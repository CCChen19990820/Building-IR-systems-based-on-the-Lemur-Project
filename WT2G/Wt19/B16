<h2>The American Cancer Society</h2>
<p>
<h3>Feeding at the Tax Trough</h3>
<p>
<b>By Dr. James T. Bennett</b>
<p>
In recent years, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has become increasingly active in politics.  Some of its state-level affiliates have lobbied for increases in state tobacco taxes, only to have the new tax revenues earmarked to themselves and their political allies.  This has clearly detracted from the ACS's mission of providing services to cancer victims.  Donors to the ACS must ask themselves why they should continue to support an organization that is increasingly political and funded by tax dollars.
This article examines how ACS state divisions in Massachusetts and Arizona have sought and received government funds.
<p>
<h3>ACS's Old Policy:<br>
No Tax Dollars</h3>
For almost 20 years, the American Cancer Society (ACS), as a matter of policy, refused government support.  Although the ACS had sought and obtained federal funds in the past, on November 11, 1978, ACS's Board of Directors adopted a resolution known as Financial Policy 19:
<ul>
<li>"RESOLVED: that acceptance of federal, state, or local governmental funds by the American Cancer Society directly or indirectly be discontinued as soon as practicable;
<li>FURTHER RESOLVED: that to accomplish the above, the following course of action be taken:
<li>1. No new tax-funded program is to be authorized.
<li>2. Divisions [of ACS] that can withdraw from existing arrangements without severe repercussions should do so as soon as feasible.
<li>3. Where Divisions have contractual or strong obligations to continue joint programs, they may continue to do so but should look for ways to phase out such arrangements gradually.  No obligation should exceed five years.
<li>4. Co-sponsorship of activities may continue provided it does not require the Society to accept federal, state or local governmental funds."1
</ul>
The reasons for this ironclad prohibition were explained by Lane Adams, ACS's executive vice president, in the ACS's annual report the following year: "Freely contributed dollars are simply not the same as tax dollars.  The need to win public support every year, year after year, imposes an important discipline on the Society—a need to keep the public informed and involved.  It's a myth that government programs are the heavy artillery in social improvement because they're often more generously financed."2
After adopting Financial Policy 19, the ACS repeatedly emphasized its stance.  For instance, in the book, Crusade: The Official History of the American Cancer Society, published in 1987, author Walter Ross stated that "The Society is supported entirely by private donations. . . .  The Society accepts no money from federal, state, or local government.  Nor does it participate in jointly funded research or other activities with any government agency."  Ross claimed that because ACS fundraising was conducted by volunteers and "contributions are generally small, averaging about $10 . . . , this extraordinarily broad base of support frees the ACS of obligation to any individual, group, or foundation."3
Both Adams and Ross were correct to note that private donations are inherently different from taxpayer funds.  Government money inevitably carries restrictions on its use.  Moreover, reliance on tax dollars requires a charity to be involved in the political arena—an activity that necessarily detracts from its charitable mission.  And unlike private contributions, the quest for tax dollars does not require a charity to convince the public that its activities are worthy of support.
The ACS's policy against accepting taxpayer funds was commendable.  Unfortunately, that policy turned out to be expendable.
<p>
<h3>ACS's New Policy:<br>
"If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em"</h3>
During the 1980s, two events made ACS officials reconsider the ban on accepting tax money:
<ul>
<li>Through intense political advocacy, the AIDS lobby was able to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars from the government to assist AIDS victims and educate the public about AIDS.  Despite IRS regulations that limit nonprofit lobbying, the AIDS lobby's advocacy was largely ignored.  Other old-line health charities, most notably the American Lung Association, also became highly proficient at obtaining government funds without losing tax-exempt status.  (See Dr. James T. Bennett, "Health Charity Lobbying: Imitating the AIDS Movement," Alternatives in Philanthropy, December 1994.)4
<li>Second, and more importantly, rising competition among health charities for increased funding dramatically lowered the rate of growth in contributions to the ACS.  During most of the 1980s, the ACS saw double-digit percentage increases in its yearly income.  But in 1990, the ACS raised only 2.8 percent more than in 1989, causing considerable concern among ACS executives.5  If private contributions could not keep pace with rising expectations, the ACS would have to follow other health charities and feed at the tax trough.
</ul>
In 1993, a decision was effectively made to quietly abandon Financial Policy 19.  This is apparent in ACS president Reginald Ho's 1993 report to the board of directors: "One of the barriers to growth and health in the Society has been flat fund raising. . . .  A situation has arisen in certain states, namely, California and Massachusetts, in which a high excise tax on tobacco was lobbied for by the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the American Heart Association jointly.  The tax was passed, and millions of dollars were released. . . .  The Lung Association and the Heart Association competed for these programs.  However, the ACS Division was not allowed to compete for funds. . . .  New sources of funds are becoming available which did not exist in the 1970s.  Perhaps it is time for a paradigm change in this area of policy."6
Indeed, the ACS's Executive Committee had already taken up the issue of abandoning Financial Policy 19 so that state and local tax funds could be accepted: "The Society recognizes that state and local health departments are sources of indirect funding through privately operated programs and will look with greater favor on the acceptance of funding through these programs, with the flexibility and discretion they offer, than on the acceptance of direct government funding" (emphasis added).7  In other words, nonprofit intermediaries could channel state and local tax dollars to the ACS so that the organization could still publicly proclaim that it did not accept government funds while discreetly doing so.
<p>
<h3>Massachusetts' Question 1 Referendum</h3>
In 1992, anti-smoking activists in Massachusetts succeeded in raising state cigarette taxes through a referendum called Question 1.  A 25 cents-per-pack tax increase took effect on January 1, 1993.  Proponents expected the tax to generate about $176,000,000 annually in revenues, $80,000,000 dollars of which would be earmarked for anti-smoking programs run by government agencies and nonprofit organizations.  In addition, $17,900,000 would support a media campaign and millions more would be distributed to local health departments that would award grants and contracts to anti-smoking groups.
The Massachusetts referendum closely mirrored a tobacco-tax initiative in Colorado, described in detail in "The National Cancer Institute and Colorado's Project ASSIST" (Dr. James T. Bennett, Alternatives in Philanthropy, February 1996).  Candace Pierce-Lavin, an ACS-Massachusetts employee, helped spearhead the referendum under the auspices of a front group called the Massachusetts Coalition for a Healthy Future.  According to the Boston Globe, "Candace Pierce-Lavin . . . said [that] her group of 200 or more health and professional associations will keep the pressure on Beacon Hill [the Massachusetts legislature] to make sure the funds are spent as proposed in the petition [i.e., given to anti-smoking groups].  'The coalition will stay together after the campaign and aggressively lobby the legislature,' Pierce-Lavin said."8
The Massachusetts Department of Health was charged with awarding grants and contracts to anti-smoking groups.  The Boston Globe described Dr. Gregory Connolly, a state health department official who helped organize the referendum, as a "strident antismoking activist:" "Connolly and his associates at the Department of Health have brought aboard many of the individuals and institutions that helped them pass the referendum" by making "grants for dozens of projects intended to batter smokers into submission. . . ."9
<p>
<h3>ACS-Massachusetts' "Quitline":<br>
Make-Work for Anti-Smoking Activists</h3>
One such grant, in the amount of $800,000, was given to ACS-Massachusetts to operate a smoking "Quitline."10  A copy of the grant, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows the Quitline to be a bloated bureaucracy.  The contract calls for three telephone "counselors," each paid $26,000 per year,who offer advice to smokers.  Assisting them are two "screeners/data entry" personnel, each paid $20,000, to screen callers and record demographic data.
But in addition to these five, the grant also calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>Program Manager at $55,000;
<li>Program Director at $43,500;
<li>Supervisor at $33,800;
<li>Promotion Coordinator at $28,000;
<li>Assistant Program Director at $25,000;
<li>Data Manager at $28,000;
<li>Office Manager at $22,000;
<li>Administrative Assistant at $22,000;
<li>Secretary/Receptionist at $18,000;
<li>Finance Coordinator/Payroll employee at $22,000.
</ul>
In addition, 12 percent is added for payroll taxes and another 13 percent for fringe benefits.  More telling, however, are those slated for the positions.  According to the contract, the Program Manager position "will be carried out by Candace Pierce-Lavin, ACS' Director of Tobacco Control and Government Affairs.  Ms. Pierce-Lavin has been with ACS since 1982, has played a leadership role in the coalition that secured passage of the Question 1 Referendum, and is extremely knowledgeable about tobacco control and smoking cessation issues."  But Ms. Pierce-Lavin's only "qualification" appears to be that she "recently conducted a site visit to the California Quitline, where she consulted at length with the Director, and with key staff members, and observed the Quitline in operation."
The contract also specifies that Karen Zweig, J.D., fill the Program Director position.  Ms. Zweig's credentials include "building inter-agency collaborations" (i.e., forming political coalitions) and "[visiting] the California Quitline to learn about their [sic] operation."
Obviously, the Quitline is a "make-work" project for ACS employees and anti-smoking activists.  Considering the hundreds of millions of dollars that federal, state, and local governments—as well as private sources—already spend on anti-smoking programs each year, the Quitline is redundant.  And given the severity of the nation's cancer epidemic, surely more effective uses for $800,000 could be found, such as free mammograms for low-income women.11
<p>
<h3>Arizona's Tobacco Tax Initiatives</h3>
In 1994, the head of ACS-Arizona, Matt Madonna, organized a coalition to collect petition signatures to place a cigarette tax increase, known as Proposition 200, on the state ballot.  ACS-Arizona contributed $24,000 to the initiative, which voters passed in November.  As in California, the increased revenues, estimated at about $90,000,000 annually, were partly earmarked for groups such as ACS-Arizona.  The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) was charged with distributing grants and contracts to nonprofit groups for educational and research purposes.12
Since ACS-Arizona and the ADHS worked together to pass the cigarette tax increase, their continuing collaboration is not surprising.  What is surprising is how closely the two operate.
<p>
<h3>ACS-Arizona:<br>
Fundraising with Tax Dollars</h3>
A January 30, 1996 "Memorandum of Understanding" between ACS-Arizona and the ADHS discloses how ACS-Arizona obtains taxpayer support.13  Ostensibly, ACS-Arizona and ADHS operate a joint project, officially administered by ADHS, called the "Women's Cancer Control Project."14  But the memorandum specifies "five core areas" of concern for ACS-Arizona that go far beyond the control of women's cancer.  These are: "Breast Cancer, Tobacco Use Reduction, Fundraising, Resources and Information, and Volunteer Involvement."  To support ACS-Arizona in these areas, ADHS's Women's Cancer Control Project has "[designated] an ADHS staff person to participate in activities of the ACS, including . . . fundraising efforts [and] other areas agreeable to both parties" (emphasis added).
Why should a state agency assign a tax-paid employee to assist in ACS-Arizona's fundraising?  Moreover, the memorandum specifies that "The ADHS will promote reciprocal assistance from local ADHS funded agencies to their ACS Regional offices in volunteer recruitment and ACS fundraising as feasible and appropriate" (emphasis added).
At issue is whether the government should give preferential treatment to one nonprofit organization over others that address health and other problems.  More fundamentally, should the government use taxpayers' money to raise money and recruit volunteers for a nonprofit?
<p>
<h3>ACS-Arizona:<br>
A Poor Steward of Donations</h3>
There is ample evidence that ACS-Arizona is a poor steward of the donations it receives.  A January 1995 exposé on ACS-Arizona by John Dougherty, an investigative reporter at the Phoenix New Times, found that the organization spent $3,600,000 in 1994 on its own internal operations but only $47,000 on direct services for cancer victims.  According to Dougherty, between 1988 and 1994, total expenses at ACS-Arizona grew by 10 percent; salaries rose by 25 percent; and overhead costs increased by 7 percent.  But spending on direct services for cancer victims declined by 51 percent.15
Dougherty also revealed that anti-smoking advocates in Arizona, as in Massachusetts and California, lobbied against measures in the state legislature to redirect the new cigarette tax revenues away from their own coffers: "A battle has already erupted in the Arizona legislature over the spending formula, with some Republican leaders trying to have all the money placed into the general fund.  ACS-Arizona and other groups who supported the legislation have hired lobbyists to keep the money from being reallocated. . . .  There is no doubt that ACS-Arizona intends to fight to keep the current distribution of tobacco tax dollars as is.  'We will do whatever we can to make sure the funds . . . are used where they are supposed to go,' [ACS-Arizona's Matt] Madonna says."16
<p>
<h3>Should Donors Support the ACS?</h3>
The American Cancer Society has abandoned its long-standing prohibition against accepting taxpayer support.  By campaigning to raise state cigarette taxes and lobbying to earmark the new revenues to itself, it has found a way to revive its sagging financial fortunes.
By accepting tax money, the ACS is undermining the rationale for its own existence—indeed, the rationale for all charities: they do what neither government nor the profit-making private sector can or will do.  But if the ACS already receives taxpayer support, why should contributors give generously to it?

<B>Introduction by Julie M. Taylor</B>
<DD><I>Today, women control 60 percent of the wealth in the United States.  Yet research has found that women donors 
have traditionally shown less interest than men in supporting national nonprofit organizations that promote changes in 
public policy.  With a growing number of women in the workforce as business owners, entrepreneurs, and executives, women 
are increasingly positioned to affect public policy through their charitable giving.
<DD>This issue features articles by four women who serve in key positions at private foundations: Ethelmae 
Humphreys, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Humphreys Foundations; Heather R. Higgins, Director of The 
Randolph Foundation; Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of the Anschutz Family Foundation; and 
Kristen A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation.  We asked them to discuss why 
their foundations support public-policy organizations and initiatives.  Specifically, we asked:
<UL>
<LI>With so many competing needs for foundation support, why does your foundation award grants to 
public-policy organizations?
<LI>How do these grants help your foundation fulfill its mission?
<LI>If your foundation supports direct-service charities, how does this relate to your public-policy giving?
<LI>What factors cause you to reject public-policy grant proposals?
<LI>What issues do you believe public-policy groups have not sufficiently addressed?
</UL>

<BR>Chairman of the Board and CEO
<BR>The Humphreys Foundations</B>
<P>
<DD>The several foundations created by the Humphreys 
family have as a key part of their mission the demonstration 
of the superiority of a voluntary society over a political 
society.  Over 60 percent of our funding goes to 
market-oriented public-policy groups that are helping to promote a 
society of free and responsible individuals.
<DD>We have for many years supported the Foundation 
for Economic Education, which publishes the monthly 
journal <I>The Freeman</I>.  Other major recipients are the 
market-liberal Cato Institute, the Institute for Humane Studies, 
and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation.  We are 
also a major supporter of the National Right to Work 
Legal Defense Foundation.  We believe each of these is 
doing important yet unique work to promote a free society.
<DD>Other public-policy grant recipients include the 
Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, 
Advocates for Self-Government, the Center for Independent 
Thought, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Consumer Alert, 
the Critical Review Foundation, the Discussion Club, 
Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Free 
Enterprise Institute's debate project, the Federalist Society, the 
Future of Freedom Foundation, the Heartland Institute, the 
Institute for Justice, the Institute for Policy Innovation's 
tax action analysis, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the 
National Endowment for Liberty, New York 
University's Austrian Economics program, the Reason Foundation, 
the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, the U.S. Term 
Limits Foundation and, of course, the Capital Research 
Center, which provides valuable insight into philanthropic activity.
<DD>We support some direct-service charities (mostly 
local), but only those that do not receive funding from 
government tax revenues.  That is the first stipulation of all our giving. 
 Most of this giving is done anonymously.  Recipients 
are generally charities that serve young people and 
families, from scouting and &quot;Y&quot;-type organizations to direct 
assistance to a young quadriplegic who inspires young people 
to take responsibility for themselves.  Each year we 
also provide local elementary school children with 
educational materials about the effects of smoking.
<DD>Over the years, we have supported a few 
direct-service groups that we later discovered were accepting 
government money.  When we learned that the local theater group 
had accepted funds from a state agency, we turned down 
support for its expansion project.  At our urging, the 
theater board changed its bylaws to exclude government funding. 
 But in many cases, we've had to cut off support.  We 
gave to the local Girl Scouts until we learned it was 
accepting volunteer services from a tax-supported agency.  We 
had also supported with a sizable gift the local biennial 
international piano competition until I saw in the newspaper that 
it had received a grant from a state arts agency.
<HR>
<blockquote>I think those who favor a free society have spoken very convincingly 
on economic issues.  But we haven't paid enough attention to social 
issues such as welfare and poverty.</blockquote><HR>
<BR>
While we support very few bricks-and-mortar 
projects, we do not exclude them out-of-hand if they meet 
our general funding criteria.  We supported construction of 
the new Cato Institute building in Washington, D.C.  We 
are also supporting construction of a community center 
building in a small town where one of our businesses is located.
<DD>We generally reject public-policy grant proposals 
that don't seem timely or relevant to today's key issues.  But 
we try to help any organization that has a good business 
plan for promoting a worthwhile project.  It's interesting 
to watch new groups spring up in response to the 
changing constellation of public-policy concerns.  Our funding 
priorities have changed somewhat to accommodate 
these changes.
<DD>In public policy, I think those who favor a free 
society have spoken very convincingly on economic issues.  But 
we haven't paid enough attention to social issues such 
as welfare and poverty.  This is partly a shortcoming 
of academia in not researching this area sufficiently and in 
not communicating its findings to public-policy groups that 
can influence the media and public.  Ideally, the needy 
should be helped through private charity.  But do we have 
enough rigorous research to convince Americans that this is 
possible?
<P><a name="hea">
<B>Heather R. Higgins
<BR>Director
<BR>The Randolph Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Public-policy grantmaking is not a traditional area 
of charitable giving, in large measure because 
historically such efforts, having no defined beneficiary, would not 
have legally qualified as charitable.  But as times have 
changed such giving has come to be viewed as a proper domain 
of philanthropy, just as in roughly the same period our 
understanding of government has generally changed to 
encompass a much broader view of its proper tasks.  In 
contrast, &quot;government&quot; used to be a word that was always 
modified, as in &quot;federal government,&quot; &quot;family government,&quot; 
&quot;church government,&quot; or &quot;school government,&quot; because 
different spheres of life were thought to be best governed at 
different levels and in different ways.
<DD>If the primary purpose of philanthropy is to alleviate 
the sufferings of mankind and to do what we can to improve 
life on earth, then it is important not only to directly 
assist individuals but to help create conditions which will 
help them to help themselves.  This is the purpose of 
public-policy grantmakinga purpose that should be of 
equal interest to citizens of both sexes.  Much of the 
original impetus for such grantmaking came from those who felt 
that government should and could solve our problems.  In 
fact, most public-policy advocacy and lobbying by charities 
is based on that assumption.
<DD>In recent years, however, a contingent of 
grantmakers has become convinced that well-meaning but 
misguided attempts by government to remedy problems it has not 
fully <HR>
<blockquote>
Public policy itself has not only come to affect whole new spheres of 
daily life but has often done so in ignorance. . . .  Unless those errors 
are corrected, in the long run all the direct charity in the world will not 
keep our society whole.<HR>
</blockquote>
<BR>
understood has caused more harm than good, and that 
to remove government-created obstacles to effective 
charity is the first obligation of citizens who wish to improve 
the human condition.  Public-policy grantmaking, done 
properly, is an application of the Confucian maxim that if 
you give a hungry man a fish he will be hungry again 
tomorrow, but if you teach him to fish he will be fed for life.
<DD>That leveraging principle is important to The 
Randolph Foundation's grantmaking, particularly since we are a 
small grantmaker.  In almost all our public-policy 
grantmaking we seek to encourage those attitudes and principles 
which lead to the right and necessary conduct of our citizens.  
We believe that good work has been and is being done in 
the realms of economic and regulatory policy, and that the 
area which currently needs our attention is the cultural 
underpinnings of free and democratic societies.
<DD>Though public policy is our primary area of focus, we 
do occasionally support direct-service organizations.  
When we do so it is generally because their work is 
extraordinary, and we lend support to help them &quot;franchise&quot; their ideas.  
A more likely approach for us, however, is to support 
work that can be used by a variety of local service providers 
to make their own efforts more effective.
<DD>In our view, public-policy grantmaking is 
particularly important at this time, because public policy itself has 
not only come to affect whole new spheres of daily life but 
has often done so in ignorance and in violation of those 
central principles of human nature and natural law which are 
the cornerstones of our society.  Unless those errors are 
corrected, in the long run all the direct charity in the world 
will not keep our society whole.

<B>Sue Anschutz-Rodgers
<BR>President and Executive Director
<BR>The Anschutz Family Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Although the Anschutz Family Foundation focuses 
primarily on community organizations, we do make 
some grants to public-policy organizations.  We recognize 
that public policy affords us the opportunity to invest at 
the &quot;macro&quot; level.  The interplay between business, 
government, and the nonprofit sector can be best addressed through philanthropic contributions to public policy.
<DD>Our foundation's goal is to promote individual 
self-sufficiency and traditional values.  Over the past 
four decades, government has grown to become the 
principle provider of human, educational, and health services.  
We believe that the best delivery of these necessities is 
through families, churches, and organizations at the 
community level.  Government as a primary resource provider has 
too often caused a retraction of the vital roles of 
voluntary institutions.  Further, charitable investments bring a 
much greater return if directed through community-based 
organizations instead of through government.
<DD>However, we are challenged to understand how 
devolution will affect services to those who are truly in need.  
We believe that no greater resource exists than that of 
the collective capacity of our citizens to serve their 
communities.  But our convictions for limited government, a 
thriving free-market economy, and a compassionate and civil 
society require a successful balance of interests.  
Recognizing historical imbalances, businesses must become more 
responsible.
<DD>Public-policy investments allow us to keep a 
larger perspective.  Americans living in the West often 
decry Washington as myopic, which in some cases is true.  
But state and local governments have also expanded
their domains, and must be reckoned with.  With our focus on 
the community level, it is often difficult to keep abreast 
of national and state issues.  Our support of public 
policy keeps us alerted to legislative, executive, and 
judicial actions at all levels of government.
<DD>What causes foundations to hesitate about investing 
in efforts to affect public policy?  Generally, it is due to 
other questions that arise when contemplating such grants: 
How many think tanks are really necessary?  How many 
high-priced speakers are needed to tour college campuses?  
How many Washington-based public-policy groups rely on 
glossy proposals with no substantiating documentation on 
requested funding or expected results?  How many 
groups champion causes beyond objectivity and common sense?
<DD>Sometimes our being so far from Washington helps 
to filter out the noise.  The question all of us must 
ask ourselves is how do we better assist individual citizens 
as they go about their daily liveslives based on work, 
family, and community?  We believe in the importance 
of public policy, whether it serves to check the growth 
of government or to stimulate debate and discourse.

<BR>President and Executive Director
<BR>The E.L. Wiegand Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Contemporary philosophers, politicians, and 
philanthropists are plagued by the poignant questions, &quot;Where are 
we going?  How will we get there?&quot;  Too often, they 
are beguiled by the parlance of the 
day&quot;beyond postmodernism,&quot; &quot;spiritual acedia,&quot; &quot;quantum 
physics,&quot; &quot;social capital,&quot; &quot;devolution revolution,&quot; &quot;cybertots.&quot;  
As the millennium closes, prophetic cynicism often prevails.
<DD>In contrast, at the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, 
the poignant words of James Joyce resonate: &quot;The now, 
the here, through which all future plunges to the past.&quot;  The Foundation is the living legacy and embodiment of 
our benefactor, Edwin L. Wiegand.  As President and 
Executive Director, I view the Foundation's expedition 
through his enduring eyes.  His life-vision embraced a reverence 
for the sacred, for democracy, for free-market principles, 
and an adherence to the work ethic.
<DD>In 1996, this oracle's prescience remains constant.  
Public-affairs grants, one of the five areas that comprise 
the Foundation's mission, exemplify the heightened use of 
our Benefactor's Litmus Test.  Components of the test 
include fiscal responsibility, synergy of mission, project 
uniqueness, geographic parameters, administrative utility, 
societal impact, accountability, other funding sources, 
and board composition.
<DD>Historically, our Foundation's public-affairs grants 
have reflected a strict adherence to E.L. Wiegand's 
principles, and in recent years these grants have totaled nine percent 
of our philanthropic effort.  The average number of 
grants reviewed has decreased while the representative 
grant awarded has increased.  Geographic preference has 
shifted from Washington, D.C. to the West, with special 
preference assigned to small, exemplary, less-institutional 
organizations.  Since 1993, we have awarded occasional 
multi-year grants and have given special consideration to 
projects supporting the emerging democracies in Eastern and 
Central Europe.  Increasingly, the Foundation 
receives unsolicited letters of inquiry, though we currently elect 
to initiate more proposals for Trustee review.
<DD>The preservation of donor intent is serious business.  
As President, I strive to achieve the magical coalescence 
of dreams and due diligence.  Winston Churchill once 
said that &quot;money melts.&quot;  However, the Wiegand 
professional motto is &quot;money melds&quot; with endeavors that are worthy 
in the eyes of our beloved benefactor.<BR>

<h2>Tax-Funded Politics</h2>
<HR>
<P>
<small>Reformers in Congress want to strengthen laws restricting tax-funded
politicsthe practice of federal departments and agencies awarding
grants to nonprofit organizations that use the money to lobby
for higher taxes, more government, and more grants for nonprofits.
No one knows exactly how much is spent on political advocacy of
the estimated $39 billion that the federal government gives to
nonprofits each year. But the Capital Research Center and other
groups have disclosed many questionable grants. Although there
are many laws that restrict such activity, they have not been
well enforced.
<P>
This issue contains two articles that examine grants made by
the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. James T. Bennett, a professor
of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia,
and Thomas J. DiLorenzo, a Senior Fellow at the Capital Research
Center and professor of economics at Loyola College in Baltimore,
discuss how tax dollars intended for disease research and public
health education have been diverted into political advocacy. These
articles should serve as a wake-up call for Congress, taxpayers,
and nonprofit donors.

<h3>The National Cancer Institute and Colorado's Project ASSIST</h3>
<P>
by Dr. James T. Bennett 
<P>

<P>
The July 1995 issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> (&quot;Project
ASSIST: Image and Reality&quot;) described how the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), part of the federal government's National Institutes
of Health, has provided anti-smoking organizations with as much
as $100 million in federal tax revenues to lobby for higher tobacco
taxes at the state level. The NCI's Project ASSIST, the American
Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention, is the
major funding vehicle for this campaign.
<P>
Project ASSIST was largely spearheaded by the American Cancer
Society (ACS), the nation's largest and best-known health charity.
Officially launched in 1991, ASSIST ostensibly supports grassroots
groups that organize public education campaigns to discourage
smoking. This follow-up article examines the actual operation
of ASSIST in the state of Colorado. It shows how federal funds
were illegally used to promote a ballot initiative to raise the
state's tobacco tax.
<P>
Far more is known about operations of ASSIST in Colorado than
in other states where ASSIST grants have been awarded because
a lawsuit was recently filed against the Colorado Department of
Health, the agency charged with disbursing ASSIST funds in that
state. The suit alleged the improper use of ASSIST funds and illegal
lobbying by state health department officials. Documents related
to this case provide revealing information about how ASSIST was
developed in Colorado, its activities, and the personalities involved.
<P>
What emerges is a complex and twisted tale: front groups were
created to provide a smokescreen for lobbying; state bureaucrats
used state offices to facilitate lobbying; and positions of authority
were sold, with those hoping to acquire a share of the projected
tax revenue paying &quot;front money&quot; to secure their positions.
<P>
<B>Colorado's Amendment 1: Self-Interest Disguised as Public Health</B>

<P>
Colorado was in many ways an ideal state from the perspective
of those organizing Project ASSIST. For more than a decade, anti-smoking
groups had been active, and one of their prime objectives had
been to raise tobacco taxes. Colorado's constitution also allowed
citizen-initiated referenda. Against this backdrop, the National
Cancer Institute awarded the Colorado Department of Health (CDH)
an ASSIST contract, providing $6,976,683 for the period September
20, 1991 to September 29, 1998. The CDH would in turn provide
ASSIST funds to local anti-smoking groups.
<P>
On November 19, 1993, anti-smoking activists filed an &quot;initiative
regarding Tobacco Taxes&quot; with the Colorado Department of
State. If the initiative passed, taxes on cigarettes would be
raised on July 1, 1995 by 50 cents per pack and taxes on cigars
and smokeless tobacco would be increased by 50 percent of the
manufacturer's list price.
<P>
Purportedly, the goal of anti-smoking activists was to reduce
smoking by 43 percent in Colorado. If improved public health were
the sole objective, however, the disincentive of higher tobacco
prices should have been sufficient. But substantial tax revenuesan
estimated $130 million per yearwere to be distributed as follows:
<UL>
<LI>$65 million to medical professionals and hospitals for health
care of the needy;
<LI>$39 million to anti-smoking activists and health charities
for educational programs to reduce tobacco use;
<LI>$13 million to academics and public interest groups for research
on tobacco use.
</UL>

<P>
Another $13 million was to be divided among municipalities, counties,
economic development initiatives, and an 11-member citizens' commission.
This would be composed of individualsmost likely health charity
officials, medical professionals, and anti-smoking activistswho
would oversee the disbursement of revenues. While they would be
unpaid, no doubt they would take many expense-account trips to
anti-smoking meetings held at pleasant venues in the U.S. and
abroad.
<P>
<B>The Fair Share For Health Committee and Colorado ASSIST</B>

<P>
In March of 1993, the Fair Share for Health Committee (FSFHC),
a 501(c)(4) lobbying organization, was created to promote the
tax initiative. As shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, its membership was essentially
a who's who of the Colorado hospital, medical, and health charity
professions. The overlap between FSFHC membership and membership
in Colorado ASSIST, a 501(c)(3) educational organization created
to receive Project ASSIST funds, is substantial. Colorado ASSIST's
executive committee included representatives of the American Cancer
Society, Colorado Department of Health, and the Coalition for
a Tobacco-Free Colorado (CTFC), a 501(c)(3) organization instrumental
in securing the ASSIST grant.
<P>
The activities of one anti-smoking activist, Arnold Levinson,
illustrate the ties between FSFHC and Colorado ASSIST. Levinson,
formerly an assistant city editor for the <I>Colorado Springs
Gazette</I>, served as a Colorado ASSIST consultant, helping &quot;extensively
in the design of Colorado ASSIST.&quot; He was also executive
director of FSFHC, and was thus in charge of promoting the tobacco
tax initiative.
<P>
Colorado ASSIST paid Levinson $50 per hour for his services under
an initial contract for 930 hours. Other contracts followedone
for $46,500 during the period 1992-1993 and another for $60 per
hour for the period 1993-1998. Thus, Colorado ASSIST, a federally
funded organization, paid Levinson while he organized the tax
initiative. It also reimbursed Levinson for travel costs to Grand
Junction and Durango, where he gave &quot;presentation[s] on tobacco
taxes.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Colorado</B> 
<P>
Another anti-smoking activist, Walter F. &quot;Snip&quot; Young,
served as director of Prevention Programs at the Colorado Department
of Health and was also the director of Colorado ASSIST. CDH's
&quot;Best and Final&quot; grant proposal to the NCI noted that
Young learned in 1987 of a possible ASSIST grant in Colorado:
&quot;[Young] informed the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Colorado,
which includes representatives of the American Heart Association
of Colorado and the American Lung Association. . . . In Spring
1988 . . . , Mr. Young convened a series of informal discussions
with the executive directors of ALA-Colorado and AHA-Colorado
to discuss their prospective roles in the project. As national
ASSIST planners disclosed information about the Project, Mr. Young
shared this information with the voluntary health agencies through
formal discussions with an ad hoc committee of the [CTFC]. .
.&quot;
<P>
CTFC's 501(c)(3) status would seem to preclude political activity,
but this restriction was ignored in the early stages of the tax
initiative. On January 6, 1993, Young and Peter Bialick, president
of the anti-smoking group GASP of Colorado, sent a letter on CTFC
stationary to anti-smoking activists. It said that &quot;The Coalition
for a Tobacco-Free Colorado is on its way to placing a ballot
initiative to increase the state tobacco tax before the voters
in 1994. We need your help to construct the language of the petition
[at a day-long retreat]. . . . Morning presentations will explain
the rationale for tobacco taxes and the successful experiences
of California and Massachusetts. The afternoon will be a work
session where we will discuss and agree on the principal objectives
of the petition language. . . .&quot;
<P>
A main topic of the retreat was money. Participants approved an
organizational structure for promoting the initiative that included
a board of directors and an executive committee charged with conducting
campaign operations. Organizations that wanted to obtain a seat
on the boardand thus influence in determining what groups would
receive the projected tax revenuewere required to pay $10,000.
<P>
Significantly, more than half the organizations on CTFC's initial
board were also members of the lobbying group Fair Share for Health
Committee (see Table 1, entries marked &#167;). Four other groups
involved in FSFHC were also affiliated with CTFC (Table 1, entries
marked ). By January 1993, CTFC had more than a dozen sponsors
or affiliated organizations who were also members of FSFHC. Thus,
for all intents and purposes, these two organizations were indistinguishable,
even though one was ostensibly a tax-deductible, tax-funded educational
group and the other a political lobbying organization.
<P>
<B>The National Cancer Institute</B> 
<P>
NCI was aware that the objective of Colorado ASSIST was to raise
state taxes and that federal funds would be used for this purpose.
Documents that the Colorado Department of Health submitted to
NCI clearly and repeatedly emphasize the tax theme:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>Colorado should &quot;increase economic incentives and taxation
to discourage the use of tobacco products;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;The price of tobacco products needs to be greatly increased
through taxes and/or sales-license fees;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;The Colorado ASSIST Alliance will work to increase public
knowledge of the need to increase the cigarette tax substantially;&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;Educational presentations will be made to all [areas] regarding
the need and current efforts to increase tobacco taxes;&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;Strategies to advocate increased tobacco taxes will be
incorporated into the ASSIST media plan;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;Information will be presented . . . regarding the rationale
and need for sales license fees on tobacco sales.&quot;
<P></ul>
Other CDH materials clearly show that ASSIST funds were used for
political activity. Expense reports submitted by Connie Acott,
an ASSIST consultant and founding board member of CTFC, to the
CDH note that Colorado ASSIST meetings concerning the &quot;tax
initiative&quot; and the &quot;coalition tax initiative&quot;
were held in August and November 1992. Another Colorado ASSIST
expense report refers to a meeting of the organization's &quot;Political
Advocacy Team,&quot; held on April 15, 1993.
<P>
<B>Tax Dollars Down the Drain</B> 
<P>
Organizations promoting the tax initiative lost little time in
obtaining ASSIST money from the CDH. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> is a partial list
of groups that received ASSIST contracts during 1993-1994. A comparison
of Tables 1 and 2 shows that substantial funds were given to organizations
involved in the Fair Share For Health's tax initiative.
<P>
How were these funds used? Recipients were required to complete
contract reimbursement forms and an &quot;Activity Matrix,&quot;
one of whose goals&quot;Economic Incentive to Decrease Tobacco
Use&quot;lists the following activities: &quot;Educate re excise
taxes,&quot; &quot;attend training,&quot; and &quot;coordinate
publicity/media.&quot; Activities related to the tax initiative
were reported on this form. Reports submitted by grant recipients
requesting payment are also revealing. They show that substantial
amounts were paid for activities that apparently involved very
little effort:
<UL>
<LI>The American Lung Association received $5,000 in October 1993
for having &quot;completed orientation and review of implementation
responsibilities for the Annual Action Plan&quot; and for &quot;[establishing]
recruitment and operating systems for Field Coordinator.&quot;
In November 1993, the ALA received $5,000 for exploring &quot;preparations
for a legislative breakfast.&quot; The following month, it received
$5,000 for identifying speakers to make &quot;presentations on
tobacco taxation,&quot; initiating &quot;development of a list
of influential contacts,&quot; and examining &quot;existing databases
and resource directories that identify Denver Metro tobacco youth
cessation resources;&quot;
<LI>Valley Wide Health Services received $2,083 in October 1993
for &quot;papers contacted/articles written.&quot; Similar amounts
were given in November and December 1993 for identifying &quot;community
groups&quot; and writing articles for newsletters;
<LI>The Weld County Health Department received $2,000 in December
1993 for having &quot;developed Action Plans&quot; and for attending
a CTFC meeting.
</UL>

<P>
ASSIST funds were also spent freely on business amenities:
<UL>
<LI>That Personal Touch Catering company received approximately
$300-$400 per month for catering Colorado ASSIST executive committee
and Alliance board meetings;
<LI>Nearly $5,000 was spent in 1993 to host a Colorado ASSIST
banquet;
<LI>Throughout 1990 and 1991, an average of $1,000 per month was
spent on temporary employees;
<LI>Ramada Inn was paid $1,055 to host a Colorado ASSIST board
meeting;
<LI>Nancy Salas, a CDH employee who often attended ASSIST training
sessions in Washington, was reimbursed $36.70 for a letter opener.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Politicking in the PICS</B> 
<P>
Petitioners for the tax initiative were organized in twelve cities
and regions, called &quot;Primary Intervention Communities&quot;
or &quot;PICs.&quot; Active in Aspen, Alamosa, Boulder, Colorado
Springs, Craig, Denver, Durango, Fort Collins, Grand Junction,
Greeley, Montrose, and Pueblo, their role was to raise funds for
the initiative and gather signatures. Additionally, 130 &quot;community
organizations&quot; throughout Colorado formed a coalition called
the Colorado ASSIST Alliance. Evidence of widespread lobbying
by these organizations can be found in the minutes of their meetings
and in newsletters used to communicate with and motivate the petitioners.
<P>
The Colorado ASSIST Alliance published its own newsletter using
ASSIST funds. In the March 1992 inaugural issue, it reported that
the American Cancer Society had contacted 120 individuals &quot;concerned
with tobacco control across the state . . . with a reminder to
urge their Representatives to achieve legislative passage of House
Bill 1239 Pat Sullivan's measure to add an additional 25 cents
tax on the purchase of a pack of cigarettes. . . . We urge everyone
to let your representatives know your feelings about this measure.&quot;
<P>
In the fifth issue (July 1993), ACS-Colorado's Madelyn Parker
praised the political activism of ASSIST participants in an article
entitled &quot;PICs Take on Policy Advocacy:&quot; &quot;Though
carefully nourished personal interaction at the state and local
levels, ASSIST alliance members who recently attended orientations
in the process of political advocacy are now working to educate
public policy makers about health and safety issues related to
tobacco.&quot;
<P>
The same issue carried another article by the Fair Share for Health
Committee's Arnold Levinson. Headlined &quot;To Get Rid of Tobacco,
TAX IT!,&quot; it described how a &quot;coalition of organizations
has now been formed to increase Colorado's tax on cigarettes .
. . and other tobacco products. Leading the effort is a broad
coalition of health organizations, including the largest voluntary
health agenciesthe American Lung Association, the American Cancer
Society, and the American Heart Association.&quot; The article
noted that more information about the initiative was available
from the FSFHC's Amanda O'Neill.
<P>
Colorado ASSIST's &quot;Annual Action Plan&quot; (AAP), submitted
to the National Cancer Institute in August 1993, explicitly stated
that politics was the organization's central focus. Under the
heading &quot;Year One Objectives,&quot; Colorado ASSIST announced
that &quot;By October 1994, a state bill will be introduced in
the Legislature to license tobacco sales, and active support for
the measure will come from businesses, labor, medical professionals,
educators, youth and the religious community. . . . By October
1994, policy advocacy will be provided to PIC representatives.&quot;
<P>
Arnold Levinson also made numerous presentations to PIC representatives
throughout the state, financed with ASSIST funds. The minutes
of a meeting of the Larimer County PIC, held June 9, 1993, note
that Levinson &quot;gave a presentation on the campaign his organization
[FSFHC] is heading to place a cigarette sales tax initiative on
the 1994 election ballot. . . . [FSFHC] is asking for our help
in collecting signatures on petitions.&quot; According to travel
expense reports that Levinson submitted to the Colorado Department
of Health for reimbursement, similar appearances were made in
June to PICs in Boulder and Pueblo.
<P>
<B>GASP of Colorado</B> 
<P>
One anti-smoking group which received ASSIST funds, GASP (Group
to Alleviate Smoking Pollution) of Colorado, offers insight into
how federal money was used to promote the tax initiative. As one
of the oldest and most energetic anti-smoking organizations in
the state, GASP's newsletter, <I>The Nonsmokers' Voice</I>, relentlessly
promoted the initiative. One issue contained the following articles:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>&quot;<I>Cigarette Tax Efforts Underway</I>. GASP of Colorado
is teaming up with other pro-health groups to put on the ballot
an initiative to increase Colorado's cigarette tax . . . under
the name Fair Share For Health Committee.&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;<I>President's Challenge to Our Members: One Completed
Petition Per Member</I>. I would like to ask each able-bodied
GASP member to help complete at least one petition.&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;<I>Contributions Needed</I>. Initiatives take much time
to organize. . . . [We] will contribute some money and in-kind
support. . . . Pitch in now with your contribution.&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;<I>Annual Meeting to Focus on Cigarette Tax Efforts</I>.
Candace Pierce-Lavin, the coordinator of the successful Massachusetts
cigarette tax campaign, will be GASP's special guest at our annual
meeting . . . this fall.&quot;
</ul><P>
<B>Two Questions</B> 
<P>
Despite the efforts of ASSIST-funded organizations, the Colorado
tobacco tax initiative was defeated by voters on November 8, 1994.
The story of the political campaign for Colorado's Amendment 1
raises two serious questions:
<P>
<ul><LI>Is it proper for the National Institutes of Health and its divisions,
including the National Cancer Institutewhose mission is to research
the causes of and to find cures for diseaseto divert millions
of dollars to advocacy group politics?
<P>
<li>Is it proper for health charities such as the American Cancer
Society, American Heart Association, and American Lung Association
to increasingly embrace politics while abandoning their traditional
mission of providing assistance to disease victims? Obviously,
when health charities use funds for political activities, fewer
resources are available for helping disease victims.

<h2>Tax Funded Politics</h2>
<HR>
<small>Reformers in Congress want to strengthen laws restricting tax-funded
politicsthe practice of federal departments and agencies awarding
grants to nonprofit organizations that use the money to lobby
for higher taxes, more government, and more grants for nonprofits.
No one knows exactly how much is spent on political advocacy of
the estimated $39 billion that the federal government gives to
nonprofits each year. But the Capital Research Center and other
groups have disclosed many questionable grants. Although there
are many laws that restrict such activity, they have not been
well enforced.
<P>
This issue contains two articles that examine grants made by
the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. James T. Bennett, a professor
of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia,
and Thomas J. DiLorenzo, a Senior Fellow at the Capital Research
Center and professor of economics at Loyola College in Baltimore,
discuss how tax dollars intended for disease research and public
health education have been diverted into political advocacy. These
articles should serve as a wake-up call for Congress, taxpayers,
and nonprofit donors.

<h3>The Centers for Disease Control and the American Lung Association</h3>
By Thomas J. DiLorenzo
<P>
The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which most
Americans think of as a federal agency that conducts research
and dispenses advice on disease, is heavily involved in funding
political advocacy. This article examines a $30,000 grant the
CDC recently awarded to the American Lung Association (ALA), the
oldest and one of the largest health charities in the U.S.
<P>
The grant supported the ALA's May 1993 conference, &quot;Seize
the Initiative: A National Training Conference for Increasing
Tobacco Excise Taxes Through Initiated Acts,&quot; one of several
recent ALA seminars designed to train anti-smoking activists in
how to lobby for higher tobacco taxes.1 The California Department
of Health also contributed $68,958 in state cigarette tax revenues.
<P>
A third co-sponsor was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a Princeton,
New Jersey-based private philanthropy that has spent tens of millions
of dollars promoting socialized medicine, including the ill-fated
Clinton health care plan. The Foundation had considerable influence
in the Clinton Administration's secret White House Health Care
Task Force. It has also funded efforts to enact broad-reaching
state-level health reforms compatible with the Clinton plan.2
<P>
<B>From Charity to Politics</B> 
<P>
The conference was organized by the staff of the ALA with assistance
from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. A Freedom of Information
Act inquiry to the CDC regarding the conference drew this response
from Lynn Armstrong, Assistant FOIA Officer: &quot;Program staff
stated that proceedings of the conference were not compiled. Also,
there were no handouts.&quot;3
<P>
In fact, there were handouts, and a considerable record of the
proceedings exists. These were obtained from a state public health
department official who attended the conference and who apparently
felt it was his duty to share this information with the taxpaying
public.
<P>
The overall theme of the conferencewhich underscores the direction
many health charities such as the ALA have taken in recent years was
announced on the first page of an ALA publication: &quot;Health
advocates assumed a new, sometimes treacherous, exhilarating and
definitely challenging role in the past decade. The genteel `Smoking
is bad for your health' posters were replaced by determined action
through legislation and the initiative process.&quot;4 In other
words, many health charities are no longer content with providing
services to disease victims and educating the public about health
issues. They are now committed to using the coercive power of
government to force Americans to adopt &quot;healthy&quot; lifestyles.
<P>
<B>The How-To's of Lobbying</B> 
<P>
One segment of the conference, &quot;Ingredients for Success,&quot;
featured several speakers who offered advice on how to organize
an effective statewide initiative campaign. Karen Rouse, vice
president for marketing and communications at the Massachusetts
division of the American Cancer Society (ACS), amused attendees
with &quot;war stories&quot; of her state's successful effort
to raise tobacco taxes. She emphasized that the initiative was
carefully designed to channel much of the estimated $120 million
in new tax revenues to anti-smoking organizations such as the
ACS.5
<P>
This strategy was virtually identical to one used in 1988, when
anti-smoking groups in California successfully promoted Proposition
99, an initiative to raise that state's tobacco taxes. As discussed
in the July 1994 <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Proposition
99 generated millions of dollars for anti-smoking organizations'
&quot;educational&quot; programs. Anti-smoking groups gave gifts
such as backpacks and gift certificates to high school students
who promised to quit smoking. The groups also spent tax revenues
earmarked for education on political campaigns aimed at enacting
local anti-smoking ordinances. When state legislators learned
of this, they reappropriated some of the revenues to medical care
for the needy.6
<P>
Another speaker, political campaign consultant Jack Nicholl, offered
tips on how to &quot;tap an emotional issue,&quot; the importance
of &quot;aggressive negative campaigning,&quot; and the use children
as an &quot;emotional symbol and message of the campaign.&quot;
As a key organizer of Proposition 99, Nicholl recalled that &quot;Press
events were held in child care centers. Children marched with
organizers.&quot;
<P>
Nicholl also explained steps taken to encourage lifestyle-tolerant
Californians to support Proposition 99: &quot;Early tobacco tax
polling showed that voters were not anti-smoking zealots and did
not support coercive measures to force smokers to stop. In fact,
supporters believed overwhelmingly that `smokers have a right
to smoke.'&quot; Consequently, &quot;leaders of the coalitionsuch
as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association
. . . put their own militant antismoking rhetoric on the shelf
for the duration of the campaign,&quot; and decided instead to
pitch their message as follows: &quot;We are not an anti-smoking
campaign. Adults can choose to smoke, but if they do, they must
pay their fair share of the costs associated with smoking.&quot;7
<P>
This approach was disingenuous in two ways. First, according to
ALA CEO John R. Garrison, the ALA's goal is to achieve a &quot;smoke-free
society&quot; through &quot;advocacy efforts,&quot; not to make
smokers to pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of health care costs.8
Second, contrary to Proposition 99 proponents, tobacco taxes already
more than cover the costs of health care for diseases attributable
to smoking, according to comprehensive studies by the Rand Corporation
and Congressional Research Service.9
<P>
Another speaker, Doug Barr, CEO of the Canadian Cancer Society,
suggested that U.S. health charities stop using their millions
of volunteers to provide direct services to disease victims and
instead employ them in political campaigns: &quot;If we are willing
to learn the political ropes and mobilize our volunteers to exercise
their political clout, our organizations can bring about significant
legislative change. . . .&quot;10
<P>
A representative from the polling firm of Abacus Associates, based
in Hatfield, Massachusetts, also made a presentation on political
polling intended &quot;to develop a strategy and message for winning.
. . . The purpose of polling is to help you develop and deliver
the most effective message for moving the voters you need to move
in order to win.&quot;11
<P>
Conference participants received numerous materials, including
the ALA's <I>Guidebook for State Action to Increase Tobacco Taxes</I>,12
a 124-page manual providing detailed information on coalition
building, petition drives, polling, and how to present one's case
to potential coalition members and the public. The <I>Guidebook</I>
also offers the successful tax-increase campaigns in California
and Massachusetts as models for other states and discusses how
anti-smoking activists in Florida recently celebrated that state's
increase in tobacco taxes. Revenues in Florida, the <I>Guidebook</I>
explains, will be used by anti-smoking groups to conduct door-to-door
leafleting, phone banking, public opinion polling, mail-in petition
efforts, training of anti-smoking activists, and fundraising (said
to be a &quot;high priority&quot;).
<P>
<B>A Tax-Funded Assault on Freedom</B> 
<P>
Anti-smoking organizations such as the ALA ignore the fact that
if smoking is specially taxed or prohibited because it involves
health risks, many other freedoms are in danger of being curtailed
or lost. After all, eating fatty foods, exercising too little
or too much, riding a bicycle without a helmet, and driving a
car also involve risks and may lead to illness, injury, or death.
It is a travesty that taxpayers are forced to support a political
movement that prohibits their freedom of choice.
<P>
Although the CDC's mission is to conduct disease research and
educate the public about health issues, its grant to the ALA was
used to teach the nuts and bolts of political organizing, a blatantly
illegal use of tax money. It is time that Congress investigated
the CDC's politicized grantmaking.

<h2>From Foster Care to Adoption: An Interview with Conna Craig
</h2>
<I>America's state-run foster-care system is increasingly under
attack. Many complain that the system is woefully slow in placing
children into permanent adoptive homes and that it too often shifts
children from one temporary foster home to another. This, critics
charge, leaves children with a sense of rootlessness and without
normal bonds of familial love. Many also say that adoption into
permanent families is taking a back seat to long-term foster care.</I>
<P>
<I>It was not always this way. Until early in this century, adoption
was generally handled informally within communities and by private
charities that helped to place abandoned children and orphans
into stable, loving homes. This work has been largely supplanted
by a state-run, tax-funded foster-care system.</I>
<P>
<I>We recently interviewed Conna Craig, president of the Institute
for Children, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based private nonprofit,
to learn more about how we reached the current morass and what
can be done to revive the voluntary sector's role in adoption.
She advises governors, other policy makers and opinion leaders
both here and abroad on practical steps that can be taken to restructure
foster care and adoption. Adopted at age eight into a family that
has cared for 110 foster children, Ms. Craig believes that children
are better off in a permanent, loving family and that every child
deserves such a start in life. The Institute can be reached at
(617) 491-4614.</I> 
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>There are currently some 50,000 children who the
courts have declared legally free to be adopted, yet who are still
in foster care. Why is this?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Fundamentally, because the notion has arisen that the
state can or should be a parent. There are three major reasons
for the demise of adoption. One is government involvement in what
was once a largely private endeavor. The second is an anti-adoption
bias that, with the help of the media, is taking on frightening
proportions. The third is what some call the culture of victimization.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Let's start with the firstgovernment involvement.</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Some people have an interest in perpetuating the current
system. Many of the studies on foster care are conducted by the
government or by organizations that receive government funding.
That makes me question the bias of those studies.
<P>
In 1980, Congress mandated that the states report on the number
of children in foster care and their status. Yet today, there
is no government agency that can say with certainty how many children
are in foster care, where they are, whether they are free to be
adopted, or if they're OK. Since 1980, Congress has also required
that every child have a permanency plan within 18 months of entering
foster care. This is usually a plan for a return to the child's
biological parents or adoption.
<P>
It's been 15 years since this law was passed, but one in ten foster
children is still in state care for longer than seven years. Clearly,
such planning isn't resulting in permanent homes for children.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about state regulations governing adoptions?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Several states require that an adoptive family be identified
before a child is legally free to be adopted. Children in those
states become caught in a Catch-22: they cannot be free to be
adopted until a family is identified, but a family is more likely
to be identified when a child is already free to be adopted. We're
conducting a study of children who are free to be adopted in each
state, and some of the numbers we've found are alarming. In California,
there are more than 9,000 children free to be adopted but who
are still in foster care.
<P>
I don't think we should rely only on social work and adoption
recruitment before freeing these children. For the sake of the
children, people who wish to adopt should be given an accurate
picture of the number of children who need permanent homes.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about the anti-adoption bias you mentioned?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> There's an organization called the National Association
of Black Social Workers in Detroit which believes that there are
&quot;many compelling reasons&quot; to reject transracial adoptionsplacing
children of one race with parents of another. NABSW believes that
if same-race homes cannot be found for black children, the &quot;full
range of permanency planning&quot; should be used. That includes
returning children to their biological parents or keeping them
permanently in state foster homes.
<P>
Rita Simon, a distinguished sociology professor at the American
University, has conducted a 20-year study summarized in <I>The
Case for Transracial Adoption</I> (Washington, DC: American University
Press, 1994) which looks at transracial adoptions. The Search
Institute in Minneapolis has conducted the largest-ever study
of adopted adolescents (&quot;Growing Up Adopted: A Portrait of
Adolescents and Their Families&quot;). Both find that transracially
adopted children fare very well on a number of indicators.
<P>
I grew up in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic adoptive family, and
I'm incredulous when so-called experts imply that I could have
loved my brothers and sisters more if our skin color had matched.
I find that mystifying and even racist. I think the NABSW and
those who are against transracial adoption are partly responsible
for the fact that black children on average spend twice as long
in foster care as white children.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What's the culture of victimization?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> In essence, it's the view that child abuse and neglect
have their roots in social factorsracism, economic inequality,
broken homesnot the uncoerced actions of parents. There is a group
called Concerned United Birthparents (CUB), headquartered in Des
Moines. As an organization, its message is that long-term foster
care is preferable to adoption, although not everyone who belongs
to CUB is anti-adoption. Its arguments are fueled by socialist
feminists who claim that the two-parent family is an old, outmoded
ideal. When this idea infuses the thinking of social workers,
we see children being returned to abusive homes or kept permanently
in the limbo of foster care.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Are there any other obstacles that prevent children
from being adopted?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Another major problem is the categorizing of many foster
children as having special needs. Originally, this designation
was intended to help children who might otherwise not be adopted.
But today, some 70 percent of children in foster care are categorized
as having special needs. Sometimes, this simply means having been
in foster care for a certain number of years or being part Native-American.
Not surprisingly, a federal subsidy comes with this categorization.
<P>
Of course, some children do have special needs. But over-categorization
has two harmful consequences. First, it tends to carry a stigma
that discourages many people who want to adopt. Some of those
people eventually decide to adopt a child from another country.
While international adoption is commendable, not everyone can
afford it. I've heard parents say they tried to adopt a child
from the inner-city, but were discouraged by the system. Second,
the term special needs ignores what one father with several adopted
children recently told me about one of his daughters: &quot;She
is special, and she needs us.&quot;
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Why is the debate over foster care and adoption happening
now?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> It's a positive response to what happens under dire
and unfortunate circumstances. I don't think you'll find many
people who would agree that long-term foster care is working.
Children are dying in foster care. Seventeen percent of incarcerated
criminals in state prisons are former foster children. Forty percent
of former foster kids &quot;graduate&quot; to welfare. Thirty-nine
percent of the homeless youth in Los Angeles County are former
foster children.
<P>
The real solution is a private one. Adoption is the ultimate form
of privatization: it is the wresting of authority over a child's
life away from the state. It allows the child to be freeto be
raised not by government but by loving parents. This results not
only in much better outcomes for children, but also in huge savings
to taxpayers. When you look at children who have been adopted
into permanent homes, these kids do far better as measured by
a variety of indicators than foster children and also better than
national samples of children.
<P>
Foster care is a $10-billion-a-year industry, and it's growing.
I think what we're seeing is 30 years of big-government failure.
People are re-examining the role of the state. We recognize that
government cannot raise children. Even President Clinton said
so in his first State of the Union Address. Mrs. Clinton recently
hosted a White House ceremony celebrating National Adoption Month.
She urged Americans to help find an adoptive home for every child
free to be adopted.
<P>
One of the most tragic failures of the welfare statewhat I call
the dirty little secret of the welfare stateis foster care. Part
of the reason it's taken so long to realize how bad things have
become is because many states and government agencies are loathe
to share their information. But with the &quot;information explosion&quot;
of the last ten years, people are learning about what's going
on through the Freedom of Information Act, good reporting, and
academic studiesand they're blowing the whistle.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>How were adoptions generally handled by earlier generations
of Americans?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Through most of America's history, adoption and child
welfare were handled privately with very little government intervention
or regulation. In <I>The Tragedy of American Compassion</I>, Marvin
Olasky talks about how charities ran orphan trains that took orphans
to adoptive homes all over the country. More often, an adoptive
home was available in the immediate community. Adoptions weren't
usually recognized by law. But there was an informal recognition
by neighbors and those in the community.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about adoption as an alternative to abortion?
That seems to be an area where pro-life and pro-choice groups
could find common ground. Do you see anything happening here?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Right now, women faced with an unplanned pregnancy are
not encouraged to look at their full range of (continued after table)<BR>

<P>
choices from raising the child to looking to one's family for
support to getting married. I'm hearing more from the pro-life
community about making adoption work better. The pro-choice side
more often raises the question of who will care for the children.
I would encourage them to look at the number of people who wish
to adopt.
<P>
My sense is that there are tens of thousands of peopleif not morewaiting
to adopt. I'm certain that there are more families than there
are children free to be adopted; and it is not true that these
families are only interested in adopting healthy white babies.
The National Adoption Center in Philadelphia reports that there
are 650 families waiting to adopt older, special-needs children.
AKIDS in White Plains, New York, has a list of 150 people waiting
to adopt special-needs kids. The San Francisco office of Adopt
a Special Kid, which has 27 offices nationwide, receives 1,500
calls a year from people who wish to adopt children with disabilities.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>There seems to be a stigma attached to the woman
who has a child out of wedlock and then places the child for adoption.
She's seen as irresponsible because she's chosen not to raise
her own child. Maybe more women are having abortions because of
this. Can anything be done to change this perception?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> In England, I've seen the same trendbasically blaming
a woman for choosing adoption. Professor Richard Whitfield is
writing a paper on adoption for the Institute of Economic Affairs
in London. He tells the story of a young girl who wanted to place
her child for adoption but was totally discouraged by state social
workers. Also, when I talk to young, pregnant girls who live in
group homes, they consistently tell me they would never place
their children for adoption. They know what the system is. If
we got government out of the business of parenting, the system
would improve and attitudes about adoption would begin to change.
<P>
We see a lot of public service announcements about getting food
stamps and other welfare benefits, but we don't see a message
telling young, pregnant girls about adoptionthat bringing a baby
to term and placing it for adoption can be a morally courageous
choice.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Your Institute is seeking to get governors to take
the lead in reforming the foster care/adoption system.</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Yes. Governors are the natural champions of foster children,
who under law are wards of the state. We are trying to convince
every governor to get his or her state out of the business of
parenting. Governors can also take the lead in helping to knock
down barriers that prevent the voluntary sector from doing more.
For example, we wanted to have a Thanksgiving dinner this year
for foster children in shelters and group homes. A friend volunteered
his beautiful home, which happens to be just over the state line
in New Hampshire. We discovered we couldn't take the children
into another state. Next year, we hope to have Thanksgiving dinners
for foster children in every state.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What role can grantmaking foundations play in promoting
the adoption process?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Foundations have an exciting opportunity to invest now
in reshaping the system. Foster care and adoption are enmeshed
in an array of social issues: crime, teen pregnancy, abortion,
family violence. Foundations that support community-based approaches
to these issues would do well to consider how they can help knock
down some of the barriers that keep foster children languishing
in state care. I would also urge foundations that support economic
research to examine this pressing economic issue: foster care
and public-agency adoption is a $10-billion-a-year industry. The
Atlas Economic Research Foundation in Fairfax, Virginia saw this
connection and became our first investor.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about charities, and for that matter, businesses?
What role can they play?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> There is a tremendous role for both. There's a charity
here in Massachusetts whose mission is to ensure that no foster
child experiences the holidays without a toy. It's all-volunteer
and receives no government money. It also provides football and
baseball tickets and pays for prom dresses and tuxedos for teenage
foster kids as well as for Little League teams and driver's education.
It now reaches 5,000 foster children in Massachusetts each year.
This is a wonderful example of the promise of the private, voluntary
sectorof individuals and corporations working together to help
foster children. I think that with a devolution from federal entitlement
programs to state-level accountability, we'll see more and more
of these kinds of initiatives.
<P>
Charities and businesses can also help cover some of the costs
of adopting, which can run into the thousands of dollars. Let's
say you have a child in South Boston who is free to be adopted
and a family waiting to adopt in Dallas. Delta Airlines, which
calls itself the airline for kids, and other major carriers could
each pay for 1,000 newly adopted children to go to their new homes.
People could even donate their frequent flyer miles for these
kids.
<P>
We're launching an initiative in 1996the Moses Projectthat will
seek to engage the community of faith more fully in the adoption
process. Our first step is to find out why churches and synagogues
do not always get involved in foster care and adoption, and what
they perceive as the barriers to doing so.
<P>
Another problem is medical conditions that some foster children
have. Some who would otherwise be adopted have long-term or episodic
health conditions. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, other major insurance
companies, and HMOs could agree to cover the medical bills of,
say, ten newly adopted children in their communities.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What can individuals do?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> We receive letters and phone calls from individuals
across the nation who are seeking advice and who want to help.
We are considering setting up a network of state-level citizen
groups and are seeking funding for this project. In the meantime,
individuals can support their local private and faith-based foster-care
and adoption providers. Also, I urge individuals to write to their
governors and ask that reform of foster care and adoption be made
a top priority.

<h2>Undermining the Founder's Intent: Five Case Studies</h3>
<BR>


By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Wooster">Martin Morse Wooster</a>
<P>
The issue of donor intent continues to vex the philanthropic world,
particularly some of America's largest foundations. This article
expands on my recent book, <a href="/crc/books/pdi.html"><I>The Great Philanthropists and the
Problem of &quot;Donor Intent&quot;</I></a> (Washington, DC: Capital
Research Center, 1994). It continues the stories of foundations
that have violated their founders' wishes, adding new information
on recent developments. It also includes new material on the views
of Henry Ford II and a discussion of the recent &quot;Lee Bass
Case.&quot; A summary offers advice for donors who may wish to
create a private foundation.1

<B>The Barnes Foundation: &quot;A Dangerous Precedent&quot;</B>

<P>
The Barnes Foundation board of trustees continues to violate the
wishes of Albert C. Barnes (1872-1951), an entrepreneur and art
collector who created a world-renowned gallery of French modernist
art in Merion, Pennsylvania. Although Barnes' will firmly states
that no paintings are ever to leave the museum, many paintings
have been sent to exhibits around the world.
<P>
The Foundation continues a legal battle with the Violetta de Mazia
Trust, created by a student of Barnes who was also a trustee of
the Foundation until her death in 1988. The Trust contends that
the Foundation's board has improperly diverted grants intended
for the Foundation to Lincoln University, an African-American
school which under the terms of Barnes' will appoints most of
the Foundation's directors. The Foundation counters that most
of the de Mazia Trust's assets (including paintings) were stolen
from the Foundation and that the Trust should legally be part
of the Foundation, not an independent entity.
<P>
In January 1995, the Foundation and Trust reached an out-of-court
settlement. The Foundation agreed to permanently offer art courses
based on Barnes' views and agreed that the Trust is an independent
organization over which it has no legal authority. In return,
the Trust agreed to donate $2,750,000 over seven years to pay
for the art courses. It also agreed not to object to the Foundation's
efforts to alter Barnes' will by increasing admission fees, allowing
fundraising events at the museum, and letting the Foundation invest
in areas other than government bonds and railroad stocks, as Barnes
had wished.2
<P>
In July 1995, however, Montgomery County Orphans Court Judge Stanley
Ott rejected the settlement. The Trust, along with Concerned Students
of the Barnes and Friends of the Barnes Foundation (two organizations
not included in the original settlement), have resumed their suit.
Foundation president Richard Glanton, who has led the effort to
alter Barnes' will, continues to criticize Barnes supporters:
&quot;The courts have given standing to any Tom, Dick, or Harry
to heave spitballs at us. Anywhere else in the world we'd be heroes
for doing what we've done. What have our critics ever done for
the Barnes? Nothing. They're nobodies.&quot; Glanton also called
Barnes supporters a &quot;small, mean-spirited group.&quot;3
<P>
The Foundation has been more successful in efforts to send its
paintings around the world. In 1992, Orphans Court Judge Louis
D. Stefan allowed a limited tour of certain paintings. In February
1994, he extended the tour to include museums in Fort Worth and
Toronto. This has proven to be a big moneymaker: by March 1995,
the tour had raised $14,600,000. Visitors to the Philadelphia
Museum of Art paid $9.50 to see the paintings ($8.50 more than
they would have paid at the Foundation) and spent $1,500,000 on
memorabilia, including CD-ROMS, even though Barnes' will firmly
prohibits any reproduction of the paintings.4
<P>
The foundation also successfully petitioned the Pennsylvania Superior
Court in May of 1995 to allow the paintings to be transported
to the Haus der Kunst, a museum in Munich. (A month earlier, Orphans
Court Judge Stanley Ott had denied the request, citing the fragility
of the paintings. The Superior Court gave no explanation for its
reversal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear the
case.) The paintings have been sent overseas in return for a payment
of $2,250,000 from the Haus der Kunst. It is unclear when they
will be returned.
<P>
The <I>New Criterion</I>'s Roger Kimball recently told the <I>National
Law Journal</I> that the assault on Barnes' will is &quot;a smear
campaign pure and simple. Barnes set up a rigorous educational
mission, and it is being undermined by certain people for their
own aggrandizement. Barnes was not crazy; he was betrayed.&quot;
&quot;The Barnes affair is one of the great scandals in American
art museums,&quot; adds Thomas Freundenheim, the Smithsonian Institution's
assistant secretary for museums, &quot;and it sets a dangerous
precedent. If a will isn't sacrosanct under the law, what is?
The Fricks, Barnes, and Carnegies of the future are going to think
very carefully before donating their masterpieces to our institutions
and to our future generations. And that is a more dangerous situation
than the public understands it to be.&quot;5
<P>
<a name="buck"></a>
<B>The Buck Trust: From Charity to Alcohol Prohibition</B> 
<P>
The $427,000,000 Buck Trust, created by Beryl Buck (1896-1975),
an oil heiress and longtime resident of Marin County, California,
supports programs and causes increasingly removed from those specified
by the donor. According to Buck's will, distributions from the
Trust are to be &quot;used for exclusively nonprofit, charitable,
religious, or educational purposes in providing care for the needy
in Marin County . . . and for other nonprofit charitable, religious
or educational purposes in Marin County. . . .&quot;6
<P>
After a 1986 lawsuit in which the San Francisco Foundation, the
Trust's administrator, tried unsuccessfully to alter Buck's will
to allow the distribution of funds throughout the San Francisco
Bay area, a court ordered that the Trust's wealth be transferred
to a newly created Marin Community Foundation. The court also
ordered the funding of three new Marin-based nonprofits with Buck
Trust funds: the Buck Center for Research on Aging, Beryl Buck
Institute for Education, and Marin Institute for the Prevention
of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Problems.
<P>
In June 1991, the Trust's board agreed to spend $4,500 in Trust
funds to study whether the self-esteem of Marin County residents
would be harmed by the Buck Center's plans to use rats in laboratory
experiments. According to Mary McEachron, administrative director
of the Center, &quot;rodent activists&quot; had prompted the study
by protesting construction of the facility.7
<P>
The 1994 annual report of the Marin Institute shows that Trust
funds are being used to support nonprofit lobbying to increase
regulation of the production and distribution of alcoholan activity
unrelated to Beryl Buck's desire to help the needy of Marin County.
In collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a major
promoter of government-run health care, the Marin Institute recently
began a three-year program &quot;to provide in-depth support for
policy initiatives to prevent alcohol and other drug problems&quot;
in seven major cities. In addition, the Marin Institute:
<UL>
<LI>Continued to collect a &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; of alcohol-industry
merchandise of which it disapproved.
<LI>Purchased $1,000 worth of stock in Anheuser-Busch and Canandaigua
Wine in order to introduce shareholder resolutions at annual meetings.
<LI>Joined with alcohol prohibitionist organizations in Sweden,
Norway, and the United Kingdom to create the Global Alliance to
Prevent Alcohol-Related Harm.
<LI>Held at least six &quot;media advocacy&quot; workshops designed
to train activists in ways to urge journalists to support government
regulation of alcohol.
<LI>Provided &quot;technical assistance&quot; to such organizations
as the Advocacy Institute, a tobacco prohibition group; American
Lung Association, now a major anti-tobacco lobbying organization;
and Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.8

<B>The Estate of Doris Duke: Lost in Probate</B> 
<P>
Little change has occurred in the Duke Endowment, the Charlotte-based
regional foundation created by tobacco and hydroelectric power
magnate James B. Duke. But the estate of Doris Duke, his recently
deceased daughter, is more unsettled than ever.
<P>
Doris Duke willed most of her fortune to a proposed Doris Duke
Charitable Foundation. With $1.2 billion in assets, this would
be the sixteenth largest foundation in the U.S.slightly larger
than the Carnegie Corporation of New York ($1.2 billion) but smaller
than the Annenberg Foundation ($1.3 billion).9 With the turmoil
surrounding the Doris Duke estate, however, it is unclear who
would run the foundation or if it will be created at all.
<P>
Duke revised her will at least six times in the two years before
her death in October 1993. In her last will, she named Bernard
Lafferty, her butler, co-executor (along with U.S. Trust) and
awarded him a $500,000 salary plus a $5,000,000 executor's fee.
In January 1995, however, Duke's nurse, Tammy Payette, charged
that Duke did not die of natural causes but was killed by a &quot;massive
sedation regime&quot; administered by Lafferty.10 Manhattan Surrogate's
Court Judge Eve Preminger appointed former district attorney Richard
Kuh to investigate the allegations and other charges of irregularities
in the management of Duke's estate.
<P>
Other Duke employees have also questioned the legality of Duke's
will. Colin Shanley, Duke's cook, and Ann Bostich, Duke's housekeeper,
charged that Duke was disoriented when she signed her last will.
Bostich also accused William Doyle, the lawyer who prepared the
last will, of holding Duke's hand and pushing it &quot;along the
page, guiding the hand&quot; until a signature was obtained.11
<P>
In April, Kuh's report was unsealed in Surrogate's Court. It supported
Payette's charges, saying that though Duke was terminally ill
in October 1993, her death was hastened by a fatal morphine overdose.
It also accused Lafferty of severe mismanagement of the estate,
saying that several charitable gifts made in Duke's name to Duke
University ($2,000,000), the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation
($1,000,000), and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
($1,000,000) may have been made by Lafferty himself while Duke
was in no condition to agree. It further accused Lafferty of reckless
spending and of improperly borrowing $853,000 in interest-free
loans from U.S. Trust.
<P>
As Kuh's report was being released, Chandi Duke Heffner, a belly-dancing
instructor whom Duke adopted in 1988 and then un-adopted in 1991,
settled her longstanding dispute with the estate for a figure
reported to be $65,000,000. As for Tammy Payette, she recently
pleaded guilty to stealing $500,000 in art and jewels from six
wealthy patients.
<P>
In May, Judge Preminger ousted Lafferty and U.S. Trust as co-executors
and replaced them with Morgan Guaranty Trust and Alexander D.
Forger, a former chairman of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley, and McCloy
who served as executor of the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Preminger, citing Lafferty's admitted alcoholism and &quot;lack
of appreciation of the most basic financial matters,&quot;12 also
noted that U.S. Trust should have noticed Lafferty's deficiencies
and not loaned him the $853,000: &quot;U.S. Trust has failed to
discharge this duty to the estate and the charitable beneficiaries.&quot;13
In October, a New York appeals court upheld Preminger's ruling,
although Lafferty and U.S. Trust plan to appeal a second time.
<P>
So it remains unclear who the final executor of the Doris Duke
estate will be, whether the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation will
be created, whether Chandi Duke Heffner's settlement with the
estate will be overturned, and whether Duke University, the Elizabeth
Taylor AIDS Foundation, and People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals will have to return the questionable donations made in
Doris Duke's name. Nearly every question about the Doris Duke
estate, including what her charitable intentions were, remains
unanswered.
<P>
<a name="ford"></a>
<B>The Ford Foundation: &quot;A Horrible Mistake&quot;</B> 
<P>
New information concerning how Henry Ford II (1917-1987) lost
control of the Ford Foundation his family created has emerged
in the form of taped interviews conducted between 1980 and 1985.14
Ford stipulated that the tapes not be made public until five years
after his death. The tapes' contents were recently summarized
by the <I>Detroit News</I> in a multi-part series.15
<P>
Although Ford is already known to have regretted his decision
in 1948 to relinquish family control over the Foundation, the
interviews are more candid. &quot;I made a big mistake on the
Ford Foundation. I had the Ford Foundation in my hand at one time.
Then I lost it, and I lost it on my own volition. I gave it away
on my own. I was young, inexperienced, and stupid. I just muffed
it. It got out of control, and it stayed out of control. And now
it's gone, of course.&quot;16
<P>
Ford added that he should have used the Foundation mostly to fund
causes created by his grandfather, including the Henry Ford Hospital,
Edison Institute (now the Henry Ford Museum), and Fair Lane, his
grandfather's estate (now a conference center). &quot;It could
have been done so easily,&quot; he said. &quot;It could have been
done with a penin four seconds. We had three trustees. We could
have done anything we wanted. We could have taken the [Ford Motor]
stock and given it to any nonprofit company, nonprofit Edison
Institute, nonprofit Henry Ford Hospital, nonprofit Fair Lane,
nonprofit whatever you want. And done a much better job for the
whole family than I did. I did it all on my own and I made a horrible
mistake. I'll never live it down, and I regret it sincerely. But
what the hell can I do about it? I can't do anything about it.
Just have to lie and die with it.&quot;17
<P>
The Ford Foundation recently announced that longtime president
Franklin Thomas will step in down in 1996. His replacement is
Susan Berresford, a Foundation vice-president and employee since
1970. In a lengthy interview with the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
Berresford did not say how she intended to uphold the charitable
ideas of Henry Ford or Henry Ford II. In fact, she did not mention
the Fords at all.18 Writing in the <I>New Republic</I>, David
Samuels predicts that Berresford will continue the Foundation's
longstanding pattern of funding the &quot;professional advocacy
industry,&quot; including the Ms. Foundation for Women, Women's
Legal Defense Fund, National Women's Law Center, and Institute
for Women.19
<P>
<a name="bass"></a>
<B>The Case of Lee Bass: I Want My Money Back</B> 
<P>
One place where donors have had a great deal of trouble expressing
their ideas is in universities. Pro-capitalist donors have spent
tens of millions of dollars creating &quot;free enterprise chairs&quot;
at universities, most of which have done little to advance free
markets.20 Others have had a hard time convincing universities
to accept their ideas as well as their checks. Consider the case
of Lee Bass.
<P>
Bass, who graduated from Yale University in 1979, is heir to an
oil fortune. Inspired by Yale historian Donald Kagan, Bass decided
in 1991 to give $20,000,000 to his alma mater to create courses
that would promote Western civilization. Kagan became the first
&quot;Bass Professor&quot; and was charged with designing the
program.
<P>
In the meantime, Yale hired a new president, Richard Levin, who
found that the university had a $12,000,000 budget deficit that
Bass' grant could close. Although the Western civilization program
was scheduled to hire four new professors, one clause of the Bass
indenture said that &quot;full-time faculty [should] take direct
responsibility for the teaching at the heart of the program.&quot;
Levin interpreted this to mean that existing faculty could be
assigned to the program and paid with Bass funds. According to
Bass professor of history Henry Turner, &quot;We were asked to
design a Rolls Royce of a course [but] were told to put in a Chrysler
engine and Plymouth upholstery.&quot;2l
<P>
Meanwhile, Yale undergraduate Pat Collins began investigating
the program. He found that several professors objected to a new
course upholding the works of &quot;dead white males.&quot; Collins'
work was picked up by the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, which editorialized
that &quot;There can be little doubt that the faculty quarters
ideologically opposed to the Western Civilization program . .
. played a crucial role in derailing the initiative and, not incidentally,
the intentions of the grant.&quot;22
<P>
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Bass first heard his
program was in trouble from the <I>Journal</I> editorial. He had
received no response to several requests for information on the
status of the program between September 1993 and November 1994.
For some reason, Yale president Levin was unable to find time
to talk to Bass. In February 1995, Bass imposed an additional
condition on his grant: that he have the right to approve the
professors teaching the program. Levin refused to accept the condition,
so Bass withdrew his grant in March 1995.
<P>
Yale's response has been to deny that the episode had anything
to do with ideology. But Yale subsequently rejected an offer by
members of Yale's class of 1937 to raise the $20,000,000 lost
by the Bass grant for a new Western civilization program.
<P>
The publicity surrounding the Bass case may lead increasing numbers
of alumni to question the wisdom of giving to their alma maters.
&quot;I don't think the problem is simply dealing with Western
Civilization or the humanities at Yale,&quot; says Russell Reynolds,
a 1954 Yale graduate. &quot;I think it's dealing with the governance
of Yale and the way the institution is currently being run.&quot;23
<P>
The Bass case suggests that universities can be remarkably impervious
to outside influence. Perhaps a better way for alumni to influence
their alma maters is to donate books or magazine subscriptions
to the college library, or to support nonprofit organizations
that seek to aid college students and professors, such as the
Institute for Humane Studies, Intercollegiate Studies Institute,
Madison Center, National Association of Scholars, or Young America's
Foundation.
<P><a name="advice"></a>
<B>Advice for Donors</B> 
<P>
What lessons can be drawn from these stories?
<UL>
<LI>The Barnes case shows that trustees can successfully challenge
a will in court even if the donor's wishes are explicit. Donors
would thus be wise to consider giving most or all of their wealth
during their lifetimes. Nonetheless, examples of other foundations,
such as the Duke Endowment and Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, show
that an explicitly worded bequest is more likely to be honored
than a vaguely worded one.24
<LI>The Buck case shows the importance of carefully selecting
an executor. Had the San Francisco Foundation honored Beryl Buck's
will, the court would not have created the Marin Community Foundation
and programs with no relation to Buck's wishes.
<LI>The Duke case likewise shows the importance of the executor,
and the kind of lengthy probate court contest that may occur if
a highly competent one is not chosen.
<LI>The Ford case suggests that family control of a foundation
can help uphold donor intent. But, as the accompanying article
on the Pew Charitable Trusts shows, family involvement by third-
or fourth-generation heirs is probably less effective, as they
will have little or no direct knowledge of the founder's ideas.
Family control is likely to keep a foundation on track only in
the short run.
<LI>The Bass case shows the advantage of giving during one's lifetime.
Lee Bass was able to withdraw his gift when he saw that his wishes
would not be fulfilled.
<LI>In short, there are no guarantees that one's bequest will
be honoredonly varying degrees of probability that it will be.
Donors can increase the likelihood that their wishes will be followed
by explicitly stating their objectives and carefully choosing
trustees. They should also consider giving more during their lifetimes
and limiting the life of their foundations.<BR>

<h2>The Pew Charitable Trusts: Revitalizing &quot;the Spirit of
the 60s&quot;</h2>
<BR>
By Dr. Robert Lerner and Dr. Althea K. Nagai
<P>
The family of Joseph Newton Pew, founder of the Sun Oil Company,
created seven charitable trusts beginning in the late 1940s to
carry out their philanthropic ideals. As Martin Wooster relates
in <a href="/crc/books/pdi.html"><I>The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of &quot;Donor
Intent,&quot;</I></a> the Pews were strongly religious conservatives
who often gave to charity anonymously, believing that &quot;charity
should be a private matter between God and one's conscience.&quot;1
<P>
Two Pew brothers, J. Howard Pew (1882-1971) and Joseph N. Pew,
Jr. (1886-1963), took over the family oil business after their
father's death in 1912. J. Howard Pew attended Grove City College,
which was largely developed and financed by his father, and briefly
studied at MIT. His scientific contributions to the oil business
included the development of Sun Red Stock, a more versatile lubricating
oil than had been used, and hydrolene, the first commercially
successful petroleum asphalt.2 Joseph N. Pew, Jr., a graduate
of Cornell University, became heavily involved in national politics
as vice president of Sun Oil. He led the effort to overturn Franklin
Roosevelt's National Recovery Act, a system of government-organized
cartels declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935.
<P>
Both brothers were strong supporters of religious organizations
and black colleges. Both also strongly supported the Republican
Party, giving an estimated $2,000,000 between 1934 and 1940. Joseph
N. Pew, Jr. also purchased a number of magazines, including the
<I>Farm Journal</I> and <I>Pathfinder</I>, to advance his anti-New
Deal views.
<P>
<B>The Founding of the Trusts</B> 
<P>
Starting in 1948, J. Howard Pew, Joseph N. Pew, Jr., and their
sisters, Mary Ethel Pew and Mabel Pew Myrin, gave at least 80
percent of their fortunes to seven charitable trusts: the Pew
Memorial Trust, J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust, Mabel Pew Myrin Trust,
J.N. Pew Jr. Charitable Trust, Medical Trust, Mary Anderson Trust,
and Knollbrook Trust. These were intended to support education,
social services, religion, health care, and medical research.
The Trusts' first president was Sun Oil executive Robert G. Dunlop,
who succeeded J. Howard Pew as president of Sun Oil in 1947.
<P>
Major changes began with the death of J. Howard Pew. Robert I.
Smith was appointed administrator of the Glenmede Trust Company,
the holding company of the Trusts, and later served as president
of the Trusts from 1977 to 1986. He began the practice of consulting
outsiders, such as Yale University president A. Bartlett Giamatti
and future Harvard University president Neil Rudenstine for advice
on what the Trusts should do.3
<P>
Even though the Pews believed in giving anonymously, Smith oversaw
publication of the Trusts' first annual reports. He also broadened
the base of Pew funding to include large grants to major research
centers, mainstream social agencies, and Ivy League schools, even
though J. Howard Pew detested the liberalism of Ivy League schools.
In 1981, the Trusts also stopped supporting hospital wings and
disease research, shifting funds to initiatives intended to change
public health policy.4
<P>
<B>Radical Restructuring</B> 
<P>
The transformation of the Trusts accelerated with the 1987 appointment
of Dr. Thomas W. Langfitt as president. A former neurosurgeon
and vice president of health affairs at the University of Pennsylvania,
Langfitt fired 17 of 20 executives, including the executive director,
three vice presidents, and 13 program officers. The only prominent
executive to remain was Rebecca Rimel, a former nurse who was
promoted to executive director. (She became president in 1993.)
During Langfitt's tenure, two of five board members also resigned,
one under pressure for &quot;meddling&quot; in staff affairs and
another, John G. Pew, a distant relation, in protest of the foundation's
increasingly liberal leanings.5
<P>
Langfitt explains the Trusts' operating principles: &quot;In the
past, we'd identify a problem and fund private agencies. Now we
see that most of the responsibility for dealing with major social
problems rests with the government. However, it lacks the money
for new programs. So instead of working on a parallel track we
build partnerships between government and private agencies.&quot;6
Likewise, Rimel says, &quot;If we could infuse the spirit of the
'60s into our work it might get the country out of this morass
of feeling that problems are insolvable.&quot;7 According to Rimel,
&quot;The political ghosts of Pew's past are gone.&quot;8<BR>

<B>Analysis of Pew Grantmaking: The Environment</B> 
<P>
To determine the extent of change at the Pew Charitable Trusts,
we examined all grants in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993,
and 1994. We categorized these as ideological or non-ideological,
then subdivided the ideological grants into liberal and conservative
categories.
<P>
The results of our analysis are startling. We found that in 1986,
the Trusts gave about three times as many grants and three-and-a-half
times as much money to liberal groups as to conservative ones.
By 1994, the Trusts were giving 22 times as many grants and 40
times as much money to liberal groups. The total number of grants
and amount of money given to conservative groups actually decreased
from 1986 to 1994. (See <a href="#chart1">Chart 1.</a>) 
<P>
The liberal orientation of the Trusts is evident in a number of
policy areas, particularly the environment. The Trusts are now
the nation's largest environmental grantmaker. Most funding comes
from the trust created by Joseph N. Pew, Jr., although there is
no evidence that he was interested in conservation.
<P>
The <I>1985 Annual Report of the J.N. Pew Jr. Charitable Trust</I>
shows that 19 conservation grants were awarded in 1984. These
supported such goals as protecting &quot;the natural environment
and genetic diversity.&quot;9 In 1986, the J.N. Pew Trust made
grants totalling over three million dollars to such moderately
liberal environmental groups as the Nature Conservancy, National
Wildlife Foundation, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's
Marine Policy and Ocean Management Center.
<P>
The J.N. Pew Trust has since embraced radical environmentalism.
In 1991, it awarded 98 environmental grants totalling over $13
million. These addressed such concerns as &quot;Deforestation
and the Loss of Biodiversity&quot; and &quot;Global Warming and
Climate Change.&quot; By 1994, the J.N. Pew Trust was giving $17
million to environmental groups, and the combined trusts were
providing over $23 million in environmental funding (see <a href="#chart2">Chart
2</a>).
<P>
This sweeping change is probably due to the 1990 appointment of
Joshua Reichert, the Trusts' program director in conservation
and the environment. Reichert is a former liberal organizer associated
with Caesar Chavez's United 
Farm Workers10 who, according to Langfitt, &quot;understands environmental
issues from the ground up. He has worked at both the program and
policy level to effect environmental change, has had considerable
domestic and international experience, and is particularly familiar
with the important and oftentimes understated linkages between
economic, social, and environmental problems.&quot;11
<P>
In 1994, the Trusts adopted an interdisciplinary approach to the
environment. Under the rubric &quot;the Global Agenda&quot; and
&quot;the Pew Global Stewardship Initiative,&quot; funds are drawn
from the Pew Memorial Trust and support such nonprofits as the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences ($230,000), Environmental
Defense Fund ($180,000), Global Action Plan for the Earth ($150,000
to teach children &quot;to lead environmentally sustainable lives&quot;),
International Institute for Sustainable Development ($150,000),
International Women's Health Coalition ($150,000), League of Women
Voter's Voter Education Fund ($75,000), National Council for International
Health ($50,000), Planned Parenthood Federation of America ($130,000),
and Zero Population Growth ($150,000). Funding from other Trust
programs in 1994 supported the Center for Public Interest Research
($115,000), Environmental Defense Fund ($140,000), Friends of
the Earth ($45,000), Natural Resources Defense Council ($1,175,000
[three grants]), and Rainforest Action Network ($160,000).12
<P>
<B>Undoing the J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust</B> 
<P>
J. Howard Pew created his trust to support individual initiative,
free markets, lower taxes, and less regulation
. The Trust's charter proclaims that &quot;[S]ocialism, welfare-stateism,
Marxism, Fascism and any other like forms of government intervention
are but devices by which government seizes the ownership or control
of production.&quot; Pew also expressed his belief that the &quot;enemies
of freedom employ sophistry, obfuscation, and semantics in order
to destroy the true meaning of liberty. . .&quot;
<P>
Despite its explicitness, the new leadership has diverted the
Trust from its founder's intent. Incredibly, the Trust, which
once supported numerous conservative domestic public-policy organizations,
has virtually abandoned these efforts. In 1993, the Trust made
no grants to conservative domestic public policy groups. In 1994,
it made only one such grant to the National Right to Work Legal
Defense and Education Foundation ($150,000). The conservative
Heritage Foundation also received a grant of $300,000, but this
was to study international trade. In contrast, as late as 1989,
the Trust made 10 such grants totalling $1,775,000. In 1981, conservative
grants totalled $2,432,000 and were awarded to the Alternative
Education Foundation ($22,000), American Enterprise Institute
($1,000,000), Committee for a Free World ($25,000), Ethics and
Public Policy Center ($200,000), Heritage Foundation ($100,000),
and Rockford Institute ($30,000) (see <a href="#chart3">Chart 3</a>).
<P>
Grants since 1991 have supported public policy initiatives in
the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In 1994, the Trust made 27 such grants, mostly to ideologically
indeterminate groups. According to the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
however, the Trust is phasing out its support of Central and Eastern
Europe this year &quot;to focus its $10-million public-policy
program on similar efforts in the United States.&quot; Whether
such funding will promote free markets and limited government
is questionable, since the Trusts are currently &quot;pouring
money&quot; into the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington,
D.C. in order &quot;to alter news coverage of government and politics
to focus more attention on solutions to problems than on political
differences.&quot;13 This may be an effort to counter the recent
Republican sweep of Congress and the Contract with America.
<P>
<B>Family Involvement: An Effective Safeguard?</B> 
<P>
Four seats on the Trusts' eight member board are held by Pew descendants,
who according to <I>Town and Country</I> are &quot;philosophically
attuned to the founders' spirit.&quot; They are R. Anderson Pew,
a great nephew of Joseph N. Pew, Jr., who has long been involved
in the Trusts; Joseph N. Pew III, the son of Joseph N. Pew, Jr.;
J. Howard Pew II, a grandson of Joseph N. Pew, Jr., who is listed
as &quot;an environmental activist in Chester, Nova Scotia;&quot;
and Dr. Joseph Pew IV, another grandson of Joseph N. Pew, Jr.,
who &quot;practices medicine in disadvantaged neighborhoods.&quot;14
<P>
These members appear to be at least complacent, if not supportive,
of the recent changes, although all but one refuse to be interviewed.
R. Anderson Pew says he sees no inconsistency between the founders'
intent and current grantmaking: the Trusts' founders &quot;never
saw any inconsistency between holding to their beliefs and adapting
to a changing world. If Uncle Joe and Uncle Howard were sitting
here today, they'd approve of the direction we've taken.&quot;15
He also purports to be &quot;mystified&quot; by the idea that
the founders were conservative: &quot;Our Aunt Harriet Pew in
Civil War days ran an underground railroad helping slaves. . .
. You can't get much more liberal than that.&quot;16 Of course,
such efforts occurred before the Trust-founding Pews were born.
And while admirable, the underground railroad was not the kind
of &quot;public-private partnership&quot; now endorsed by the
Trusts, but a wholly private endeavor in defiance of federal law.
<P>
The fact that the Pew Charitable Trusts' grantmaking is now far
removed from the vision of its founders suggests that in the long
run family involvement may not be an effective means of upholding
donor intent. As Martin Wooster writes, &quot;the longer a foundation
exists, the less likely it is to heed donor intent. This is due
in part to fading memories, as friends and associates of donors
die and are succeeded by people who did not personally know the
founder.&quot;17 This is a warning that donors should take to
heart.

<B>The J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust</B>
<P>
Created in 1957, the J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust exists to:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Acquaint the American people with the evils of bureaucracy
and the vital need to maintain and preserve a limited form of
government in the United States as intended by our forebears and
expressed by them in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights;&quot;
<LI>&quot;Acquaint the American people with the values of a free
market, the dangers of inflation, the need for a stable monetary
standard, the paralyzing effects of government control on the
lives and activities of people;&quot;
<LI>&quot;Support and expound the philosophy that we must first
have faith in God before we can enjoy the blessings of liberty;&quot;
and
<LI>&quot;Bring about the realization that our failure to fight
for the preservation of our liberty is a crime, the punishments
for which is servitude.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
J. Howard Pew, a pioneer in the petroleum industry, was an outspoken
defender of free enterprise and a critic of big government. Here
are some excerpts from his numerous speeches and writings:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;No economic planning authority could possibly have foreseen,
planned, plotted, and organized such an amazing spectacle of industrial
progress as the world has witnessed in the last century. No trust
or combination, private or governmental, could have accomplished
it.&quot;
<LI>You can't mix government and business &quot;any more than
you can mix pure water with contaminated water and get anything
but contaminated water.&quot;
<LI>&quot;The hand of Government on business is the cold clammy
hand of death and it must eventually destroy everything it touches.&quot;
<LI>&quot;It has been because of its freedom from regulatory interference,
its full opportunity to deal, unhampered, with its manifest problems,
that the petroleum industry has been able so well to serve the
public interest.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Nobody must be barred, no innovation rejected, no idea
untried; everybody must have his chance. . . . That is our great
American heritage. With so many political witch doctors abroad
in the land teaching communism, fascism, planned and dictated
economies, governmental paternalism and all the others, I urge
you to guard well that heritage and turn a deaf ear to all their
sophistries. When a people come to look upon their government
as the source of all their rights, there will surely come a time
when they will look upon that same government as the source of
all their wrongs. That is the history of all planned, dictated
economies. That is the history of tyranny.&quot;
</UL>

On February 8, President Clinton, with much fanfare, signed the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  The law heralds a new era of growth and competition in the rapidly expanding communications sector, which now accounts for one-seventh of the American economy.  The first overhaul of communications policy in 60 years, the legislation promises to unleash a market free-for-all by tearing down anti-competitive barriers and allowing heretofore segregated industries to enter each others' markets.  Soon, local phone companies will offer long distance services; long distance carriers will provide local service; and both will provide video services.  Cable companies are eager to provide phone service, and users of the Internet and digital technology, restricted only by their imaginations, are already revolutionizing how people communicate with one another.
<p>The main thrust of the new law is laudably deregulatory.  But despite its promising framework, the devil is in the details.  The Federal Communications Commission must conduct scores of rulemaking proceedings to implement the new law.  That means there are many opportunities for mischief on the part of special interests seeking to use the process to restrict competition in one way or another.  
<p>Much has already been written about the various corporate supplicants jockeying for their respective "fair advantage."  Yet the corporate turf wars are only part of the picture.  The law provides plenty of opportunities for big government types eager for a handout.  And a horde of nonprofit pleaders — all claiming to represent the public interest — are queuing up to get their chunk of the pie.  Having failed to derail telecommunications reform, they are now doing their best to gum up the process.  
<p>Smelling money, this vast array of activist groups hopes to use the law's universal service provision to establish a new communications entitlement that will encompass everything from free services for schools to HUD grants for wiring housing projects to the Internet.  The activists are egged on by federal agency officials who see deregulation as a threat to their sinecures.  Unconstrained competition is great for consumers, but scary to those whose power depends on maintaining government control. 
<p>
<a name="birth"></a>
<h3>The Birth of a New Entitlement</h3>
"Up for Grabs," appropriately enough, was the title of a June 10 conference at Gallaudet University in Washington sponsored by the Benton Foundation, with funding from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, W. K. Kellogg, and Charles Stewart Mott foundations, as well as the Carnegie Corporation and Ameritech.  Billed as a discussion of the public interest in the new telecommunications environment, it attracted a multitude of progressives representing such groups as People for American Way, Child Welfare League of America, Planned Parenthood, American Library Association, and OMB Watch.  This professional assembly of the socially concerned pondered what the information age meant for them. 
<p>The conference participants shared certain assumptions.  They generally agreed that unfettered markets threaten the fabric of society, that a "referee" is needed to correct the inevitable injustices caused by competition, and that corporate power, left unchecked, will overwhelm the right of other voices to participate in the decisionmaking process.  The participants were unsympathetic to Republican policy ideas and argued for the public's "right" to have access to the new technology.  Needless to say, for the right to be real it would have to be subsidized by the federal government.  
<p>Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) set the tone for the conference at its morning session.  Markey outlined his scheme for a new telecom entitlement centered on his proposal for an "E-Rate."  Schools would receive "free" a core of communications services under the proposal.  Additional advanced services would be acquired at a discounted E-Rate.  Calling for an E-Rate "crusade," Markey urged activists to rally editorial opinion behind it and warned that a "social disaster" was in the making unless schools received these services.  Enthusiastic applause greeted Markey's prediction that by next year he would again be chairman of the House subcommittee dealing with telecommunications issues.
<p>(The alphabet seems central to Markey's policy initiatives.  He is also an architect of the "V-Chip," which in theory allows parents to screen out violent programming.)
<p>Markey's remarks revealed much about the cozy relationship between government and nonprofit advocacy groups.  Liberal interest groups serve the political class, which rewards them for generating grassroots support.  Conferences like this one enable activists to meet with their political comrades to discuss how both can survive and flourish.  Indeed, the event was co-sponsored by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a part of the Commerce Department.  NTIA administers the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program, which is considered one of the top slush funds for government grants to nonprofits.
<p>Thus, Markey implored participants to "ruthlessly participate" in the process.  At the same session, Bob Rowe, a commissioner on the Montana Public Service Commission, warned the crowd that utility regulators were too exposed to business interests and needed to hear more from the "public interest community."  Later, in a small discussion group, he urged advocates to take a grassroots organizing approach.  A lawyer from the Agriculture Department volunteered his agency to subsidize the new technology entitlement.
<p>Senator Robert Kerrey (D-Neb.) provided a further illustration of how nonprofits and government sustain one another.  During a question and answer session after lunch, Kerrey was asked how Indian and rural communities could obtain access to advanced telecommunications.  When the questioner offered to send Kerrey more information, the Senator shot back, "Don't send me the information, send me [legislative] language."  
<p>Many discussions bordered on the surreal.  Some participants seemed convinced that inability to access the internet was a serious cause of many social ills.  Coralee Whitcomb, president of a Boston group called Virtually Wired, worried that the disadvantaged would be "railroaded" off the information mainline and appealed for assistance in connecting battered women to the internet.  She was particularly concerned that those in homeless shelters were unaware of the internet's value.  One might as well have demanded HMOs for Bosnia or Enterprise Zones in Liberia.  
<p>Some conferencegoers shaded their political demands by employing corporate-inspired jargon about "leveraging" grants and "strategic interventions," but there were also class warriors like Gigi Sohn from the Media Access Project, a liberal public interest law firm, who spoke of a "handful of big companies controlling what people hear and see."  Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute deplored the process by which Americans became "atoms up against global economic forces and multinational corporations."
<p>Most participants, however, seemed less inspired by radical activism or liberal ideas than by an envy that the technology revolution is generating enormous wealth.  Sohn summed it up:  "It comes down to money."  Contemporary interest group liberalism is not about new ideas or protecting individual rights: it is focused on protecting and enlarging privileges that depend on maintaining streams of funding from government.
<p>
<a name="words"></a>
<h3>Universal Service: The Politics of Magic Words </h3>
The rallying cry for telecom collectivists is universal service, the belief that everyone should have access to phone service.  In practice, universal service has meant that urban and long distance phone customers, regardless of income, subsidize the cost of providing equivalent services to rural users.  Proponents assert that phone service is almost a corollary to the constitutionally-protected right to free speech.  Activists now seek to extend the concept of universal service to other forms of electronic communications.  They have good reason to think they can win this fight because the 1996 Telecommunication Act has a universal service mandate.  It sets up a Federal-State Joint Board to make recommendations for implementing the law's universal service provision.
<p>By early fall the FCC is expected to issue a universal service rule.  The rulemaking process, which invites comments in response to the agency's initial "Notice of Proposed Rulemaking," has attracted an unusually broad range of interested parties.  Hundreds of organizations from consumer and civil rights groups to the U.S. Catholic Conference have filed comments.  The large number of participants reflects the amount of money that is at stake.  As Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation observed in its reply comments, "This proceeding will largely determine who will receive universal service subsidies and who will pay for them."
<p>Probably the most vocal and visible player in the universal service debate is the Consumer Federation of America.  CFA was actively involved in the debate over the telecom act, and it has been a thorn in the side of the exponents of telecom deregulation.
<p>According to Bradley Stillman, CFA's telecommunications policy director, not only is every American consumer entitled to have "access to the full panoply of services available over the telecommunications network," there should also be a "guarantee that they will have some level of actual <i>service</i> as well [emphasis in original]."
<p>For CFA, affordability is the bedrock of universal service.  In comments filed jointly with Consumers Union and American Association of Retired Persons, CFA argues that an expansive "relative" definition of affordability "should be a basic concept of universal service."  In other words, people should not have to "seriously diminish their standard of living" or face "serious inconvenience" as a result of paying for telecommunications services.
<p>CFA and its nonprofit allies believe universal service should include not only basic access, but also flat-rate service, directory assistance, the provision of directories, Call Trace, and 900-number blocking service.  (A number of groups, including the U.S. Catholic Conference and the National Coalition for the Homeless, contend that the universal service package should also include specialty services like voice mail.)
<p>The joint comments filed by nine other activist groups, including People for the American Way, Benton Foundation, Center for Media Education, National Council of La Raza, and National Rainbow Coalition, are even more explicit.  Prepared by counsel for People for the American Way and the Media Access Project, they assert unabashedly that "full, equal, and affordable access to a broad range of telecommunications services is a birthright of citizenship."  Put bluntly, "Those without access to telecommunications services are disenfranchised."
<p>No doubt, most of us would prefer to receive a "universal service" for anything; how about cars or televisions?  But as CSE Foundation notes, "to the extent the definition of universal service becomes more expansive, it becomes more expensive."  And the costs of such a policy are likely to be passed on to ordinary telecommunications consumers, and "may hurt those who do not qualify for subsidies yet cannot afford to pay the inevitable costs."
<p>It is important to understand that those mobilizing to affect the law's provision for universal service are not simple do-gooders ignorant of economic consequences.  Advocates of the new communications "right" believe that the communications revolution can become a vehicle to further their political aims.  Hence, People for the American Way and friends emphasize the "role of institutions" in applying an expansive notion of universal service that includes "institutional access to advanced services."  Institutions, they maintain, can provide "fundamentals training, skills building, information exchanges, and technical support" and can "even function as access providers for community networks." 
<p>According to Gary Bass, the head of OMB Watch, "Whether it's the Million Man March or the Stand for Children, we saw the Internet was a tool for organizing . . .  These are empowering mechanisms."  Bass insists that activists must "fight for the right of community groups across the country to have access to the bells and whistles."  The activist left would like nothing more than for the government to provide a free communications apparatus for its lacework of alliances and networks.

<h3>Consumer Federation of America: Suspect Source</h3>
CFA and its allies have been the primary stumbling blocks to greater telecommunications competition.  CFA's Stillman claims to welcome the outbreak of competition among telecom providers.  He says, "We must have competition as soon as possible," that "competition is the only effective outcome", and that competition and universal service are "not conflicting goals."  Yet while the legislation was before Congress, CFA claimed that the telecom bill would cost consumers billions of dollars in higher phone costs.  By contrast, Citizens for a Sound Economy, a group with considerable policy expertise in regulatory issues, estimates that the bill may lower consumer prices by 20 to 30 percent.
<p>CFA has a poor track record in predicting communications costs.  When the old Bell system was broken up in 1984, it contended that local rates would skyrocket, forcing consumers to give up their telephones.  But when one takes inflation into account, phone rates have actually decreased during the past decade.  And phone usage is way up, requiring phone companies to add new area codes at a record rate.  Since the AT&T divestiture the consumer price index consistently has grown at a rate faster than changes in basic local phone rates.  Was this a surprise to CFA?  Probably not.  In 1986, then-CFA Legislative Director Gene Kimmelman, who is now co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, CFA's sidekick in the telecom wars, was quoted in the <i>New York Times</i>:  "To be honest, we painted the worst case scenario and it hasn't been that bad."
<p>CFA was also the prime force behind the 1992 Cable Act, which has been largely repealed by the new Telecommunications Act.  Most analysts have concluded that by 1992 cable rates had peaked and that service was on the upswing.  A classic case of regulatory overkill, the main repercussion of the '92 act was to confuse consumers with nearly unintelligible bills.  Wayne Leighton, an economist at CSE, notes that "while it is true that prices were increasing somewhat before passage of the Cable Act, the quality of services was rising at a faster rate.  The law capped rates, and, as one would expect, services dropped drastically."
<p>CFA's actions on the telecommunications front have been driven by the group's anti-free market ideology.  Railing against "increased concentration" in the industry is characteristic of CFA's enmity toward business and free enterprise.  A glance at CFA's policy resolutions shows that, on virtually every issue, CFA supports more government control and regulation over private action.  It opposes both the flat tax and a consumption-based income tax, supports taxpayer funding of political campaigns, opposes the line-item veto; opposes term limits; opposes a balance budget amendment, supports Canadian-style single-payer health care reform, and opposes medical savings accounts.
<p>Notwithstanding its clear ideological makeup, CFA has been enormously effective at getting its message out.  A Nexis search joining the terms "Consumer Federation of America" and "telecommunications" resulted in 459 citations since the beginning of 1995.  Even AT&T resorted to a CFA study in a television commercial as evidence of the baleful consequences of the then-pending telecom act.

<h3>Competition Policy Institute: Whose Interest is Served?</h3>
A new telecom "public interest" watchdog group was in the news recently when it was revealed that long distance giants AT&T and MCI were among its main sources of funding.  The Competition Policy Institute was co-founded in March by Ron Binz, former head of Colorado's Office of Consumer Counsel, and Debra Berlyn, executive director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates and a prominent critic of deregulation.  The group made the news when the <i>Washington Post</i> reported that John Windhausen had left his job as a Commerce Committee staffer for Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC) to work for CPI.  Hollings was a major force in crafting the 1996 Telecom Act.  CPI received $500,000 in seed money from AT&T, MCI, and other communications companies (see box for list of companies).
<p>A first look at CPI's advisory Committee would lead one to believe that it was simply another ideological advocate of big government.  It includes CFA's Stillman, as well as Rich McClintock of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) and Susan Weinstock of AARP.  Yet its mission will be to promote policies "that introduce competition in telecommunications and energy markets in ways that benefit consumers," focusing initially on implementation of the new telecom law.  Interestingly, in the group's press release, Binz specifically points to the need for "competition for local phone service."  But ironically there is no mention of competition in long-distance phone service.  The long distance providers bankrolling CPI are eager to enter the local phone markets.  They are not thrilled, however, at the prospects of the Bell Operating Companies (Baby Bells) entering their long distance business.

<h3>Children's Television: <br>
Effective and Constitutional?</h3>
Implementation of the Telecommunications Act is only one area attracting the attention of special interest nonprofits.  "Children's Television" remains a lively issue engaging the attention of activist groups.  The FCC announced recently that it will move forward to adopt a rule requiring broadcasters to air three hours weekly of so-called educational television.  This follows a barrage of statements by politicians and interest groups supporting a programming quota, an idea strongly supported by FCC Chairman Reid Hundt, alter ego of Vice President Gore.  President Clinton, the prominent advocate of school uniforms and curfews, also voiced his support.
<p>On May 29, Massachusetts' Rep. Markey held a press conference with representatives of supportive nonprofits to announce that 220 members of Congress — a majority of House members — had signed a letter urging the FCC to adopt the three hour rule and "defend the rights of children."  Markey had the support of the Consumer Federation of America, National Education Association, the U.S. Catholic Conference, Children's Television Workshop, the national PTA, and Children Now, to name a few.  Shortly thereafter, dubious holdouts at the FCC surrendered, clearing the way for adoption of the rule.
<p>Will the rule do what it's supposed to do?  Writing in the <i>Weekly Standard, American Spectator</i> media critic James Bowman observes, "The truth that everybody really does know, but doesn't quite say, is this:  TV, whether 'commercial' or 'educational,' isn't good for you. . . .  At best, television is light entertainment."  So-called educational television, notes Bowman, may only be marginally more beneficial to children than entertainment programming.  The skeptical critic argues that if contemporary children "have no intellectual context in which to place the constant stream of moving images, [they] will never gain anything of any educational use from it."
<p>First amendment expert Robert Corn-Revere, a partner at Hogan & Hartson and adjunct professor at Catholic University's law school, offers a second and more severe argument against a programming quota.  He notes that "no court has ever upheld a specific programming mandate by the FCC."  "Compelling speech is no different than censorship," adds Corn-Revere, who sees the three-hours-a-week proposal as further evidence that there is "less sensitivity" to constitutional concerns at the FCC these days.

<h3>Center for Media Education</h3>
The Center for Media Education is a leading proponent of children's television mandates.  Headed by Jeff Chester, CME is the "designated successor to Action for Children's Television," a nonprofit founded by Peggy Charren, a longtime crusader against television advertising.  CME organized a coalition of groups that called for a mandate of at least one hour per day of educational programming.  
<p>CME has also received wide notice for its work to protect children from what it calls "exploitive media industry practices."  With major funding from the philanthropic Carnegie Corporation of New York, CME launched "Action for Children in Cyberspace" to fight "over-commercialization" and "manipulative forms of advertising."  Pursuing Charren's anti-commercialism theme, it has proposed new rules to restrict what it sees as "deceptive and unfair advertising practices" on the internet.
<p>Founded in 1991, CME has cultivated the concept of "electronic redlining," the notion that unless government and nonprofits intervene to protect the public interest the information highway will bypass the poor and minorities.  Along with CFA, it seeks to "protect consumers from price gouging and other abuses on new telephone and TV systems."  CME has called on the FCC to adopt special rates for nonprofits.
<p>CME has received funding from the Annie E. Casey, Maximilian E. & Marion O Hoffman, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, and Nathan Cummings foundations, and the Pew Charitable Trusts.
<p>
<a name="media"></a>
<h3>Media Access Project</h3>
The furthest left of the telecom nonprofit activists is the Media Access Project.  MAP got its start fighting on behalf of the FCC's fairness doctrine, which was supposed to provide equal time for alternative views.  While the fairness doctrine was also supported by some conservative groups (it was significantly repealed in the 1980s), MAP regarded it as a means to "open the networks to anti-war and civil rights activists."  Focused mainly on broadcast and cable, MAP supports government rules that promote minority and female ownership of telecom industries and policies that insure "access for divergent points of view and alternate artistic perspectives."  MAP shares office space in Washington, D.C. with People for the American Way, and the two groups work closely together.
<p>Like the Consumer Federation of America and People for the American Way, MAP is motivated by hostility toward free enterprise.  It wants to impose greater public interest requirements on broadcasters such as "free" airtime for political candidates.  It also favors regulations to restrict the concentration of ownership in the mass media, and it has criticized recent Baby Bell mergers.
<p>MAP opposes attempts to restrict indecent programming.  It attacked a 1992 law that encouraged cable TV operators to ban indecent programming on public access channels.  MAP Executive Director Andrew J. Schwartzman accused the legislation's sponsor, North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms of "trying to get cable operators to do the government's bidding."  Likewise, MAP joined a bevy of other parties, including the ACLU and People for the American Way, in challenging a 1995 Circuit Court ruling upholding limits on the hours during which indecent programming may be broadcast on TV.  The Supreme Court declined to review the lower court decision.
<p>MAP actually agrees, to a limited extent, with many conservatives on the issue of digital spectrum.  Conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation, as well as Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole, argue that the lucrative digital spectrum should be auctioned off rather than given to broadcasters as currently planned.  MAP opposes the idea of a corporate "give away," but not out of any desire to privatize the radio spectrum.  Instead, it wants to extort nonprofit giveaways.  It proposes that a portion of the money raised through auctions be diverted for "public purposes" like children's programming or public broadcasting — or to "fund nonprofit access to advanced telecommunications networks."
<p>Alternatively, MAP would have the FCC require broadcasters to reserve part of their frequencies for nonprofits or agree to carry additional "public programming" in exchange for the digital spectrum licenses which they want so desperately. 
<p>MAP has received funding from the Nathan Cummings Foundation and the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation.

<h3>The New Luddites</h3>
In the past decade communications has become the most dynamic sector of our economy.  The little-understood and as yet largely unimplemented Telecommunications Act of 1996 could arguably be the most significant piece of legislation passed by Congress in a long time.  It presents endless opportunities for growth and prosperity.  But like the Luddites of old, there are those eager to block change.  Fearing technology, or more accurately, fearing the loss of established political power that new technologies always undermine, they stand in the way.

Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole has proposed a charity tax credit, which will allow taxpayers to earmark a portion of their taxes ($500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for couples) to private and religious charities that spend over 75 percent of their money on poverty relief.  Dole said it would give Americans the choice of giving their money "to Big Government, or to Big Brothers and Big Sisters."

<h2>The Transportation Lobby: The Politics of Highway and Transit</h2>
<P>
<I><B>Social Engineers Compete with Special Interests in Drive
for Highway Dollars<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
by Peter Samuel
<P>
As anyone who drives to work knows, America's transportation policy
is in gridlock. Long steered by local interests, it is now hobbled
by the additional pestilence of an anti-growth ideology hostile
to roads and cars. As usual, taxpayers are the losers. New technologies
and privatization show promising potential. But transportation
lobbies have joined forces with environmentalists to stall innovative
efforts to relieve the nation's congested highways.
<P>
The automobile is an intensely ideological object. For the political
right, it is a symbol of freedom, fun and individual self-expression.
For the political left, it epitomizes consumerist excess and is
responsible for suburban sprawl, white flight, urban blight, and
the decline of community spirit. In <I>End of the Road: From World
Car Crisis to Sustainable Transportation</I>, author Wolfgang
Zuckerman sums up the view from the Left, declaring cars &quot;an
unchecked menace . . . to our hapless planet.&quot; Most Americans,
however, acclaim and even romanticize modern technology's greatest
contribution to individual mobility. Little wonder, then, that
political ideologues who are troubled by this development want
to restrict the free range of automobiles and seek public transportation
alternatives that organize mobility to achieve larger social goals.
As in the areas of energy and the environment, transportation
has become a target for Washington-based advocacy groups eager
to shape public policy.
<P>
But political advocacy tactics are also used by those whose livelihood
depends on America's love of cars. The highway lobbies have little
ideology beyond &quot;more roads,&quot; but they too see tax funding
as the only way to support their concrete interests.
<P>
<B>Cars Need Roads</B>
<P>
During the third quarter of this century America's cities were
substantially reshaped by an extraordinary spasm of gas-tax financed
highway construction. From 1957 through much of the 1960s state
highway authorities built an average of 2,000 miles of freeway
each year, a third of it in urban areas, in what has been rightly
called the largest public works program in world history. Ninety
percent of interstate freeway funding came from the federal government.
The hectic pace of early interstate construction was driven by
single-minded highway engineer technocrats; neither prices, costs,
nor alternative agendas entered their mental world.
<P>
Highway proponents brushed aside their early and feeble adversaries
the gas stations, motels, and small businesses bypassed by the
new freeways. But then liberals began to agitate. They complained
that aid to education and slum clearance deserved priority over
new highways. Urban freeways were especially controversial because
they required structural demolition. Fearful of losing battles
to anti-highway groups, highway planners looked for ways to appease
potential opponents. They came to accept in principle government
&quot;comprehensive planning&quot; of transportation and urban
land use and learned to adapt to federal oversight.
<P>
In 1973 the Nixon administration supported legislation that for
the first time allowed federal highway funds to be used for mass
transit projects. Washington, D.C. led the nation away from city
freeways. Other cities like Boston, San Francisco, and New York
City quickly followed. The highway lobby, apparently assuming
that tax revenues were limitless, shortsightedly supported federal
subsidies for rail, subway and bus transit systems, arguing that
they would complement highways.
<P>
The result? A national transportation lobby was created in Washington,
D.C. Once dedicated simply to more federal pork-barrel spending,
its appetites are beginning to change. The transportation lobby
increasingly represents the concerns of the social planners and
activists who voice a new ideology hostile to growth and concerned
about &quot;limits&quot; and &quot;sustainability.&quot;
<P>
Yet at least some of the ambitions of the new planning elite are
being thwarted: witness the overturn of the national 55 mile-per-hour
speed limit. In addition, federal spending cutbacks have targetted
transit more than highways in the FY1996 budget. Besides financial
pressures, the conservative political revolution is reviving entrepreneurial
alternatives to the transportation &quot;public works&quot; pork-barrel
and technological innovations are undermining the bicycle-to-work
ideologues. One all-but-forgotten American tradition the private
toll road has been rediscovered.
<P>
<B>Hey, Big Spender</B> 
<P>
Over $900 billion is spent annually in the United States on surface
road and rail transportation. It is not surprising, then, that
transportation looms large in federal handouts, or that there
is a formidable transportation lobby in Washington, D.C. Transportation
lobbies ranked second in campaign contributions $23 million to
Congressional candidates in 1994, exceeded only by labor unions.
<P>
Transportation funding is the purest political &quot;pork&quot;
for any congressman's district. News reports regularly cite Senator
Robert Byrd (D-WV) for his ability to bring huge dollops of highway
funding to West Virginia through arcane parliamentary maneuvers.
Byrd's colleague Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) is affectionately known
as &quot;Senator Pothole&quot; for the deftness with which he
delivers transportation bacon to his constituents. And in central
Pennsylvania, Route 220 is named &quot;Bud Shuster Highway&quot;
after the heroic efforts of Representative E.G. (Bud) Shuster
(R-PA) in securing funds for bringing an interstate-style freeway
spur 25 miles north from the state Turnpike to the town of Altoona
(population 51,000). Ann Eppard, a longtime administrative assistant
to Rep. Shuster was in the news recently for her success as a
lobbyist. Ms. Eppard has signed up Federal Express, Amtrak, American
Road and Transportation Builders Association and other prominent
members of the &quot;transportation lobby&quot; apparently on
the basis of her access to Rep. Shuster and her intimate knowledge
of how the Congress does transportation business. Conveniently,
Ms. Eppard retains her position as Rep. Shuster's Washington fundraiser,
according to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
The largest portion of the nation's transportation account is
spent privately on automobiles and freight. But the huge amount
controlled by governments is caught up in politics, lobbying and
advocacy.
<P>
Government spends over $70 billion annually on roads. By contrast,
the nationwide operating expense for transit train, subway and
bus transportation is a smaller but not insignificant $18 billion.
Only a little more than a third of this amount is covered by commuter
fares. Nearly two-thirds comes from taxes. At least until the
1994 elections, government spending on public transit has been
considered politically correct, with transit spending preferred
to highway spending: i.e., cars are bad, rail is good. Federal
grants for transit construction and equipment purchases have been
rapidly expanding from $3.0 billion in 1990 to $4.6 billion in
fiscal 1995.
<P>
Do motorists pay their way? This question is at the center of
many arguments over government transportation policy. The American
Public Transit Association (APTA), the chief lobbyist for the
transit systems, argues that motorists gain some $345 billion
in benefits while paying $44 billion in taxes, a net $301 billion
public windfall. However, highway interests, organized by lobby
groups such as the Highway Users Federation and the American Automobile
Association, calculate that motorists are net losers by $38 billion
annually, paying motoring-related taxes of $114 billion for only
$76 billion in road services.
<P>
Whatever the correct calculations, transportation economists agree
that there are major inefficiencies and inequities in the highway
and vehicle financing system. Some trucks and rush-hour commuters
pay too little. Light trucks and non-rush-hour motorists pay too
much. This is hardly surprising. Concentrated benefits, diffused
costs is an axiom of politics. Factions with a large and concentrated
interest in policy matters will tend to prevail over members of
the general public, who individually have a relatively small interest
and no way to voice it.
<P>
<B>The Song of the Open Road</B> 
<P>
For an illustration of the transportation lobby, consider the
trucking industry. It is represented by the American Trucking
Associations (ATA), a nonprofit 501(c)(6) trade group that provides
representation at the federal level for a federation of fifty
state associations. ATA has a budget of $35 million, a staff of
300, and an array of spinoff subsidiaries:
<UL>
<LI>TruckPAC, its political action committee;
<LI>The ATA Litigation Center, a non-profit law firm;
<LI>The ATA Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) research and education unit;
<LI>Team 2000, a grassroots network;
<LI>Deliver USA, an educational and publicity outfit;
<LI>TransSat, a satellite-based trucking broadcasting and news
service;
<LI>and the ATA Federation, which brings other industry transportation
groups within its compass.
</UL>

<P>
ATA successfully lobbied last year for passage of the National
Highway System (NHS) bill, which makes nearly 170,000 miles of
road eligible for federal aid. ATA President Thomas J. Donohue
also demands protection of the Highway Trust Fund from diversion
to &quot;non-highway purposes such as Amtrak and mass transit
funding.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Diversion&quot; is the term that the highway lobbies use
when they fight battles for taxpayers' money. The Highway Trust
Fund, created by legislation in 1956, is the U.S. Treasury account
from which money is drawn for federal highway aid. Its most spectacular
accomplishment was the completion of the Interstate Highway System,
first mapped in 1947. Current efforts to defend the Fund from
raids by transit and Amtrak are not new.
<P>
But the Highway Trust Fund, like the Social Security Trust Fund,
is a fiction. A real trust fund has a dedicated set of objectives
and independent trustees who control it. The so-called Highway
Trust Fund is merely a Treasury account drawn on annually as Congress
sees fit through the appropriations process. Since the 1970s,
federal government highway funds have been used for transit projects,
a &quot;diversion&quot; of funds that was regularized in 1983
when a separate Mass Transit Account was established within the
Highway Trust Fund. In this way, taxpayers' monies are used not
for highway expansion and improvement, but to fulfill the social
engineer's dream of remaking America. The image of a small north
European country where commuters happily walk or peddle to the
local tram terminal for their morning ride to work comes to mind.
<P>
<B>Toll Roads: Pay-As-You-Go or Highway Robbery?</B> 
<P>
How inevitable is the battle of special interests over public
highway funds? One alternative may be private toll roads, which
recently have been rediscovered by policymakers. Toll roads can
alleviate traffic congestion, spur economic development, and answer
commuter complaints without resort to the massive expenditure
of public funds. Financially strapped practical politicians are
begining to vie to be seen at toll road ribbon-cutting ceremonies.
And federal and state legislation on private toll roads is not
as obstructive as it once was. Despite continued resistance from
highway departments and interest groups, attitudes toward toll
roads are changing in the 1990s.
<P>
There has been bipartisan political support for the investor-owned
Virginia Dulles Greenway and for California's State Route 91 Express
Lane, the world's first all-electronic toll facility, which has
no cash collection plaza. Opened on December 27, it is the first
toll facility to be based on congestion relief pricing: $2.50
toll in rush hour, 25 cents off-peak.
<P>
The California state government is negotiating with private interests
for two additional major toll roads that are likely to be built
in southern California before the end of the decade. Similar projects
are being considered in Richmond, Virginia; the Seattle-Tacoma
area; and in Michigan. Government-built toll roads have opened
in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, California and Texas during
the 1990s.
<P>
State turnpikes with revenues of $5 billion annually are ripe
for privatization if free enterprise-inclined state governments
opt for reform. And private toll roads are being built internationally
in Canada, Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Thailand, Taiwan, China and Australia.
<P>
The rediscovery of the toll road may be largely a product of the
budget crunch, but toll roads should encourage policymakers to
recognize that transportation policy does not have to centered
in Washington. In fact, initial construction of what now constitutes
the Interstate Highway System was primarily a series of state
undertakings that began in earnest without major federal aid.
California and other western states relied on state gasoline taxes.
Other states financed highway construction through tolls imposed
by state highway departments or state-established turnpike or
tollroad commissions. They borrowed construction money from the
capital markets on the security of the future stream of revenues
that tolls would generate.
<P>
But tollways have been unpopular. Highway toll charges are visible
and irksome when motorists have to wait in line to pay. Consequently,
there is a ready constituency for `freeing' highways: This has
occurred on Connecticut I-95 and its parkways, I-30 between Dallas
and Fort Worth, Route 36 between Denver and Boulder, and I-95
from Richmond to Petersburg. Moreover, tolls' visibility put them
at a disadvantage to the invisibility of the gas tax, which is
simply added to the price of gasoline at the pump, unlike most
other consumer goods. Toll roads have thus been handicapped in
the battle for consumer opinion. The introduction in 1990 of electronic
tolling, however, has removed a major obstacle to their popular
acceptance.
<P>
<B>The Highway Lobby</B> 
<P>
But toll roads are also opposed by a formidable array of advocacy
organizations. Foremost among them are The American Automobile
Association, the American Highway Users Alliance, and the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
<P>
The American Automobile Association (AAA) has always adamantly
opposed toll roads and called for &quot;free&quot; public roads.
Founded in 1902, the famed AAA, along with the farmers' National
Grange, was instrumental in the passage of the Federal Highway
Acts of 1916 and 1921. This legislation established the policy
that public roads should be planned nationally by an independent
federal agency, the Bureau of Public Roads.
<P>
AAA is a huge non-profit: it has 38 million members, 113 state
and regional clubs, and 37,000 fulltime staff in the U.S. and
Canada. A nonprofit but fully taxable corporation without stockholders,
AAA, in effect, establishes its state and regional clubs as franchises
with which it has various confidential revenue-sharing arrangements.
AAA's 34 million U.S. members pay an average fee of $30. It claims
to be the largest publisher of travel material in the world. Further,
it generated $2 billion in 1994 travel agency sales, has 3.8 million
AAA/Visa and Mastercard holders, and contracts with over 13,000
local garages to provide emergency road services to members.
<P>
AAA's government affairs office in Washington, D.C. has a staff
of 12. Its headquarters staff of 1,000 is in Orlando, Florida,
ironically probably the most heavily turnpiked city in the world.
<P>
The Highway Users Federation is another influential lobby that
favors the maximum construction of untolled roads. HUF was established
by General Motors in 1932 on the not unreasonable assumption that
healthy GM auto sales required plenty of roads.
<P>
Renamed the American Highway Users Alliance at the end of 1995,
this 501(c)(6) trade organization is backed by the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association, the American Trucking Associations,
and the American Petroleum Institute. AHUA is directed by William
Fay, who previously headed the Product Liability Coordinating
Committee, a tort reform group. It has about 500 corporate and
invididual members, a $2 million budget, and a staff of 12 in
its Washington, D.C. headquarters.
<P>
The most influential highway lobby, however, is the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), a 501(c)(3)
with a current annual budget of $14 million. AASHTO represents
all 50 state highway and transportation agencies and several regional
agencies that build federally-funded roads and transit systems.
Headed since 1980 by Francis Francois, a patent attorney and former
Maryland county politician, AASHTO has a Washington staff of fifty.
<P>
AASHTO's relations with federal roads agencies have been almost
incestuous. The federal government's Bureau of Public Roads (BPR)
was a full member of the organization for many years and BPR's
long-serving chief, Thomas H. MacDonald (1919-1953), was a fanatical
hater of tolls. These sentiments echo in the Federal Highway Administration,
BPR's successor agency, which, in its 1976 bicentennial history
of American highways, referred to the toll promoter as a &quot;highway
parasite&quot; seeking a &quot;stranglehold&quot; on travel and
commerce.
<P>
<B>The New Road Warriors</B> 
<P>
Before new and technologically-efficient toll roads become an
answer to rush-hour gridlock, one other political hurdle must
be overcome. The old highway interest groups are forming alliances
with public transit advocates. Since 1990, the major barrier to
new highways has been the Clean Air Act. It gives the EPA virtual
veto power over new highway construction. Under pressure, the
highway builders have begun to work with transit groups.
<P>
Symbolizing this change, highway lobby groups have added the &quot;T&quot;
for Transportation to their names: AASHO is now AASHTO. The contractors'
lobby, the American Road Builders Association (ARBA), is now ARTBA.
And the Institute of Traffic Engineers became the Institute of
Transportation Engineers.
<P>
As the highwaymen scramble to re-position themselves, mass transit
has placed its lobbying power in the American Public Transit Association
(APTA). Another 501 (c)(6) trade association, APTA's $12 million
budget comes from some 500 transit agencies around the country
and from the private companies that sell them equipment and services.
APTA's staff of 70 is housed in an office not far from Metro Center,
Washington D.C.'s busiest subway stop. It can claim considerable
credit for influencing the flow of federal transit appropriations,
its top priority.
<P>
APTA has financed a major grassroots campaign, Transit NOW, that
stages rallies and telephone and letter-writing campaigns to sway
members of Congress in transit-dependent districts. Linked to
organized commuter groups, APTA can mobilize the grassroots in
political contests. Its press relations are excellent: it offers
a regular fax service to correspondents and a well-produced weekly
newspaper.
<P>
<B>Progressive Transportation</B> 
<P>
The Surface Transportation Policy Project (STPP) is the latest
special interest entry in the struggle for public funds. Just
as advocates of &quot;progressive philanthropy&quot; want to replace
traditional charity workers with 
social activists, so also do a new breed of transportation policy
experts aim to replace fact-and-figures transportation technocrats.
STPP is a 501(c)(3) group of environmentalists, Naderites, urban
planners and public transit proponents that seeks to tighten enforcement
of the Clean Air Act and to increase transit's share of federal
highway funds. These funds, totalling an incredible $151 billion,
are currently authorized under the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA, or, as it is called, &quot;Ice-tea.&quot;)
<P>
A coalition of over 100 groups without formal membership, STPP
has a $3 million annual budget which supports a staff of ten.
Its steering committee includes representatives of the National
Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, National Wildlife
Federation, Citizen Action, American Public Transit Association,
AARP, the Bicycle Federation, and assorted energy conservation
groups, architects and preservationists.
<P>
STPP's well-argued publications reflect the convictions of policy
ideologues who are more committed to `taming' highways than to
building them. By contrast, the highway lobbies publish materials
that reflect what one researcher has called the tendency of the
highway business to be dominated by engineers from blue-collar,
small-town backgrounds without the education or experience to
fight ideological political warfare.
<P>
STPP's founder and director is Hank Dittmar, former chief lobbyist
for the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
Most of its funding comes from the Nathan Cummins Foundation,
the Energy Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the James C. Penney
Foundation and the Surdna Foundation.
<P>
<B>The New Ideology of Transportation</B> 
<P>
By the late 1990s, highway agencies that once proudly extolled
the benefits of new road construction have been reduced to subsidiaries
of transportation departments dedicated to &quot;transportation
demand management,&quot; or TDM as it is known. TDM is an off-shoot
of environmentalist concepts such as &quot;demand side management&quot;
and &quot;integrated resource planning&quot; that first appeared
in energy policy. Under this philosophy electric utilities, for
instance, are supposed to invest in &quot;negawatts&quot; rather
than megawatts: they are encouraged to promote conservation measures
to <I>reduce</I> energy demand. These buzz words embody the policymaker's
conviction that a well-functioning economy should suppress demand
rather than expand supply. They represent a repudiation of consumer
sovereignty and free markets.
<P>
The TDM ideology of &quot;limits&quot; is apparent in government
transportation programs with titles like ECO (employee commute
options), ETR (employee trip reduction), HOV (high occupancy vehicles-only)
lanes, and carpool propaganda and subsidization. Transportation
departments now tout the special virtues of bicycling, telecommuting,
and riding transit. They insinuate that auto use, especially single
driver auto use, reflects greed, consumer ostentation and insensitivity
to civic virtue. The form of transportation you use is no longer
a private preference. It represents a social morality. The supposed
&quot;imbalance&quot; in the auto/highway system is blamed for
urban &quot;sprawl&quot; i.e. low-density detached housing and
shopping malls and for the decline of central city neighborhoods,
crime, pollution, even global warming.
<P>
Transportation has thus become another battleground in which those
with &quot;the vision of the anointed,&quot; in Thomas Sowell's
felicitous phrase, war with the benighted masses besotted with
cars.
<P>
Few areas of daily life affect people more than transportation.
And few areas are more in need of serious reform. The first step
is realizing that the solution will not be found in perpetuating
government's current monopoly in roads. Rather, it will be found
in new technology and in privatization efforts that are just now
showing signs of catching on in America. As always, this will
entail battling a host of entrenched forces, who, because of interest
and ideology, can be counted on to defend the status quo. 
<P>
<br>
<I>The author, Peter Samuel of Frederick Maryland, has written
about transportation issues for numerous publications. He recently
prepared a report on highway privatization for the Cato Institute.</I>

<h2>Campaign for Human Development Part II: The Chicago Story</h2>
By Scott Weinberg
<P>
<I>Editor's note: In <a href="/crc/trends/ot-0995.html">September</a>, we reported on the worsening problems
of the Campaign for Human Development, the U.S. Catholic bishops'
anti-poverty crusade, whose help for the poor is compromised by
its support for discredited welfare policies and the 60s era activists
who promote them. As last month's issue went to press, CHD supporters
were gathering in Chicago to celebrate the organization's 25th
anniversary. Scott Weinberg, co-author of our September report,
attended the conference and reports on what he saw.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<br>
On August 25-28, over 2,000 activists descended on the posh Hyatt
Regency in Chicago. They came to celebrate the 25th anniversary
of the Campaign for Human Development to meet old friends and
make new connections, in short, to tell their stories. Over the
course of the weekend the conference participants learned new
ways to raise money, discussed how to expand their constituent
bases, and familiarized themselves with the latest organizing
techniques. They heard from academics, reporters, prelates, and
professionals in the politics of protest. They networked, debated
future strategies, and discussed their vision of social justice.
<P>
The event was not unlike other gatherings of liberal activists
except for one thing. This conference was arranged by a program
run by America's Catholic bishops.
<P>
<B>Grassroots Leadership</B> 
<P>
In the atrium, clusters of participants reclined in marbled porticoes
before the opening reception in the Grand Ballroom. Here, I met
Naomi Swinton, who invited me to her fundraiser. Swinton is a
gay and lesbian rights activist for Grassroots Leadership, a CHD-funded
group from North Carolina.
<P>
CHD provided $25,000 to Grassroots Leadership in 1994. As we noted
last month, the North Carolina-based group promotes environmentalism,
abortion rights, homosexual rights, and sundry other liberal causes.
According to its own literature (distributed at the CHD conference),
Grassroots Leadership &quot;works closely with . . . all major
southern movements and organizations, including civil rights,
women, labor, lesbian and gay, environment, peace and religious
action.&quot;
<P>
Swinton is typical of many of the participants. She explains that,
though she has not had that much experience with Catholics, she
hopes CHD can transform what she sees as an autocratic Church.
&quot;I would like to see [CHD] to continue to work on the Catholic
Church . . . presenting a progressive Catholic voice in America.&quot;
<P>
Grassroots Leadership, Swinton explains, is working against &quot;the
right-wing, reactionary, Christian Right&quot; and especially
against Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), who she considers &quot;.
. . one of the most racist politicians in the Congress.&quot;
<P>
Why should a program of the U.S. Catholic bishops, supported by
parishioners' donations to the collection plate, support Grassroots
Leadership? Indeed, even some recipients of CHD benefactions seemed
pleasantly surprised by CHD grantmaking. Duke Schempp, a pro-choice
Catholic and president of a CHD-funded organization in North Dakota,
remarked following Kahn's workshop, &quot;I hear a lot of people
talk in the hallways . . . `My God! I can't believe they're funding
that here!' And these are the constituents of the CHD!&quot; He
concluded, &quot;I hope CHD encourages groups to get out of the
church, because if people knew what social justice was, they wouldn't
be sticking money in the collection every year.&quot;
<P>
(Schempp noted that the chairman of his organization works at
an abortion clinic. &quot;It makes it a little tense when it comes
to doing something with the diocese,&quot; he said.)
<P>
<B>The Politics of Envy </B>
<P>
Several recurring themes punctuated the conference. The arguments
and rhetoric of class warfare were particularly in evidence, and
nowhere was the language of envy and resentment more articulate
than in Cornel West's keynote speech at Saturday's &quot;Interactive
Plenary Session.&quot;
<P>
West is a professor of religion and African-American studies at
Harvard University. The topic of his speech was &quot;A Current
Socio-Political-Economic Analysis.&quot; The following are excerpts:
<P>
&quot;. . . anytime you talk about poverty in America, you also
have to come to terms with the pernicious and vicious legacy of
White Supremacy . . . and you begin to hit up against issues of
patriarchy, insubordination, and wealth . . . We are living in
one of the most frightening and terrifying moments in the history
of the nation. . . .
<P>
&quot;And believe you me, there will never be enough police and
prisons to deal with the avalanche of despair . . . There's no
serious talk about the fact that one percent of the population
owns 48 percent of the financial wealth. That sounds oligarchic,
plutocratic . . . pigmentocratic . . . The ultimate logic of a
market economy is the gangsterization of culture . . . The marketplace
. . . is an extension of the laissez-white supremacy . . . Same
as those with homophobia, keeping trapped the humanity of gay
brothers and lesbian sisters.&quot;
<P>
West, an increasingly well-known public speaker, recently joined
other celebrities and Hollywood leftists like Ed Asner and Whoopi
Goldberg to rally support for convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal.
In an open and shut case, Jamal was convicted and sentenced to
death for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel
Faulkner, who was found with a bullet in his back and another
between his eyes.
<P>
Although it took the jury less than four hours to convict Jamal
of first degree murder, the case has oddly become a cause celebre
for extremists seeking to rekindle the passions of the 1960s.
They now claim that the &quot;mediagenic&quot; Jamal, a former
radio commentator and militant activist, was framed. West has
even compared him to Martin Luther King.
<P>
The third world rhetoric of haves and have-nots was not limited
to Cornel West. Bertha Lewis of Brooklyn ACORN, the radical community-action
group, echoed West's revolutionary rhetoric: &quot;You gotta continue
to organize! `Cuz I'm gonna tell ya the rich and those other folks
[in Congress] CHD can be the foundation for poor people to be
organized in this country, to overcome these walls and bring the
money down!&quot; Rudolph T. Juarez, president of the CHD-funded
Quad Cities Interfaith in Davenport, Iowa, concurred, &quot;Whoever
has the money has the power.&quot; &quot;Endemic to human society
[is that] the big guy has all the power and authority . . . so
what we try to do is spread it around a bit more,&quot; said Juarez.
<P>
<B>Sin and the Republican Contract</B> 
<P>
The absence of diversity was another hallmark of the conference.
Participants were overwhelmingly left-liberal. They shared an
implacable belief in the ability of government to cure society's
ills. And they were united in their enmity toward conservatives,
the Republican Congress and, especially, House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
<P>
Pablo Eisenberg, executive director of the Center for Community
Change, a sort of roundhouse for leftist activists, went furthest
in his attacks on conservatives. In an interview with me, Eisenberg
branded conservatives in Congress as &quot;anti-American, anti-people,
anti-democratic . . . anti-Christian and anti-faith; intolerant,
bigoted.&quot; To him, CHD is &quot;an attack on all the conservative
values the Christian coalition claims it has.&quot; Later, he
added the observation that the Pope is too conservative, and that
&quot;If there was a progressive Pope, everything in the CHD would
be fine.&quot;
<P>
Even discounting a speaker's flattery of his hosts, Eisenberg,
a veteran activist-organizer and Washington fixture, acknowledged
CHD's strategic importance: He observed that without CHD funds
&quot;more than half of the organizing in this country would not
be taking place.&quot;
<P>
At a reception on Friday, Ray Schomaker from the Communities United
for Action in Cincinnati commented that the Contract With America
only &quot;favors the rich and shuts out the poor. That's the
complete antithesis of what we're all about here.&quot; Sister
Marion Dillon, the CHD diocesan director for the Philadelphia
archdiocese, said: &quot;Most people here are against the Contract
for America because Newt Gingrich's contract puts a hold on all
that CHD is trying to accomplish.&quot; Chicago ACORN activist
Sammie Sim told me that Newt Gingrich wants to starve children.
<P>
Such fevered personal attacks were common. In another interview,
Kathleen Sherred, an activist from the CHD-funded Mon Valley Unemployed
Committee in Pennsylvania, charged that Senator Rick Santorum
(R-PA) &quot;isn't Catholic. He thinks that if you were born poor
it's your fault . . . Santorum is against the spirit of CHD. Anyone
but God can fall. Santorum thinks he is God and he will fall.&quot;
<P>
I met Pat O'Bryan, Catholic Social Action Director from Cleveland,
Ohio, on Saturday evening just before the Gala dinner. &quot;Republican
defense spending is up,&quot; said the affable and idealistic
O'Bryan, &quot;but they're balancing the budget at the expense
of social programs to the detriment of the poor.&quot; 
O'Bryan describes Newt Gingrich as &quot;a right-wing intellectual
and demagogue. I think he buys his stuff so well then couches
it in intellectual terms that it's almost a fundamentalist faith.
He's like a fighting dog. He knows just where to bite . . . After
Newt has destroyed the Democrats, it's up to people like us to
find a third way.&quot;
<P>
Returning from an ACORN rally, I came across Andres Sarabia, a
CHD diocesan director from Texas. Speaking with me outside the
hotel, he argued that &quot;CHD helps community organizing provide
the forum, the legitimacy, for anger.&quot; If guilt often goads
the conscience of the liberal upper-middle class philanthropist,
arguably anger motivates the activist. And Sarabia is angry at
conservatives: &quot;The Republicans are saying to young families,
`you don't have a job, that's your fault; you're uneducated, that's
your fault; you don't have a place to live, that's your fault.'
They put all the blame on young families, but society doesn't
take the blame for nothing. What they are saying is that you don't
matter. You're insignificant in our master plan, our contract
on America.&quot;
<P>
Society is at fault and must accept responsibility: this is a
hallmark of CHD thinking and explains the group's emphasis on
collective blame over individual responsibility. The view was
elaborated by Ernesto Cortez, head of the Southwest district of
the Industrial Areas Foundation, a major recipient of CHD money
and the organization founded in Chicago in 1940 by the late Saul
Alinsky, the father of community organizing. Speaking with fervor
and zeal during a Sunday panel discussion, Cortez, the organizer's
organizer, argued that Catholics will have to atone for the sins
of the Republicans: &quot;I'm reminded that all of us as Catholics
are going to have some explaining to do on Judgment Day . . .
when we look at the folks [in Congress] that we gotta explain.
Because unfortunately, our responsibility isn't just individual.&quot;
<P>
In coarse tones, the balding activist added, &quot;We're going
to have to explain as a people, as a community, as a Church, what
we did about these folks. Because Phil Gramm didn't get elected
by an act of God. Dick Armey didn't get appointed by the pontiff.
Tom DeLay didn't just happen. He didn't come out of the head of
Zeus . . . although he's a pretty dumb fellow. I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to say anything people would take offense at. But I didn't
think anyone would take offense at my referring to Tom DeLay as
cognitively challenged.&quot;
<P>
Those who vote for Republicans may not commit a sin, but clearly
it is a sin not to do everything possible to prevent them from
doing so.
<P>
<B>Radical Religion, Imperialism, and Sister Lucy</B> 
<P>
It is unlikely that those with non-traditional views of the Church
itself would feel anything but at ease at the conference. CHD
has often been criticized for giving free rein to advocates of
liberation theology. Participants at the conference were open
about their support for liberation theology and quick to criticize
the so-called institutional church.
<P>
Pat O'Bryan looks to the third world for the answer: &quot;We're
going to find our consciences, our sense, soul, and mind in the
third world . . . Europe is thrashing about; they've gone right-wing
too.&quot; &quot;The CHD in the U.S. and the whole world does
what liberation theology does in Central America. . . .&quot;
Louann Shea from Catholic Charities in Chicago, whom I met in
the hotel lobby, offered the opinion, &quot;My view on poverty
is that when the Church crumbles, and it will, all that's left
are individuals standing on their own two feet.&quot;
<P>
In many cases, CHD conference-goers were critical of what they
see as the autocratic nature of the Church. Often they questioned
fundamental matters of faith on issues such

as the ordination of women. Jan Valder, a former CHD national
committee member who served on the celebration's Educational Moment
Committee, sees CHD transforming &quot;both society and the Church.&quot;
She would like the Pope to be &quot;a little different on women's
issues. Women don't have an equal role in the Church. If you look
at the institution without talking about ordination but you could
talk about that, too.&quot; She is critical of the Church's &quot;overwhelming
male-centeredness.&quot;
<P>
Sister Marion Dillon opines that &quot;Women priests will come
after a married clergy, but not in John Paul II's lifetime.&quot;
She notes that a lot of the people at the celebration oppose the
Pope because he is considered too conservative.
<P>
In short, what the British call &quot;loony-leftism&quot; permeated
the conference. In the exhibit area, I came across an elderly
nun peddling &quot;Lucy's cards&quot;: greeting cards with themes
blending environmental mysticism with feminism: &quot;. . . see
woman whom I have ordained;&quot; &quot;earth mother . . . goddess
mother . . . Sophia spirit breath of the Holy Jesus Son of Mary;&quot;
&quot;praise our goddess in her universe.&quot; The cards are
the creation of Sister Lucy, a Dominican nun from Racine, Wisconsin.
<P>
The moderator at a session titled &quot;Catholic Social Teachings
101&quot; asked participants to provide examples of &quot;structural
sin.&quot; Said one participant, &quot;I was thinking in terms
of structural sin when `imperialism' was written [on the board].
I would say that structurally we are part of a system that exploits
third world countries . . . That's a part of our government. .
. .&quot;
<P>
Another participant offered: &quot;Imperialism is our support
of the Contras in Nicaragua. They [the Sandinistas] had the public
revolution. Our government wasn't happy with the result. We broke
international law by mining the harbors, by funding [the Contras]
when Congress agreed not to fund them . . . People like Ollie
North, and others, broke our laws.&quot;
<P>
<B>CHD and ACORN: Together Again</B> 
<P>
It wouldn't be a CHD event without a media stunt by the Association
of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). As past editions
of <I>Organization Trends</I> have noted, ACORN is a radical pressure
group well-known for its disruptive antics. ACORN chapters across
the country have greatly benefited from generous funding from
CHD.
<P>
ACORN activists from across America took advantage of the CHD
conference to &quot;do a job&quot; on Chicago's Whole Foods Grocery
Store. Calling themselves the &quot;Red Brigade&quot; and wearing
t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan &quot;ACORN &amp; CHD,&quot;
the activists boarded six buses that departed from the Hyatt for
the protest. Most were older black women led by a handful of young
white activists.
<P>
Ted Thomas, ACORN's negotiator, explained the group's objectives:
&quot;We have a hiring hall. What we want to do is make an agreement
with them that they will hire a number of people . . . from our
hiring office. The next step is to see that they get the minimum
of $7.70 what we call a living wage . . . If we hear that our
workers aren't being treated fairly or squarely, we have to go
back and put more actions on them.&quot;
<P>
Just what is wrong with Whole Foods?
<P>
According to activist Marcia Ericksen of ACORN Minnesota, &quot;The
workers are young and they don't know how to organize . . . My
impression [about Whole Foods] is that they're posing as not selling
processed foods . . . Whole Foods is a new type of market based
on the co-op model of having organic food but it's supplied to
people on a larger scale mass market than the co-op model.&quot;
The protesters expressed concern that Whole Foods could put co-ops
out of business.
<P>
Apparently, ACORN regards Whole Foods as some sort of sinister
health foods conglomerate. According to another ACORN organizer,
&quot;Whole Foods attracts the same kind of audience as co-ops
. . . They were originally hippie entrepreneurs who sold out big
to corporate management . . . They have board members in the military
establishment, but I'm not positive about that. They use new age
ideas to market old capitalistic ideas.&quot;
<P>
As usual, the facts conflict with ACORN's claims. Activists unfurled
a banner inside the store which read &quot;We Can't Survive on
$4.25,&quot; and they demanded more ethnic representation in hiring.
However, I spoke with Paul, an employee, who reports that Whole
Foods employees, most of whom are members of minority groups,
start at $7.00 per hour. The store's managers are a black male
and a white woman. The chain's regional president is Mary Kay
Hagen. Paul says that Whole Foods offers great benefits. &quot;It's
a great job.&quot;
<P>
As ACORN workers chant, &quot;A-C-O-R-N, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE WILL
RISE AGAIN,&quot; Steve, another Whole Foods employee, comments:
&quot;The public chooses. That's what makes the country what it
is. The public chooses with their shopping dollars. If the public
did not like what we were selling and where we were, then we would
not be able to survive.&quot;
<P>
Steve's comments were clear and are accepted by most Americans.
It is unfortunate that CHD does not appear to understand or accept
them. Individual freedom, choice, competition and cooperation
are implicit in Steve's off-hand description of how Whole Food's
consumers, managers, and employees relate to one another. But
they seem alien to the ACORN protesters and to the CHD program
officers who distribute the funds raised from Catholic parishioners.
<P>
In his opening address, Chicago's Archbishop Joseph Cardinal Bernardin,
honorary chairman of the CHD 25th anniversary celebration, noted
that &quot;The CHD is the church's best-kept secret.&quot; Indeed
it is.

<h2>Campaign for Human Development: Worse Than Ever
</h2>
<I><B>Anti-Poverty Program Celebrates 25 Years. Conference Features
Marxist Professor and Pro-Abortion Speakers.</B></I>
<P>
<br>
Prepared by freelance reporter Scott Weinberg
and <I>OT</i> Editor <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Pambianco">Bob Pambianco</a>
<P>
<i>Editor's Note: This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Campaign
for Human Development, the 60s-era anti-poverty program of the
American Catholic Bishops. As this issue goes to press, activists
from across America are gathering in Chicago during the last weekend
in August to celebrate the occasion and to reflect on CHD's accomplishments.
For our part, we see little to celebrate. CHD remains a source
of funds for the radical left, supporting groups and causes that
promote class division and espouse beliefs antithetical to Catholic
social teaching. In this issue, we examine some of the notables
who will address the Chicago gathering, and also focus on CHD's
activities in the Southwest. Regrettably, the picture is a dismal
one. In a later issue, we will provide an in-depth report on just
what happened at the Chicago conference.</I>
<P>
<br>
Every year at Thanksgiving time, American Catholics are called
upon to contribute to the Campaign for Human Development, the
anti-poverty program of the American Catholic bishops. Informed
that CHD is an innovative &quot;self-help&quot; program offering
the poor a hand-up not a hand-out, the faithful make generous
contributions over $230 million to CHD since its inception. What
they are not told, and what the bureaucrats at CHD do not want
them to know, is that most of CHD's money goes to support liberal
activists who use it to teach people how to organize and agitate
for more government spending programs. Even worse, CHD-funded
activists are often openly disdainful of the teachings of the
Catholic Church, whose offerings they gladly accept. This year's
collection is scheduled for the weekend of November 18-19.
<P>
<B>CHD Sociology and Theology</B> 
<P>
Far from offering an innovative approach to poverty, the Campaign
for Human Development operates on the same assumptions as Lyndon
Johnson's War on Poverty. Rather than encourage individual striving
and responsibility, CHD focuses on the so-called root causes of
poverty. Rather than offer the poor the example of success and
guidance in achieving it, CHD explains why poverty is the system's
fault and teaches how to radicalize institutions. Rather than
champion faith to challenge society's spiritual emptiness, CHD's
good news is that organizing around &quot;issues&quot; builds
coalitions and creates political power.
<P>
CHD vociferously claims to be nonpartisan, but almost all of its
activities fall on the left often the far-left side of the ideological
spectrum. CHD-funded groups invariably favor public policies that
require state intervention and decisionmaking. And they build
support for their positions by resorting to the rhetoric of class
consciousness and the tactics of social conflict.
<P>
What is worse is that CHD has established a long track record
of funding groups whose activities many Catholics would find repugnant.
CHD grantmaking guidelines essentially allow it to finance any
organization whose <I>primary</I> focus is in accord with Catholic
social and moral teaching. However, other concerns may be directly
at odds with Church teaching. Thus, what should be CHD's goal
acts instead as a disclaimer, enabling CHD to avoid responsibility
for the positions of groups it funds.
<P>
CHD claims to be a witness to Catholic social justice. But Dr.
Francois Orsini, founder of the St. Antoninus Institute for Catholic
Business in Education, observes that CHD solutions preclude genuine
Christian social action. By concentrating on tried-and-failed
methods of victimization and blame, CHD undermines the individual's
capacity for spiritual, moral and social renewal. &quot;In the
long run,&quot; Orsini concludes, &quot;the CHD is a mockery of
Catholicism that hurts rather than helps the poor.&quot;
<P>
<B>Who's Celebrating CHD? </B>
<P>
The announced line-up of speakers at CHD's August 25-28 anniversary
conference in Chicago is a social register of its radical outlook.
Among the featured luminaries are a Marxist college professor,
pro-abortion and pro-gay rights activists, and a strident opponent
of school choice.
<P>
<B>Cornel West.</B> A Harvard philosophy professor and avowed
Christian-Marxist, West regards American democracy as a bridge
between Christian revelation and Marx's dialectical materialism.
The <I>New York Times</I> describes him as &quot;a progressive
socialist in the age of triumphant capitalism&quot; and notes
that he was introduced to Marxism through his involvement with
the Black Panthers, the sixties black-power group.
<P>
In his book <I>Prophecy Deliverance!</I>, West posited that the
fate of Western civilization is in the alliance between Afro-American
religious thought and progressive Marxism. The &quot;relative
absence of progressive Marxism in American society is exacerbated
by the reluctance of American Marxism as a whole to take seriously
indigenous American radicalism . . . A distinctive virtue of progressive
Marxism linked to prophetic Christianity is the ease with which
it can cooperate with non-Marxist progressive movements.&quot;
<P>
West is an &quot;honorary chair&quot; of the Democratic Socialists
of America (DSA), a political party-turned-nonprofit lobby that
shares his yearning for a new political Left. Founded by the late
Michael Harrington, DSA operates on the premise that &quot;our
economic system places too much power in the hands of too few
people&quot; and &quot;seeks nothing less than the freeing of
the human mind and spirit through the radical restructuring of
our economic, social, and political institutions.&quot;
<P>
<B>Dolores Huerta.</B> Like West, an &quot;honorary chair&quot;
of the DSA, Huerta is co-founder and vice president of Cesar Chavez's
United Farm Workers of America. A committed abortion-rights activist,
she was a featured speaker at the National Organization for Women's
pro-abortion rally in Washington in April. An avowed feminist,
she believes that &quot;Men are taught to dominate and have power
over people&quot; and that &quot;Women are a colonized group.&quot;
Proposals to end affirmative action and reform welfare are part
of a &quot;get-back-to-the-kitchen movement,&quot; she says.
<P>
Huerta's views on abortion are incompatible with the Catholic
view of moral life and her politics are the antithesis of the
pro-life cause. She advocates taxpayer-funded abortions and opposes
even modest efforts to restrict abortion.
<P>
In 1990, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported that she was a
member of a commission set up by NOW to determine the feasibility
of establishing a third political party devoted to feminist issues,
in particular support for abortion on demand.
<P>
In 1990 Huerta was involved in an attempt to block President Bush's
motorcade, joining protestors demanding an end to United States
involvement in El Salvador and more money for AIDS. A <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> account reports that &quot;several American flags
were set fire&quot; and protesters unfurled a banner proclaiming
&quot;U.S. out of my Uterus.&quot;
<P>
<B>Bertha Lewis.</B> It is appropriate that the list of speakers
include Bertha Lewis of Brooklyn ACORN. The overtly radical ACORN
(Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) has been
a long-time and major beneficiary of CHD munificence. In 1994,
CHD provided $436,000 to fourteen ACORN groups across the country.
<P>
Accomplished in pressuring banks to finance its housing programs,
ACORN is not so much an advocacy group as a strong-arm gang. Earlier
this year, it gained notoriety for disrupting a meeting featuring
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In March, ACORN activists burst into
a meeting of the National Association of Counties just before
Gingrich was scheduled to speak, banging on lunch trays and shouting
&quot;Nuke Newt!&quot; Later, the group interrupted a House Committee
hearing <BR>
on low-income housing loans. Several ACORN leaders were arrested
and taken into custody by the Capitol Police.
<P>
The Clinton administration scrambled to deny association with
ACORN, cutting off funds to the Acorn Housing Corporation, which
had received a $1.1 million federal grant to support 42 AmeriCorps
national service volunteers. Acorn Housing Corp. unsuccessfully
argued that it was a completely separate nonprofit organization,
one which just happened to share headquarters with ACORN, and
just happened to be founded by ACORN.
<P>
<B>Winona LaDuke.</B> She is co-chair of the Indigenous Women's
Network (IWN), a Minnesota-based group that addresses the concerns
of American Indian women. Earlier this year, the group sponsored
a tour by a feminist rock-and-roll band, the Indigo Girls. Audience
members filled out protest cards and listened to nightly speeches
by LaDuke.
<P>
&quot;Our activism is definitely spiritual in nature,&quot; a
band member told the <I>San Diego Union-Tribune</I>, which noted
the Indigo Girls' support for &quot;. . . Greenpeace and assorted
abortion-rights, gun control and AIDS-relief organizations.&quot;
<P>
LaDuke is the founder of the CHD-funded ($50,000 in 1994) White
Earth Land Recovery Project (WELR). For failure to pay taxes,
the White Earth Indian tribe lost over 800,000 acres of land in
Minnesota, some of which was later acquired by the Catholic Church.
The Project is working to reacquire the land.
<P>
<B>William Greider.</B> A supporter of the methods of Saul Alinsky
and Ralph Nader, Greider is a middle-aged liberal journalist who
has found a home as political editor at <I>Rolling Stone</I>,
the magazine for middle-aged liberal fans of rock music. Greider
is an outspoken opponent of school choice programs. As assistant
managing editor of <I>The Washington Post</I>, Greider in 1981
blasted neoconservatives &quot;living proof that even intellectuals
can be dangerous&quot; for supporting school privatization efforts.
Tuition tax credits, long-supported by Catholic parents and educators,
were denounced by Greider as a racially-motivated sop to the rich
likely to wreck Washington, D.C.'s public schools, &quot;just
when they are getting their act together.&quot;
<P>
D.C. schools have never gotten their act together. The Bishops
are on record supporting the concept of school choice. But Greider
is in tune with the staff at CHD. Last year, Timothy Collins,
CHD's deputy executive director told <I>Organization Trends</I>
that CHD does not support programs promoting school choice because
it is not a &quot;poor people's&quot; issue. For his part, Greider
takes the teachers' union line that private schools deliberately
keep out the &quot;unwashed.&quot;
<P>
In <I>Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy</I>,
clearly the title for a pundit's tome, Greider proclaimed, &quot;America
has become a nation where monied interests and elite organizations
dominate the discourse and the process whereby government makes
decisions.&quot; More colloquially, in a July 1995 <I>Rolling
Stone</I> debate with P.J. O'Rourke, Greider dismissed the argument
that only individuals, not government, create wealth as &quot;silly
and flatly wrong.&quot; State power was needed to &quot;confront
the destructive side effects of capitalism&quot; and the &quot;malefactors
of great wealth.&quot;
<P>
<B>Rep. Marcy Kaptur. </B>A Democratic Congresswoman from Ohio
and former CHD national advisory committee member, Kaptur's voting
record and political career embodies CHD's swing to the left.
According to <I>The Plain Dealer</I>, a Cleveland, Ohio newspaper,
Kaptur, once a rank and file pro-lifer, now believes that &quot;The
majority of my constituents feel that government funding should
not be used to support abortion, but they recognize that families
who choose it should have the legal right to do so. I am trying
to make sure the health [care] bill reflects that.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, the National Right to Life Committee gave Kaptur a 44
(out of 100) in its scorecard of abortion-related votes in Congress.
She has voted against parental notification and for funding of
the United Nations Population Fund.
<P>
<B>Pablo Eisenberg.</B> A veteran of the War on Poverty and the
Johnson administration's Office of Economic Opportunity, Eisenberg
is the chief theorist of the community organizing concept that
informs CHD operations. He is the executive director of the Center
for Community Change (CCC) in Washington, an organization dedicated
to redistributing wealth through higher taxes and increased social
spending. Funded by a raft of liberal philanthropies, the Ford
Foundation in particular, CCC functions as a hub and clearinghouse
for thousands of community-based organizations.
<P>
The Center has helped identify new funding sources for left-wing
activists and was instrumental in creating the National Committee
for Responsive Philanthropy, itself a past recipient of CHD funds.
In 1993, <I>Organization Trends</I> called attention to the fact
that the Committee issued a major report attacking the pro-life
movement.
<P>
<B>Si Kahn. </B>Part professional activist and part singer-songwriter,
Kahn's tunes, in the words of the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>, are
&quot;anthems of social justice.&quot; The conference itinerary
lists Kahn as one of the entertainers at the event, as well as
a workshop leader.
<P>
During a 1985 show, Kahn sang a song about Senator Jesse Helms
getting pregnant and begging for the abortion he outlawed.
<P>
Kahn heads a North Carolina group called Grassroots Leadership
which he founded fifteen years ago. In 1994, CHD contributed $25,000
to Grassroots Leadership, a group whose mission is &quot;to promote
racial causes, women's freedom of choice, gay and lesbian rights,
and environmental issues,&quot; according to <I>The Plain Dealer</I>.
<P>
Kahn says, &quot;My work is explicitly political,&quot; a remark
that exemplifies what is wrong with CHD.
<P>
<B>Radical Grace: Industrial Areas Foundation and Albuquerque
Interfaith </B>
<P>
The network of interlocking CHD grant recipients provides further
evidence of how CHD operates and of the radical nature and ill-effects
of its work. 
<P>
A major recipient of CHD funds is the Industrial Areas Foundation.
CHD has provided millions of dollars $5 million between 1991 and
1993 alone from Catholics of good will to IAF groups across the
country. IAF was founded by the late Saul Alinsky whose organizing
methods serve as a model for CHD. A founding father of social
activism, Alinsky wrote <I>Rules for Radicals</I>, whose credo
inspires and teaches: &quot;To hell with charity; the only thing
you'll get is what you're strong enough to get.&quot;
<P>
In October of 1994, a group called Albuquerque Interfaith (AI)
received a CHD grant of $50,000 &quot;to help that group become
a broad-based community organization.&quot; Albuquerque Interfaith
works with the Industrial Areas Foundation to develop methods
of church-based organizing in order to recruit new members. So-called
interfaith alliances enable church groups to transform themselves
into political action centers to mobilize and agitate for the
progressive cause of the day. The head of the Southwest district
of the Industrial Areas Foundation is Ernesto Cortez, one of Saul
Alinsky's chief disciples.
<P>
A founding organization of the Albuquerque Interfaith network
is the Albuquerque-based Center for Action and Contemplation (CAC).
Its role, according to the Center's founder Rev. Richard Rohr,
is &quot;to question the bourgeois, middle-class world view,&quot;
&quot;to challenge the middle class and the White,&quot; and &quot;the
middle-class attitudes in America that are oppressing us.&quot;
The CAC is committed to &quot;collaborating with other organizations
endorsing a similar vision and philosophy.&quot;
<P>
The character of that vision and philosophy can be gauged in CAC's
newsletter <I>Radical Grace</I>, which blends Saul Alinsky's social-activist
polemics with liberation theology. According to <I>Radical Grace</I>:
&quot;Our times cry out for renewed political vision . . . We
challenge any political litmus test that distorts the independent
moral conscience that faith can bring into politics . . . We are
deeply concerned about the subversion of prophetic religion .
. . when the gospel message is turned upside down to bring more
comfort to those on top of society than those at the bottom.
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> asserts that &quot;The almost total identification
of the Religious Right and the new Republican majority in Washington
is a dangerous liaison of religion with political power.&quot;
Yet mixing politics with religion is exactly what <I>Radical Grace</I>
and CHD practice.
<P>
The newsletter renounces dogma and tradition, promotes radical
feminism, and announces &quot;Reinventing the Masculine&quot;
and &quot;Reconstructing Sexuality&quot; seminars. Nestled among
notices common to any parish bulletin (breakfast at a homeless
shelter; celebrating the feast of St. Anthony) are events that
deal with &quot;rediscovering and claiming the feminine soul&quot;
and &quot;Reconstructing Business Relationships and Corporate
America.&quot;
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> is openly contemptuous of Church teaching
on the role of women in the Church. Christina Spahn writes, &quot;I
do not look to the Vatican for assurance of my place in the Church
today.&quot; She complains that efforts to &quot;remind the Vatican
that women <I>could</I> be named as Cardinals . . . have been
vastly ignored.&quot; The &quot;institutional church,&quot; she
says, &quot;is flawed by sin, fear, and the comfort of the familiar.&quot;
<P>
Another article carps about the &quot;repression of women in the
Church.&quot; &quot;We have been denied what many of us believe
to be God-given privileges,&quot; says the author.
<P>
<B>Political Activism and Abortion</B> 
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> politicizes the sacred by rewriting the Apostles
Creed, referring to God as the mother and father of nonviolence,
and Jesus Christ as a &quot;victim of the death penalty.&quot;
Its &quot;all inclusive&quot; communion of saints numbers Gandhi,
Martin Luther King Jr., Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, and &quot;.
. . the whole of humanity in the great dance of life.&quot;
<P>
A CAC volunteer, Sister Mary O'Keefe, confirmed by phone that
she supports choice in abortion, and dissents 
from Rome on most moral issues. O'Keefe says she is praying for
the Pope's conversion. O'Keefe also confirmed that her views are
largely shared by most of the CAC staff.
<P>
CAC's new president is Richard Heim, a former secretary of the
New Mexico Department of Human Services who was instrumental in
introducing Medicaid-funded abortions to the state. Heim, a Catholic,
repeats the Planned Parenthood line that if &quot;the state undertakes
funding of medical care of the poor, which includes funding for
childbirth, the state cannot also deny funding for abortion,&quot;
according to <I>The Albuquerque Tribune</I>. 
<P>
Heim also serves as &quot;core leader&quot; at the Aquinas Newman
Center in Albuquerque, which works with Albuquerque Interfaith
seeking &quot;supporters in large numbers to demonstrate broad-based
support for corrective action by professional and elected leaders.&quot;
<P>
Members of local church congregations are questioning why their
communities have such close ties to IAF. As a consequence, a number
of churches have withdrawn their affiliation with Interfaith movements
because of that relationship.
<P>
Most notable is the withdrawal of El Divino Redentor Church in
McAllen, New Mexico. Petitioners recount IAF's tactics: &quot;Although
joining in this movement was authorized by committee, it is not
favored by the membership in general,&quot; the petition from
the Methodist congregation stated. The congregation reasoned that
the &quot;objectives of this organization [Valley Interfaith]
are of political pressure and this is contrary to the purpose
of this church;&quot; and it concluded that if &quot;things continue
as they are, our congregation will be destroyed.&quot; The church
called for a service of reconciliation to &quot;renounce membership
in Valley Interfaith.&quot;
<P>
A parishioner at Albuquerque's St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church,
Mrs. Joan Higgs, underscores what is troubling Catholics about
the Campign for Human Development. Higgs recalls the original
CHD collections over twenty years ago: &quot;I believe everyone
used to think the CHD was the Church's [standard] collection for
the poor.
<P>
&quot;It sounded good and so we naturally made the effort to contribute.
Now, as we object to that kind of political action in our church,
my family no longer contributes.&quot;
<P>
Higgs remembers meeting Interfaith activist, ex-priest Tim McCluskey.
She recalls a man quite simply unable to accept &quot;no&quot;
for an answer. His appeals to have &quot;our parish accept an
AI alliance amounted to endless talk, never a prayer, and endless
`discussion.' She concludes, &quot;I believe there is something
wrong with politics being an essential part of our congregation's
affiliation, and so we no longer contribute to the CHD collection.&quot;
<P>
<B>What is Wrong With the CHD?</B> 
<P>
CHD contends that its work is impelled by Scripture, modern Catholic
social teaching, and the &quot;pervasive presence of poverty in
the United States.&quot; Yet the evidence suggests otherwise.
<P>
In fact, Catholic scholars and clerics argue that the CHD abuses
&quot;the pervasive presence of poverty in America&quot; to advance
a liberal political and social agenda. A Midwest diocesan director
for CHD, who asked to remain anonymous, regards the lack of clear
articulation about the Campaign's principles as a danger which
lends itself to abuses. A priest, the CHD director said he doesn't
go out of his way to promote the collection: &quot;We've included
the CHD collection with two others on the same day,&quot; he remarked.
<P>
Commenting on the overall functioning of the CHD, the director
commented that CHD is &quot;in the hands of a few well-intentioned
people who don't do their homework about the projects they fund
nor seem to care to.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It is sad how most Catholics think that CHD money goes to
church projects, when in fact it does not,&quot; he concludes.
<P>
Once again, we call on the America's Catholic bishops to initiate
a desperately-needed overhaul of the Campaign for Human Development.
The problems with CHD are legion. Given the deep-rooted and institutional
nature of the problems, as well as the Campaign's flawed premises,
we seriously doubt whether mere reform is possible. Nevertheless,
we urge the bishops to rein in this program. The bishops themselves
must exercise active oversight, not rubberstamp decisions by CHD
professional staff. At a minimum, they should recognize an obligation
to be honest with parishioners about the aims and activities of
CHD.
<P>
We look forward to the day when there will be no need to report
on the Campaign for Human Development. And we are confidant that
this day will arrive because, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis
once said, the glare of scrutiny is &quot;the best of disinfectants.&quot;
<P>
Meanwhile, we strongly urge parishioners to withhold their contributions.

<h2>The National Trust for Historic Preservation<BR>
</h2>
<br>
<a href="/crc/about/people.html#Pambianco">Robert V. Pambianco</a>, Editor
<P>
<I>Editor's note: The National Trust for Historic Preservation,
a taxpayer-funded nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting
national historic sites, offers a prime example of how opponents
of economic development use the political process to achieve their
ends. Thoroughly elitist in its disdain for popular interests,
the Trust carries a worthwhile goal to extremes: it is hostile
to property rights, doesn't mind trampling on freedom of religion,
and keeps in step with the latest dictates of political correctness.
</I>
<P>
<br>
The National Trust for Historic Preservation was chartered by
the U.S. Congress in 1949 to &quot;protect buildings, sites, and
objects significant in American history and culture.&quot; Over
the years, it has encouraged Americans to better appreciate the
significance and beauty of many places in American history. It
has acquired and manages eighteen historic &quot;house museums,&quot;
including the homes of President James Madison, President Woodrow
Wilson, and Naval hero Captain Stephen Decatur, as well as three
Virginia plantation mansions.
<P>
The Trust has capitalized on the interests of a new generation
of Americans who enjoy travel, antiques, home re-decorating, and
the &quot;finer things.&quot; Its high-toned bimonthly magazine
features people restoring old houses and groups renovating picturesque
local properties. It is filled with advertisements for expensive
vacation spots and has an extensive real estate section. The Trust
sponsors tours to exotic places around the globe Istanbul, Venice,
Carthage, Cape Town, Victoria Falls, Imperial Asia often aboard
cruise ship, yacht, clipper ship, or the Orient Express.
<P>
In recent years, the Trust's mission has moved beyond the preservation
of noteworthy sites. The meaning of historic preservation has
been transformed as the Trust has broken new ground in public
policy, adopting controversial positions on legal and constitutional
issues and using historic preservation as a vehicle to promote
an anti-growth agenda. Perhaps fearful that it will be tagged
as a defender of old-money illusions of bygone days or as a commercial
promoter of yuppie lifestyles, the Trust now dedicates itself
not only to protecting historic places but also &quot;historic
environments,&quot; the &quot;livability of our communities,&quot;
and &quot;diversity.&quot;
<P>
The Trust has a budget of $33 million and total assets of $68
million. Its president is Richard Moe, former chief of staff to
Walter Mondale. A 501(c)(3) organization, it receives one-fifth
of its budget from the federal government through a grant from
the National Park Service.
<P>
The $7 million grant is part of an annual $41 million appropriation
for the Historic Preservation Fund, $33 million of which goes
to State Historic Preservation Offices.
<P>
<B>Constitutional Concerns: the Fifth Amendment</B> 
<P>
The Trust's activities touch on two contentious constitutional
issues. The first relates to the Fifth Amendment to the Bill of
Rights, which states that the government may not seize property
for public purposes without just compensation. With that Amendment
in mind and as part of the Contract with America, property rights
proponents in Congress have proposed so-called &quot;takings&quot;
legislation, which requires federal agencies to compensate property
owners whose land has been devalued by government regulatory mandates.
(The Private Property Protection Act of 1995 has been passed in
the House of Representatives; similar legislation is awaiting
action in the Senate.)
<P>
Even though the legislation would not limit government's authority
to declare a property to be a historical landmark, the National
Trust has joined with the environmental movement and a raft of
other liberal constituencies in opposing takings legislation.
<P>
The Trust argues that takings bills will have an &quot;adverse
impact on efforts to preserve and protect our important and irreplaceable
historic and cultural resources.&quot; George Abney, a legislative
assistant at the Trust, says that &quot;To minimize compensation
costs, agencies ultimately could choose to ignore regulations.
Federal, state, and local governments could lose their ability
to protect public health, safety, and welfare not to mention historic
resources.&quot; In addition, the Trust contends that the legislation
threatens clean water safeguards and the federal wetlands permitting
process, which the Trust says &quot;are often critical elements
in the fight against suburban sprawl.&quot;
<P>
In the courts the Trust has also sided with opponents of property
rights. In <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, an Oregon case, the
U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled, in a significant setback for
land-use controllers, that the City violated the Fifth Amendment's
takings clause in requiring a property owner to turn over a portion
of her property for a bike path as a condition of receiving a
development permit. The Court held that city officials could not
justify commandeering 10 percent of her lot. The Trust filed an
<I>amicus</I> brief in support of the city.
<P>
<B>The First Amendment</B> 
<P>
Attempts to restrict property rights can also raise First Amendment
concerns especially when preservationists set their sights on
local churches. Classifying a church as a historical landmark
raises more than the takings issue; it raises the fundamental
issue of religious freedom enshrined in the First Amendment.
<P>
The Trust and the preservation movement have gone to battle against
churches in a number of cases. Increasingly, they seek to restrict
freedom of religion with historic preservation ordinances that
prohibit the faithful from altering their houses of worship. The
preservationists seem to mistake the purpose of a church. Like
those who attend church for chamber music concerts, preservationists
would protect churches for their aesthetic value or historic significance.
<P>
First Covenant Church in Seattle fought a legal battle with preservationists
in the early 1990s. &quot;The fact is the church isn't a building,&quot;
said Richard Sundholm, First Covenant's chairman, &quot;it is
a congregation.&quot; &quot;The church, as we see it, has a mission,&quot;
he told the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>. &quot;If the mission changes,
and we need to do something different, we are incredibly hampered
because we are a landmark.&quot; The National Trust rejected this
argument and supported city efforts to have the church declared
a landmark. In 1992, the Washington Supreme Court held that Seattle's
actions were unconstitutional.
<P>
Other churches have been less fortunate. St. Bartholomew's Episcopal
Church in Manhattan is perhaps the best known instance of a church
which fought to protect its mission from preservationist encroachment.
The church wanted to tear down its community center and replace
it with an office tower, hoping to use the revenue from the tower
to finance its social service programs for the needy. St. Bartholomew's
argued that by severely limiting its ability to raise money through
development of the property the landmark law had impaired the
church's ability to carry on its ministerial and charitable activities.
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the New York Board
of Rabbis filed briefs in support of the church. The National
Trust sided with the city's landmarks commission which won its
case in the federal appeals court in New York.
<P>
The Trust even has the audacity to cite the First Amendment against
those who attempt to exempt churches from landmark controls. In
a 1990 lawsuit, the Trust and the Landmarks Preservation Council
of Illinois charged that an amendment to Chicago's landmark ordinance
violated the First Amendment's establishment clause. The measure
provided that a church could not be declared a landmark without
the consent of its owner, and it was used by the Archdiocese of
Chicago to block landmark designation for St. Mary of the Angels
Catholic Church. The preservationists argued that the amended
ordinance conferred an unconstitutional benefit on religion.
<P>
Similarly, in 1994 the Trust opposed a bill introduced in the
California legislature by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown which
would bar local governments from designating churches as historic
landmarks. The measure had wide support in both houses of the
legislature and was supported by the San Francisco archdioceses.
<P>
James Bovard, author of <I>Lost Rights: The Destruction of American
Liberty</I>, has pointedly observed of landmark laws that, by
forbidding changes in religious architecture, &quot;these ordinances
in effect dictate that people may pray only in government-approved
spaces.&quot;
<P>
The Religious Freedom Act, signed by President Clinton in November
1993, was passed in response to a Supreme Court decision which
was considered by many too restrictive on the practice of religion.
When it was first introduced in Congress the text of the bill
provided that any burden on religious freedom had to be justified
by a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest. But the National
Trust successfully pushed for a change in the legislative language
stating that only a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on religious
freedom requires a compelling government interest. In non-legal
language, this would appear to mean that the state can impinge
on religious freedom as long as the impingement is not substantial.
<P>
It is ironic that the preservationists, in seeking to uphold history,
appear ignorant of a crucial part of early American history. That
is, in their zeal to preserve history (actually symbols of history)
they are willing to trample on the principle of freedom of worship,
which was a driving force behind the settlement of the American
colonies and the founding of the Republic. In the name of history,
preservationists seek to tell churches what they can and cannot
do.
<P>
Writing in <I>National Review</I>, Bovard quips that &quot;If
the historic-preservation movement had been as strong in the tenth
century as it is now, the magnificent Gothic cathedrals of the
Middle Ages might never have been built. The preservationists
would have been outraged at the demolition of eighth century stone-block
churches . . . and would probably have run to the nearest king
for an injunction.&quot;
<P>
<B>Battleground: The Trust versus Disney</B> 
<P>
All this reveals something else about the preservationist cause:
it defends elite privileges. As in the St. Bart's case, preservationists
often fight political and legal battles against local churches,
neighborhood groups, and social service providers. Bovard recounted
a 1993 attempt by the District of Columbia to designate hundreds
of buildings in the Logan Circle neighborhood as historic landmarks.
The effort led the <I>Washington Post</I> to comment that &quot;The
debate over the historic designation has become a fight between
a group of mostly white, affluent residents . . . and a disparate
cast of social service providers and black parishioners.&quot;
To Rev. Beecher Hicks, pastor of Metropolitan Baptist Church,
the supporters of the historic district designation &quot;. .
. have filed this application to prevent such unhistoric activity
as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and caring for children
proliferating in our neighborhood.&quot;
<P>
Philosophers and historians have recorded how social and political
elites use the powers of the state to help themselves at others'
expense. What was true in the past applies as well to the contemporary
politics of education, regulation, or affirmative action. And
it is especially apparent in the imposition of public restrictions
on private land use, as in the successful campaign to keep the
Walt Disney Company out of Northern Virginia.
<P>
The National Trust was a leader in the fight to prevent Disney
from building its history theme park in Virginia's Prince William
County. The battle pitted Hollywood activists, academics, and
Washington groups against the Governor of Virginia, the local
elected officials, and the people of Prince William County who
stood to gain from the park's construction.
<P>
In its assault on the Disney project, the Trust argued, in Richard
Moe's words, that the project &quot;would spell disaster for the
countryside.&quot; In an open letter to Disney Chairman Michael
D. Eisner, Moe and Trust Chairman Henry Jordan insisted that the
park would &quot;stand as a superscaled specimen&quot; of urban
sprawl. Historian David McCullough, author of the best-seller
biography of Harry Truman and one of the Trust's point men, called
it a &quot;development blitzkrieg.&quot;
<P>
McCullough, a member of the Trust board, typified its outlook.
In the Trust's bimonthly newspaper, <I>Historic Preservation News</I>,
he warned that development of the Disney project &quot;will swamp
the battlefield; it will all but blot it out . . . It will surround
it with congestion, traffic, parking lots, gas stations, T-shirt
shops, souvenir stores, fast food places, motels, hotels, offices.
Any spell that one feels at the Manassas battlefield as is without
the visual intrusion, not to say the noise, that will come with
this massive development that spell will be gone. It won't be
the same . . . It will be hard to be alone there. It will be impossible
to stand and just listen to the silence.&quot;
<P>
McCullough was prepared to deprive the people of Virginia of jobs
and the benefits of economic growth and deny millions of Washington-area
visitors the theme park's family-oriented entertainment and, yes,
instruction in American history because he wanted to be &quot;alone&quot;
at Manassas, without masses of visitors disturbing the &quot;spell.&quot;
<P>
Of course, the campaign for and against the Disney project had
many ironies, among them the Disney Company's intensive lobbying
to secure state funding for roads and improvements to its proposed
private development. But that the Trust, a group dedicated to
America's past, fought to halt construction of a park focusing
on American history was the greatest irony of all. McCullough
compared Richard Moe's efforts against Disney to General George
C. Marshall's leadership. But Marshall was charged with running
the U.S. Army in World War II and later reconstructing Europe,
not returning it to a state of nature. Virginia Governor George
Allen's quip was more apt: &quot;History is not just for historians.
And it is not just for smug, self-appointed arbiters of culture
and Hollywood movie stars. It is for all our citizens or it should
be.&quot;
<P>
Mindful of their vulnerability to the charge of elitism, the Trust
was careful to argue that the issue was the location of the project,
not Disney's capacity to interpret American history. McCullough
did once refer to the project as &quot;McHistory,&quot; but this
was a mistake he didn't repeat, according to <I>Washingtonian</I>
magazine.
<P>
Perhaps the project would have been &quot;McHistory.&quot; But
not everyone with three kids and a camper can afford to learn
history National Trust-style. &quot;Travel with fewer than 95
passengers aboard the splendid <I>Regina Renaissance</I>,&quot;
says the notice for the Trust's &quot;Red Sea Passage&quot; tour
to Egypt and Jordan.
<P>
<B>Wal-Mart: Public Enemy</B> 
<P>
Partly to refute allegations that it is indifferent to consumer
preferences and to the economic consequences of market forces,
the Trust promotes the economic benefits of historic preservation,
i.e. property values will rise, investment capital will be attracted
and businesses created by different kinds of preservation projects.
Left unsaid is the consequence that some preserved places will
become so costly that they will be commercially inaccessible to
those with modest means.
<P>
Certainly the Trust's recent campaign against Wal-Mart stores
suggests a hostility to consumer preferences. The Trust, headquartered
in the former home of Andrew Mellon on Washington's stately Embassy
Row, rallies opponents of the merchandise discount chain. Wal-Mart
has become the bane of anti-growth groups, labor unions and environmentalists.
Preservation elites believe Wal-Mart is a supreme symptom and
creator of the so-called &quot;sprawl&quot; they loathe. Sprawl
has become the &quot;major issue galvanizing the preservation
movement today,&quot; says the Trust's 1994 annual report.
<P>
In a recent issue of <I>Historic Preservation News</I>, Jonathan
Walters posits that &quot;sprawl-spawning megastores&quot; like
Wal-Mart have become &quot;public enemy number one&quot; in the
battle for the &quot;soul of small-town America.&quot; While Wal-Mart
is the biggest offender, preservationists have also set their
sights on K-Mart, Home Depot, Builder's Square, and price clubs
like Price/Costco and Sam's. The May/June issue of <I>Historic
Preservation News</I> noted approvingly that the Vermont Environmental
Board voted to deny Wal-Mart a permit to build on a field outside
the town of St. Albans.
<P>
Preservationists prefer places where people &quot;. . . can walk
from one destination to another.&quot; The Trust says it does
not oppose Wal-Mart per se, but prefers them to locate in &quot;smaller,
more sensitively designed stores in downtowns. . .&quot; Of course,
that is antithetical to the whole idea behind Wal-Mart: an easily
accessible big store built on cheap land and selling almost everything
at low prices. Wal-Marts and similar stores may not be as quaint
as Georgetown shops but they usually offer consumers more for
less.
<P>
The Trust is coordinating anti-superstore activity and serves
as a national clearinghouse of information for a growing network
of &quot;sprawlbusters.&quot; For $12 members can purchase <I>How
Superstore Sprawl Can Harm Communities (and What Citizens Can
Do About It),</I> a Trust guide for those who want to fight megastores.
<P>
<B>A New History?</B> 
<P>
The Trust's hostility toward Wal-Mart reveals how far it has strayed
from its original mission. The anti-Wal-Mart crusade is less about
preserving history than it is part of a general campaign against
suburban development. In this campaign, historic preservation
functions more as an argument than an objective.
<P>
As the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> noted as far back as 1991, &quot;America's
premier preservationist group has changed its ideas of what is
history and how to preserve it.&quot; When it was chartered by
Congress, the Trust concentrated on buildings and places associated
with great persons and events in early American history. In other
words, what it preserved had to be historical, not merely old.
<P>
Judging by stories in its newspaper, the Trust today seems concerned
with much that is of negligible historical significance and often
not very old:
<UL>
<LI>the Joan of Arc Plaza in New Orleans (erected in 1971), which
includes a 19th century statue of Joan of Arc and two French cannons;
<LI>a vintage McDonald's restaurant in Downey, California;
<LI>the Fair Park's Texas Centennial Building in Dallas built
in 1936;
<LI>a 1940 addition to a Georgia department store built in 1924;
<LI>a 1925 Honolulu bank;
<LI>Detroit's Tiger Stadium.
</UL>

<P>
The Trust newspaper also reports on efforts to save the world's
largest katsup bottle erected in 1949 in Collinsville, Illinois.
And in 1993, the group placed the entire state of Vermont on its
list of &quot;America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.&quot;
<P>
<B>Joining the Advocacy Chorus</B> 
<P>
The Trust's transformation was apparent from the program of its
1994 annual National Preservation Conference, whose theme was
&quot;Preservation, Economics, &amp; Community Rebirth.&quot;
<P>
One conference session on &quot;Redefining Historic Preservation:
Toward a New Preservation Manifesto&quot; asked the questions:
&quot;Has the field passed its image by? [and] Is it time for
a new definition?&quot; This &quot;advanced&quot; session explored
the idea of &quot;Getting beyond history and aesthetics to a new
paradigm of `human wholeness.'
<P>
The new paradigm consists of the &quot;five Rs&quot; of historic
preservation:
<UL>
<LI>restoring historic buildings, neighborhoods and human lives;
<LI>reweaving the built environment;
<LI>rebuilding authentic community;
<LI>reconstructing the local economy;
<LI>renewing human connections.
</UL>

<P>
The Trust's sympathy with &quot;diversity,&quot; the latest buzzword
in political correctness, was manifest in sessions on &quot;Making
Preservation Happen in Geographically, Politically, and Culturally
Diverse Communities&quot; and in a reception sponsored by the
African-American Landmarks Committee of the Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana, &quot;celebrating cultural diversity in
the preservation movement.&quot;
<P>
Besides workshops and seminars, the event included tour activities.
Some were unavoidably associated with historic preservation, like
a visit to Boston's North End. But there was also an &quot;Eco
Tour&quot; of the Boston Park Plaza hotel enabling participants
to see an &quot;environmentally sound&quot; hotel that integrates
&quot;environmental action into all daily decision making.&quot;
<P>
The Trust had come a long way from preserving the homes of founding
fathers and military heroes.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B> 
<P>
In view of the well-documented historical illiteracy of Americans
it is certainly worthwhile to protect the physical evidence of
our nation's past. But history is more than its remains. Age alone
and architectural significance give less value to Monticello than
its association with Thomas Jefferson. If preservation policies
violate the principles and ideals of American history including
property rights, the free exercise of religion, and entrepreneurship
then they are too high a price to pay. Preservation cannot be
used by privileged groups to deny others their rights or the benefits
of progress.
<P>
Preservationists must ask themselves whether their pursuit of
the past does violence to the lessons of American history. Congress
must ask whether continued taxpayer support for the National Trust
for Historic Preservation is justified.<P>

<p><blockquote><i>"...if they want to proclaim a truth or propagate some feeling by the encouragement of a great example, they form an association. In every case, at the head of any new undertaking, where in France you would find the government or in England some territorial magnate, in the United States you are sure to find an association. I have come across several types of association in America of which, I confess, I had not previously the slightest conception, and I have often admired the extreme skill they show in proposing a common object for the exertions of very many and in inducing them voluntarily to pursue it."

Alexis de Tocqueville, <br>

<p>
Greyhound rescue associations are in the finest tradition of American voluntarism. Thanks primarily to their efforts, tens of thousands of racedogs who would have been euthanized once their racing days had ended  now are adopted into loving families.  Not only are ex-racers family companions, they are also used therapeutically to lift the spirits of the sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. 
The spirit that Tocqueville admired in American civil society takes many forms. <i>Philanthropy, Culture & Society</i> is committed to bringing you these stories.

Lucy Salsman is a small grey-haired woman with a warm smile and a New Hampshire accent that is not often heard in central Texas.  The retired nurse answers the door of her two-story suburban house north of Austin in a T-shirt that reads "Adopt a 45 m.p.h. couch potato" and sports a picture of a greyhound asleep on a couch.  At first glance, there's nothing to set Salsman's house apart from her neighbors', unless it's the sign on her gate with a picture of a running greyhound and the words, "I can reach the gate in two seconds.  Can you?" 
<p>Inside, Joshua, a large (waist-high), brindle (sort of tiger-striped) greyhound, who raced in Oklahoma under the name "Get 'em Home Alone," greets me at the door with a desultory sniff.  He's a sleek dog, with bony haunches and a slight limp that comes from some kind of degenerative disease in his hip.  Not finding me particularly interesting, Joshua ambles back to his blanket laid out behind a couch in front of a window.  In the middle of the room is a large pet carrier—the kind used on airplanes.  A dozing brown greyhound wearing a white T-shirt rests inside.  Lucy has had "Nameless" for less than an hour, just time to bathe him and put him in the crate to rest after a long day of travel.  He had been found wandering alongside I-35 near Waco, an hour and a half north of Austin. Because the dog had ear tattoos that marked him as a racing greyhound, a breeder kept him for a few days until the dog could be brought to Austin and placed with Lucy. She provides foster care to retired greyhounds through an organization called Greyhound Pets of America/Austin (GPA/A). 
<p>The Austin chapter, like hundreds of groups across the country, seeks to find adoptive homes for retired racing greyhounds. With the help of cooperating racetracks, breeders and trainers, GPA and other groups have saved thousands of dogs—and perhaps the greyhound industry itself—from almost certain death. 
<p>Greyhounds are beautiful dogs with an ancient pedigree.  Fans of the breed brag that they are pictured in art dating back to ancient Egypt.  During the middle ages, only noblemen could own them.  Though greyhounds were originally used for hunting rabbits and other small game, the dog's speed— clocked as fast as 45 mph—made them a natural for racing in England and Ireland.  
<p>In the United States, the dogs have always been working dogs. First used to rid Midwestern farms of pests like jack rabbits, they were eventually turned into professional athletes.  Since 1906, the National Greyhound Association (NGA) has kept a registry of racing greyhounds.  There are about 4,000 owners and breeders who are members of NGA, and only dogs registered by that organization, or similar registries in England, Ireland or Australia, can race in the United States. 
<p>Because dog racing is a $4-billion dollar gambling industry, the dogs have to be closely regulated.  According to the NGA, it is the sixth largest spectator sport in America, attracting 27 million fans to 55 tracks in 18 states.  Within ten days of birth, breeders have to send a description of each puppy, including sex and color, to the NGA in Abilene, Kansas.  At three months, the dogs are "marked up" and tattooed.  During this procedure, each greyhound is examined thoroughly and every distinct marking is sketched on a drawing, right down to its toenail color and spots.  Each dog also is tattooed in both ears.  One ear contains the kennel registration number, and the other the dog's birth month, year, and litter number.  The only number unique to a greyhound is the litter number, which tells in what order the dogs from a particular litter were tattooed. Every greyhound must be marked up and tattooed before he can be registered and raced at a track. Every time a dog races, track officials check his litter number, age, and markings to make sure that the right dog is racing. 
<p>During the 1980s, the greyhound industry grew as state officials, eager to find alternative sources of revenue, looked to various kinds of gambling. In 1994, the industry contributed $226 million in taxes to state and local governments, up from about $30 million in 1974. In addition, each track employs from 500 to 600 people.  But by the 1990s, the bloom was off the racing rose. Competition from other sports, lotteries, and even cable TV, cut into dog racing attendance.  Some smaller tracks and poorly financed breeders went out of business.  
<p>Another threat first appeared in 1984 when the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) began to target greyhound racing.  "We were just unprepared.  We had no way of dealing with it," said Tim Horan, managing editor of Greyhound Review.  "We didn't even have a pamphlet to give out on greyhound welfare." 
<p>The Humane Society claimed that huge numbers of dogs were put to death each year—anywhere from 30,000 to 80,000. The greyhound industry had no reply because it had not kept statistics.  Stories with names like "Race of Death" and "For Blood and Money," appeared in magazines and on TV. Well-publicized scandals concerning criminal breeders leaving malnourished racers to die did not help. It didn't matter that the NGA had, in the most publicized cases, been the whistleblower that called the authorities.  The racing industry suffered as animal rights groups called for the sport's elimination. 
<p>Although the NGA employs an inspector who conducts about 700 inspections of greyhound farms and kennels a year and has the power to ban for life those breeders who are found mistreating their dogs—a penalty levied four times in 1994—critics like Susan Netboy of the Greyhound Protection League of Palo Alto, California aren't satisfied. "Humane Societies should be working to make greyhound racing illegal," she has said.  "It doesn't matter what kind of legislation you pass, you can't enforce it." 
<p>The industry has taken a two-pronged approach to its public relations: get out accurate information to reporters and government officials, and actively promote greyhound adoption.  In the mid-1980s, small greyhound adoption programs run by animal welfare groups began to emerge, first in Florida and then around the rest of the country. Some breeders made their own agreements with greyhound adoption groups, and some tracks sponsored their own programs. In 1989, for instance, when Wichita Greyhound Park opened in Wichita, Kansas, it initiated an adoption program fully funded by the track.  Any individual who races dogs at that track must sign a contract that the dogs will enter the adoption program when they are through racing, unless they go back to the farm for breeding or race at another track.  
<p>In 1992, such individual efforts were given a major boost by the American Greyhound Council (AGC), a nonprofit entity founded in 1987 by greyhound trainers, owners, and racetracks; it gave a $100,000 grant to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) for a greyhound adoption fund. The donation kicked off a splashy campaign that raised the profile of greyhound adoption.  Its  slogan was, "We're athletes, we're beautiful, we're elegant, and we're yours." The industry continues to support adoption programs financially: it gives $40,000 annually to the ASPCA and also funds a toll-free adoption hotline (see page 6), manned by Greyhound Pets of America, that puts potential families in touch with the greyhound adoption group closest to them. The hotline fielded 42,000 calls in just its second year of operation.  The grant to the ASPCA also gave the greyhound industry and at least some animal welfare groups a chance to play on the same team. As Tim Horan of Greyhound Review puts it: "In the long run the number one goal is to adopt out these greyhounds."

<h3>A Dog's Life</h3>
Because greyhounds have a unique upbringing, adopting one is not like adopting any other dog from the local animal shelter.  Bobby Hibbs has been involved with dog racing in one way or another since the early 1960s.  His father owns  Y Knot greyhound farm just east of Austin, and he and his wife Jeanette own WildCat farm a couple miles away.    When Bobby was a boy he hated the dogs, mostly because they were a lot of work.  He had to help feed them and turn them out before he could go to school or participate in sports.  For nine years he installed elevators for a living, but when his dad asked him if he was interested in coming back to the farm, Bobby said yes.
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>The Humane Society claimed that huge numbers of dogs were put to death each year—anywhere from 30,000 to 80,000.  The greyhound industry had no reply because it had not kept statistics.</big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>The road to Wildcat Farm is lined with orange, blue, and yellow wildflowers. At a sharp bend in the road, past the road scraper smoothing out a new layer of yellow road fill, lies the Hibbs' whelping farm.  Here they breed puppies and care for them until they are three months old, when they are moved to the other farm. When I pull into the drive, a yard dog, who has the run of the property, barks angrily until Jeanette puts him in a run.  He seems insulted to be penned up like the greyhounds—and I begin to see the difference between a dog and a greyhound.  Despite the commotion, the greyhounds are silent.  They are not given to the inelegant task of barking.
<p>Right now the Hibbs' have just one litter of eight-month-olds and another litter of puppies that are about six weeks old at the whelping farm.  By greyhound standards the litter is small, only eight dogs, where 12 or 13 is common.  At mid-morning all the dogs are napping, sprawled out contentedly in holes that they have dug in the soft sandy soil.  At this age, the puppies look much like any other puppy.  Jeanette says they won't develop the classic greyhound look, with long legs and snouts, until they are two to three months old. The sandy runs are connected to a well-ventilated indoor pen by a spring door, so the puppies are free to go in and out. 
<p>Though the dogs do not go into training until they are 12 months old, they are given a carefully controlled diet, meant to prepare them for the rigors of racing, from the time they are weaned at about six weeks. Young dogs get fed once a day in the morning with a milky snack at night.  At two months, they move from a mixture of baby cereal and canned dog food to a diet made up of raw meat and dry dog food.  Each dog gets 3 to 3-1/2 pounds of food in the morning, plus a mixture made of milk, puppy chow, and left-over food in the evenings. 
<p>At three months the dogs are moved from the whelping farm over to the Y Knot farm.  There are now about 60 dogs outside and another 16 dogs inside the Y Knot farm.  Outside, the dogs have been fed and are frisky; the weather may have something to do with it.  Thick clouds hang low, threatening rain, and the brisk gusting wind takes the edge off the heat.  As Bobby and Jeanette walk along the runs,  the dogs climb up on the white iron fences eager to have their necks scratched and their backs patted.  Bobby calls some of them by nickname, and tells me about some of their peculiarities.  All  dogs outside are under a year old.  During the first year little is required of them.  Mostly the dogs run—and sleep.  They chase after leaves skidding along the ground.  They get into impromptu races with the dogs in the runs next door.   They chase birds and can tear up any animal dumb enough to get into their runs.  
<p>"I've seen stray cats come in there and be destroyed," Jeanette says.  "We had a cat—My husband warned my daughter, 'Amanda, I'm telling you. . . .'  'No, Daddy, it won't climb over that fence. . . .'  We had Sonny [the cat] here.  Sonny would walk the fence.  Sonny would go in with the puppies, the little puppies.  And he would be fine.  But one day he climbed in here with dogs about this size (eight months old).  When we got him out he didn't look like a cat anymore. He survived but we had to give him away.  Amanda never asked for a cat again."
<p>But at a year the dogs' lives change.  The dogs, nearly full size at that point, move  into a small air conditioned building furnished with a double deck row of cage-like crates about 2-1/2 feet wide, 3 feet tall, and 3-1/2 feet deep.  Crates like these are home to the racing greyhound until it retires.  When we enter the kennel, it is about 11:00 A.M., and  the dogs are resting.  They sprawl in their crates, some sleeping on their backs on the two layers of carpet that line the floors.  One has pushed his carpet aside so he can feel the cool concrete on his belly. In the background country music plays, and Jeanette says the radio stays on 24 hours a day both at the farm and in the kennel at the track. 
<p>Once the dogs are in training, their lives are subject to a rigid routine. "We turn them out four times a day to get exercise, go to the bathroom, get a drink of water."  The dogs get so accustomed to the routine "they have a time clock inside them that they know to the minute when it is time to turn out," Bobby Hibbs says.  Every turn out is supposed to last 45 minutes, but it is sometimes hard to get the dogs to cooperate.  "Honestly, you put a dog in the kennel, they don't ever want to be outside.  They love the house.  The only time they want to be out is when they run.  Especially in the heat—in 10 minutes they're ready to go back in." Male and female dogs are turned out into separate pens, and all the dogs wear muzzles for protection.  Bobby explains that the dogs in training have been taught to go after the sound of a squawking object.  If a dog were to start squealing or whimpering, all the other dogs might turn on it.   
<p>The dogs have to learn several skills before they can go to the track.  They have to learn to be lead by a collar and by a lead. Outside, Bobby Hibbs demonstrates how resistant even a collar-trained dog can be.  The dog, weighing close to 80 pounds, plants both hind legs in the hard packed dirt, moving only grudgingly as Bobby tugs on the collar.  Though running comes naturally, the dogs also have to learn to chase after a lure.  Since it is illegal to use jack rabbits, trainers use a contraption called a Jack-a-Lure made of a mop and noisy squawker.  The dogs first learn to chase the noise, then learn to chase it in a circle, then train on a short track, and finally learn to start from a box.  It is at that point that they are ready to go to the track.  "We call them puppies until they go to the track," Bobby Hibbs says.  "Then they become racers."
<p>So what is a racer?  It is a dog that runs twice a week at speeds over 40 mph around an oval track ranging in length from 5/16 to 9/16 of a mile.  When it isn't racing, it is sleeping.  "They run around a few times and they get to rest for two days.  They're treated like royalty at the track.  Once they get that run in, the time in between, they actually live a lot better than a lot of people do," says Jeanette Hibbs.  Every track employs a veterinarian who examines each dog before every race to make sure it is healthy and fit to run.
<p>If a dog runs well in grade D races, it can move up to C.  And if it does well in C, it'll move up to B and then A, where there is a chance to make some real money for the owner and trainer.  The best dogs run in stake races, with purses of over $100,000.  The biggest purse ever was $130,153 offered in a stake race at the Woodlands in Kansas City, Kansas in 1995.
<p>When a dog's speed begins to fall off by a second or two, it drops from the high grade races to the lower until it is no longer able to compete professionally. That's when the dog gets turned over to a group like GPA/A.  Other dogs that are injured or are no longer able to pass their racing physicals also become eligible for adoption. Most dogs' racing careers last from one to five years.
<p>Turning a racer into a pet isn't always easy. The myths that people believe about greyhounds—that they're vicious (because they wear muzzles when racing) or high-strung—aren't true. But the dogs do have their peculiarities.  Some of them, for  instance, can't be trusted around small animals.  For them the instinct to chase is too strong, and they would never be at home with small dogs or cats.  That's why many groups place the dogs into foster care first, so they can figure out what kind of family would best suit a particular dog.

<h3>Racers Turned Pets</h3>
Liz Sheehan and her husband Kenneth have been greyhound owners for three years.  The young couple live in far northwest Austin, in one of the last subdivisions before the houses end and the prairie begins.  When it comes to the subject of their two greyhounds, Samson, an 80-pound red brindle male, and Hannah, a 55-pound "blue" (actually grey) female, they are passionate.   Liz speaks of the dogs as though they were her children, calling them the "greatest members of our family," and saying "I'm proud of them." 
<p>Although pride seems to be an odd word to use in describing two dogs who loll around the house a good part of the day, Liz talks openly about the changes she's seen them undergo. "Hannah had a wall in front of her. . . .  She didn't like people coming up to her too much.  She was a little afraid.  Anytime you came  too close to her, she would get real scared.  She was real shy in the beginning, but as you can see, she's come out of her shell."  Liz laughs as she adds this last sentence because both Samson and Hannah are aggressively investigating me and my 11-year-old son who is taking pictures.
<blockquote><i><b><big> Despite the commotion, the greyhounds are silent.  They are not given to the inelegant task of barking.  
</big></b></i></blockquote>
<p>"I think probably the best way to describe the transition they make is to say that they come to you as a greyhound,  turn into a dog, and then  into a pet," Liz says.  "These are not the same dogs I got when I first adopted them."  When I ask what that means, Kenneth interjects:  "All they know is a routine.  All of a sudden they don't have a routine anymore, so there is a lot of nervous anxiety.  They don't know what is going on." Samson, the first dog they adopted "did a lot of pacing—he did a lot of investigating.  He had to learn to trust us," Liz says.  After a while "they become more playful. . . .  They start trusting you more. . . ."
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>"There's nothing as thrilling...as actually meeting the breeder somewhere and taking the dogs off the trailer.  There was something about it that I had to kind of hold back my tears."
</big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>Training the big dogs to go to the bathroom outside is probably the easiest task since they are already accustomed to keeping their crates clean.  The Sheehans leave their dogs inside without incident for eight or nine hours at a time while they are at work. But some of the other features of daily life in a house can cause trouble.  "Samson had to be introduced to everything in the house.  TVs were a big thing for him. Most of the greyhounds have not seen anything, they've never been in a home.  Linoleum—he used to be afraid of walking on linoleum floors because at one point in time he kind of lost his grip.  Kenneth used to have to carry him . . . with his paws in the air like a little baby."
<p>Racing greyhounds spend most of their time with other dogs.  While they are talked to and handled by their trainers, they don't get the kind of individual attention a house pet would get.  When they retire, they often become the center of their family's pet universe.  So accustomed has Samson become to attention, that he will actually cry when Liz or Kenneth stop petting him.  Greyhounds also can become lonely if they are the only canines in a family.  When bored, the dogs can get into mischief.    The Sheehans have had to "Samson-proof" the house because he likes to chew things—the television remote control, a cordless phone, books, and paper.   That's why they adopted Hannah, who like "Nameless" had been abandoned at the side of the road in Waco.  Like "Nameless" her tattoos are illegible, so it is impossible to find out where she came from. 
<p>Although the Sheehans are greyhound owners, they actually volunteered for GPA/A before they adopted Samson.  "I was just fascinated with the dogs and I was fascinated with the idea behind the dogs," Liz said.   "I felt it was a good organization—that the concept was very good in terms of finding homes for dogs.  I don't know, there was just something about it that kind of tugged at my heartstrings.  I could make a small difference, even if it was placing a few dogs or taking a few dogs myself.  I could make a difference. That's probably what other people feel as well. That's all that matters to me in the organization—placing the dogs in good homes."
<p>The Sheehans don't have regular contact with the breeders or trainers; that's someone else's job in the organization.  But Liz remembers the first time she accompanied a group to pick up the dogs.  "There's nothing as thrilling . . . as actually meeting the breeder somewhere and taking the dogs off the trailer.  There was something about it that I had to kind of hold back my tears because I looked into their eyes and I saw how afraid they looked and how scared they looked because everything they had known had been taken away from them.  They were so used to their kennels and so used to where they were at, and then when I saw them coming off the truck, it was really a neat feeling knowing that we could make a difference with these dogs and find them great homes." 
<p>And what does GPA/A think about the breeders and trainers they work with? "We've built a relationship with them and it's based on respect and trust.  A lot of them have a really big interest in where their dogs are going, and they've worked with us and know we are going to give the dogs real good homes,"  Liz said. 
<p>GPA/A has placed 500 dogs since 1990 when it was founded.  Last year it placed 81. The organization is partially funded by a $100 adoption fee, which covers the cost of spaying or neutering the dogs, updating their vaccinations, cleaning their teeth, and giving them any other medical attention they need.  One of the chief activities of the organization is spreading the virtues of greyhounds as pets.
<p>Lucy Salsman is one of the dogs' most enthusiastic boosters.    On the day Chuck Hoover, GPA/A's president, brought "Nameless" to her, he also had another recently retired racer that he was delivering to another foster home.  Lucy describes her: "She had a little tiny face, and she was kissing everybody—she was kissing him and kissing me and kissing Chuck.  She was a real sweetheart." Lucy's speech is peppered with words like "precious" and "sweet" when she talks about her dogs.  One of them was named Daisy.  "Daisy would carry a teddy bear everywhere," Lucy said.  "I'd say to her, 'Daisy, go get your baby, go get your baby and carry it.'  And she'd start in the living room and she'd come around the dining room, and around and around she'd go with that teddy bear." Terry, a white and brindle greyhound, prompts Lucy to say with a laugh:  "We should have just called her Terror, but she was precious."  
<p>It was love for greyhounds in particular and the desire to help them that brought Lucy into fostering.  "I'm really happy I got into fostering because I really love these dogs.  They're great.  I just love to do it so much.  I feel like I'm helping to take care of them. They're just so gentle and so nice, and when they get to be part of the family, they're just great."

<h3>Man's Best Friend and Therapist</h3>
Though most greyhound owners brag about the breed's intelligence, the dogs are not suited for every task.  Since they don't bark and are very gentle and submissive, they do not make good watchdogs.  These qualities have, however, prompted  interest in whether greyhounds could make good therapy dogs, ones that work with emotionally and physically disabled people.   Daisy, the dog with the teddy bear, now spends every day in a nursing home where her new owner works.  She visits with the patients until she's had enough, and then goes back to the office where she can be alone. 
<p>The Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital in Wichita, Kansas has two greyhounds that regularly work there.  Meagin is a certified assistance animal.  She has gone through rigorous training and testing so that she has become the arms, so to speak, for her master who is disabled and unable to carry more than five pounds. In addition to that work, she and another younger greyhound, Flo Jo, serve as therapy dogs in the rehabilitation hospital.  According to Linda Mansfield, Director of Clinical Services, Meagin and Flo Jo help stimulate brain-injured patients and motivate those who are beginning a painful course of therapy.  She says sometimes a patient will talk to a dog more readily than to a therapist.  "When people are just starting to recover, they relate better to the dogs,"  Mansfield said.  In her opinion, the dogs are actually performing tasks in the hospital that people could not accomplish.  At this point, the Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital is the only rehab hospital she knows of that uses greyhounds as therapy dogs.  But Mansfield has received inquiries from across the country.  She thinks the dogs' docile nature, especially among older patients, ideally suits them to the task.
<p>Wherever greyhounds go, they get noticed.  In Austin, Ralf and Camille Lukner adopted two retired racers because "we like to rollerblade.  There aren't many dogs that can go that fast."  Since greyhounds are sprinters, though, they don't always make the best running companions, and it turned out that only one of the Lukner's dogs likes to run distances.  Whenever they go skating with the dogs, they attract a lot of attention from other skaters and runners.  People may be cautious because of the dog's size—a male can weigh up to 80 pounds, and a female, 60 pounds, but they all want to know what kind of dog it is.
<p>Lucy Salsman and her husband Frances received similar attention when they traveled with greyhound Joshua to New Hampshire.  At many of the motels, those walking smaller dogs would want to keep away from Joshua, but they also were curious about him.  Many had never seen a greyhound before and others wanted to know how they could adopt.
<p>It is a lot easier to adopt a greyhound now than it used to be.  More and more tracks are running their own programs.  Shoreline Star racetrack in Bridgeport, Connecticut opened its own track-funded program last November, placed its first dog in December, 1995 and by May, 1996 had placed 60 dogs directly and given 12 to 14 others to various adoption groups.  The American Greyhound Council has a web page on the internet, and there are web pages devoted to many other greyhound adoption groups.  By calling the American Greyhound Council's toll-free number, even people in states without racing can get in touch with adoption programs. 
<p>Greyhound adoption has also successfully reduced the number of dogs euthanized, according to industry statistics.  In 1992, 49,000 greyhounds were born, 9,000 were adopted, and 23,000 were euthanized.  In 1993, 43,000 greyhounds were born, 13,000 adopted, and 16,000 euthanized. In 1994, 42,000 were born, 14,000 adopted, and 15,000 euthanized.  Last year, 16,000 were adopted and 12,000 were euthanized.  The trend over the past four years has been for breeders to raise fewer dogs and adopt out more. 
<p>
<blockquote><i><b><big> Meagin and Flo Jo help stimulate brain-injured patients and motivate those who are beginning a painful course of therapy.  She says sometimes a patient will talk to a dog more readily than to a therapist.
</big></b></i></blockquote>
<p>Has the greyhound industry been able to convert its enemies into friends? The Humane Society of the United States still wants to shut the industry down.  Campaign 2000 is an effort to ban racing in every state.  So far, it has been successful in getting greyhound activity, including AKC coursing events, banned in some states where there are no racetracks and no organized opposition. Jacque Schultz, administrator of the Greyhound Adoption Fund for the ASPCA, would also like to shut the industry down, even though her organization benefits from its generosity.  "If I could make greyhound racing shut down tomorrow, I would," she said. But Tim Horan points out, the worst thing for the dogs would be to shut down 52 racetracks.  "Immediately, you'd have [approximately] 150,000 dogs—there would be mass graves.  There aren't enough people to adopt them all." 
<p>The dog racing industry and its critics have agreed upon greyhound adoption, but for somewhat different reasons.  The industry promotes it because it is good for business and the "right thing to do."  Some animal rights advocates support it because they believe they are rescuing animals from an inhumane lifestyle.  Though critics might want ultimately to shut the tracks down, for now the two sides can agree:  Greyhound adoption works and supporting it has been good for the industry, good for the dogs, and good for families that love the dogs.

<b><i>What Health Crisis?</i>

<p><i>The advent of Christian cost-sharing ministries provides a new, viable option to conventional health insurance.</i>
<p>
<p>Jessica was helping her mother hang clothes in the muggy August heat, doing her best to reach the line strung between a hulking pine tree and the old baby-blue house. The Jacksons lived there nearly rent-free, a godsend for the family since father Charles was a seminary student at Jackson, Mississippi's Reformed Theological Seminary. As a home-schooler Jessica pitched in to help around the house as much as possible, but now she needed some help of her own. The clothesline was barely out of reach of her 10-year-old arms. She canvassed the back yard and spied a small plastic play slide, a perfect makeshift stool, she thought. But just after  positioning herself  under the line, the toy slid out from under Jessica's feet. She fell awkwardly on her elbow, sending a sharp pain through her whole arm.
<p>"We heard this shrill scream that we thought was a dog," recalls Jessica's mother, Connie, 36. "Then we looked outside and saw that it was Jessica."
<p>The Jacksons were frantic. 
<p>They put ice on their child's arm. But time and cold compresses did not lessen the pain or inflammation. Finally, they decided to take Jessica to the nearby Baptist Medical Center. The drive was a tense one. Besides worrying for their daughter's welfare, another thought  ran through both Connie and Charles's minds, one not too far from many parents during such times as this: Will our insurance pay?
<p>
<center>*    *    *</center>
<blockquote><big><i>Joe Maxwell is national editor of World magazine. He lives in Madison, Mississippi, with his wife and three boys.  </i></big></blockquote>
<p>
<p>These days, more and more people share a similar story—worrying not only for the welfare of an injured or sick family member, but for the willingness of their health insurer to honor its contract and cover the claim. Moreover, many families today still don't even have medical insurance, making the ride to the hospital even more unnerving. 
<p>More than 40 million Americans lack health insurance, according to 1993 census figures; many of these have jobs that do not offer health coverage; 12 million children like Jessica are not covered, and many don't qualify for Medicaid due to their parents' salary level.
<p>The problem is often twofold: First, there is the growing cost of treatment: In 1972 the per-capita medical expenditure for the average American was $387; that figure jumped to $3,294 by 1993; by the turn of the century, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that number will be at $5,712. Health expenditures nationwide jumped from 7.7 percent of the GNP in 1972 to 13.9 percent in 1993 with projections of 16.4 percent, or $1.6 trillion, by the end of the decade.
<p>A second problem is the lack of portability of health insurance coverage, the vast majority of which is provided to Americans not on an individual basis, but through an employer's plan. Congress has been debating new bills to alleviate skyrocketing premiums and lack of portability. A bill passed 100 to 0 in the Senate and sponsored by Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy seeks to address the problem by creating new federal standards and programs. Yet it is highly questionable whether the plan is desirable: the Senate bill will add to the federal bureaucracy, and it  threatens to force the existing insurance industry to raise premiums to offset the costs of covering those who would have been previously rejected as bad risks.
<p>But there is an exciting option, one that predates the modern health insurance industry but which promises to expand dramatically in the years ahead. These are the growing number of Christian cost-sharing groups in which thousands of people join together to meet not only financial, but also spiritual and emotional burdens.

<p>The digital clock reads 3:45 a.m. and the alarm rings in Joel  Smith's bedroom. He and his wife live a comfortable life in a spacious, modern log-cabin home situated on a forested hill by a fish-stocked lake in north Mississippi. 53-year-old Joel managed a massive manufactured home plant in Lexington, Mississippi for years before moving into the insurance business as a state representative for John Hancock Life Insurance in the early 1980s. For more than a decade now, he has sold life insurance—and health insurance—to scores of Mississippians who trust him for more than just his good business sense. They rely on Joel because he is a licensed minister in the Church of God in Cleveland, Tennessee and the lay-pastor of a rural church of 300 that meets in an attractive prefab log cabin building just down the road from Smith's home.
<p>Each morning, as a ceiling fan whizzes overhead in the dark, the Smiths nudge each other out of bed and onto their knees. On the nightstand next to their king-size bed sits a Bible and Joel's reading glasses. Next to that is a magazine article titled, "The Precious Blood of Jesus," and a digital clock/phone radio.
<p>Their morning routine includes a call to 1-800-PSALM 33 to get a recording of the most urgent requests from their fellow cost-sharing members. The couple is soon deep into prayer for people they've never met but with whom they share a common bond and commitment. The Smiths are spending an early Friday morning praying for the members of their Christian health care group who have suffered sickness or injury requiring them to file claims. The members of the Melbourne Florida-based Christian Care Medi-Share Program to which the Smiths belong conduct a 24-hour prayer chain, seven days a week for those participants facing needs. More importantly, people involved in the program also write each month to other group members with  needs.
<p>"The whole thing to me is based on life-style," says Joel, as he  sits with his legs crossed in the foyer of his church, a Bible on one side of the table in front of him, a calendar listing his insurance sales calls on the other. "It's incumbent on every member to be responsible and honest."
<p>Responsibility and honesty, says Joel, are too often lacking in how individuals treat their conventional health insurance plans today. By contrast, the Smith's Christian Care Medi-Share program emphasizes conscientious self-monitoring. Moreover, it offers members 100 percent coverage for less each month than most conventional group insurance—a little less than  $200 per family.
<p>Over the last half-decade, several Christian cost-sharing groups resembling the Christian Care Medi-Share group have sprung up. They include: Samaritan Ministries in Greenfield, Indiana; the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter in Barberton, Ohio; All Saints in Tyler, Texas; and Helping Hands in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 
<p>While specifics vary from group to group, these Christian cost-sharing groups all share a basic philosophy summarized  in Galatians 6:2: "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ." Without exception, these are groups of Christians banded together  to care for one another.
<p>"In our nation's past, our forefathers were quite familiar with bearing one another's burdens," states a brochure published by one cost-sharing group, Samaritan Ministries. "Today, our mentality is far from that of our ancestors. We still have the mandate to bear one another's burdens, but we hardly know what that means anymore. If our barn burns down or an emergency medical problem arises, the insurance company takes care of it and our friends, relatives and neighbors have little participation in restoring us to our former state. We don't need each other in the way we used to. We're not knocking insurance companies—we're merely saying there is a better way for Christians who desire to minister to the body of Christ while  providing for their own medical needs and being thrifty with their money."
<p>The Smiths' membership in the Florida-based Christian Care Medi-Share Program resembles other Christian care groups in its operation:
<ul>
<li>Potential members are screened to validate a sincere Christian commitment; some groups accomplish this by requiring membership in a local church and attendance at least three out of every four Sundays; others simply interview an applicant's pastor to verify the person's faith in Christ.
<li>Once accepted, a member enjoys coverage usually equal to or exceeding that offered by most conventional employer-provided plans. 
<li>The Christian Care Medi-Share plan is as follows:  After a $250 deductible, 100 percent coverage is provided up to $1 million at a monthly cost of $85 per member, $150 for two persons, and $195 per family of three or more. Eight-five percent of a monthly family membership fee of $195 goes to pay the medical bills of another member that month, 6 percent is used for processing needs/claims, and 9 percent is used for administrative costs and disease prevention education. 
<li>Every Christian care ministry stipulates that membership is contingent upon living a healthy life-style. This means not smoking, not using illegal drugs, and not engaging in sex outside of marriage. Several groups, including the largest—Christian Brotherhood Newsletter—prohibit any drinking, while others including the Christian Care Medi-Share Program permit it in moderation. 
<p>These ministries point to widely published statistics indicating that up to 80 percent of all diseases result from the consequences of life-style choices. The American Medical Association estimates that up to 40 percent of all hospital patients are treated for problems resulting from alcoholism; the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services in 1993 reported that $188 billion is spent each year on health care resulting from unhealthy life-styles leading to high rates of cancer, accidents, AIDS and heart disease. 
<p>Such figures account for many of the hefty increases in conventional health insurance premiums in recent years. Proponents of Christian cost-sharing ministries say they shouldn't have to support the destructive life-styles of others with their premium dollars. 
<p>Says John Reinhold, president of the Christian Care Medi-Share (CCMS): "Our members believe in sharing and caring, but they do not wish to subsidize those . . . who choose to live in a way which inevitably leads to a premature breakdown in mind and body, i.e. using tobacco, abusing chemicals and toxic substances, taking drugs, gluttony."
<p>Christian cost-sharing groups encourage self-regulation by their members.  Christian care groups rely on individual members to screen their medical bills for excess and mistaken charges, a practice often indirectly discouraged by conventional health insurance plans—government or private—where participants take the attitude of "getting back from the system everything they have paid in over the years."
<p>When a member incurs a need—which conventional insurance would call a claim—he reports it to his cost-sharing group's national office. Some, like the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, "publish" the needs of their members in a monthly newsletter, assigning each member a specific person to pray for and to receive his monthly support check. Each member then mails a monthly membership fee directly to the member whose need they've been assigned, along with a card or letter of encouragement.  Other groups including CCMS let members send their monthly dues to the main office, which then redistributes the resources to those particular members with needs. Members receive a note about the specific person and need to whom their monthly dues are applied, and they are encouraged to write and pray for their recovery.

<p>Abby Van Ness sat at her computer and pecked away at her homeschool assignment—writing an encouraging note to the woman who was receiving her family's monthly support check. 
<p>
Dear Miss/Mrs. Gillespie,
<p>My name is Abby Van Ness. I am 10 years old. I will be 11 on June 24th. My family is supporting you this month. I hope that you recover soon from the automobile accident. It must be very painful and I don't think I would like it if I were in the situation that you are in now. I am praying for you and the Lord is watching over you. Now, I'll tell you a little bit more about myself. My father is the pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Lexington, Mississippi. My mother is an Ocupational (sic) Therapist. She works at

Heritage Manor in Greenwood, Mississippi. She works NORMALLY (emphasis is original) two days a week. But that's about to change. I have two sisters and one baby brother. His name is Peter. (Besides his nicknames, middle name, and last name.) My oldest younger sister is named Kate. (Her full name is Mollie Kate Van Ness.) My other sister's name is Sarah. (HER full name is Sarah Rose Van Ness.) Peter is only one so he's not old enough to have any hobbies. Kate loves to sing. She is 7 years old. Sarah is 4 years old and is at an acting silly age. My hobbies are: Reading, Swimming, and acting. I think that one of them later might be: Running Track. I can run half a mile in about four minutes and 37 seconds! I'm going to run a race against my aunt. She's very athletic. She says an eight minute mile is good. Well, hope you enjoyed reading this letter!

Abby Van Ness
<p>
<p>No conventional health insurance provider could offer this kind of personal service. Abby's mother, Jody, smiles as she discusses her belief in the Christian cost-sharing concept; she is conservative-to-the-core, and she likes playing an active role in her health coverage, both spiritual and financially. An occupational therapist in the Mississippi Delta, Jody says she regularly sees how medical groups routinely overcharge insurance companies for their services. "I am overpaid, by far," she says.
<p>By contrast, Jody's cost-sharing group asks her to be wise in how she files needs/claims, and to scrutinize her medical bills for errors or overcharges. The fact that she and other members of her Christian cost-sharing group have an active claim in the financial interest of their organization is a strong incentive for each member to work to keep costs down. "I see the waste when health coverage is done with other people's money," she says, sitting outside her Lexington, Mississippi, house, watching one of her girls climb an old magnolia tree. A mongrel squirrel dog named Charlie rests nearby in the cool dirt. "I believe that I know enough to spend enough to take care of my children wisely."
<p>In this sense, health insurance has always boiled down to this philosophical question—who can best care for prioritizing an individual's health needs—the individual, or an impersonal company or government agency? 
<p>
<a name="care"></a>
<h3>Taking Care of One Another</h3>
<p>Some form of health insurance has been in existence for centuries. The ancient Chinese were thought to pay their local doctor during times of health so that he would care for them during times of sickness. Ancient Greeks had benevolent societies in which members pooled resources for medical care; Rome adopted the practice. Early Christian records indicate church members cared for each other physically and financially, as well as spiritually. And in medieval Europe, members of trade guilds foreshadowed employer group insurance, caring for each others' needs during times of sickness. 
<p>Health insurance in its modern form, however, is a relatively new phenomenon, developing long after American companies were offering marine, fire, and life insurance to customers. 
<p>Modern insurance in the United States began when individuals "wrote their names under" an agreement—thus the term, "underwriter"—promising to pay a certain sum if a ship met with disaster on the ocean. In exchange, they gained an interest in the potential profits the ship's cargo might bring. A mariner would get numerous underwriters to help absorb risks, which soon became actuarially calculable. 
<p>With time and growing expertise in the mathematics of calculating risk and statistical odds, groups of people organized to insure not only the risks of marine travel, but also risk of the destruction of businesses and neighborhoods by fire. The Friendly Society for the Mutual Insuring of Houses Against Fire was created by a royal charter in 1735 in Charleston, South Carolina. Benjamin Franklin founded the Philadelphia Contributorship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire, in 1752. And by 1759, the Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia banded together to form the country's first life insurance corporation, which still exists today as the Presbyterian Ministers' Fund. 
<p>When it came to health and accident insurance, however, there was little movement for decades. In the days of primitive medical knowledge and skill, people remained well-served by neighborly care and generosity; hospitalization and the rampant rise in costs of medicine and services were a thing of the future. The first medical insurance—a sickness policy—appears to have been offered by the Massachusetts Health Insurance Company in 1847 in Boston. The policy covered treatment of that day's major infirmities. The first accident policy was apparently offered by the Travelers Insurance Company to James Bolter.  For $5000 it insured his walk home from the post office. Bolter's monthly premium? Two cents. Fraternal Benefit Societies became the first real purveyors of group health coverage: the Ancient Order of United Workmen, founded in 1868,  is generally credited with being the nation's first fraternal insurance company. Other groups followed, including the Sons of Norway in 1895, the Aid Association for Lutherans in 1899, and the Catholic Knights of Columbus Insurance Society.
<p>By the advent of this century, nearly 50 companies sold accident policies, since accidents were actuarially predictable. Sickness, on the other hand, was not—statistics were still sketchy—and companies steered clear of offering sickness policies. With the onset of the Great Depression, however, hospitals and doctors found themselves treating hundreds of patients who had lost their capacity to pay for health services. The medical community responded by creating the nonprofit Blue Cross, offered by hospitals, and Blue Shield, offered by physicians. The first such group is traceable to a schoolteachers' organization in Dallas that worked with Baylor University to arrange for monthly prepayments for future hospital and physician care. 
<p>Private, for-profit insurance companies took note. Until then, they offered only life, fire, and marine insurance, along with crop and other casualty policies. But with the growing progress in statistical calculation, and the budding success of group health plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, commercial companies began seeing the profit to be made in insuring health as well. Moreover, with the advent of the two world wars, big employers began to offer what is now considered commonplace: group policies for their employees.
<p>Such group plans allowed for maximum purchasing and insuring power at the minimum cost. Companies offered group policies in part because skilled labor was scarce in war times and competition for good workers was high; offering group coverage was a means to recruit the best workers. Group plans also offered a nice tax deduction at a time when American corporations were facing ever-growing tax burdens. Moreover, the Supreme Court ruled just after WW II that health insurance was a legitimate bargaining chip in labor-management negotiations.

<h3>A New Way of Thinking</h3>
Whether private or public, for-profit or not-for-profit, group health insurance was becoming a fixture in the United States. And it didn't take long for Americans to develop a whole new attitude toward caring for their health needs. They dropped their long-held reliance on neighbors, church, and the kindness of local doctors in favor of coverage by impersonal insurance plans. By 1940, the nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield in America estimated that it had 4 million clients, compared to 1.2 million using commercial health insurance services. But by 1951, the situation was reversed, and the commercial companies surpassed the nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield groups in number. As of 1950, 77 million people had some form of hospitalization coverage.
<p>Since WW II, commercial health insurance, along with the government's own insurance plans—Medicaid and Medicare—have grown rapidly and adapted to the needs of the market. Hospitalization plans expanded first: by 1970, about 70 percent of all private expenses for hospital care and more than 40 percent of all doctors' expenses were covered by voluntary insurance. Soon, "major medical" policies were created by commercial companies to insure individuals for a maximum amount of coverage minus a preset deductible. 
<p>Another trend has developed: some companies are now self-insuring, offering their own employees coverage instead of purchasing it from an outside company. Often companies who self-insure cite actuarial figures for their employee base showing less health risk than the average American. These companies therefore conclude they shouldn't have to pay higher rates to subsidize the unhealthy life-styles of an insurer's other clients. That, they say, is just good business. Only a half-century ago health insurance plans were considered a luxury. Now they are touted by some as a fundamental "right."

<h3>Alternative Life-styles</h3>
John Reinhold enjoyed a long, successful career as a businessman and charity fund-raiser before founding the Christian Care Medi-Share in 1992. He and well-known Christian financial counselor and author Larry Burkett headed up the Great Commission Foundation for Campus Crusade for Christ that sought to raise $1 billion for the organization. With time, Reinhold began contributing his talents to the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, recruiting new members in the Florida area. Then he and a group of Christians launched their own cost-sharing group, the Christian Care Medi-Share group, styled along the same lines as CBN but with some minor adjustments.
<p>Ironically one day a CCMS ministry executive approached Reinhold. "[He] informed me that my weight made me ineligible for our ministry of sharing," recalls Reinhold. "You see, we have thousands of members who share each other's medical bills, and there are certain restrictions voted by the members so that we are in compliance with biblical life-styles. So here I was, one of the key players who formalized the sharing program, exempted from the ministry sharing."
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>Most of the Christian cost-sharing groups encourage healthy living, but don't cram it down members' throats. </big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>Since then Reinhold has taken stock of his own nutritional needs. He's lost more than 70 pounds, enabling him to go off of prescription drugs and relieving his problems with arthritis and his heart condition. Today, Reinhold, along with several medically trained CCMS members, writes a column in the quarterly Christian Care Medi-Share's newsletter on improving members' nutrition and living healthier life-styles.  Helping One Another offers health quizzes and reviews books on the effects of over-eating and using caffeine.
<p>Most of the Christian cost-sharing groups encourage healthy living, but don't cram it down members' throats. Says Reinhold, "There are some basic things that we can do to make positive changes in our lives to better serve our Lord as well as assist in holding our monthly costs in line."
<p>Reinhold points to figures showing that those living and eating according to biblical ideals live longer and better. For instance,  Reinhold asserts, Seventh-Day Adventists live an average of seven to nine years longer than other evangelicals, due mostly to observing nutrition tips from the Old Testament forbidding eating pork. Fifty percent or more of Adventists are lacto-vegetarians, as well. Life-style, life-style, life-style forms the heart of Christian cost-sharing ministries' success and attraction.
<p>Several years ago, Christian journalist and author Ken Walker began lamenting the fact that his dollars were going to support the unbiblical life-styles of others. When his wife left her job to work in a ministry, the couple was left without health insurance, so Walker began investigating available major medical plans. One insurer's representative casually lamented that her insurance company would not subsidize her birth control pills, "but they will pay for my abortion."
<p>"Those words cut into me like a knife," recalls Walker. "I realized this company wasn't unique; most health insurance plans follow these and other ill-advised policies. I didn't want to participate and, no matter how indirectly, subsidize such practices."
<p>After contact with Larry Burkett's staff,  Walker looked into the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter. He was pleased with what he found. The group did not offer coverage for abortion or unwed pregnancies. Moreover, the Walkers liked the fact that their monthly checks were sent directly to another member who had a "published" need, putting the Walkers directly in contact every month with another Brotherhood member both financially and in prayer. 
<p>This philosophy of mutual care and concern is based in Christian teaching as old as the institutional church itself. And while Reinhold and several other groups have modified the idea first set forth by the Illinois-based Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, CBN remains the largest cost-sharing group, with 80,000 members. CBN founder Bruce Hawthorne started his program after experiencing the concept of Christian care in his own life. Hawthorne's 16-year-old daughter died in a car wreck, then three medical emergencies involved his other children, and finally Hawthorne's wife and another daughter died accidentally the next year. Hawthorne, who at the time worked at the Barberton, Ohio Rescue Mission, was left with $54,000 in hospital bills, and could only seek the aid of local believers. He mailed a request for material help to each of the 13,000 people listed on the rescue mission's mailing list. Forty-five days later, he'd accumulated enough money to offset his bills. 
<p>"When I should have been at the very bottom emotionally, I was experiencing spiritual and emotional elation," he said in an October 1995 article in Sound Mind Investing. "I realized that there was a need for [this] if for no other reason, for the support that one needs while going through a tragedy."

<h3>In Good Hands</h3>
The most important question for insurance consumers is this: Will the policy pay? That's what ran through Charles and Connie Jackson's minds as they drove their little girl, Jessica, to the hospital to repair her broken elbow. When they arrived at the emergency room, an attendant asked Charles to provide some health history on Jessica. Charles sat  nervously waiting as the clerk requested proof of his health coverage.  He pulled out his wallet and handed the clerk an attractive plastic card provided by his cost-sharing ministry—The Christian Care Medi-Share Association.
<p>"It just looks like any other insurance care," Charles recalls. "They just took it and Xeroxed it."
<p>Charles thought for a moment that he might offer an explanation concerning the group's novel approach, but decided against it. He realized the clerk showed no signs of skepticism. She was processing his claim like any other. "She didn't ask, so I didn't offer," says Charles.
<p>Charles' cost-sharing ministry boasts that, "to-date, no member has ever been refused treatment by any medical entity." In some instances, members have routed questions from their medical provider to the group's home office via a toll-free number. In every case the medical provider's concern was addressed: Will this coverage pay? Numerous state insurance regulators have challenged the concept of Christian cost-sharing ministries, but without success. Eight states have actually passed laws exempting cost-sharing groups from insurance regulation. In Florida, such groups are regulated under charitable solicitation laws.
<p>Jessica Jackson's  parents paid the first $250 of her medical bill as a deductible, and then the Christian Care Medi-Share group picked up about another $700 in expenses. The couple says they are now convinced not only of the biblical-basis for cost-sharing but of its practicality as well
<p>There is one other benefit. For every thousand families who join the Jackson's group, Christian Care Medi-Share, at least $2 million of their after-tax income is kept out of the current "health-care machine," notes CCMS membership chairman Robert Dixon.  He adds, "Those who join are grateful that behind us is a multi-million dollar 'safety-net' and beneath us are the everlasting arms."

<h2>A Century of Service: Palmer Home for Children</h2>
By Joe Maxwell
<P>
Easter 1907 had just passed and summer was at hand. The lawn surrounding
Palmer Orphanage's two large brick buildings was a carpet of green,
&quot;so inviting to the little ones,&quot; wrote Florence Foster
Frierson, the orphanage's head matron and the wife of Palmer superintendent
William V. Frierson.
<P>
Mrs. Frierson was a devout Presbyterian who loved watching a summer
rainstorm, seeing new growth break through the Mississippi soil,
or hearing children recite their catechism from beginning to end
for the very first time.
<P>
On this April day, she rode to the local train station with a
cheerful heart. But in seconds, it was broken. Mrs. Frierson heard
a baby cry and ran to the arriving train: there the frail form
of a dying woman trembled as she descended the train steps. Two
&quot;older tots&quot; stayed close by her; a man accompanied
them, carrying a crying infant. &quot;My heart leaped into my
throat, and for a moment I seemed ready to yield to a flood of
tears,&quot; Mrs. Frierson recalled.
<P>
A Christian mother, ill with cancer, was bringing her children
to the Palmer Orphanage. &quot;These three little girls, although
badly spoiled having had a sick mother so long are promising children,&quot;
reported Mrs. Frierson. As the mother bid her offspring good-bye,
Mrs. Frierson could only watch and pray. Then the woman turned
to Mrs. Frierson and, with tears streaming down her face, made
this last request: &quot;Teach my children to meet me in heaven.&quot;
<P>
Palmer Home for Children in Columbus, Mississippi has a glorious,
gut-wrenching, and godly history filled with countless true stories
of God's awesome and sometimes awful movements among his people,
of men and women committed to his service, and of children always
the children who have formed the heart and soul of Palmer Home.
<P>
More than one hundred years after its founding in 1895, many incidentals
about Palmer Home have changed. But, remarkably, despite the flux
of American and church history, its essence remains intact.
<P>
Today, Palmer Home mends the scars of and models evangelical Christian
values to some seventy-five boys and girls from broken or needy
homes. As pundits and policymakers debate the &quot;issue&quot;
of childcare and consider the &quot;options,&quot; Palmer Home
offers the reality of a century's experience in long-term residential
group childcare.
<P>
Orphanages established by Christian communities were popular refuges
for children in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
(There were as many as 1,000 in America in 1919.) But they fell
from favor, and foster care programs regulated by secular governments
took their place. By the 1960s and 70s, the vast majority of orphanages
had closed, and their children were placed in foster care, a system
which often handled them as players in a game of musical chairs.
Remarkably, Palmer Home for Children survived.
<P>
Three distinct periods characterize the existence of Palmer Home.
In some measure, they reflect larger historical developments in
the nation and in attitudes toward child welfare. Palmer was founded
in the post-Civil War South, a traumatic period of economic poverty
and racial segregation, but deep religious faith. Its growth under
superintendent John Frierson, responded to the rise of Progressivism,
the Great Depression, and two world wars. Palmer's current character
was forged in the post-war years as a New South overcame racial
divisions and social isolation. Despite government's burgeoning
role in the work of child welfare, which has threatened to undermine
local initiatives and religious authority, Palmer Home has retained
its independence as a faith-based charity supported by voluntary
gifts and bequests.
<P>
Here is its story.
<P>
<B>Palmer's Founding: A Charity in the Post-Civil War South</B>

<P>
Palmer Orphanage, now Palmer Home for Children, was founded by
William States Jacobs, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church
of Columbus, Mississippi, a small town in the northeastern part
of the state. The son of the founder of South Carolina's Thornwell
Orphanage, he challenged his congregation to start its own orphanage
which he named after Benjamin Morgan Palmer, a leading Southern
Presbyterian churchman.
<P>
Palmer received its charter on April 29, 1895. Fifteen acres of
land were purchased and by 1898 a two-story building was erected
at a cost of $3,000. Records show that every congregation in town,
including the Jewish synagogue, helped in the construction, as
did a &quot;committee of outsiders,&quot; interested citizens
not involved in church affairs. By 1904, 45 boys and girls were
living separately in the two buildings. Palmer Orphanage was debt-free.
<P>
A year later, Civil War veteran William Frierson became Palmer
Orphanage's third superintendent. Frierson had fought in the Battle
of Gettysburg where he was wounded and captured by Union forces.
An ordained preacher advanced in years when he arrived at Palmer,
Frierson was a tough and principled Southern Calvinist. With his
wife Florence, he established the moral tone and the philosophical
backbone of Palmer Orphanage.
<P>
In their newsletter, <I>The Charity Ledger</I>, William Frierson
laid down the priorities of the orphanage: &quot;First, the material
interests of the home must be looked after. . . . Second, the
spiritual interests of our children must not be neglected. The
head and the heart both need cultivation. . . . Besides the regular
morning and evening devotional exercises, our children attend
Sunday school and preaching at the Presbyterian church where their
advantages are first class.&quot;
<P>
For the next 70 years Palmer's children would sing in the Columbus
First Presbyterian Church choir. They would attend its Sunday
services and comprise much of its youth group. Their social life
would center on church activities.
<P>
The children were clearly the delight of the Friersons and the
matrons who assisted them. The orphanage soon took on the feel
of a family. One pastor from Vicksburg dropped off four children
and stayed for two days. He would write: &quot;I have never seen
a healthier or happier looking lot of children. . . . What pleased
me most was the family-like atmosphere of it and the absence of
that machinelike government that may be seen in so many institutions.
I noticed that the children ran over to your house whenever they
felt like it with the same confidence that any little child runs
to its father's house.&quot;
<P>
Early records show that the matrons made Palmer a home. Miss Pressly,
the little boys' matron, took her boys for walks to the Tombigbee
River. Other matrons took girls and boys on picnics in the woods,
gathering flowers and berries, and singing songs. Both child and
adult at Palmer Orphanage enjoyed the country. Life was simple,
and it was governed by the seasons and the weather more than we
can imagine.
<P>
One day Florence Frierson watched as Miss Pressly said good-bye
to two young boys. She was to begin her one month's summer leave.
(Imagine 70 children, three caretakers, and no air-conditioning!)
Miss Pressly walked to the front gate, kissed the two boys good-bye,
and turned away. One child, William, called out, &quot;Miss Pressly!&quot;
and ran to kiss her yet again.
<P>
Donors were faithful to Palmer Orphanage in those early days,
and improvements were made to the campus. By 1909, there were
67 children. Palmer had almost two girls for every boy in 1911.
These ratios varied, but they reflected the greater mobility of
older boys who could leave and move into the world to find manual
work. In 1912, expenditures overtook receipts by $1,212 and the
trustees became concerned as the orphanage began to run a constant
debt. By 1915, with the Kaiser on the march and cotton at five
cents a pound, one report noted the campus was &quot;beginning
to suffer from want of repairs.&quot;
<P>
The elderly Friersons' letters to supporters were filled with
gentle but urgent pleas for monetary as well as prayer support.
As if to deny the effects of time and the scarcity of resources,
Florence observed in one: &quot;In talking with one of our faithful
workers yesterday, we agreed that we would look no longer at circumstances,
and would put discouragement behind us, while we labor on for
these little ones.&quot;
<P>
John Frierson, the son of William and Florence, could tell that
his parents needed him and that it was time to return to them.
A successful lawyer and teacher in Port Gibson, a town in southwestern
Mississippi near the Mississippi River, he bid his friends good-bye
and joined his parents at Palmer in 1910.
<P>
A 1912 note from John Frierson to supporters suggests the orphanage's
plight: &quot;From a human standpoint the outlook is cloudy. The
close of the fiscal year for . . . 1911 found us several hundred
dollars in debt, due to the falling off of receipts during the
summer months, our increased expenses for necessary improvements,
failure of [a] well, confinement in [the] hospital of [a] child
for months, and other things. . . . Unless our friends come up
more generously to our help, the balance will be against us before
the end of March. . . . Friends, the work is yours. We are your
servants.&quot;
<P>
<B>The John Frierson Years: A Standard-Bearer for Troubled Times</B>

<P>
Pete Robinson didn't mind the mile walk to school over hilly roads
that often were dusty or muddy. For decades, he and other Palmer
children did a lot of walking. But on this day Pete, a sparkplug
of a teenager, was making a different trek, one that surely caused
his bones to quiver more than any nail-driving tackle he endured
quarterbacking Columbus' high school football team.
<P>
Pete made his way downtown to the law offices of John Frierson
near the First Presbyterian Church, where the Palmer children
regularly attended. Before he knew it, he was being greeted by
a secretary. &quot;Have a seat and let me go get Mr. John,&quot;
she said. Before he could get comfortable, Mr. John beckoned.
<P>
By this time, around the 1930s, &quot;Mr. John&quot; had grown
to be a thin, tall man with a wrinkled face, drooping jowls, and
a slightly pointed head, all of which was covered by his magnificent,
perfectly combed, gray hair. The bachelor-lawyer and full-time
surrogate father of hundreds was a portrait of Presbyterian distinction.
<P>
He removed his glasses and took time to talk a bit with Pete about
his transgression. Mr. John was calm and gentle. He cared about
each child. But Pete had broken the rules, and he knew full well
the consequences.
<P>
Mr. John took off his belt and applied it to Pete's backside.
The high-school quarterback, who was recently inducted into the
National Wrestling Hall of Fame, never doubted he warranted the
licks and felt he profited from them. It often hurt much more
just to disappoint Mr. John. Pete and other boys would say routinely
for years to come: &quot;I never got a whippin' I didn't deserve.&quot;
<P>
Frierson also understood, however, that children deserved support
and encouragement, even when they acted impulsively. Once, in
December of 1935, a girl left Palmer and married a boy without
telling Mr. John, who was concerned when he heard of the girl's
choice in mates. Nonetheless, he wrote her a letter that said
this, in part:
<P>
&quot;<I>Of course we were all surprised and shocked to hear of
your marriage and I regret the manner in which it occurred. It
is the first time that we have had a run away marriage. It was
altogether unnecessary on this occasion. I have always dealt openly
and frankly with all you children. You were old enough to marry
and make up your own mind and if you had told me that you were
going to marry and had made up your mind to marry I would have
gone with you to stand by you on such an occasion. I want you
to know of my love and affection and continued interest for your
happiness.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;I sincerely hope that you will think seriously and put
into practice all the principles of righteousness and faith and
trust that we have endeavored to instill through all these years.
You will need them now, more than ever, and if you and [your husband]
determine upon the course of life that the Bible maps out you
can succeed and get along, live useful lives and be happy.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;I am enclosing to you a check for $10 with love and good
wishes embraced therein. Sidney will get your things together
and send them to you wherever you are.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;With sincere love and prayers for your welfare, I am,</I>
<P>
<I>Your friend,</I>
<P>
<I>John Frierson&quot;</I> 
<P>
Experiencing a consistent and caring discipline, many children
came to realize that they had stumbled upon a prize living out
in that cow pasture-turned-orphanage: a lanky, loving man who
was there for them in good times and bad. John Frierson, in this
sense, was the standard at Palmer Home for Children against whom
all others would be measured. He was the benchmark of consistency,
selflessness, and caring.
<P>
Frierson was Mississippi's representative to the White House Conference
on Child Health and Protection called by President Hoover and
held in Washington, D.C. in 1930. By this time, a new class of
&quot;professional&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; social workers
was calling for federal aid and action to develop comprehensive
codes governing the supervision and support of children who had
no homes. They argued that traditional, church-run efforts were
sentimental and sloppy. And they were hostile to orphanages. Men
like Charles Loring Brace, founder of the New York Children's
Aid Society, attacked orphanages for what he considered their
&quot;institutionalization&quot; of children. He and others campaigned
for what has become the modern system of foster-care placement.
The novelist Theodore Dreiser, the editor of <I>The Delineator</I>
women's magazine from 1907-1909, urged systematic government involvement
in childcare and published case histories of children offered
for adoption.
<P>
Frierson's correspondence makes clear that he didn't like it.
Frierson's words concerning the growing role of government in
caring for children seem almost prophetic today. &quot;I became
convinced and am still convinced that the adoption plan is wrong
for an orphanage. . . . There is no assurance of any religious
influence,&quot; he wrote. Government rule-making, he felt, practically
guaranteed that there would be no serious regard for religion
in the character formation and moral upbringing of children.
<P>
John Frierson was more than just a local lawyer with some ideas
about church and government. He was a scholar of Latin and the
classics, a reciter of good poetry, and a principled civic leader
who matched wits with the notorious Mississippi governor Theodore
Bilbo, who once called Frierson a &quot;pious, church-fed hypocrite&quot;
after Frierson dealt him a minor political defeat.
<P>
In one unfortunate respect, Frierson was a man of his time and
place, accepting racial segregation as a fact of life. But unlike
Bilbo's determined efforts to inflame racial hatreds, Frierson's
strong Christian convictions however tainted by cultural dictates prompted
him to treat all men and women with respect. Palmer's charter
establishing a home for &quot;white orphans or children of reputable
character, one of whom is dead&quot; was changed to admit black
children in the early 1970s. Palmer's present administration is
committed to serving children of all racial backgrounds, and three
black children currently live at the home.
<P>
Palmer's children surely knew little of the South's tortuous path
toward racial justice. Instead, each morning they saw Mr. John
walk up and down their ranks as they stood for inspection before
school outside the Lindamood building, named for a local donor.
And in the evening, they could hear the operas that he played
on his record player. The girls would entertain their boyfriends
in Mr. John's parlor as he read in a chair nearby. And anyone
was welcome to borrow books from his personal collection.
<P>
The campus was increasing in size and scope. By 1929, Mr. John
reported that the Palmer Orphanage comprised 110 acres, four brick
buildings, one brick laundry, a brick dairy, two good barns, a
smokehouse, and &quot;a splendid herd of Jersey cows.&quot; &quot;The
properties are worth $80,000,&quot; he stated, while the yearly
deficit had grown to $7,888.90.
<P>
In 1931, Palmer Orphanage was in the same shape structurally.
But the financial ruin of the Great Depression was hitting more
than New York stockbrokers. Mr. John found more and more destitute
children knocking on his door, and the care for a typical child
cost $20 a month. He told a church synod meeting in 1931: &quot;We
have not increased our capacity for children and do not intend
to, but it [is] impossible for us to deny children who need these
benefits when we have a place to put them.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Rhythm of Life at Palmer Home</B> 
<P>
A day in the life of Palmer Home remained pretty much the same
for decades. The rooster crowed before sunrise, waking the sleepy
girls in the Lindamood building and the boys in two nearby buildings.
By five o'clock or shortly thereafter, several older boys were
walking through the muggy darkness to the back barn, where they
milked a herd of dairy cowswhich they often named after the girls.
In the days before refrigeration the boys would fill large milk
pails and place them in a three foot-deep cement trough filled
with cold artesian water.
<P>
Meanwhile, teams of older girls worked in rotation on monthly
assignments, rising early to make biscuits and toast. There was
hired help, too. As Mr. John recalled in his memoirs:
<P>
&quot;A negro woman was the cook, with the help of the older girls
to bring in the food to the table and to wash the dishes after
meals. A negro man for the garden and lot, and three older boys
to milk the cows. There were coal fires in grates, the coal had
to be carried up stairs to the rooms, and the ashes brought down.
The lighting was by oil lamps and the wicks were trimmed daily
and the chimneys cleaned.&quot;
<P>
At six o'clock a bell would ring. The girls would break their
huddle by the floor heater where they were memorizing their daily
Scripture or catechism, and then everyone would converge on the
dining hall. Girls wearing pants or curlers were sent back upstairs
to change. Miss Clara Swoope, Miss Zina Witherspoon, or another
of the matrons would hear children recite their &quot;memory work&quot;
for the day. After recitation, the children could enter the dining
hall, sit down, and wait.
<P>
Ring! Mr. John struck his bell and called for silence, then a
blessing was offered and the eating began. &quot;Watch the milk
this morning,&quot; one boy might whisper, &quot;the cows have
been eating the bitter weed!&quot; After breakfast, Mr. John read
a Scripture for the day from his Bible. Then everyone sang a song
and were adjourned for school. Before departure, they reassembled
in front of Lindamood, where Mr. John reviewed their appearance.
<P>
Then off to school. In its first decade, Palmer established its
own two-room schoolhouseone room for the boys, the other for the
girls. But by Mr. John's time, all Palmer children were attending
local public schools, and stories abound of friendships made with
children from town. Palmer children were invited to local family
homes and participated in all school activities.
<P>
After school, a few boys stayed for sports practice, but most
children returned home and did chores: girls shucking corn or
shelling beans around the house; the boys in the gardens or among
the livestock. On Saturdays, for years, the girls scrubbed the
stove, piece by piece, and cleaned chickens for Sunday dinner.
<P>
At six o'clock in the evening another bell rang, and the children
reassembled for supper, after which Mr. John read to them from
whatever book he might be consuming, perhaps <I>The Black Rose</I>
or <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>.
<P>
All agreed that it was wonderful listening to Mr. John read: &quot;He
had a good, solid presentation voice,&quot; recalled Pete Robinson,
who came to Palmer at six years of age in 1926 after his father
was killed working in a lumberyard.
<P>
Often the sound of Mr. John's firm voice was all a child needed
for motivation. Billy Wray, who attended Palmer from 1930 until
1943, recalls the day the boys chose to swim at the river instead
of work on the farm. That evening Mr. John announced, &quot;Well,
I drove around Bolin's Bend this afternoon and I noticed more
grass than corn down there.&quot; Mr. John's voice made its point.
&quot;The next day we were down there getting the grass out of
the corn,&quot; recalled Wray in an interview.
<P>
Nights were spent at study hall, or in sitting and talking and
watching younger children play jacks on the sidewalk. Often Mr.
John would have children over to help them with their studies.
&quot;We would go over at night for him to help us with our homework,&quot;
recalled Evelyn McPhail, now a co-chairman of the Republican National
Committee who works with RNC chairman Haley Barbour. McPhail grew
up at Palmer in the 1940s and 50s. &quot;We'd be waiting our turn;
you'd sit on a little stool at his feet, and he would take the
book and sit there and help you with your Latin lessons.&quot;
<P>
Mr. John doled out the discipline according to the sex of the
offender. While boys might feel the sting of a curtain sash, girls
were rarely physically punished. They were made to sit with Mr.
John at his house and listen to classical music! One thing was
clear: mutual love and respect always prevailed. Perhaps no event
better illustrates this than one of the sadder moments in Palmer's
life: it was 1935, and Matron Clara Swoope was dying. Mr. John
recounted it this way:
<P>
&quot;I came home from Jackson one Friday night in 1935. After
breakfast Miss Clara followed me to my house and said, `Mr. John,
I went to see Dr. Lehmberg while you were gone and he told me
I was going to be sick. I want you and him to talk and tell me
what I must do.'&quot;
<P>
Mr. John and the doctor agreed that, in her late stage of cancer,
she should forgo treatment. He offered her a room at his house,
but the other matrons decided to set up Miss Clara in her own
room at the head of the stairs. Some days passed, and Miss Clara's
condition worsened. A local pastor came to visit and pray with
her. &quot;I think my sins have been forgiven,&quot; she told
him. &quot;Your sins, Miss Clara? You've got no sins,&quot; he
replied.
<P>
Mr. John, knowing that she was &quot;passing from earth to heaven,&quot;
prayed for Miss Clara, reading John 14:1-4. Then he and the children
sang &quot;When the Gates Swing Outward.&quot;
<P>
Early Saturday morning, November 23, 1935, Clara Swoope died and
was buried the same day. &quot;She knew and loved a child,&quot;
Mr. John said. &quot;It was not a detached interest, nor was there
any coddling familiarity, but an inspiring expectation of the
best to come. . . . Miss Clara was the finest expression of cultured
Christian womanhood: modest, retiring, self-effacing, the very
best kind of guide to youth. Her memory will be sacred, and a
benediction for years to come. She was indeed a servant of God
to the end of her days. She was so wise and so good and we are
thankful for her.&quot;
<P>
Palmer youth were taught to live useful lives. Fifteen Palmer
men served their country in World War I, and 54 in World War II.
When the Mississippi River flooded to record levels in 1927, two
Palmer girls who were working at Greenville, Mississippi called
Mr. John to let him know the levee had busted. &quot;Don't you
think we should get out of here?&quot; one asked. &quot;Well,
honey, do they need you?&quot; he queried. When she said yes,
he told them to stay where they were and sent some Palmer boys
to help out, too.
<P>
Mr. John never stopped loving his children. He was strong for
them to the end. Yet time finally caught up with Mr. John, and
it threatened to catch up with Palmer.
<P>
The money never seemed to be there. By 1945, the oldest boy at
the orphanage was a mere 14, and Mr. John was forced to supervise
the milking. In his 1947 superintendent's report to the Mississippi
synod, Frierson stated plaintively: &quot;For the improvements
that are desirable and necessary, I hardly know how to relate
it.&quot;
<P>
Finally, in 1950, Mr. John Frierson retired from Palmer Orphanage.
Perhaps he foresaw the hard times and struggles that were to come.
On December 7, 1957, Mr. John died at the age of 81, seven years
to the day that he retired. In his forty years at Palmer, John
Frierson had served some 600 to 800 children.
<P>
One day in 1959, the attorneys sent Palmer an official letter
accompanied by a check for $6,657.02 payable to the orphanage
from the estate of Mr. John F. Frierson. After paying for his
burial expenses, Mr. John had designated that whatever funds were
left be given to Palmer. During four decades of service, Mr. John
had taken no salary, sustaining himself on his lawyer's income.
<P>
One Calvinistic account of John Frierson's father, William, had
observed that his life was &quot;fraught with usefulness.&quot;
It added that his son &quot;John . . . [is] now filling places
of usefulness and honor.&quot; As his good Calvinist father before
him, and his beloved matron Miss Clara, Mr. John had led a useful
lifedown to his last dollar.
<P>
<B>Palmer's New Era: Change and Continuity</B> 
<P>
When Mr. John moved out of Palmer's life, &quot;Papa Joe&quot;
Davis moved in. God once again proved sovereign for Palmer Home.
<P>
Photos abound of Papa Joe playing with the children. One shows
him on his knees near Christmastime, giving a youth a ride on
his back. It was said that if you would collect the pecans, Papa
Joe would bake you a fruitcake.
<P>
Davis endeared himself to the children. Howard Kelly, a Palmer
resident from 1953 to 1962, recalled the children's initial impression:
&quot;He was a big man. I expect he weighed over 230 pounds. He
probably stood 6-2, 6-3; he had a size 52 belt. As a child saw
him, he was even bigger. He got your attention!&quot;
<P>
Papa Joe tried to maintain the Frierson legacy. But society was
changing all around Palmer. Children began growing their hair
long and rebelling against their parents. The music they listened
to was decidedly different from Mr. John's operatic arias. Davis
needed to negotiate these changes with care.
<P>
For instance, Mr. John had centered the children's lives on what
happened at Palmer Home. He had allowed young men to visit Palmer
girls only in his parlor and in his presence. Davis let the girls
go out on dates. Palmer's young women were encouraged to participate
in the activities of the larger society.
<P>
Papa Joe also addressed the need for more housing at Palmer. But
instead of constructing dormitories, he built cottage-style homes.
This shift in building type actually represented a shift in the
idea of what an orphanage can be. It became less a village and
more a gathering of family-sized homes. This important shift reflected
new ideas in the best way to care for children. Today Palmer houses
its children in seven cottage homes staffed by seven sets of houseparents.
<P>
The new construction took money. Like those before him, Davis
knew that he had to make the orphanage's resources stretch as
far as they could. &quot;I never really had to ask for the money
to build those cottages,&quot; recalled Davis. &quot;I just made
known to the churches what our plans were to care for these children,
and the money came in.&quot; A Palmer trustee once said, &quot;Joe
Davis will take 50 cents and get a dollar's worth for it.&quot;
Davis was helped by the South's post-war prosperity and by his
abilities as a fundraiser and money-manager.
<P>
Palmer continued its tradition of self-sustaining frugality. For
instance, when an old building was scheduled for demolition, the
bricks were cleaned and stacked so that they might be used to
construct the new cottages. The farm program continued, also,
raising beef cattle and hogs to provide meat for the children
and staff. But the home also embraced the modern economy, using
its resources to create more wealth for its children's benefit.
Palmer planted ten of its acres with pine trees that were intended
for sale to a paper mill.
<P>
Davis saw Palmer through the upheaval of the sixties and seventies.
&quot;I never really noticed any effect on our children at Palmer
Home. We just kept doing what we had always done: Give them the
most love and most opportunities we could,&quot; he said.
<P>
Nonetheless, Palmer has seen more changes as the years went by.
Palmer was made responsible to an independent Board of Directors
in 1979, ending official presbyterian governance of on-site administration.
Trained counselors, administrators and nurses have been added
to the staff of houseparents, increasing their expertise in dealing
with troubled children. And the process of admitting children
has been refined. Referrals come from churches, distressed parents
who voluntarily yield their children, the courts and social agencies.
<P>
Still, Palmer continues to specialize in providing homes for children
with promise. Each Palmer child has suffered indignities. One
hundred percent of the current residents come from broken families:
75 percent out of drug or alcohol abuse; about 15 percent out
of physical abuse; and upwards of 50 percent suffer from neglect.
Palmer makes a special effort to hold together siblings who might
otherwise be split up in modern foster care. Currently, Palmer
has ten sets of two siblings, four sets of three siblings, five
sets of four siblings, one set of five siblings and another of
seven. &quot;Virtually all our kids come from a family that is
below the poverty line,&quot; says Dr. Rob Crankshaw, Palmer's
director of counseling services. &quot;We find that a lot of the
parents came from good middle or upper middle class families.
But because of drug abuse or related situations, they just can't
hold jobs, get into all kinds of trouble, and they plunge into
poverty.&quot;
<P>
Since Davis's retirement in the late 1970s, four other men have
led the Palmer Home for Children. Their's has been the responsibility
of defining and carrying out the mission of a privately-funded
Christian orphanage. This is not easy in a secular society whose
institutions are heavily funded and regulated by government. Moreover,
as House Speaker Newt Gingrich discovered, many Americans have
very unfavorable stereotypical images of orphanages.
<P>
Today, Ed Waldron is executive director of Palmer Home for Children,
a post he held as the institution celebrated its 1995 centennial.
A Ph.D. in higher education administration with years of experience
in childcare, Waldron presides over a $1.8 million budget and
a staff of 20 who provide the care for some 75 boys and girls.
Palmer Home is preparing to improve and expand its programs as
it enters its second century of service.
<P>
Yet despite all that is new, the essentials remain. Palmer is
still covered with the sounds and sights of children, and with
the sounds and sights of adults watching over them.
<P>
Some of the current caretakers have the exuberant heart of a Florence
Frierson. Others have the strong countenance of a William or John
Frierson, capable of stopping a child cold in his mischief, or
repairing a broken spirit with one firm, kind glance. And the
many successors to Miss Clara Swoope remain on campus, housemothers
who quietly make everything all right.
<P>
A walk around Palmer's campus today would bring joy to Mr. John's
eyes. &quot;They are bright and interesting and as carefree and
happy as if they owned a bank or, perhaps, more so. Why shouldn't
they be? They have lots of fresh air and water, and a sufficiency
of food and clothes, and good friends and jolly playmates.&quot;
John Frierson wrote those words in 1912. Today, Palmer Home for
Children ensures that they still ring true.

<h2>MacArthur's Genius Awards</h2>
<b><I>The Oscars of the Multicultural Elite</I></b><BR>
By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Wooster">Martin Morse Wooster</a>
<BR><BR>

<blockquote>
<P><i>&quot;At the risk of revisionism or of blasphemy, I also 
suggest that the merits of the star system and of elitism, which is a 
star system extended to a highly refined group, be recalled.  
The onerous dangers of the star system have been exposed: 
the confusion of star and movement, of elite and group; the 
selection of the `star' through the media or through current 
governors, not through the movement; the feeding of the egos of 
the few while the many suffer malnutrition.&quot;</I>
<P>
<P><a href="pcs-196a.html">Catharine R. Stimpson</a>, 
<br>Director,
<br>MacArthur Fellows Program (1974) 
</blockquote>
<P>It happens every summer.  Sometime during the dog days 
of June or July, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation announces the <a href="pcs-196b.html">winners</a> of the annual MacArthur 
Fellows Program, the so-called &quot;genius grants.&quot;  Around 20 
people, some famous, many obscure, are awarded unrestricted 
five-year grants of between $150,000 and $350,000  which they 
can use for any purpose they desire.
<P>
The MacArthur Fellows Program is a relatively small part 
of the giant MacArthur Foundation's activities.  In 1994, 
the foundation awarded $130 million in grants, of which $6 
million was allotted to the fellows program and an additional 
$500,000 on an allied trust.  Between 1989 and 1994, the 
MacArthur Foundation approved $736 million in grants, of which 
$48 million, or seven percent, was allotted to the fellows program. 
 Nearly every other division of the foundation has a 
larger budget, and some of MacArthur's divisions, such as the 
programs to promote world peace and the health program, 
have budgets twice as large as the MacArthur Fellows program.
<P>But despite its low budget, the Fellows program 
probably generates most of the publicity about the MacArthur 
Foundation, and explains why MacArthur is one of the few 
recognized &quot;brand names&quot; in the foundation world.  There are two 
reasons for this.  First, as <I>The New Republic's 
</I>Robert Wright once noted, the  MacArthurs are one of the few awards 
individuals can obtain.  Most of the time, most of the money in 
the philanthropic world goes to other non-profits, and 
individuals can't get money unless they affiliate themselves with an 
organization.  But since MacArthurs go to people and not to 
groups, everyone in America can daydream about getting one.  Had 
the MacArthur Foundation decided to award the same amount 
of money to 20 or 25 organizations each year instead of 
to individuals, the MacArthur Fellows program would have 
remained obscure.
<P>Second, the process of awarding MacArthurs 
eliminates most of the grantsmanship and paperwork
 associated with philanthropy.  Though the MacArthur Fellows routinely go 
to people who support causes to which John D. MacArthur 
would be opposed, the program certainly follows John D. 
MacArthur's philosophy of charity.  MacArthur, a hard-headed 
skinflint, routinely rejected anyone who came to him asking for 
money; the MacArthur Fellows similarly turn down all people 
who apply for grants, even if (as has apparently happened more 
than once) you go to MacArthur Foundation headquarters at 
South Dearborn Street in Chicago and claim that God came to you 
in a vision and demanded you receive a MacArthur fellowship. 
 The MacArthur Fellows program is one of the few activities 
of American philanthropy where you don't have to worry 
about pleasing a program officer to get a grant.
<P>
Moreover,  the people who get MacArthur fellowships 
can do whatever they want with the money. This ensures that 
the MacArthur Foundation seal of approval frequently goes 
to eccentric and radical endeavors.  According to former 
MacArthur fellows program director Kenneth Hope, if a MacArthur 
Fellow wanted &quot;to start a revolution in Afghanistan, here's 
the MacArthur Foundation with its face hanging out saying 
there was something special about that individual.&quot;
 (<a href="/crc/pcs/pcs-196b.html">Past Winners</a>)
<P>&quot;Old John D. MacArthur would perhaps be horrified 
by some of the labor organizers and activists who have gotten 
his money,&quot; essayist Richard Rodriguez noted in a 1994  article 
in the<I> Los Angeles Times</I>.  &quot;Yet, there remains about 
the MacArthur prizes a faith that is deeply Protestant, 
individualistic and capitalistic.  Give the artist big money and you 
will create big art.&quot;  Or, as son J. Roderick &quot;Rod&quot; 
MacArthur announced in a 1979 interview in 
<I>Forbes</I>, &quot;Like the Renaissance princes, we'll fund Michelangelo.&quot;
<P>
It's certainly true that many of the MacArthur recipients 
have been distinguished Americans,  For example,  two of the 
recent Nobel Laureates in Literature, Joseph Brodsky and 
Derek Walcott, had been MacArthur Fellows before they won 
the Nobel Prize.  And occasionally, there is a non-leftist 
recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, such as philosopher 
Leszek Kolakowski, essayist Stanley Crouch,  or Robert Woodson 
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.
<P>
Far too often, however,  recipients of MacArthur 
Fellowships are  members of the hard left.  In a recent essay in 
<I>U.S. News and World Report</I>, John Leo noted that the 1995 
MacArthur Fellows included a feminist musicologist who argued  
that classical music largely consisted of &quot;aggressive pelvic 
pounding&quot; and a historian who argued that the history of the 
American West was the story of greedy, power-mad white males 
oppressing everyone else.  &quot;The truth is that the MacArthur 
awards, launched in 1981 to reward high achievement and high 
promise, are not what they once were,&quot; Leo wrote.  The 
science awards still seem to be given out fairly, but other 
selections pretty much have much more to do with politics than 
with achievement or potential.  A lot of the award winners are 
either ideologues...or low-luster laborers in the traditional 
vineyards of the left.&quot;
<P>
The idea of the MacArthur Fellowships originated 
with William Kirby, John D.  MacArthur's lawyer and a member 
of the MacArthur Foundation board until his death in 1990. 
 According to the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>, sometime in the 1970s Kirby read an article by cardiologist George 
Burch calling for foundations to be more adventurous in 
their grantmaking.  Kirby passed the article on to Rod 
MacArthur, who found the idea of making scholars self-sufficient 
appealing.  Within a few weeks after John D. MacArthur's death 
in 1978,  Rod MacArthur had perfected the idea of the 
MacArthur Fellowships and had recommended that they be the 
primary purpose of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation.
<P>
Kenneth Hope,  a Rod MacArthur aide who 
subsequently directed the MacArthur Fellows program between 1982 
and 1992, described Rod MacArthur to  the<I> New York 
Times Magazine</I>: &quot;MacArthur was the kind of guy who 
harangued total strangers in restaurants about PCB levels in 
whitefish.&quot; MacArthur's fanaticism ensured that he would promote 
the MacArthur Fellows Program even though some of his 
advisers apparently warned him that unrestricted grants to 
individuals were not a good idea.  According to a 1979 article in 
<I>Science</I>, Murray Gell-Mann, the eminent physicist who 
subsequently became a member of th
e MacArthur Foundation  board,  reportedly told MacArthur that &quot;if he had received a windfall as 
a young scientist, he might have gone into real estate 
speculation.&quot;
<P>
It took two more years for the foundation to define the 
size and scope of the MacArthur Fellowships. This was an  
unsettled time in MacArthur Foundation history.  Between 1978 
and 1983, Rod MacArthur launched a barrage of lawsuits 
against the Foundation, charging that the foundation board was 
mismanaging the sale of Bankers Life, the giant insurance 
company created by John D. MacArthur and willed to the 
foundation upon the founder's death.  Because of the Tax Reform 
Act of 1969, the  foundation had to sell at least 80 percent of 
Bankers Life stock, because under the Tax Reform Act, a foundation 
can not own more than 20 percent of a company's stock.
<P>It's clear that part of the reason Rod MacArthur was 
hostile to the Foundation board was ideological, since Rod  was 
very liberal and the members of the board opposing him, such 
as radio commentator Paul Harvey and former Treasury 
Secretary William Simon, were conservatives.  &quot;We're mostly a bunch  
of Midwestern businessmen devoted to free enterprise and 
opposed to government controls,&quot; one board member told 
<I>The American Spectator'</I>s Joshua Muravchik in 1992. Paul 
Harvey added that he was appointed to the MacArthur 
Foundation board because John D. MacArthur &quot;knew we mostly feel 
the same way about things that he did.&quot;
<P>
But because of Rod MacArthur's lawsuits, the 
Foundation board was expanded to include liberals who did not know 
John D. personally.  By 1981, the conservatives had quit, 
ensuring that the MacArthur Foundation would be as liberal as 
Rod MacArthur.  But the younger MacArthur continued to sue 
the board until very shortly before his death in 1984.
<P>
According to John Corbally, the MacArthur 
Foundation's first president,  &quot;for a while the board was devoting only 
about one-quarter of its meeting time to program activities and the 
rest to the litigation.&quot; 
<P>&quot;I recall counting more than 30 lawyers at one board 
meetingthere was literally not a seat available,&quot; added 
MacArthur Foundation executive vice-president James M. Furman in 
a 1987 interview in the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>.
<P>
It's unclear how all this turmoil affected the 
MacArthur Fellows program.  Kenneth Hope  told the 
<I>Washington Post i</I>n 1992 that the tension at the time was so great that he lost 
15 pounds during the first year of planning the program, due in 
part to endless late-night sessions and countless arguments.
<P>But it's certainly probable that had Rod MacArthur 
not launched his war against the MacArthur Foundation board, 
the MacArthur Fellows program might be far larger.  According 
to Hope, the MacArthur Foundation did resist two of 
MacArthur's ideas, awarding lifetime fellowships and tying the list 
of recipients to a list of world problems the foundation wanted 
to solve.  &quot;When we started this,&quot; Hope said, &quot;the first thing 
Rod asked me to do was to come up with a list of the 
world's problems.  His idea was that we would approach the 
individual through the problems.&quot;   (The 
MacArthur Foundation did award a few lifetime fellowships, but stopped this practice 
after Rod MacArthur's death.) 
<P>
<br>
<B>On the Lookout for Genius</B>
<P>
By 1981, the internal conflicts over the fellows program having been solved, 
the MacArthur Foundation picked 100 talent scouts to find prospective fellows.  
Since 1981, the names of these scouts have been kept secret, but the first list was leaked 
to <I>New York Times Magazine</I> writer Anne Matthews.  A few of the nominators, 
such as Woodrow Wilson Center director James Billington and philosopher Allan Bloom, were 
conservatives, but nearly all of the others were well-known liberals, 
including English professor Houston Baker, Jr., Carnegie 
Foundation president Ernest Boyer, <I>The New Republic 
</I>columnist Robert Brustein, author Frances FitzGerald, Independent Sector 
chairman John Gardner, literary critic Alfred Kazin, National 
Public Radio chairman Frank Mankiewicz, author Toni 
Morrison, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission chair 
Eleanor Holmes Norton, producer Joseph Papp, director Arthur 
Penn, cartoonist Garry Trudeau, and literary critic Helen Vendler. 
 Since then, prominent liberals known to have served 
as judges include historian John Hope Franklin, Children's 
Defense Fund president Marian Wright Edelman, former 
M.I.T. president Jerome Weisner, scientist Jonas Salk, physicist 
Murray Gell-Mann, and Center for Community Change director 
Pablo Eisenberg.
<P>This collection of the great and the good might very well 
tend to give prizes to  people very much like themselves.  When 
the first MacArthur Fellows were announced  in 1981, their 
harshest critic was <I>The New Republic'</I>s Michael Kinsley who 
noted that many of the recipients were winners of Pulitzer Prizes, 
or were tenured professors at Harvard, or, in the case of author 
and poet Robert Penn Warren, had been winning prizes for 
over fifty years before getting a MacArthur.  &quot;Given one or two 
of the names,&quot; Kinsley wrote, many people could come up 
with half a dozen others without knowing what the list was for.  
It could be this year's honorary degree recipients at Princeton, 
or a Presidential Commission on the Future of Values, or 
the celebrity endorsers for a particularly tony Scotch 
advertising campaign.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Not one of the first MacArthur fellows is 
suffering from lack of recognition for his or her talents,&quot; Kinsley added.  &quot;What's more, not 
one really faces financial obstacles in exercising 
his or her creativity.  They are already doing 
whatever it is the MacArthur Foundation admires them 
for doing; many are already doing quite well at it, and presumably they will keep on doing it, unless this windfall encourages them to stop."
<P>
Moreover, Kinsley argued, the MacArthur Fellows 
program contradicted the &quot;rugged individualism&quot; inherent in the life 
of John D. MacArthur, a heroic entrepreneur who began his 
career penniless and died a billionaire, never receiving a grant 
from anyone.  &quot;The basic theory of meritocracy is that in a 
free society the meritocratic virtuesimagination, daring, 
hard workwill produce their own reward, and in John 
D. MacArthur's case, for better or worse, they did.&quot;
<P>
The MacArthur Fellows program, Kinsley concluded, &quot;is 
not merely silly, but snooty; an exercise in invidious distinction 
for its own sake.&quot;
<P>
Despite Kinsley's trenchant criticisms, the MacArthur 
Fellows program has changed remarkably little between 1981 
and today.  Only one internal critique of the program has appeared. 
 According to a 1989 article in the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>, when Adele Smith Simmons became president of 
the MacArthur Foundation in 1988, a review was undertaken of 
the Fellows program to see how it could be improved.  
One criticism was that no business leader had ever received 
a MacArthur fellowship.  &quot;We're competing with other 
mechanisms that reward people, and prominent among them has 
been the marketplace,&quot; Kenneth Hope responded.  &quot;There's 
little case for giving it to a millionaire.&quot;  No businessperson has 
won a fellowship since this review was made.
<P>In 1985, a MacArthur Fellowship was given to a man 
who was once denied a grant by John D. MacArthur.  According 
to author Denise Shekerjian, at an unspecified time (probably 
in the 1970s) Patrick Noonan, later to be president of the 
Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Fund, went to the 
Palm Beach, Fla. coffee shop where John D. MacArthur spent 
his days drinking coffee and making deals. &quot;You know, 
Mr. MacArthur, sir...saving the park 
lands...important wetlands...national heritage...ecology,&quot; Noonan 
expounded. &quot;Young man,&quot; MacArthur retorted, &quot;I've never given 
away anything in my life, and I'm not about to start now.&quot; He 
ordered Noonan to pay for his coffee and left.  Nonetheless, 
Noonan became a MacArthur Fellow in 1985, and the land he 
hoped MacArthur would donate became the John D. MacArthur 
State Park in 1989.
<P>By the early 1990s, the MacArthur Fellowship program 
had ceased to be a philanthropic novelty.  The New York Times</I>, which placed the yearly announcement of the 
MacArthur Fellows on its front page, pushed the announcement farther 
and farther back in the paper; by 1994, the announcement 
barely made the third section of the <I>Times</I>.  And when Kenneth 
Hope decided to quit as director of the program, the reason he 
gave was that the job had become routine.  &quot;I still love the 
program a great deal, but I wasn't getting the sort of inspiration I 
had before,&quot; Hope said.
<P>Nor was it clear what sort of inspiration the 
MacArthur Fellowships have provided.  In 1983, MacArthur 
Foundation president John Corbally announced that the foundation 
was 
conducting an internal review of the program to see what 
the fellows produced with their grants.  That review was 
apparently not made public, nor has any other systematic review known 
to have been undertaken since that time.
<P>
<P><B>Character, Productivity and Benefits</B>
<P>There is, however, a fair amount of anecdotal evidence about the 
uses fellows make of their MacArthur grants.  About five percent of 
the fellows, according to Matthews,  are unable to handle the stress the 
fellowships create, and suffer from writer's block or other  stress-related illnesses.
<P>&quot;If you are a good person to begin with,&quot; former MacArthur 
Fellows selection committee chairman William J. McGill told Matthews, 
&quot;a MacArthur makes you saintly and helps your work.  If you 
have flaws, the absolute freedom of the award quickly 
magnifies them.  If you have some deep personal weakness, some 
mean stress, a MacArthur will assuredly tear you apart.&quot; 
<P>The evidence suggests that the MacArthur Fellowship 
is most useful when it is given to younger scholars at the start 
of their careers.  When African-American essayist Henry 
Louis Gates Jr. received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, he was 
an untenured junior member of the Yale faculty.  During 
his fellowship, he wrote six books and became an important writer. 
 &quot;At a time when I was struggling to become a literary critic, 
(the MacArthur) gave me the self-confidence to be bold and 
experimental,&quot; Gates told the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>.  Gates added that he used the MacArthur money to make several 
trips to Africa as well as to much of the United States.  &quot;I can't 
stress how important that was in my work.&quot;
<P>Tina Rosenberg, a free-lance writer, was inexplicably 
awarded a MacArthur award in 1987 at age 27. The prize helped her 
win a book contract to write about Latin America.  &quot;If not 
for MacArthur, I wouldn't have written the first book,&quot; she told 
the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>.
<P>
But for every success story, there is usually a tale of how 
the MacArthur blocked or even retarded a career.  Robert S. 
Root-Bernstein's  1981 MacArthur prize prevented him from 
getting a job.  At the time Root-Bernstein won the award, he had 
just received a doctorate from Princeton in biochemistry and 
was looking for a full-time position. The Salk Institute cut off 
his postdoctoral fellowship.  Former professors, envious of 
Root-Bernstein's prize, gave him the cold shoulder.  He ended 
up doing volunteer work at the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in Los Angeles.  Not until Root-Bernstein's 
MacArthur fellowship had nearly expired did he finally find a job 
teaching introductory  biology at Michigan State.  &quot;I got dumped 
back into the same narrow-minded system I was liberated from,&quot; 
he told the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>.
<P>
The stories of Gates, Rosenberg, and Root-Bernstein, 
however, are not typical because they were young and 
untenured when they won their MacArthur Fellowships.  It's far 
more typical for a MacArthur to be awarded to an older, 
tenured professor, usually at an Ivy League school.   By 1987, 
for example, five MacArthur Fellowsphysicist David 
Gross, physicist Joseph H. Taylor, historian Robert Darnton, 
physicist Edward Witten, and astrophysicist James Gunnall lived 
on Hartley Avenue in Princeton, New Jersey, and all taught 
at Princeton University.
<P>
As<I> Los Angeles Times</I> reporter Elizabeth Venant 
observes, the MacArthur Fellowship &quot;has not redirected the work or 
lives of most winners with full-time university jobs.&quot;  Many  
professors used their MacArthur awards to fund an IRA, or for 
the college education of their children, or as a down payment on 
a house.  Douglas Osheroff, a Bell Laboratories physicist, 
told the <I>New York Times</I> that he primarily used the $184,000 
he received to &quot;buy computers and make some home 
improvements.  It's nice to have money in the bank.  It gives you a 
certain freedom.&quot;
<P>
It's unclear that the MacArthur Fellowship has much 
influence on the older, heavily-credentialed recipients who tend 
to receive the award.  One-third of MacArthur recipients are 
over age 50, and when Roy Hoopes interviewed some of   them 
for <I>Modern Maturity</I>, he found that the major effect of 
the MacArthurs was to act as a credential that generated 
more income from lecture fees and other assignments.  Some of 
the people Hoopes interviewed regretted that they did not 
receive the award when they were younger and hungrier.  
&quot;Twenty-five years ago,&quot; literary critic Irving Howe said, &quot;the grant 
would have been three times more helpfulwhen you are 
younger and trying to get established.&quot;
<P>
It is also unclear how much the MacArthur Fellowships 
help artists though   it seems to have helped writers, who work alone. 
 Novelist and film director John Sayles, for example, used 
the first year of his fellowship to write screenplays for such 
popular films as <I>Clan of the Cave Bear</I>.  Sayles then used the 
income from these screenplays to finance films. 
<P>
But many of the MacArthur grants to artists have gone 
to people who have created theatre or dance companies,  and 
the recipients have used their grants to aid the ventures they 
have created.  For example, documentary film maker 
Frederick Wiseman used his MacArthur fellowship to prepare 
short scenes from potential future projects, which he then showed 
to other possible grantmakers.  For artists who have to meet 
a payroll, the evidence suggests that the MacArthur most 
resembles more conventional grants, save that the tedium 
of proposal writing is eliminated.
<P>
When J. Roderick MacArthur was dying of cancer in 
1984, he suggested that it would take a decade for the effects of 
the MacArthur Fellowships to be made clear.  Now that the time 
has passed, it's clear that the MacArthurs have had much 
less impact than most observers predicted in 1981.  Some 
younger scholars have used the MacArthur award to buy time to 
produce substantial works.  Many older scholars have been aided by 
the MacArthurs to a more comfortable retirement.  But despite 
the efforts of over a thousand anonymous talent scouts, 
the MacArthur Foundation has failed to find anyone as talented 
as Michelangelo.
<P>
The primary effect of the MacArthur Fellowships has 
been, as Michael Kinsley predicted, to act as a credential.  If 
someone received a MacArthur Fellowship, the unsaid logic goes, 
they<I> must</I> be important, or why would they receive the prize? 
<P>
<br><B>A Multicultural Trophy</B>
<P>
But even this argument is coming under question.  
The appointment of Catharine Stimpson as MacArthur 
Fellows director in January 1994 has ensured that the program 
has become a captive of  the multicultural left.   The 
MacArthur Foundation was always among the most liberal of the 
big foundations; as early as 1990, <I>The New 
Republic'</I>s Robert Wright observed that &quot;it is true that the MacArthur 
Foundation, the most commonly cited example of woolly-minded 
`60s-era liberalism, does indeed deserve this distinction.&quot;  But 
although MacArthur Fellows have tended to be liberals, the 1995 
recipients (the first completely under Stimpson's control) are 
even more left-wing. They include the editor of a left-wing 
news service, a lawyer who spent his career fighting the 
death penalty, and  a feminist filmmaker.
<P>The 1995 recipients, <I>New Criterion</I> editor
 Hilton Kramer told  the <I>Chronicle of 
Philanthropy</I>, were &quot;the straight politically correct, multicultural ticket,&quot; adding that director 
Stimpson had &quot;completed the total destruction of the MacArthur 
fellowship program, in regard to any kind of intellectual or 
artistic distinction.&quot;
<P>If the MacArthur Fellows continue to reward obscure 
leftists, it's likely that the lustre of the prizes will dim.  How can 
the MacArthur Foundation claim that all &quot;geniuses&quot; in America 
are women or minorities?  &quot;The MacArthur Foundation is free 
to finance political activists and gender ideologues who believe 
in symphonic rape,&quot; observes <I>U.S. 
News'</I>s John Leo.  &quot;but let's have no more prattle about `geniuses.'&quot;
<P>The MacArthur Fellowships are also losing their 
distinction because many of the recipients are, 
well,<I> silly,</I> a point best demonstrated by Jack Hitt in the November 1995 
<I>Esquire</I>.
<P><I></I>Every other year the MacArthur Foundation holds a 
convention in Chicago for MacArthur Fellows.  Though the meeting is closed to the 
press, the enterprising Hitt snuck in.  What did he find? Seminars such as &quot;Would 
Tyrannosaurus Rex  Eat a Lawyer?&quot; and  
&quot;What Shells Teach Us About Evolution and Economics,&quot; and informal debates 
among the fellows as to whether or not crack dealers could be turned into 
stockbrokers. Hitt's response to the convention is simplehe laughed.  For laughter, 
Hitt wrote, &quot;is almost as close to a sin as 
you can get these days.&quot;
<P>But Hitt's response is the right way to approach the 
MacArthur Fellows program.  At their heart, they are a 
philanthropic enterprise that borders on farce.  The story of the 
MacArthur fellows is not tragic or heroic, but comic; it is the story of 
an unclothed  emperor of the charitable world.  For the 
MacArthur Foundation has yet to answer one fundamental question 
about the fellows programwhy should anyone take it seriously?

<h2>Thinking about Welfare Replacement
</h2>
<br>
By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Olasky">Marvin Olasky</a>
<P>
For too long the welfare debate has been the same old same old.
Liberals have emphasized distribution of bread and assumed the
poor could live on that alone. Conservatives have complained about
the mold on the bread and pointed out the waylaying of funds by
&quot;welfare queens&quot; and the empire-building of &quot;poverty
pimps.&quot;
<P>
Now, however, there is beginning to be talk not about reforming
the welfare systemwhich often means scraping off a bit of moldbut
about replacing it with a revolutionary centrist system based
in private and religious charity. Such a system was effective
in the 19th century and will be even more effective in the 21st,
with the decentralization that new technology makes possible,
if we make the right changes in personal goals and public policy.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement necessary? Because in America we now
face not just concern about poor individuals falling between the
cracks, but the crunch of sidewalks disintegrating. An explosive
growth in the number of children born out of wedlocknext year,
one of every three of our fellow citizens will begin life hindered
by the absence of a father is one indication of rapid decline.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement morally right? Because when we look
at the present system we are dealing with not just the dispersal
of dollars but the destruction of lives. When William Tecumseh
Sherman's army marched through Georgia in 1864, about 25,000 blacks
followed his infantry columns, until Sherman and his soldiers
decided to rid themselves of the followers by hurrying across
an unfordable stream and then taking up the pontoon bridge, leaving
the ex-slaves stranded on the opposite bank. Many tried to swim
across but died in the icy water. Similarly today, many of the
stranded poor will soon be abandoned by a country that has seen
welfare failure and is lapsing into a skeptical and even cynical
&quot;compassion syndrome&quot;unless we find a way to renew the
American dream of compassion.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement politically possible? Because there
is broad understanding that the system hurts the very people it
was designed to help, and that the trillions of dollars spent
in the name of compassion over the past three decades have largely
been wasted. Conservatives who want an opportunity to recover
past wisdom and apply it to future practice should thank liberals
for providing a wrecked ship. And liberals should support welfare
replacement because, given the mood of the country, the alternative
to replacement is not an expanded welfare state, but an extinct
one.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement practical? First, because nonprofit
organizations based on traditional poverty-fighting principles
are displaying much greater effectiveness than their governmental
counterparts; groups such as Voice of Hope in Dallas, CityTeam
in San Jose, the Right Alternative Family Service Center in Milwaukee,
and Clean and Sober Streets in Washington, D.C., are all having
success where governmental programs have failed, and at a fraction
of the cost. Second, because new means to get more resources to
those groups with an alternative welfare vision are now under
development. For example, not long ago a tax credit for citizens
who would joyfully support a neighborhood charity, but hate the
idea hurling more dollars down the federal HHS drain, was a gleam
in the mind's eyes of a few; now, such a proposal is gathering
steam.
<P>
<B>The Death of Hope</B> 
<P>
The destruction of life through the current welfare system is
not often so dramatic as that which occurred in 1864, but the
death of hope is evident every day. During the past three decades
we've seen lives destroyed and dreams die among poor individuals
who have gradually become used to dependency. Those who stressed
independence used to be called the &quot;worthy poor&quot;; now,
anyone who will not work is worthy, and mass pauperism is accepted.
Now, those who are willing to put off immediate gratification
and sacrifice leisure time in order to remain independent, are
called chumps rather than champs. We've also seen dreams die among
some social workers who had been in the forefront of change. Their
common lament is, &quot;All we have time to do is move paper.&quot;
Those who really care do not last long, and one who resigned cried
out, &quot;I had a calling; it was that simple. I wanted to help.&quot;
Some social workers take satisfaction in meeting demands, but
others, who wanted to change lives, become despondent in their
role of enabling destructive behavior.
<P>
We've seen dreams die as &quot;compassion fatigue&quot; deepens.
Personal involvement is down, cynicism is up. Many Americans would
like to be generous at the subway entrance or the street corner,
but they know that most homeless recipients will use any available
funds for drugs or alcohol. We end up walking by, avoiding eye
contactand a subtle hardening occurs once more. Many Americans
who would like to contribute more of their money and time are
weighed down by tax burdens. We end up just saying `no' to involvement,
and a sapping of citizenship occurs once more.
<P>
We've seen dreams die among children who never know their fathers.
At the end of a very enjoyable movie from the 1980s, <I>The Princess
Bride</I>, a character named Inigo Montoya has been chasing for
over twenty years a six-fingered man who killed his father. Finally
he has the six-fingered man at swordpoint, and says in words he
has long rehearsed, &quot;My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed
my father. Prepare to die.&quot; The vile murderer begins to plead
for mercy. Inigo Montoya, says, &quot;Offer me money.&quot; The
six-fingered man says, &quot;Yes.&quot; Montoya says, &quot;Power,
too, promise me that.&quot; &quot;All I have and more.&quot; &quot;Offer
me everything I ask for.&quot; &quot;Anything you want,&quot;
the six-fingered man says. Inigo Montoya then runs him through
with the sword, saying, &quot;I want my father back, you son of
a bitch.&quot; A six-fingered government's programs have contributed
to the removal of fathers, and nothing else can replace them.
<P>
Some would say that the death of dreams is inevitable. Big business...
big government... big charity. Wake up and smell the cyanide.
Mass civilization requires impersonal welfare. Yes, we lose the
personal touch, but there is no alternative if resources are to
be efficiently and equitably dispersed. That's the pessimistic
positionbut the success of small, community-based groups shows
that it is not inevitable for the American dream of compassion
to die.
<P>
<B>The Realism of Welfare Replacement</B> 
<P>
Past performanceunder circumstances as materially difficult as
those of todayalso suggests that the dream can live. Today we
have lots of theories about fighting poverty, but it is not necessary
to be moving in the theoretical plane. The testimony of successful
anti-poverty programs a century ago and today is that those embodying
personal involvement and challenge, both material and spiritual,
can change lives even under hard circumstances.
<P>
For instance, our predecessors who helped others to move out of
poverty, and then turned their attention to the next group of
immigrants and impoverished, did not have it easybut they persevered.
Theirs were not the good old days. Work days were long and affluence
was rare, and homes on the average were much smaller than ours.
There were severe drug and alcohol problems and many more early
deaths from disease. We are more spread out now, but our travel
time is not any greater. Overall, most of the problems paralleled
our own; the big differences are the increases in illegitimacy
and divorce. Most of the opportunities and reasons to help also
were similar; a big difference in this regard is that our tax
burden is much larger, and many Americans justifiably feel that
they are paying for others to take care of problems.
<P>
Community-based poverty-fighters today also have it hardand the
task is perhaps harder because, in theory, we have improved our
poverty-fighting techniques The bottom rungs of the ladder are
no longer so low: we've removed the bottom rungs, leaving many
people stuck on the ground. Over the past three decades we have
fought a war on poverty that has also struck down three other
enemies of the left: we've waged a war against shame, a war against
family, and a war against God. And yet, when we take away shame,
we take away deterrent; when we take away family, we take away
the soil in which compassion best grows; when we kick out religion,
we also remove the greatest incentive to help and be helped. <I>Newsweek</I>
recently had a cover story about the need to bring back shame;
maybe we are learning.
<P>
Some on the left say that, without welfare, poor folks are forced
into &quot;demeaning&quot; jobs. But in the weekly news magazine
I edit, <I>World</I>, we recently had the shamelessness to put
on the cover a photo of a 65-year-old man who has had a shoeshine
shop in south central Los Angeles for many years, and is revered
in the community. Teenagers come to him for counsel, and some
use his wisdom on the way to gaining positions of trust and authority.
(One person we quoted, who was full of praise for the &quot;demeaned&quot;
shoeshiner, is now a police chief nearby.) Sure, we can pride
ourselves in removing the bottom rungs of the ladder, but then
many people are stuck on the ground. We need to reemphasize the
fact that it is not demeaning, but noble, to work hard to support
a family.
<P>
There's a lot we can learn in this regard from a wonderful Western
produced in 1961, <I>The Magnificent Seven</I>. It tells of how
seven Texas gunfighters come to the defense of a village that
previously had succumbed to a bandit gang; its best scene comes
toward the end, when a gunfighter played by Charles Bronson is
surrounded by a circle of admiring children. &quot;We are ashamed
to live here,&quot; one boy says. &quot;Our fathers are cowards.&quot;
The gunfighter replies, &quot;You think I am brave because I carry
a gun, but your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility
for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your mothers, and this
responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton. It bends
and twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
And there's nobody that says they have to do this. They do it
because they love you and because they want to..... I have never
had this kind of courage, running a farm, working like a mule
every day with no guarantee what will ever come of it. This is
bravery. It's why I never even started anything like that. It's
why I never will.&quot;
<P>
Some supporters of big government snarl about &quot;turning back
the clock&quot; to smaller-scale approaches, but it is not bad
to turn back the clock to that type of bravery. Besides, we truly
turn back the clock when we stick with the centralization developed
in the 1930s and the 1960s. We will be turning back the clock
in the 21st century if we repeat the mistakes of 20th century
centralization. We need to make the vision of the 19th century
relevant to the 21st by updating strategies and devising new projects
and tactics. That is already happening even in Washington, D.C.,
in nonprofits such as Martha's Table, which uses computers and
love in after-school programs; the Gospel Mission, which uses
insights of modern psychology within a biblical framework; and
Clean and Sober Streets, where up-to-date information about drug
effects is put into use within a system that provides an old-fashioned
choice: Shape up or ship out.
<P>
<B>A Positive View of People</B> 
<P>
Furthermore, if we fall into the pessimistic view that people
are problems, we are also turning back the clock, this time to
the 1970s when Zero Population Growth was hot. Population paranoia
should have been laid to rest by the experience during the 1980s
and 1990s of city-states like Hong Kong and Singapore, crowded
and without natural resources, yet rapidly ascending in economic
potency. Recent Asian experience shows once again that every mouth
comes with a brain and a pair of hands, and that each brain and
pair of hands, when trained, can perform wonders. Poor people
are assets to be liberated rather than problems to be subsidized:
They are resources, not victims.
<P>
If we focus not on weaknesses but on the strengths and competitive
advantages of inner cities, including location, then we can put
legs on a vision that at its core is simple: We need compassion
that is personal, spiritual, and challenging. We often hear today
that the problems of poverty are incredibly difficult. That is
only partially true: The problems themselves are solvable; summoning
the will to solve them is what often seems beyond us. The easy
way out is to look to government programs, slightly modified.
But there is no need to settle for so little: Those who have faith
and determination throughout the country are showing the opportunities
for effective compassion.
<P>
Members of Rosedale Park Baptist Church in Detroit's inner city,
for example, know what needs to be done. Pastor Hamon Cross, Jr.,
tells those who have been sucked into dependency, &quot;I gotta
hurt ya before I can help ya.&quot; The church offers free counseling
services, but clients must pledge to study specific scriptures
bearing on their problems, to discuss them in counseling sessions,
and to hear and take notes on a good sermon each week. The goal
is transformation, not just training.
<P>
Homeless women helped at St. Martin de Porres House of Hope in
Chicago learn what they have to do. &quot;Dysfunctionality, and
an often total lack of understanding of personal responsibility
and discipline&quot;that is the main cause of homelessness, according
to Sister Connie Driscoll, who founded and heads the 100-bed shelter
that is operated without any government funds. The women who come
to her, she notes, &quot;almost always have the money to pay their
rent, but they often do not. They spend the money on something
else, and they don't pay the rent on time, month after month,
until the landlord evicts them.&quot; Those women need not a Day
Timer but something that will flip the hourglass of their existence
before all the sand runs out.
<P>
Even <I>The New York Times</I> occasionally stumbles across the
core of the problem, noting last October 22 that three-fourths
of welfare recipients who leave the rolls later return, often
lamenting &quot;what they called their bad attitudes or insufficient
drive.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Crucial Importance of Attitude</B> 
<P>
Attitude: the technically-best training program in the world will
not work for manyprobably mostpeople on unless their minds are
reconfigured. One problem with the low-level maintenance that
welfare provides is that necessity is the mother of personal change,
and AFDC or SSI payments remove that necessity. Steve Gilkenson,
program administrator at the McAuley Mission in New York City,
and a man who has been through tough times himself, suggests that
&quot;The problem today is nobody's able to hit bottom, they just
bounce around the bottom, and every couple of months someone picks
them up.&quot; With decreased welfare payments, he suggests, &quot;our
chapel would be fuller and our audience would be soberer.&quot;
<P>
Some people say that welfare replacementemphasizing shelters like
the McAuley Mission or its counterparts in many cities, rather
than soulless government barracks; emphasizing abstinence-based
programs like Best Friends or True Love Waits rather than governmental
sex education; emphasizing tough anti-addiction programs as CityTeam
in San Jose does, rather than the numerous soft government variantsis
unrealistic. But the truth is, any program that emphasizes material
end results without first examining beliefs, values, and the attitudes
that arise out of those basics, is one that may look good in a
bureaucratic notebook, but is out of touch with fundamental needs.
<P>
Welfare replacement will come, slowly, but the administrators
and social workers whose livelihoods depend on the current system
will fight and kick all the way. They won't come right out and
oppose effective private programs, but they willin response to
public demandpromote programs that on the surface taste great,
but which over time will prove to be far less filling than what
private groups offer. The professionals will put lots of equations
on the reform blackboard, and tell the rest of us that only they
know what the higher math means. To respond well, we will need
to borrow a response from Mrs. Einstein when a reporter asked
her whether she understood the theory of relativity. &quot;No,&quot;
she responded, &quot;but Albert does, and I trust Albert.&quot;
We'll need to develop our own Alberts, not by trusting those whose
livelihood depends on welfare state payments, but those who practice
true compassion on mean streets.
<P>
<B>A Different Kind of Expertise</B> 
<P>
In California, for example, we'll want to skip the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I> but spend time at a gospel-proclaiming inner city church,
such as St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ. There, in southeast
San Diego, the fellow playing the bongos on stage may have been
a drug addict a year ago, and the man in a suit in the next pew
a recently-released convictbut a spiritual transformation has
swept both of them, and hundreds others, into a new life. As one
church leader, businessman Richard Smith, Jr., points out, the
church's goal is to deal with not just poverty, which is a relatively
easy material problem, but impoverishmentlong-term hopelessness,
humiliation and degradation, a culture unto itself. It takes more
than money to redeem the lives of those who have become spiritually
destitute.&quot;
<P>
In Colorado, a visit to Step 13, a rehabilitation program for
substance abusers, will throw more light on alternatives to the
SSI program than will an academic conference. Rough-hewn Bob Cote,
a former substance abuser who runs Step 13, now labels SSI &quot;Some
Sort of Insanity&quot; or &quot;suicide on the installment plan,&quot;
because of the alcoholics with standing accounts at liquor stores
who benefit from the government's tender mercies. (He is equally
sarcastic about popular estimates of the extent of homelessness,
based on reports from local shelter providers of how many people
they have housed, &quot;Drift from D.C. to California, be counted
as 1,942 people.&quot;) Cote, not a religious man, still emphasizes
that any program to be effective must produce an internal change,
not just an external change in job-pursuit manners which will
be temporary at best. The social work pros and profs, he insists,
just don't get it: &quot;50 masters degrees vs. 3000 street people,
who's gonna win?&quot;
<P>
In Georgia, rather than listening to those who believe in magic flick
the wand, provide new housing, and the problem of poverty goes
poof!we will need to hear explanations such as the one coming
from Summerhill Neighborhood head Douglas Dean: &quot;We're not
just talking about changing people's physical environment. We're
talking about spiritual change, changing people's hearts. A lot
of people have come here with quick fixes that have failed and
left people discouraged.... Churches can break through that discouragement
by telling the truth and showing people how to rebuild family
life.&quot;
<P>
In Michigan, to get a more accurate portrait than that offered
by liberal social workers, we will have to check in with Mary
Jackson, a cheerfully maternal, middle-aged black woman who eleven
years ago deliberately moved into the Smith Homes, a rough inner
city project, in order to help youngsters there. She runs a weekly
Bible club program for about three dozen children and is frank
about the problems of &quot;lazy&quot; project residents who have
been on welfare for years and have a &quot;deeply embedded&quot;
entitlement mentality: &quot;They just want to stay in their own
little worlds..... They think somebody owes them something.&quot;
Ms. Jackson was especially irritated when welfare mothers whose
children attended a week-long summer camp refused to pay the $50
fee: &quot;It's not like they don't have any money. They can afford
to get their hair and nails done and wear leather coats that working
people can't afford.&quot; Michigan welfare reform will succeed
only when the moms Ms. Jackson sees begin treasuring their children
above their nails.
<P>
In Missouri as in other states, there will be much wailing about
&quot;what will happen to the children&quot; if significant welfare
reform kicks in. To find out, we won't want to ask Children's
Defense Fund publicists but we will need to listen to Jerry Hayes,
who heads the Sunshine Mission in St. Louis and has set up an
MBA programmind, body, and attitudeor kids likely to fall prey
to the street culture of irresponsibility. Hayes personally understands
the difference between that culture and an opportunity culture:
As a child he lived part of the time in a government housing project
with his mother, and part of the time with a great aunt who made
it a priority to quiz him each day on Bible verses and teach him
the value of hard work and thrift. He understands that the cultures
cannot readily be merged; they have antithetical values, and a
person needs more than a government training program to move from
one to another.
<P>
In New York, there is great concern about what will happen to
&quot;the homeless,&quot; but paying much attention to the official
reports will teach us little. Instead, we'll want to talk with
Gilbert Gilliam, who combines the beefy look of an ex-football
player, the withered look of an ex-addict, and the quick smile
of someone whose life has changed: Gilliam, 38, is a shelter security
guard at the McAuley Mission and the person who has the greatest
opportunity to make or break the program. (Like secretaries in
many offices and sergeants in the army, security people truly
run shelters.) Gilliam, if he were in charge of an anti-drug program,
says he &quot;wouldn't hire nobody who hadn't gone through the
downfall. It doesn't take much when you're detoxing to fall under
bad influences, so the best thing is to be that person's contact`just
me for breakfast and dinner.' And if you don't know drugs yourself,
you don't know what it's like and people can fool youto be successful
here, you gotta have that gut feeling that enables you to tell
someone, `I know when you're bull-jiving me.'&quot;
<P>
What we've been getting from liberal theoreticians for years are
reams of bull-jiving but those who are matadors in the bullring
have a different perspective. In Oregon, Don Michel, executive
director of the Union Gospel Mission, doesn't equate welfare change
with mean-spiritedness, because he has watched people trading
food stamps for drugs. Michel now tells reporters about his changed
attitude: &quot;I thought just handing out food and clothes without
question was a very compassionate thing to do. But what I think
now is when you give things out without accountability, you're
participating in that person's harm.&quot; He sees that services
are available for those who want to change, but most will not
change unless they are forced to: &quot;It's never been true that
there is an absence of service.... there is an absence of motivation.&quot;
Michel wants to push hard: &quot;What sounds coldhearted to people
not exposed to this population is just reality.&quot;
<P>
<B>Drowning one-third of a nation</B> 
<P>
What Michel calls the &quot;absence of motivation&quot; is the
critical hole in much naive talk about homeless people restoring
some order to their lives, or people on welfare going to work.
Necessity is the mother of change, and our removal of urgent necessity
from the lives of many poor people has also taken away the impetus
to productive behavior. Realistic welfare replacement and coddling
cannot coexist.
<P>
We will need to insist that realism means taking into account
more than material conditions. The War on Poverty defined realism
as emphasizing dollars and cents rather than children's need for
a two-parent family, but the 1960s idea that a woman's place is
in her own apartment, with a husband optional, contributed to
a single-parent pathology that has ravaged the black community;
that pathology is now becoming general, with about one out of
four white babies born to single women, and the percentage apparently
rising each year. Our economics-only, supposed realism has damaged
two generations, and indexes of leading cultural indicators suggest
that the damage will be visited to the third and fourth generations.
<P>
Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 described one-third of the nation;
sunk into material poverty; Americans are a far more affluent
people now than sixty or so years ago, but the dire news is that
almost one-third of Americans are deprived in more severe ways
that they ever were. Now, nearly one-third of children are essentially
fatherless at birth, and nearly one-third of high school seniors
read at the &quot;below basic&quot; level, which means that essentially
they cannot function as readers.
<P>
We tend to focus on dropouts, but every year schools dump 750,000
more semi-literates into the workforce, and it's no surprise that
they have trouble achieving good wages at work. It goes against
the feminist impulses of recent years to concentrate particularly
on the need for men to be equipped to find good jobs, but men
need to be breadwinners if women are to have the choice to stay
home with their children. It is vital that fathers (whose sustained
presence is desperately needed if families are to be stable, teenaged
boys disciplined, and crime reduced) not to be relegated to the
low-rent realms of the playboy philosophy, hopping from bed to
bed.
<P>
Reducing illegitimacy and reemphasizing fatherhood are two key
steps to rebuilding marriage and family. The extent of our cultural
loss is conveyed in an anecdote offered by Anne Gordon; she is
the wife of &quot;Coach&quot; Wayne Gordon who twenty years ago
came from Iowa to the North Lawndale area of Chicago, set up a
weight-lifting machine in a local storefront, and conducted Bible
studies there between the grunts and groans of high school guys
who might otherwise have spent their time in gang-banging. Wayne
and Ann Gordon have since been instrumental in establishing of
the Lawndale Christian Center, which includes a gym, a full-service
medical clinic that provides health care to over 4,000 individuals
each month, a development corporation that buys and rehabs abandoned
buildings, and a computer-crammed learning center that provides
after-school tutoring. But along with all the improvements, Mrs.
Gordon recalls the visit of a woman who &quot;came to our house
one night at dinner time. She knocked on the door and we were
all sitting around the dinner table eating and she said, `Do you
all do this every night?'.... It seemed to her like a big event,
whereas to us it was just part of family life and very normal.&quot;
All of the improvements in North Lawndale will avail little unless
the tender mercies of a family dinner become normal activities.
<P>
The question of the hour concerning welfare replacement, and one
for the rest of this century, is how to make the normal an everyday
occurrence rather than an exhibit for an anthropological museum.
Welfare replacement is more than changing the welfare system;
it will only be possible if the educational system, the teen sexuality
culture, and the adoption system also change. In all of these
areas, the same old same old must live no more, if those who have
been enslaved in government welfare and school systems are to
have a new start.
<P>
<B>A Time for Optimism</B> 
<P>
Can the country make that start? Some may think it impossible
for a nation that has gone far into the jungle to hack its way
out. And yet, there is some historical precedent. England at the
time of the American Revolution was a morally sick society, but
the efforts of William Wilberforce and others helped to give it
a much improved nineteenth century.
<P>
In the United States, the 1840s and 1850s were decades of spiritism
and free lustNew Age theology and sexuality. The Civil War expansion
of government power introduced welfare practices that were previously
frowned upon. In 1873 one of every ten persons in Brooklyn (then
an independent city) took weekly rations from public storehouses.
Other cities were not far behind in their offerings.
<P>
Critics of such programs did not give up, however. They proved
that governmental provision &quot;does more hurt than good, and
makes more paupers than it relieves.&quot; They wrote not only
about funds wasted through promiscuous distribution to alcoholics
and addicts, but about &quot;compassion&quot; properly understoodsuffering
with and challenging those in distress. By the late 19th century
their efforts were proving successful. Reformers in large cities
were able to abolish indiscriminate relief, and able-bodied men
returned to the marketplace; an abundance of warm-hearted but
hard-headed charities dealt with special cases. Combining vision
and realism, our predecessors produced solutions that were not
panaceas, but did delay for decades an epidemic of illegitimacy,
and saved from misery thousands of children.
<P>
Today, after thirty years of social excess, the epidemic is upon
us. Liberal scholars complain of the &quot;feminization of poverty,&quot;
since female-headed households are the main locus of poverty,
but they do not acknowledge the triple-A causative factors: a
decline in adoption, an increase in adultery, and an AFDC system
that emphasizes the pseudo-independence of deeply dependent young
women. Americans concerned about poverty a century ago not only
saw cause and effect more clearly but came up with programs that
worked then and can work now, even in the face of a more extensive
social breakdown. We have far greater wealth now than Americans
did a century ago; do we have the will?

<h2>Bringing Daddy Home: <I>The Fatherhood Movement</i></h2>
<br>
By Patrick and Gwen Purtill 
<P>
For thirty years social analysts have attempted to persuade Americans
against common sense, and increasingly against common experience,
that family disruption does not seriously harm children. That
effort is rapidly losing ground. There is a large and growing
body of empirical evidence showing that widespread fatherlessness
is wreaking physical, emotional and spiritual havoc on children.
<P>
During these years, advocates of &quot;alternative families&quot;
justified family breakup by arguing that traditional families
were a widespread source of real pathology. The argument simply
does not hold water. For example, traditional families are less
prone to domestic violence than stepfamilies, single-parent families,
or co-habitating couples. The argument against the traditional
family has been dominated by the false comparison of fictional
models to real families. Traditional families are condemned as
&quot;dysfunctional&quot; when they fail to live up to the <I>beau
ideal</I> styled by a popular therapist. But the true comparison
is between the traditional family and its real world counterparts:
single-parent families, stepfamilies, and co-habitating couples.
Judged by that standard, the married, biological family emerges
as the best environment for children.
<P>
Certainly many traditional families have problems, which range
in gravity from everyday mutual annoyance to serious physical
abuse. And of course, there are examples of wonderful stepfamilies
and even single-parent families. But an adequate understanding
of the issue demands that we know the rule before we begin to
take account of the exceptions. And if we are serious about doing
what is best for our children, we will promote the institutions
that are likeliest to secure their happiness and well-being.
<P>
In virtually every case, &quot;family disruption&quot; or &quot;alternative
families&quot; means growing up without a father. Children deprived
of their fathers find it harder to develop normally into happy
adults. Young boys first learn how to treat women by watching
their fathers. Likewise, young girls learn what is, and what is
not, acceptable treatment by men. Children who grow up without
their fathers are much less likely to enjoy successful marriages
themselves later in life. Additionally, they tend to suffer a
variety of problems, including &quot;higher than average levels
of youth suicide, low intellectual and educational performance,
and higher than average rates of mental illness, violence and
drug use.&quot;1
<P>
Moreover, the family is the means by which children learn to interact
with others. Through the mutual bonds of affection and responsibility
in the family, children learn to extend their sense of affection
and duty to members of the larger community. &quot;Authority,
stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute
the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within society,&quot;
says the catechism of the Catholic church. &quot;The family is
the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values,
begin to honor God, and make good use of freedom. Family life
is an initiation into life in society.&quot;2
<P>
Perhaps the most alarming consequence of father absence is that,
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
&quot;children from disrupted families are at a much higher risk
for physical or sexual abuse.&quot;3 But, as many researchers
now point out, the three social problems most on the minds of
Americanseducation, poverty, and crimeall find a common taproot
in father absence.
<P>
Numerous studies show that children who live with both biological
parents have a great advantage. They tend to perform better in
class and on standardized tests. And they have fewer problems
with their peers. According to one study, for example, children
living apart from their biological fathers are 40 percent more
likely to repeat a grade in school and 70 percent more likely
to be expelled.5 Children from disrupted families also are less
likely to graduate from high school or to attend college than
are their peers from intact families.
<P>
Changes in family structure have had an even more dramatic impact
on poverty. Since 1970 the number of American children living
in poverty has been rising steadily. Nearly three quarters of
the children living in single-parent families will spend part
of their childhoods in poverty, an experience shared by just 20
percent of children in two-parent families.6 Moreover, for children
living only with their mothers, poverty is not necessarily a short
term drop in an otherwise reasonably comfortable childhood. For
22 percent of these children, it lasts for a period of seven years
or longer.7
<P>
The last 35 years have seen violent crime in America increase
more than 500 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Justice,
juveniles make up &quot;the fastest growing segment of the criminal
population in the United States.&quot; According to the <I>Journal
of Research in Crime and Delinquency</I>, &quot;the best predictor
of violent crime in a neighborhood is the proportion of households
without fathers.&quot;8 Nationally, more than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions come from fatherless homes.9
Moreover, most violent criminals are males who grew up without
fathers, including 60 percent of rapists10 and 72 percent of adolescent
murderers.11
<P>
Indeed, there is growing bipartisan agreement that father absence
is not merely one among many factors indicating risk for criminality.
Rather, it is the single most important factor. In a paper published
by the Progressive Policy Institute, Elaine Kamarck and William
Galston assert, &quot;The relationship [between family structure
and crime] is so strong that controlling for family configuration
erases the relationship between race and crime and between low
income and crime. This conclusion shows up time and again in the
literature.&quot;12
<P>
<B>Illegitimacy: The Norm in America's Inner Cities</B> 
<P>
Each year in America nearly one million children are born to unmarried
women. That is one child out of every three, a 400 percent increase
since 1960 when only 5 percent of all births were to unmarried
women.13 Many single mothers never marry or remarry. Even those
who eventually marry usually spend about six years as a single-parent.
For black women, it usually is much longer.14 Between working
and the responsibilities of rearing a child alone, these women
have little time to devote to romance. Despite tabloid stories
featuring the births of love children to fabulously wealthy Hollywood
superstars, the overwhelming majority of unwed mothers are poor
women with a high school education at best.
<P>
In the inner city, where single-parent families are the norm,
education is elusive, poverty sprawls across generations, and
crime is omnipresent. According to social scientist Charles Murray,
the black illegitimacy rate in inner citiescurrently at over 80
percent has created a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; culture with
&quot;the values of unsocialized male adolescents made norms physical
violence, immediate gratification and predatory sex.&quot;15
<P>
The disintegration of urban black families has created living
conditions previously unimaginable in the United States. In some
communities, the ideal of responsible fatherhood is reduced to
a teenaged boy buying diapers for the mother of his children.
The question is no longer whether current welfare policies are
bad for America's poorest families, but how to control the damage
they already have dome.
<P>
<B>Institute For Responsible Fatherhood</B> 
<P>
AFDC created an economic incentive for widespread illegitimacy.
But The Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Revitalization
is working to reverse this one family and one father at a time.
Reuniting fathers with their families is the most promising solution
to the misery and turmoil in the inner city and the Institute
is working at the front lines of that battle. According to its
founder and president, Charles A. Ballard, apart from looking
to a father for a child support check, much of our society &quot;looks
right through him.&quot;
<P>
Charles Ballard does not need statistics to know what can happen
to a boy growing up without a father. He is one of the statistics.
Ballard describes himself as an angry young man who dropped out
of school, fathered a child with a woman he had no intention of
marrying, and, finally, landed in prison. But in prison, of all
places, the familiar pattern broke. He became a Christian and
committed himself to becoming a real father to the son he then
hardly knew.
<P>
Upon release from prison, Ballard took jobs wherever he found
them. Finally he persuaded his son's mother, who had since married,
to let him adopt their child. &quot;There were times,&quot; he
says, &quot;when I had no idea what to do. Many times, my only
refuge was the knowledge that for all my faults as a father, I
was better than nothing.&quot;16 It took six years of hard work,
but he went to college and got his degree. Since 1982 Ballard
has worked with men in the Hough neighborhood in the heart of
Cleveland, teaching them to be good fathers to their children.
In the neighborhood around his center, two out of three children
are born out of wedlock.
<P>
What Ballard's Institute does there is far from standard issue
social work. &quot;If we believe that every individual has the
potential to control his life, then we must treat each person
with respect,&quot;17 he insists. Among other things, that means
not doing for anyone what he can do for himself. The Institute
does not spoon-feed a father through the bureaucracy or schedule
classes for him. A man who is going to be a good father to his
children needs to develop the initiative and confidence to take
responsibility for himself and his family. By the time a man leaves
the program, he already has accomplished formidable goals by himself.
<P>
Ballard believes that if you really listen, you will discover
that these young fathers already want to take care of their children,
and they even have some idea of how to turn their lives around.
But they need guidance and moral support. More than anything else,
however, they need role models. Consequently, Ballard has trained
what he calls Outreach Specialists who work from a mentor/protege
model of nontraditional, intensive, one-on-one guidance. They
ask a father for a commitment to four goals:
<UL>
<LI>Legally acknowledge paternity of his children.
<LI>Decrease at-risk behavior.
<LI>Stay in school, or return for a GED.
<LI>Obtain a job and begin to contribute to the care of his children.
</UL>

<P>
Separate group sessions for fathers and mothers are held weekly,
and combined group sessions for both parents are held monthly.
But the outreach specialists spend the majority of their time
working in the homes of their proteges. Meetings are held there
to deal with problems at the source. During the early phase of
the program, it is not uncommon for the outreach specialist to
see the father three times per week. Outreach specialists are
available to their proteges by pager 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. Mentors discuss long term (5-to-10 year) goals with these
fathers, then work backwards to develop specific 90 day plans.
<P>
One of the primary functions of the outreach specialist is to
serve as a role model to his proteges. Each must adopt what Ballard
calls a &quot;risk-free life-style.&quot; Those who challenge
young fathers to walk the straight and narrow must live according
to the same rulesfree of &quot;tobacco, alcohol, other drugs,
abusive behavior, sex outside of marriage, obesity or other high
risk behaviors.&quot;
<P>
At the outset, the father and mother often are not on friendly
terms. Therefore, the outreach specialist always contacts the
children's mother and anyone else, such as a grandparent, who
is deeply involved in rearing the children. Even if a father does
not seek custody of his children, one of the program's central
goals is to develop a respectful, cooperative relationship between
mother and father. A fringe benefit of Ballard's method is that,
after learning to work together for the good of their children,
many parents in the program eventually marry. But at minimum,
children will see their parents treating one another with respect.
<P>
With funding from the Ford Foundation, The Institute for Responsible
Fatherhood and Family Revitalization is embarking upon a tremendous
expansion this year. Ballard is working to replicate his Cleveland
operation in Nashville, Yonkers, San Diego, Milwaukee, and the
District of Columbia. Each of these cities has shown an interest
in the program as well as a base of support within the community.
Mr. Ballard and his family currently are relocating to Washington,
D.C. to manage all of these programs from a central office. It
is difficult to predict how well the Institute will succeed at
maintaining the integrity of Ballard's intensive one-on-one approach
and at requiring hard virtues of outreach specialists in distant
cities.
<P>
<B>Divorce: Life Without Father Hits the Middle Class</B> 
<P>
But escalating rates of illegitimacy tell only half of the story.
There is more than one way to grow up without a father. An estimated
one million children each year go through the divorce or separation
of their parents. Although the rate has fallen somewhat since
its peak in the early 1980s, the last three decades have seen
the divorce rate in America triple.
<P>
Divorce has a profound impact on child well-being. Children of
divorce, along with their mothers, almost always suffer economically.
Fathers typically see their financial position improve somewhat
after divorce. But even if child support arrangements were perfectly
equitable, women and children would still suffer economically
from a family breakup. The crucial fact is that very few men have
the financial wherewithal to support two households, particularly
if they later remarry and father more children. In the overwhelming
majority of cases, single mothers will always have to work full
time while struggling to care for their children alone.
<P>
More surprising, however, is the extent and duration of emotional
damage suffered by these children. Only in cases involving physical
violence do children show signs of relief over family breakupeven
when the parents' relationship was an unhappy one.18 The California
Children of Divorce Study has documented elevated levels of depression,
underachievement, and difficulty maintaining stable love relationships
into adulthood.
<P>
<B>Mary and the Legacy of Divorce</B> 
<P>
This weekend Mary is helping her stepmother with a birthday party
for her nine-year-old stepsister. Mary, a white, 28-year-old woman,
lives in a Washington, D.C. surrounded by close friends. She holds
a master's degree from a private university. She is passionate
about her faith and her social work. And she has a tendency to
take in strays.
<P>
She sees her father and stepmother regularly, but having a relationship
of any kind with her father came with difficulty. Her younger
brother Mark remains bitter. They both were too young to remember
their parents' divorce. But they remember what came afterward:
isolation, poverty, humiliation, even physical danger. They knew
that everyone else in their family was middle class and upper middle
class but they were poor.
<P>
After the divorce, Mary and Mark moved to the West Coast with
their mother, Linda, to be closer to her family. They moved into
a townhouse after a short stay with Mary's godparents. A neighbor
took care of the kids during the day while Linda finished Montessori
training. Even with Papa, Linda's father, paying rent, &quot;we
ate peanut butter and jelly every day,&quot; remembers Mary. &quot;But
at least there we knew people. We had friends.&quot;
<P>
Because Linda desperately needed a better paying job, the threesome
moved when an offer came from a small town in the southwest. That
is when things really fell apart. They had no money, no friends,
and the local Methodist church made it clear that they were not
welcome. Linda was shocked. After all, she hadn't wanted the divorce.
She had been abandoned with two small children.
<P>
Destitute in a town far from anyone they knew, Linda worked two
jobs, and sometimes three, to make ends meet. During that time,
both Mary and her little brother were abused by strangers. There
was simply no one to protect them.
<P>
For all this, Mary and Mark can still be considered fortunate.
They lived in a relatively stable single-parent home. There was
no revolving door ushering new members into their &quot;family,&quot;
and old ones out. Nevertheless, they moved every year until Mary
was seven. Like most divorced mothers, Linda was constantly forced
to move for better jobs or cheaper housing. New friendships that
might have grown into a valuable support system for Linda and
the children were continually severed. &quot;Dad was not in the
picture at all then,&quot; says Mary. He had remarried and moved
East. They met him for the first time at the instigation of their
new stepmother, Joan, when Mary was seven. After that, they went
to visit on an annual vacation. &quot;Joan really tried hard.
But it was always stiff and awkward.&quot;
<P>
Then Linda got a job in a large city nearby. Because she would
be teaching in a public school, she would be drawing a larger
paycheck. Both Linda and the children were happy to be leaving
after two years. It had seemed an eternity. As they moved into
their new apartment, things looked up for the first time. But
soon, the school board realized that Linda had not completed a
course in state history. She kept her jobbut lost half her salary.
Their car was repossessed. And again they were forced to move,
this time into a smaller apartment shared with someone who delivered
newspapers with Linda in the early morning. &quot;Nothing had
prepared Mom to be poor, and she didn't know how to do it,&quot;
Mary says. &quot;On payday she would go out and spend all of the
money on food. By the third week of the month, the food would
run out and there was just nothing to be done about it.&quot;
<P>
Finally Linda completed the state history course and her full
salary was reinstated. Most importantly, they found a church that
wanted and welcomed them. It was a large, affluent Methodist church.
From that day on, they were never truly hungry again. Groceries
arrived when they were needed. No name, no notejust food. Anyone
could see that they were poor. But now someone was paying enough
attention to know when they were desperate.
<P>
The youth ministers took Mary and Mark under their wings. They
frequently called the children at home and they discretely provided
money to include them in youth activities. Likewise, the adults
of the church went out of their way to give time and attention
to the kids and to Linda. According to Mary, &quot;Mom needed
men to talk to. Mark was growing up, and she just didn't know
what to do with him.&quot; He had never known adult men and it
was beginning to show. There were constant school and discipline
problems.
<P>
Despite Linda's efforts, and the church's support, both kids were
falling in with bad crowds. When Mary finished junior high, she
asked to go to a private school. &quot;I didn't like what my friends
were doing, but they were my friends. I needed to break away.&quot;
So Mary worked during the summer and with Linda's help saved enough
money to attend a Catholic girls school. Mary suspects that her
grandparents helped. Still, the high tuition returned the family
to hardship. So Mary wrote her father, who came through. &quot;He
was always more willing to help with me than with Mark.&quot;
<P>
Mary and Mark were fortunate in several ways. Unlike most children
in a single-parent household, Mary and Mark both attended good
schools and completed college, even if they were not eating well.
And both have managed to avoid the most disturbing social ill
traceable to father absence: crime. But Mary is the first to admit:
&quot;I don't trust men. I can't do it.&quot; Last year, she left
a job she liked in part because she was unable to communicate
with her male boss. &quot;I should have stood up for myself. And
I know I wasn't playing the role he wanted me to play in the firm.
But I just couldn't confront him.&quot;
<P>
Mark has not begun to recover. Mary says, &quot;He simply cannot
form friendships with normal men. And he dates mean, manipulative
girls who completely envelop him. If they don't mistreat him,
he leaves. He is in his mid-twenties now. I don't know what will
happen to him.&quot; Moreover, neither Mark nor his father have
attempted to form a relationship. Since graduating from college
Mark has drifted aimlessly. Although he is not lazy, he works
only sporadically. Unable to form stable relationships, he treats
even his job as just another transitory experience.
<P>
Mary and Mark exemplify the catch-22 of divorce. Mark clearly
needed his father, and perhaps he would have benefited from a
stepfather in the house. But children, especially girls, often
find themselves in an adversarial relationship with their stepfathers,
competing for the time and affection of their mothers. As Barbara
Dafoe Whitehead reports, &quot;In general the evidence suggests
that remarriage neither reproduces nor restores the intact family
structure.... Indeed, children living with stepparents appear
to be even more disadvantaged than children living in a stable
single-parent family.&quot;19 Too often, the additional time and
income available to adults who remarry is not invested in the
children.
<P>
<B>National Fatherhood Initiative</B> 
<P>
The National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI) hopes to take a comprehensive
look at the issue of fatherlessness. As Mary's experience indicates,
the problems of growing up fatherless are not limited to urban,
black neighborhoods. They are not even limited to the poverty
most divorced women and their children suffer. There are unforeseeable
consequences for children who know that their father chose not
to live with their mother even though it meant he would not live
with them. The drama, scope, and gravity of fatherlessness in
the inner city make it a social problem of greater urgency. But
surely we should not expect poor minorities to live by standards
set, but not lived, by policymakers in the suburbs.
<P>
As Commissioner on Children, Youth and Families in the Bush Administration,
Dr. Wade F. Horn began speaking in 1991 on the importance of fathers
and of the two-parent family for child development. At first he
says, &quot;People would stand up and leave the room.&quot; They
aren't leaving anymore. Last year, Don Eberly, president of the
newly-formed National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI), asked Dr. Horn
to serve as the group's director. Conceived as a research and
education organization, NFI recently began to accept individual
memberships. &quot;We were constantly getting phone calls from
men who had seen us speak or read an article. They wanted to know
how to join, and we just got tired of telling them they couldn't.&quot;
<P>
The message that played so badly four years ago but is drawing
crowds today is a simple one. According to Dr. Horn, &quot;The
two-parent family is not just different, which is what everyone
used to say. The two parent family is better. Even if everyone
can't have that, we need the ideal. I never make this a moral
argument. There is plenty of empirical evidence.&quot; NFI has
worked to see that the evidence is given a public hearing.
<P>
&quot;We have to get rid of the myth of the superfluous father,&quot;
says Horn. &quot;A man's worth as a father is independent of his
economic status. Fathers should not be judged by the size of their
wallets. And we should not be trying to make men into assistant
mothers. Fathers play a unique and irreplaceable role in the lives
of their children.&quot;
<P>
The masculine role in nurturing children is not widely appreciated
because it does not fit into the modern definition of paternal
love. Fathers and mothers relate differently to their children.
Fathers tend to encourage their children to strive for excellence.
They push their children to be successful. And they are quick
to offer guidance and support. Because fathers demand the best
from their children, they are pivotal in character formation.
<P>
Fathers also tend to spend more time playing with their children.
Because their play is more physical than mothers', from team sports
to horseplay around the house, it becomes an important factor
in teaching children when and how to take risks. According to
NFI literature, &quot;This is a perfect example of how fathers
and mothers together form a terrific parenting team. Father encourages
risk taking. Mother encourages caution. Together, they give the
child a perfect message: try new things; use judgement; if you
get hurt or fail, we are here to comfort you.&quot;
<P>
According to Horn, it is very important that Americans realize
that &quot;men are very unlikely to be committed and responsible
fathers in the long term outside of marriage.&quot; If a child's
parents are not married, even men who try hard to be good fathers
tend to disappear from their children's lives after the first
two-and-a-half-years. But children need the love and support of
their fathers for more than just a couple of years. Moreover,
fathers who develop visiting relationships with their children
cannot replace full-time parents.
<P>
Early in his career as a clinical psychologist, Horn observed
that it was not unusual for child psychologists to believe that
they were more important to the children they treated than parents.
&quot;I remember thinking that I must have been absent on the
day they handed out the magic wands. There was no way that I,
with all of my expertise, could do for a child in a couple of
hours a week what the commitment of the parents could do. In my
experience, most parents were genuinely trying to do what was
best for their children.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The experts tend to get very caught up in the minutia of
what parents must do with their children at six months, eight
months, two years. And they predict terrible consequences if their
plan isn't followed to the letter. Actually, in nearly every case,
fathers just need a few general principles. They can work out
the application for themselves.&quot;
<P>
The three principles Dr. Horn tries to convey to fathers can be
summed up as time, commitment and responsibility. Love covers
a multitude of sins. And Dr. Horn believes that if fathers are
true to these three principles, everything else can be worked
out.
<P>
<B>Time</B>: For the last two decades, experts have said that
parents could get away with spending very little time with their
children, as long as it was &quot;quality time.&quot; Dr. Horn
says, &quot;This was a wonderful salve for parental guilt, but
a lousy way to rear children.&quot; Fathers should spend plenty
of time with their children. What families do together is less
important than their spending time together.
<P>
<B>Commitment</B>: A man must be committed to his marriage; and
he must keep his commitments to his children. Commitment shows
up in little ways every day. If you tell your child that you are
going to do something, stick to that commitment. More than anything,
you show commitment by spending time with your children. Fathers
should be willing to work as hard at their families as they do
at their careers.
<P>
<B>Responsibility</B>: A father's primary responsibilities include
insuring that his children are well fed, safely housed, and clothed.
In addition, he should teach them good manners and self-discipline.
How these matters are handled is best determined by each couple
according to its circumstances. But a father should not blame
someone else if his children are unsupervised, ill-mannered, or
not eating properly.
<P>
NFI works to persuade Americans that Washington policy formulas
cannot solve the problems their own families and communities face.
NFI President Don Eberly is quick to point out that government
policies alone, however worthy, will not rebuild America's families.
Consequently, the National Fatherhood Initiative focuses primarily
on challenging, from the ground up, the idea that fathers are
dispensable.
<P>
In October of 1994, the Initiative convened the first National
Summit on Fatherhood, which is planned as a bi-annual event. The
Summit, held in Dallas, Texas, featured board members David Blankenhorn,
actor James Earl Jones, Dr. Louis Sullivan, former U.S. Secretary
of Health and Human Services, and congressman and former pro football
star Steve Largent. Vice President Al Gore delivered one of the
keynote addresses. After the success of the Summit, NFI launched
the National Fatherhood Tour, featuring NFI board chairman David
Blankenhorn. The goal of these tours is to promote grassroots
efforts dedicated to fostering fatherhood in local communities.
<P>
Most recently, NFI has been accepted as a client of the Ad Council
and hopes to air its first public service announcements in early
1996. This year NFI published <I>Father Facts</I>, a monograph
by Dr. Horn which compiles the most compelling data on fatherhood
in a usable format.
<P>
NFI's actions at the community level will be complemented by its
most ambitious goal. Although still on the drawing board, NFI
hopes to work in five pilot cities bringing local leaders together
to create a &quot;father friendly community.&quot; Two cities
have already asked for NFI's help.
<P>
Community leaders will be asked to sign a statement supporting
the importance of fathers, and back up their commitment with three
to five specific actions supporting fatherhood in their communities.
The owner of a local radio station, for example, might commit
to airing public service announcements. A business leader might
commit to respecting an employee's family responsibilities and
to encourage other community businessmen to do likewise. The goal
is to have community members encourage one another to meet family
responsibilities and to dispel the &quot;myth of the superfluous
father.&quot;
<P>
<B>Vive La Difference</B> 
<P>
For 2,500 years, the Western philosophical tradition has spoken
on gender with one voice: women and men share in all that is essential
to human nature. Differences, in this respect, are less significant
than similarities. Nevertheless, those differences are immutable
and important for it is the differences between women and men
that form the basis of the family. Rail against them, we may.
Diminish their importance, we certainly have tried; but eliminate
them, we cannot. Even the most savage, totalitarian, Marxist regimes
were reluctantly forced to concede to human nature on this issue.
Through brutal repression families could be distorted, but they
could not be eliminated.
<P>
Failing to respect the differences and complimentary nature of
the sexes breaks down the bonds of affection in the family. The
competitive rather than cooperative spirit it sows has resulted
in widespread mistrust within an institution designed, among other
reasons, to promote the happiness of its members.
<P>
Those who see marriage as merely a contractual agreement between
consenting adults tend to view with suspicion its restrictions
upon individual liberty. Even some who wish to defend the family
as necessary find themselves in the awkward position of arguing
that while a stable society needs stable families, and stable
families need fathers, men may be happier outside of the family.
<P>
However, the evidence suggests that the bachelor's life is anything
but carefree. As George Gilder writes, &quot;In general, compared
to others in the population, the single man is poor and neurotic...
disposed to criminality, drugs, and violence. He is irresponsible
about his debts, alcoholic, accident prone, and susceptible to
disease.&quot;20 These qualities tend to slough off quickly upon
marriage, only to reappear after the loss of a wife through death
or divorce.
<P>
In short, while men may be quite capable of taking care of themselves,
they tend to do so only when they have families who need them.
Single men have almost twice the mortality rates as married men.21
<P>
At the outset of the sexual revolution, progressive pundits liked
to say that the institution of marriage, having outlived its usefulness,
was dying a natural death. But the facts of life have not changed.
Married men still earn some 70 percent more than singles <I>of
either sex</I>.22 And, far from being a liberating experience,
single motherhood is the surest route to poverty. In fact, 94
percent of the AFDC (welfare) caseload is single-parent families.23
Economically and socially, marriage subsidizes a life support
system for &quot;alternative families&quot; because they have
proven too weak to survive on their own.
<P>
Nevertheless, a handful of radical feminists argue that bringing
men home will only make matters worse for some women and children.
This undoubtedly is true but deceptive. It is like banning penicillin
because some people experience a serious allergic reaction to
it. It makes the perfect the enemy of the good. Unfortunately,
it also is an indication of how divorced some elements of the
feminist movement are from the actual experience of the large
majority of Americans. Finally, it demonstrates the ability of
a small, but well-organized coalition to perpetuate a distorted
view of family life through its influence within the academic
community.
<P>
Responsible fatherhood may not be easy. But it is natural. No
twelve-step legislative program is necessary for its recovery.
The government needs only to cease penalizing and discouraging
traditional families. Our cultural institutions, with the help
of human nature, can do the rest.
<P>
Half of anything is a lot. Half of all marriages end in divorce.
Half of all divorces involve children. Half of America's children
are growing up with only half of their parents.24 Half of the
children who do not live with their fathers have never even darkened
his doorway. It is increasingly clear that children who grow up
without their fathers don't stand half a chance.
<HR>

<P>
<h3>PROMISE KEEPERS</h3> 
<P>
Another group with a message for men is Promise Keepers, and it
has been packing football stadiums all across the country. In
May more than 50,000 men paid $55 each to attend a conference
at RFK stadium in Washington, D.C. Judging by the crowd, Promise
Keepers appeals to men of all races, professions, income levels,
and political inclinations. The message they come to hear is that
a &quot;real man&quot; worships God, loves and respects his wife,
and supports his children. Eight more conferences are scheduled
through October 1995, and five of them are already sold out. All
are in major sports arenas capable of holding large crowds.
<P>
Only the National Organization for Women could possibly feel threatened
by a group of men as wholesome and diverse as the one gathered
at RFK. But, right on cue, NOW vice president Rosemary Dempsey
told the <I>Washington Post</I> that Promise Keepers was promoting
&quot;a not-very-well-cloaked misogynistic message.&quot;
<P>
Former University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney founded
Promise Keepers in 1990. In the past year, its staff and budget
have grown more than five-fold. McCartney's goal is to reconnect
men with religion and a moral life by persuading them that men
can and should be masculine even as they worship God. Although
the organization requires no dues and is not membership-driven,
its program asks men to make seven promises: to honor Jesus Christ;
to have close male friends; to practice spiritual, moral, and
sexual purity; to be faithful to wife and children; to support
the church; to defy racial and denominational barriers; and to
go out and encourage the world to do the same.

The social and political war over 
		school choice has many battle
		fields, but none may be as important as the struggle now occurring in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which pits low-income and minority parents against the Milwaukee Teacher's Union, the National Education Association and the ACLU.  The conflict, described by author Daniel McGroarty in a new book, Break These Chains: The Battle for School Choice (Prima, 1996), is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court after the Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked 3-3 this spring on the issue of the program's constitutionality.  The outcome of the case of Jackson v. Benson  "will determine the future of the nation's most promising educational reform," says Institute for Justice attorney Clint Bolick, who represents the 1,500 parents and students participating in the program and who is pushing to expand it to 15,000 students.
	As part of a campaign to kill the voucher program in the cradle, a Milwaukee group called "Rethinking Schools" has published a 32-page pamphlet titled "False Choices: Why School Vouchers Threaten Our Children's Future," and it is working with the Milwaukee teachers union and the National Education Association to see that it is widely distributed.  McGroarty writes that the pamphlet's objective "is to taint the very idea of vouchers by portraying it as inherently racist."  In an introductory essay, Robert Lowe, editor of the eponymous newspaper put out by the group, charges that "the first school choice program provided white students in Virginia public funds in order to attend private academies in order to avoid attending public schools with blacks."  A cartoon in the Rethinking Schools newspaper, distributed free to teachers, shows black and white students drinking from separate water fountains. By poisoning a debate over educational policy with the red herring of racism, opponents of school choice think they can kill the program.
<p>
	Fortunately Rethinking Schools and its allies have formidable opponents whose advocacy of school choice in Milwaukee cannot be vanquished by whispers of racism.  One is former school superintendent Howard Fuller, who pronounced the public schools in his city "a failing system."  Fuller told Foundation Watch "I support low income vouchers.  People with money already have choice.  People like Bill and Hillary Clinton have choice.  Vouchers empower poor people, and I support the expansion of vouchers to sectarian and religious schools."  Fuller resigned as superintendent after a bruising battle with the teachers union over vouchers.  An African-American who holds a doctoral degree in Education (and who is married to the former Detroit Superintendent of Schools),  Fuller is currently a professor of education at Marquette University.
	Another choice advocate is Polly Williams, the African-American Democratic state representative from inner-city Milwaukee who broke with her party's leadership to push the choice program through the Wisconsin legislature.  A passionate believer in doing whatever it takes to secure opportunity for those she represents, Williams told McGroarty,  "The way I saw it, the system is preparing our children for slavery. Look at the situation: Drop out by tenth grade, get into the street life _ when you should be walking across that stage getting a diploma, you're standing in front of a judge wearing chains."
	Williams' statement is a sharp retort to the white liberals who provide the funding for Rethinking Schools, a group who make convenient use of Rethinking Schools' race-baiting to mask their own interests in maintaining the school system as a municipal power base and source of job security. For, contrary to the claims of Rethinking Schools, in the 1990's the push for school choice has come from advocates like Fuller and Williams and from black parents whose children are trapped in collapsing urban school systems.  School choice has become a weapon against the very forces of the white liberal power elite, forces which have impoverished the inner city and racially segregated its schools despite decades of political promises, court orders, and school busing.
	More rigid ideologues than pragmatic educators, the editors of Rethinking Schools are unmoved by the facts of the matter.  They allege that schools of choice will unfairly siphon the "cream" of Milwaukee students, the best and brightest, from the public schools, making them 'islands of excellence for the already privileged.'  In fact, Milwaukee's choice program is limited to families at or below 175 percent of the poverty line and the privileged have left the system.  But Rethinking Schools would rather kill the chance for low-income children to acquire a superior education in order to maintain control over a system that gives all children an equally inferior one. 
<p>
<a name="flow"></a>
<h3>THE EDUCATION MONEY FLOW: <br>
JOYCE'S TIDAL SHIFTS</h3>
<p>
Rethinking Schools' anti-school 
		choice tracts have been published 
		with financial support from the New World Foundation of New York City and the Joyce Foundation of Chicago.  In describing their motivation, James Miller, president of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, says that "Rethinking Schools is the new socialism.  It has just been repackaged.  They are very, very left of center, and to a large degree they are just apologists for the status quo in education."  
	With assets of some $21 million, the New World Foundation  has never shrunk from the notoriety which its support for far-left causes has provoked.  When the New World Foundation was chaired by Hillary Clinton (before she became First Lady) it funded such groups as the pro-Sandinista Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES) Education Fund, the conspiracy-minded Christic Insitute, SANE/FREEZE, and the National Lawyers Guild.  So its support for Rethinking Schools is not surprising.
  	Rethinking Schools' other patron is, however, far richer and, appropriately has been far more circumspect.  Chicago's Joyce Foundation was founded in 1948 by Beatrice Joyce Kean, whose family-owned timber business yielded profits which were invested and managed with the guidance of the family's law firm, Lord, Bissell and Brook. When she died in 1972, ninety percent of her fortune went to the Joyce Foundation. Today, the Joyce Foundation is among the top fifty private grantmaking foundations in the United States, with assets listed at $587,899,563 as of December 31, 1995.  Last year the foundation awarded some $21 million in grants in eight program areas.  
	Joyce's education division awarded the largest sum _ $7,157,740 _ to forty-three grantees.  It may be presumed that Rethinking Schools grant application was reviewed by one or more of the division's program officers. Warren Chapman was formerly an official of the Illinois State Board of Education and the Illinois Department of Corrections.  He holds a doctorate in education.  Ellen Alberding, an MBA who doubles as an investment officer for the foundation, was a scheduler on Senator Adlai Stevenson III's Democratic gubernatorial campaign and worked in development for the Express-Ways Children's Museum.  Her husband was counsel to Mayor Richard Daley.  Peter Mich, who also holds a doctorate in education, previously worked for the Boys and Girls Clubs where he specialized in computer technology.
	Last year, the Joyce Foundation gave $100,000 to Marquette University's Institute for the Transformation of Learning to support a book project to be developed jointly by Rethinking Schools editor Robert Lowe and choice supporter Howard Fuller.  Fuller told Foundation Watch  that the Joyce grant was specifically "not for support of school choice." Fuller, who has also received support from Milwaukee's pro-school choice Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation for other projects supportive of vouchers, says Joyce wanted him to conduct a project in cooperation with Lowe "looking at the social relationship of teachers to kids."  Fuller said he worked with Rethinking Schools because they do "professional development for teachers, work for more teachers in the school system, and look at developing a rigorous curriculum.  I'm not going to say I'm not going to work with you on these things because you oppose school choice." 
	Meanwhile, Joyce's education division awarded Rethinking Schools more than three times as much money to fight Fuller on the school choice issue.  In 1995, the decade-old organization _ whose principal activity is publication and distribution of a quarterly tabloid newspaper and associated propaganda pamphlets _ received a grant of $348,380 "to publish and disseminate two booklets on school vouchers, school choice, and the issue of school equity; and to publish a series of articles about school-to-work, educational standards, assessment, and school accountability (3 years)."  
	The Joyce Foundation-subsidized articles were published in the organization's Rethinking Schools  tabloid.  Like the anti-voucher booklet, they were full of venom.  The Spring, 1996 issue, looking more like a 1960's-era copy of The Daily Worker or The Militant than an educational publication, featured articles with sloganeering headlines -- "Stop the 'English-Only' Nonsense" and "'Stand for Children' June 1 in Washington" -- alongside advertisements for pamphlets with titles like "Rethinking Columbus," which promised to "critique traditional versions of the conquest and its legacy." 
	Particularly noteworthy is Rethinking Schools  "Special Report"  by editor Barbara Miner entitled "Splits On The Right."  A credit line reads: "This package on the right wing was made possible through a grant from the Joyce Foundation." Accompanied by unflattering pictures of Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Lamar Alexander, William Bennett, and Phyllis Schlafly, among others, the report described the political forces that it sees arrayed against Rethinking Schools in the fight over school choice. Miner reports that Robertson has been charged with advocating "an authoritarian theocracy" and adds parenthetically, "The paramilitary right is generally considered a distinct phenomenon, although it maintains strong links to some groups within the religious right."  She suggests that other conservatives _ significantly nameless, because to name anyone at all would reveal how baseless  her charges are _ demonstrate a "willingness to espouse blatantly white supremacist and anti-Semitic views."  Repeatedly, Miner makes assertions of the "bigotry, white supremacy, homophobia, and theocratic authoritarianism of the religious right."    
	Miner's feature asserts that the Christian right wants "education based on rote obedience and memorization, and prefers to provide children ready-made answers instead of encouraging them to think for themselves."  The issue carries a number of sidebars.  One, headlined "Bradley helps bankroll movement," attacks parental rights groups.  It blames "Republican guru"  William Kristol and Bradley Foundation president Michael Joyce for "building a movement for parents' rights as a way to counter the women's and gay movements and to rally people against the 'nanny state.'"  Also included is a three-page spread in tiny type listing "Economic Conservatives and Religous/Far Right Organizations" (including  Capital Research Center, publisher of Foundation Watch), "Progressive Groups Monitoring the Right Wing," and "Conservative Publications," a list which includes The New Republic.
	Other indicators of the publication's skewed view of reality include a "Multicultural Resources" listing which features such items as "Mother Jones, One Woman's Fight for Labor," "Sexual Harrassment Institute," "Teasing and Bullying Workshops," "Viva La Causa!" and "Overcoming Homophobia in the Elementary Classroom."  A crude cartoon called "Something For Nothing" shows a member of Congress  calling for repeal of the Emancipation Proclamation and asking, "Without slavery, how can we compete with China?"
	Howard Fuller is charitable when asked about the Joyce Foundation's support for Rethinking Schools.  He says, "Sometimes both sides get out there.  I like [Joyce Foundation president] Debby Leff. I have great respect for [education program officer] Warren Chapman and what he's trying to do to make change for kids."  The opinion of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute's Miller is more candid: "Rethinking Schools is way out there on the fringes," Miller told Foundation Watch, "and I'm sure that the Joyce Foundation people are aware of that."
	But when asked about the publications she funded with Joyce Foundation money, Foundation president Deborah Leff pleads ignorance.  "I don't know everything that group did," she told Foundation Watch when asked about the special section smearing conservatives.  "We did not fund Rethinking Schools to publish photos of Ralph Reed and Phyllis Schlafly.  We funded them on the choice issue." 
	Yet managing editor Barbara Miner told Foundation Watch that Joyce was probably aware of her group's activities, and suggested calling the Joyce Foundation to inquire. Her organization distributes 40,000 free copies of Rethinking Schools quarterly in the Milwaukee area and that "pretty much our only function is one of publishing."  She added that "Joyce has never dictated to us what to say.  But as with any grant proposal, we mentioned that there were several articles about several big issues in the education reform movement which were currently of concern."
	When asked, if Joyce did not know or approve of it, why Rethinking Schools gave the Joyce Foundation printed credit for its support of the  feature articles bad-mouthing conservatives and the Bradley Foundation,  Leff responded, "I apologize for not being familiar with the publication.  Grantees are going to put forward different perspectives, and just because a grantee takes on a position, there is no one position that's right.  That's wrong.  God help us if we have such a narrow debate so that there's only one way to go. We identify smart people, differing people."
	Some find Leff's explanations difficult to swallow. "That's a crock," says Miller.  "Did she know that Rethinking Schools were the major people who drove out [former Milwaukee superintendent of schools] Howard Fuller?  They are connected to a bunch of people who call themselves the New Party and Progressive Milwaukee, and all basically have the same address. There was a major election in Milwaukee right before Fuller resigned. The teachers union was heavily involved and the reformers lost.  Rethinking Schools was very much involved in that kind of stuff. They are totally opposed to school choice." 
	Miller's own think-tank, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, received Joyce funding for work on the school choice issue before Leff became president in 1992.  But Miller subsequently spoke with Joyce staff members who told him, off the record, that "no one like us would get funded with them again, not while Debbie Leff was there."
	Leff, says Miller, is rather unlike her predecessor, Craig Kennedy.  "Kennedy was different, in that he was interested in new ideas.  It didn't matter who you were, it was what you were interested in doing," he explained.  "I think she's interested in new ideas if they're politically correct.  But if you're not politically correct, you're not going to get funded.  Everybody who seems to get money from them in Milwaukee is way left-of-center, and the dividing issue in getting money in Milwaukee is: Are your opposed to private school choice?"
	Dr. Chester Finn, director of the Educational Excellence Network and a former Department of Education assistant secretary for educational research, agrees with Miller.  "I have had no direct knowledge of the Joyce Foundation since she took over," he told Foundation Watch.  "I knew it quite well under Kennedy.  It was one of the most interesting and open-minded foundations.  It gave me some support to study school reform in Chicago.  It was characterized by inquisitiveness, receptivity to standards and heterodox thought. I would never have thought of it as a fellow-traveller of the education establishment when Craig was running it.  I even talked to the board sometimes."
	Finn says the atmosphere changed when Kennedy left the foundation to work for Chicago businessman Richard J. Dennis.  "Craig left and this woman from the world of television arrived. I never met her.  A lot of people I know just rolled their eyes.  It was no longer an interesting, unconventional, or open-minded place under her leadership.  A kind of window closed, a shade came down.  There was no further communication.  All gone."
	Leff retorts sharply to complaints from past recipients like Miller and Finn, "If you haven't applied for funds, you can't get them."  Paula Wolff, a Joyce board member since 1989 and currently president of Governors State University in University Park, Illinois, adds that shifts in foundation priorities are normal over time, and that no one should expect the same grantees to be funded when new administrations take over foundations. "There certainly have been some new initiatives, rewriting of the guidelines, but foundations are changing all the time," she told Foundation Watch.

<h3>CHARLES U. DALY:  STILL<br>
A POWER BEHIND THE THRONE</h3>
<p>
School choice is but one example 
			of the debate over shifting fund
			ing policies at the Joyce Foundation since Deborah Leff departed New York City and ABC News for the foundation presidency in Chicago (salary $180,000). Yet one prominent member of the Joyce board disagrees with the perception that there has been a real change in priorities.  
	Charles U. Daly is a veteran of "Camelot."  A personal friend of members of the Kennedy family and keeper of its secrets as director of the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston and, currently, director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, Daly is a former president of the Joyce Foundation.
	He served on the search committee which chose Leff from a shortlist of eight finalists, "all of whom were women," he told Foundation Watch proudly. "It was time for a change from the white Anglo men," he added (Daly is Irish and maintains a farm in Ireland). A practicing Catholic, he notes with some pride that even under Leff,  "you won't find Joyce funding abortion."
	Daly held the presidency of the Joyce Foundation from 1978-86 after serving as vice-president for government and community affairs at Harvard University (1971-76) and vice-president of the University of Chicago for public affairs and development (1964-71). He is a smart politician of the old school, bluff, gruff, and tough. He salts his conversation liberally with profanity and is at once charming and intimidating. Daly makes it impossible to doubt his assertion that his gamble of putting 80% of the assets of the foundation into the stock market allowed it to grow from $160 million in 1986 to over $500 million today. He also claims credit for convincing Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to change the tax laws in a way which permitted foundations to expand rather than expend their portfolios.
	An active Democrat, and traditional Kennedy liberal, Daly is a staunch champion of Leff ( who made a personal contribution of $1,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1992 ) and believes she is supporting precisely the kinds of social concerns which  excited him when he headed Joyce.  Trained as a journalist (he has a masters degree from Columbia Journalism School) the Dublin-born Daly was a White House staffer in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He has edited three publications: Media and the Cities, The Quality of Inequality, and Urban Violence.  
	A self-professed risk-taker and high-stakes gambler,  he likens selecting Joyce grantees to his Korean War service as a Marine: "A lieutenant said, `I know damn well not enough of you are doing well, because not enough of you are getting killed.'" Leff should wear criticism like a purple heart, Daly thinks -- it means she's doing her job at Joyce. "Kennedy did a better job than I did," Daly told Foundation Watch, "and Leff is doing a better job than either of us did.  I think it is a place that is not afraid to be on the cutting edge.  I welcome that sort of continuing change."
	Leff is precisely the type of  president Daly had in mind, one who would shake things up. "The last thing we wanted was some busted-out university president who wanted to put on a tweed coat and enjoy life," he added.  "I think independent foundations ought to be independent.  Let's not all get in the same club.  I get so frustrated on all this  'lets get together and fund things...' In other areas of society, you'd call the antitrust lawyers in."
	Daly says Leff must be allowed to decide her own priorities.  "You hire the chief executive and let that person do the job.  The problem is you get used to the same people telling you you're terrific.  So you're funding Checker Finn and everyone tells you you're doing great work."  Daly says he approves of  the new directions Leff is charting.  He seems happy that Leff is annoying people.  "I see any kind of lock-step stuff as a problem area," he told Foundation Watch.  "There should be true free enterprise in foundations."
	Yet Daly's own testimony gives evidence that Leff is taking the foundation away from where Daly might have led it. Daly said he liked to fund both sides of a debate, and like that his successor, Craig Kennedy, funded the Heritage Foundation, "so you could talk to them." When pressed, he admits that during his tenure he was not personally against school vouchers.  "We put money into St. Ignatius," he recalled. "I asked Professor John Hope Franklin, `Have we screwed up the public school system by supporting private education?'  And he said, `Anything you can do to help a child get an education is worth it.'  There is some balance."  However, Daly was skeptical of the Bradley Foundation's program of grants of scholarship money to the poor children of Milwaukee, arguing, "For a foundation to piss away its assets on scholarships is not the best thing to do."  Daly did confess that he had himself attended Columbia Journalism School on a $600 scholarship (Leff was on scholarship at Princeton).
	However, Daly's faith that Leff shares his commitment to independent thinking and debate may be misplaced. She told The Chicago Tribune in 1993: "Would I fund a dissenting point of view just to have a dissenting point of view? No. It may not be valuable toward reaching [a program's] goal, especially considering the foundation has very limited funds."
<p>
<a name="greens"></a>
<h3>FUNDING THE GREENS</h3>
<p>
True to Daly's account, Leff has 
			maintained some longstanding 
			Joyce programs.  The foundation has a tradition of support for environmentalism, and it is a major supporter of efforts to clean up the Great Lakes.  Last year the foundation made sixty-one grants totalling $6,154,413 to environmental projects, making this area its second largest program expenditure.  
	One foundation insider told Foundation Watch that Joyce's environmental grants traditionally mix support for "wacky" political advocacy groups with more praiseworthy mainstream efforts.  And Jonathan Adler, director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and author of Environmentalism at the Crossroads (Capital Research Center, 1996) observes that the foundation "is one of the few philanthropies that has made grants to Greenpeace."  A $20,000 award was made to the radical environmental group in 1993 for "Eco-Clean," a "green" drycleaning method which does not use solvents.  
	In 1995, Joyce gave $750,000 to San Francisco's Tides Foundation for environmental projects; $225,000 to Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a Washington, D.C. consumer advocacy group whose founder, Ellen Haas, now oversees food labelling, food stamps and the school lunch program as President Clinton's appointee in the Department of Agriculture; and $50,000 to the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice "to identify and develop strategies for implementing President Clinton's Executive Order on Environmental Justice."
	A $100,000 grant went to the Union of Concerned Scientists Biotechnology Policy Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Adler told Foundation Watch, "They've been heavily involved in biotechnology _ in stopping it.  Why does anyone ever want to stop progress?"  But Leff strongly defends biotechnology's critics, arguing "If you start introducing genes into crops, there is a risk that the crops will become pesticide resistant over time.  You don't know what the long-term ramifications of what that gene-splicing will be.  Is it going to be for better or worse?"
	Adler observes that Leff's attitude would block most scientific research because her demands can never be satisfied.  No one can ever fully anticipate the consequences of a new technology before it is implemented.  "I think some of their funding of that area reflects a skeptical view of the value of technology. They gave some money to the Rockford Institute once, the Chronicles people, for anti-progress environmental stuff.  It was an effort by Jeremy Rifkin-types to woo paleo-conservatives."
	Leff disagrees: "We're not against biotechnology.  We are just looking at industrial tradeoffs.  We are working with industry people.  We are concerned about the midwestern United States.  We are deeply concerned about the vitality of the region."  A $200,000 grant to the Environmental Defense Fund "to encourage the use of market incentives to reduce air pollution" offers some evidence that Leff is right to deny that the Joyce Foundation is reflexively anti-business.
	Kara Kellaher Mikulich and Margaret O'Dell are the program officers for Joyce's environmental grantmaking.  O'Dell, at Joyce since 1989, previously worked in the University of Chicago's department of Foundation Relations. Mikulich, who arrived in 1996, is a Stanford law school graduate, was finance director for Senator Edward Kennedy's 1988 campaign, and worked for Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA), prior to stints with private law firms and a job as staff attorney at the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago.

<h3>FUNDING EMPLOYMENT</h3>
<p>
Employment is a third area of Joyce 
		Foundation concern.  About two-
		thirds the size of the environment program, the division last year spent $4,477,373, under the supervision of Mikulich and Unmi Song, an M.B.A. who was formerly a vice-president of Bankers Trust Company.  A political edge is evident here as well, with grants of $100,000 to the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C.; $100,000 to the Women's Legal Defense Fund; and $60,000 to the 9 to 5 Working Women Education Fund.  Carin Clauss, brought on the Joyce Board of Directors by Leff,  and U.S. Solicitor of Labor in the Carter administration, served on the litigation committee of the ACLU Women's Rights Project, and knew Leff from her political activities [see box on page 8]. Other large grants went to more mainstream projects such as $100,000 to MIT "to investigate policy and investment strategies for the metalworking industry in the Midwest region to increase its international competitiveness while expanding job opportunities."  The foundation is also a major funder of sometimes controversial  "school-to-work" programs.
<p>
<a name="gun"></a>
<h3>"GUN VIOLENCE"?  SQUASH IT!</h3>
<p>
Grants in the area of "gun vio
		lence" are the most evident sign 
		of Leff's impact on the Joyce Foundation.  Under her personal supervision _ Leff is listed as program officer in the Foundation's annual report _ Joyce gave $1,170,392 to ten projects last year.  Among them were the Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan in Chicago, which got $140,000 for "a national coalition of groups committed to a public-health approach," $42,500 to Johns Hopkins University's Center for Gun Policy and Research "to develop and promote an advertising code for firearms," and $200,000 to the Violence Policy Center in Washington, DC. (For more about gun-control groups see "Gun Control: Is theTide Turning?" by Austin Fulk, Organization Trends, June 1996.)
	Leff says she first became aware of the issue when she worked at ABC News and "looked at the number of gun deaths in Bangladesh compared to the number of gun deaths in Harlem.  To hear that men in Harlem lived less long than men in Bangladesh was shocking."  Perhaps because of the Kennedy assassinations, Daly is also a strong proponent of initiatives to deal with crimes committed with guns.  
	Leff argues that since "nobody wants 40,000 Americans to die of gun violence," the solution is obvious: "Let's take it out of the political debate and make it a consensus."  To achieve consensus on an issue that turns on the interpretation of the second amendment to Constitution, Leff resorts to the popular appeal of therapy and the authority of medicine rather than law.  
	She went to Jay Winsten, a biology Ph.D. on the faculty of the Harvard School of Public Health's Center for Health Communication, whose specialty is public relations campaigns -- most famously for the "Designated Driver." Leff gave Winsten  $50,000 in 1993 "to develop strategies to get the public to think of gun violence as a public health problem." That same year Joyce gave the Harvard School of Public Health $93,500 to conduct a Harris poll to determine "how the connection between guns and health can be made."
	In an April, 1996 Weekly Standard article called "Handgun Control, M.D." Tucker Carlson described the logic underlying Leff's approach: "Framed in medical terms, gun-related mayhem begins to look like one of society's most easily solved problems _ nothing at all like the complex affliction that has stymied the best efforts of police, judges, and criminologists for better than a century. If violence is a disease, the cure is simple: Get rid of the guns." 
	But as Carlson points out, "guns aren't pathogens; not biologically, not even metaphorically. Genuine pathogens, as any doctor knows, cause disease when introduced into a pathogen-free environment. Considering that there are more than 200 million privately owned firearms in the United States, only a miniscule fraction of which are ever used in acts of violence, guns don't qualify under this definition." Carlson argues there is no shooting epidemic, since the incidence has remained fairly steady in recent years and even declined in some localities. The medical metaphor won't work. 
	No matter. The facts of criminal justice won't stand in the way of  Leff's goal: "changing social norms." What gun owners saw as a second amendment right was instead a medical problem and the reason Leff turned to   Winsten, who developed Harvard's "Squash it" campaign at Leff's instigation.
	Winsten  works with gang members and "gangsta rappers" to get his public relations message across. He asks recording artists to include a "Squash it" lyric, and has developed his own gang-like hand signal. The Harvard professor arranges for public service announcements on television by "gangsta rap" stars. His goal is not to eliminate violent songs, but to add to them the option of walking away from confrontation. Unlike Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), former drug czarWilliam Bennett or National Political Congress of Black Women president C. Delores Tucker, Winsten likes and approves of "gangsta rap."
	He argues, "Gangsta Rap is going to continue to have violent images in it. I don't believe it caused what's happening on the streets. It's a reflection of it." Instead, Winsten maintains his goal is to provide listeners with a choice _ to fight or to walk away. He explains, "If there's a point where someone makes a business decision to walk away, offering two options, you can choose to fight or not to fight, I'm more than willing to settle for a mixed message."
	Winsten (who told Foundation Watch he did not believe the Beatles were promoting LSD use in "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" when he heard the song as a youth) has great faith that urban youth can learn nonviolent conflict resolution through "gangsta rap." One Winsten script for a P.S.A., by Vinnie of  "Naughty By Nature", illustrates Harvard's "Squash it" approach: 
	No argument is worth winning especially if it means you could lose your life. You can keep your self-respect without getting into a bunch of senseless violence. When you're involved in an argument that looks like it's going to get ugly, show that you're the strong one. Just walk away. Yo, it may not be easy at first but you can handle it. You're strong. And walking away from confrontation is the thing you'll have to learn for self-preservation. So, you, avoid the drama. Squash it (hand signal).
 	There can be no better illustration than these lyrics of what Jeffrey R. Snyder has called the "Nation of Cowards" approach to crime. Writing in the Fall, 1993 issue of The Public Interest, Snyder notes, "The media and law enforcement establishment continually advise us that, when confronted with the threat of lethal violence, we should not resist, but simply give the attacker what he wants...How can one who believes that the essence of his dignity lies in his self-determination passively accept the forcible deprivation of that self-determination?"
	Yet that is precisely what Winsten wants. And incredibly, the member of Harvard's public health faculty does not advocate that inner-city youth report crimes to the police. It is a strange position for a professional working in the field of public health, dependent as it is on epidemiological reporting data.  Yet Winsten told Foundation Watch, " When you walk up to the cop, do you think anything is going to happen?  It's like a parking violation to write up the theft of a gold chain. The criminal justice system has zero credibility with these kids." 
	Winsten's decriminalization approach -- and the concomitant medicalization of urban crime -- transfers police authority to kids who belong to criminal gangs and the singers who glorify them.. "They see that one arrest after another they are back out on the street, and [law enforcement] has major problems with credibility in the inner-city," he said. "Gangsta rappers" have credibility with street hoodlums the police lack.

<h3>STATEHOUSE SELLOUT: <br>
JOYCE MONEY FOR POLITICS</h3>
<p>
One other major Joyce Founda
			tion priority is a special Project 
			on Money and Politics directed by Lawrence N. Hansen, formerly a professor at George Washington University who headed the "Democracy Agenda Project."  Hansen was once vice-president of the failed Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, which was well-endowed by Richard Dennis, and whose board included  Henry Cisneros, Alan Sagner (a Clinton appointee to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting), and Peter C. Goldmark, Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation (see Foundation Watch v.I, n.4, May, 1996,  "The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism"). He also had been administrative assistant to Senator Adlai Stevenson III (D-IL) and Vice-President Walter Mondale. Hansen made thirteen grants totalling $1,082,190 to this project in 1995.
	Joyce grants in this category include a $30,000 grant to the leftist magazine Mother Jones for articles on the 1996 campaign finances of the 1994 freshman class in Congress; $200,000 to the Center for Responsive Politics to track campaign contributions; $80,000 to National Public Radio to cover campaign finance issues; $75,000 to the Radio Television News Directors Association for seminars on campaign finance; and $30,000 to the Tides Foundation to monitor radio coverage of money and politics. 
	The Center for Public Integrity in Washington, D.C. is on retainer with ABC News, Leff's former employer. It is headed by Charles Lewis, like Leff a former television producer (for Nightline and 60 Minutes). Last year it received $109, 912 from Joyce for a project which resulted in a special series The Indianopolis Star: "Statehouse Sellout: How Special Interests Hijacked the Legislature."   Of course, the story paid scant attention to the interests of foundations, or the power of their money (for example, Joyce grants approved by Daly during his presidency stopped the World's Fair from coming to Chicago). The Star's front page photo caption read "Money Talks," the lead read:
	Something was missing from the Indiana General Assembly last year. Oh, the lawmakers were there, all right. The lobbyists were out in force. And so was big money. Nowhere in sight? Democracy.
	Such apocalyptic and hysterical language is echoed in Leff's "President's Letter" in the Joyce Foundation's 1995 Annual Report. Featuring the quotation from the Star, Leff's prose reads as if it had been ripped from the 1960's manifesto of a  New Left Radical:
	The date: 1996. 
	The place: Governments across America. 
	The crimes: Theft of the American people's confidence in the institutions that govern them. 
	Assault on the belief they have a voice and that those they elect will listen to them. 
	Leff concludes her letter with an impassioned call to arms:
	In the past, Americans have rallied when democracy is in danger.  It is time we do so again.
	Before it is too late, Charles Daly and the board of the Joyce Foundation should take another look at the direction their Foundation is heading. The warning signs are clear for those who wish to see them.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>

	There are several errors of fact in your recent essay on the Rockefeller Foundation, but there is one in particular that I would like to correct. In describing John Frohnmayer's visit to Artists's Space in 1989 and the confrontation he faced on that occasion, you report that I was present.  I was not there. I realize that you are quoting John when you write this; he and I have spoken, and he confirms he has written and reported this as fact. But he mis-remembers (it happens to us all), and I simply want to set the record straight.
	John and I met many times, and sometimes we disagreed, but not in that place and not in that way.
<p>
Alberta Arthurs<br>

<p>
	John Frohnmayer was provided with a copy of Albera Arthurs' letter and has not retracted his statements. However Susan Wyatt, who organized the event, has a plausible explanation for the misunderstanding. She told Foundation Watch, "She was not there. He made an error. She was invited, there was a list of names that was released to the press before the meeting, but she did not come."
<p>
	In regards to the Bruce Nauman works referred to in the "article" you did about the American Center in Paris: You are blatantly misrepresenting the artist's work. Her's what you wrote, and what remains on your web page as of my writing this:
<p>
  Fred Henry was no stranger to the gross and disgusting. His Bohen Foundation had been a sponsor of a Bruce Nauman exhibit that was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum. It featured neon signs flicking "F--- and Die," "S--- and Die," and depicted excited male sexual organs and a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals.
<p>
	The work which included the words Americans use but can't seem to hear or type is "100 Live and Die." In this piece, columns of 2 1/2" neon letters spell out 100 different verb phrases, including "F--- AND DIE" as well as "BREATHE AND DIE." Each verb is presented twice. Once with the words "AND LIVE" and once with the words "AND DIE." The words "f---" and "s---" are the only two out of the seven one can't say on network television which are included in this work. This work occupies a wall space of approximately 12' x 16', and the sequence of the illumination of the 100 word patterns happens over a period of about ten minutes, as I remember it.<p>
	The "depicted excited male sexual organs" your editor refers to are probably part of another neon piece where, in a two image sequence, a cartoon sillhouette of a clown doesn't have an erection and then has an erection.<p>
	The most hysterical dis-informational reference is to "a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals." These works are either straight aluminum or bronze castings of taxidermy forms, or groupings of the styrofoam forms themselves. Hint: These are the forms that taxidermists use to fill the skin of the animals hunters shoot.<p>
	Your inability to convey even the tiniest evidence that you have a clue as to what is going on culturally makes me distrust you even more than the image of the "Capitol" on top of the word "Capital."<p>
	Your veil is thin.<p>
Jonathan Waterbury<br>

<p>
	We stand by our account of the Nauman show. 
<p>	
	Your new monthly Culture Watch with its emphasis on positive examples in a blizzard of bad news is badly needed.<p>
	If future issues are as telling as your first one on Frederick Stocken, you will help fill a void in America's cultural wasteland.<p>

For Joyce Foundation President Deborah Leff, Sisterhood has been Powerful
<p>
	Deborah Leff has long been a political activist. The fourty-four year old, five-foot two, never-married brunette is a protege of Michael Pertschuk, head of the Federal Trade Commission in the Carter Administration (she listed him as a reference when she applied for the Joyce job). Pertschuck says Leff was in his inner circle because "she was both a lawyer and a journalist." Pertschuk now heads the Advocacy Institute, which provides "strategic planning" to "those who advocate social and economic justice." From 1980 to 1981, she was director of the FTC's office of public affairs. She had helped design and implement Ralph Nader's consumer complaint study in 1974 while working at the Center for Responsive Law. Among her FTC projects was a ban on advertising to children (dropped when Ronald Reagan won in 1980).  Joyce gave Pertschuk's group $150,000 over two years shortly after Leff became president. <p>
	Leff's other cause has been the feminist movement. She entered Princeton on scholarship in 1969 at the recommendation of a family friend, the first year the University accepted women.  There she displayed a knack for cultivating powerful protectors. Leff was on University committees with then-president William Bowen, now president of the Mellon Foundation (see Foundation Watch vol.1, no.2,  "How they took the Stars and Stripes off the American Center in Paris"). Chosen University Scholar and Mademoiselle college guest editor, Leff rapidly became drawn into the feminist movement, joining the National Women's Political Caucus _ despite opposition from her mother (a National Institutes of Health researcher). "To her, women's movement people were a bunch of bra-burners," Leff told an interviewer. "She had made it on her own...and she just didn't see a need for it." <p>
	At the National Women's Political Committee, Leff came under the protection of Liz Carpenter, Lady Bird Johnson's confidant.Within a year, she was NWPC political director and receiving course credit for her activity.  Her  senior thesis was study of  media and the women's movement  She was "stunned" when she interviewed Walter Cronkite and he referred to feminist "nuts in the movement." Leff did not inform him she was politicial director for the NWPC. She did not obtain permission to sell her interviews. And she failed to find a publisher for her thesis, chapters of which remain sealed to this day.<p>
	 After Princeton, Leff went to work for Nader (a Princeton alum) and then studied law at the University of Chicago. There, Leff joined the "women's caucus" which filed a sex discrimination complaint against the school.  Her attempted transfer to Yale Law School failed when she was rejected. Leff graduated in 1977, went to work for the Carter administration, and the university later settled the case. <p>
	Leff joined Nightline as a field producer in 1983 on the recommendation of a feminst already at ABC News. She joined the "ABC News women's advisory board" with Carole Simpson to protest sex discrimination at the network.  Leff was promoted to senior producer on Nightline, World News Tonight, and 20/20 but never got  the job she wanted: executive producer for  Peter Jennings.<p>
	Through American Council of Learnerd Societies president Stanley Katz (whom she had known at the University of Chicago Law School), Leff contacted Adele Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation (and dean of students when she attended Princeton).  Simmons passed her name on to Jan Piercy,  a MacArthur consultant  and First Lady Hillary Clinton's Wellesley roomate, who then recommended Leff to Joyce.<p>

<h2>From The Editor:</h2>
<P>
This is the first issue of <I>Foundation Watch.</I> Our motto
is &quot;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&quot;
<P>
Philanthropic foundations are growing increasingly important in
the United States, not only for how much they give, but for those
who get their grants. While individuals (who still provide the
bulk of contributions) usually wish to help other individuals
in need, many foundations have a more ambitious agenda. They see
grantmaking as a catalyst for social change.
<P>
The impact of this sector is clearly considerable. As the federal
budget begins to shrink, foundations will be called upon to fill
in the gaps. How will they respond?
<P>
That is the question which will undergird our reporting and is
the rationale for starting this publication. We maintain a critical
point-of-view, but we wish to be fair.
<P>
We look forward to thoughtful responses from interested readers,
and invite those with opposing points of view to contribute to
a lively debate.
<P>
We also look forward to <a href="mailto:info@crc.org">receiving letters to the editor, guest
columns, and your story ideas</a>. In coming months, we hope to add
a variety of features to our coverage of philanthropy, including
interviews, profiles, and book reviews.

<h2>PBS's National Issues Convention and the Charles F. Kettering
Foundation: The Power of Money in Politics</h2>
<P>
<I>In this election year, an imposing array of well-endowed American
foundations, following the lead of the Charles F. Kettering Foundation,
have been quietly funding a set of civic education projects. These
projects purport to promote clearer thinking about democracy by
improving the way journalists cover it. Last month their endeavors
aimed for a national audience on PBS's broadcast of the National
Issues Convention. The outcome suggests that neither democracy
nor journalism was well served.</I> 
<P>
Television watchers who tuned into the National Issues Convention
in Austin, Texas (broadcast live on PBS on the night of January
20th and morning of January 21st) could see what appeared to be
a worthy endeavor in civics education. The Convention was billed
as an opportunity for over four hundred ordinary American citizens
to talk with presidential candidates, policy experts, and with
each other about their genuine concerns.
<P>
PBS viewers saw a &quot;town hall&quot; event intended to be informative
rather than confrontational. In separate segments, casually dressed
Americans asked carefully worded questions about the economy,
foreign policy, and family values to Vice President Al Gore, who
represented President Clinton, and to Republican Presidential
candidates Senators Richard Lugar and Phil Gramm, former Governor
Lamar Alexander and Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes, Jr. Jim Lehrer,
host of PBS' nightly <I>Newshour</I>, moderated the broadcasts,
which totalled nine and a half hours on the PBS schedule.
<P>
Professor James S. Fishkin, chairman of the department of government
at the University of Texas, had provided the blueprint for the
Convention. It was financed by major philanthropic foundations
and touted by a significant minority of the national media. And
it received advice and counsel from Washingtonbased political
elites. PBS called its undertaking &quot;The Democracy Project.&quot;
The $4 million cost of organizing and televising the National
Issues Convention was the first major investment by PBS in election-year
coverage for 1996.
<P>
Viewers would have no way of knowing that &quot;The Democracy
Project&quot; is but one part of a larger and long-standing project
to reshape American politics. Key players include the Charles
F. Kettering Foundation (assets $167 million) and its ally the
Public Agenda Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts (assets roughly
$2 billion) and the James S. Knight Foundation (assets approximately
$800 million).
<P>
The enterprises of these foundations travel under a number of
different names. The Kettering Foundation refers to its support
for &quot;encouraging deliberation.&quot; The Pew Charitable Trusts
fund programs in &quot;civic journalism,&quot; while the Knight
Foundation funds &quot;public journalism.&quot; Sometimes one
foundation &quot;fronts&quot; for another. For example, over $1
million over the last four years has been funneled from the Knight
Foundation through the Kettering Foundation for &quot;public journalism&quot;
projects.
<P>
When these foundations refer to &quot;deliberation&quot; and &quot;civic&quot;
and &quot;public journalism,&quot; they seem to refer to particular
proposals for reforming the way the media covers political debate
and election campaigns. Reporters are chastised for reporting
on the horse-race, &quot;who's ahead?&quot; aspects of campaigns
and for relying on sound-bites to convey candidates' positions.
Instead, the media are urged to be more serious and analytical.
<P>
This public agenda has a far more troubling private purpose. The
foundations hope to use a tamed media to change the way citizens
listen to candidates and learn about issues. By transforming the
way they select and present &quot;news,&quot; the newly &quot;re-educated&quot;
media will &quot;improve&quot; citizen decision making about politics.
&quot;Better&quot; candidates will be elected to public office
and &quot;better&quot; public policies will result.
<P>
In reality, the grantmakers are funding a multimillion dollar
experiment to reorganize the American political process to their
own liking, to protect their own priorities and privilege their
own programs.
<P>
National Issues Convention promoters wish to preempt the exciting
rough-and-tumble of American elections and replace them with a more
manageable &quot;deliberative&quot; process. This process is intended
to stifle genuine political disagreements, under the rubric of
&quot;deliberation,&quot; consensus, and nonpartisanship.
<P>
If the backers of the Convention have their way, sharp passions
will be smothered and political arguments muffled in a great liberal
stew of &quot;dialogue&quot; cookedup by PBS, the Kettering Foundation,
the Public Agenda Foundation, and their network of other government
and foundation-financed agencies.
<P>
At best, such programs would serve up pablum that cannot satisfy
the hunger of Americans for real public debate. At worst, the
body politic would be poisoned by a diet of thought-control.
<P>
<I><B>THE MEDIA'S NEW ASSIGNMENT: CREATING THE &quot;IDEAL CITIZENRY&quot;</B></I>

<P>
Liberals and conservatives love to complain about how the media
covers politics.
<P>
Pundits such as Anthony Lewis, David Broder and James Fallows criticize
the media for fostering a low level of public discourse. They
say public policy debate is pushed to the sidelines by corporate-controlled,
profit-oriented outlets which pander to the fascinations of a
mass public. The result is tabloid TV, Willie Hortonstyle political
advertisements, and photoops for politicians like the Contract
with America signing on the Capitol steps. Liberals conclude that
voters are kept ignorant because the media does not provide the
information they need to make rational decisions.
<P>
Conservatives answer that Americans are politically frustrated
because an iron triangle of government, special interests, and
the media shade the facts about government spending, taxes, education,
and crime. &quot;Reporting&quot; on television network news and
in major daily newspapers too often ignores or slyly denigrates
the genuine grievances of ordinary Americans while pushing the
public agenda of liberal elites. They say Rush Limbaugh provides
information which the American people otherwise would not hear.
<P>
The thesis underlying the National Issues Convention purports
to answer both of these concerns. It is developed in Professor
James Fishkin's book, <I>The Voice of the People</I> (Yale, 1995),
which is a sequel to his earlier <I>Democracy and Deliberation
</I>(Yale, 1991).
<P>
Fishkin argues that the media needs a new assignment if the American
republic is to achieve its full potential. He opines that the
media should not treat election campaigns as sporting events in
which one side scores points against the other. He suggests that
journalists pay less attention to the positions and promises of
the candidates.
<P>
Instead, he proposes that the media be of service to American
democracy by helping to educate<B> </B>its citizens about politics
and government through face-to-face encounters in small groups.
<P>
Fishkin says that to become &quot;ideal citizens&quot; ordinary
Americans need to be informed by &quot;nonpartisan&quot;and &quot;unbiased&quot;
factual materials instead of by partisan rhetoric. These materials
will give them a shared background for understanding the issues
of the day. Citizens can then sort through their findings by engaging
each other in facetoface discussions. This will help them learn
from each other's diverse experiences, hash out individual differences,
and find common ground. Disinterested experts will be available
to help them &quot;come to public judgement.&quot;
<P>
The result should be that rational &quot;deliberation&quot; replaces
&quot;debate.&quot; The ideal citizen will base his electoral
decisions on solid information and rational deliberations instead
of on soundbites and emotion. Last month's National Issues Convention
represented a major commitment by PBS and grantmaking foundations<B>
</B>to Fishkin's reform project.
<P>
Fishkin hands the media a plum assignment. His proposal plays
to the interest some in the media have to be more than passive
recorders of the day's events. It offers the media the chance
to be players in the political game, not mere reporters on the
sidelines. Fishkin means to mobilize the media to &quot;educate&quot;
voters to think the way he wants them to think. And his goal is
congruent with the aims of the large and powerful foundations
such as Kettering, which has worked with him since at least 1991.
Fishkin's &quot;deliberative poll experiment&quot; provides a
veneer of academic respectability to the &quot;Kettering technique.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS</B></I> 
<P>
Like Texas itself, the National Issues Convention event was nothing
if not big. PBS devoted some nine and a half hours to coverage
of the affair. Hundreds of newspaper and television reporters
flew into Austin from across the country.
<P>
On the day before the event, The Poynter Institute for Media Studies,
a private foundation which controls the stock of <I>The St. Petersburg
Times</I>, held its own seminar to instruct journalists on covering
the National Issues Convention.
<P>
And New York University's Project on the Press and Public Life,
which is supported by the Knight and Kettering foundations, offered
journalists seminars on how to cover the actual 1996 campaign.
<P>
Before the broadcast, in December of 1995, the National Opinion
Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago had polled
a random sample of<B> </B>900 citizens across America on their
political opinions. In January, some 600 were invited to travel
allexpensespaid to the University of Texas at Austin. Four hundred
fifty-nine arrived despite the East Coast blizzard. The participants
were welcomed by Governor George W. Bush, enjoyed free lunches
and dinners, went linedancing, and were further buoyed by $300
in spending money.
<P>
For four days these &quot;delegates,&quot; each supposed to represent
375,000 fellow Americans, listened to addresses by presidential
candidates -- but not Clinton, Dole or Buchanan -- and met in
small discussion groups to &quot;deliberate&quot;over public issues.
<P>
Facilitators trained by the Charles F. Kettering Foundation guided
their deliberations, and both facilitators and public participants
read discussion materials prepared by the Public Agenda Foundation
at the request of the Kettering Foundation. At the end of the
exercise, participants were polled a second time to determine
how the process of &quot;deliberation&quot; had affected their
thinking.
<P>
Fishkin had predicted that the process of deliberation would refine
and elevate the views of the Convention participants. At a Washington
press conference on January 25 and on a nationally-televised PBS
special the next evening, Fishkin announced results from the Convention's
&quot;deliberative poll.&quot;
<P>
Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes, Jr. must have been sorry he agreed
to participate in the Austin pow-wow. The press release for Fishkin's
Washington, DC appearance trumpeted polling results showing support
for the flat tax dropped from 43.5 percent in December to 29.8
percent. This drop happened after Convention participants had
the opportunity to &quot;deliberate&quot;-- and after three Republican
rivals and the Vice-President of the United States had savaged
his proposal.
<P>
However, other post-deliberation poll results reflect a muddle
of opinions, some liberal, some conservative, some confused and
contradictory.
<P>
After the four days spent in small and large &quot;facilitated&quot;
discussions in Texas, &quot;delegates&quot; who reported believing
that the average worker does not receive a fair day's pay for
a fair day's work went up from 26.6 percent to 40.4 percent; that
the amount the U.S. is spending on education and training is too
little increased from 71.9 percent to 86.3 percent; that economic
pressure is the biggest problem for the American family rose from
35.5 percent to 50.7 percent; that making divorce harder to get
would strengthen the family climbed from 36.1 percent to 56.7
percent; that the federal government should not cut spending on
foreign aid to reduce the federal budget deficit ticked up from
9.3 percent to 20.6 percent (still leaving roughly 80 percent
in favor of cutting foreign aid); that federal programs such as
welfare<B> </B>should be turned over to the states <I>increased
</I>from 49.5 percent to 62.5 percent (Newt Gingrich, call your
office!)<B>.</B> 
<P>
In foreign policy, those agreeing to send the American military
to foreign trouble spots increased from 20.8 percent to 37.7 percent.
And those who expressed overall disagreement with an isolationist
foreign policy rose from 33.7 percent to 47.8 percent.
<P>
Yet, despite Fishkin's early predictions of change, other views
remained rock solid after &quot;deliberation.&quot; For example,
both before and after polling showed more than 80 percent of the
delegates believe that the economy can function only if businesses
make good profits; 68 percent think that the traditional family
has suffered a breakdown; 72.8 percent held that the post-Cold
War U.S. should shift resources from military to domestic needs;
68 percent continued to believe prayer in school would be somewhat
useful or very useful; 88 percent held that moral education in
the schools would be somewhat or very useful.
<P>
In short, the results were vague and confusing. While the delegates
desires seem quite predictable, the results undermined Fishkin's
own prophecy that delegates would be better able to make &quot;hard
choices&quot; after the &quot;deliberative process.&quot; Americans,
as one might expect, wished to have their cake and eat it, too,
even in his &quot;deliberative poll.&quot;
<P>
Nevertheless, Fishkin told reporters that the process of deliberation
helped Convention participants to act &quot;more like ideal citizens,&quot;
giving their judgments what he called a &quot;recommending force.&quot;
He argued,&quot;These people become representative of what the
country could come to if people were more engaged in the issues.
It is meant to be a poll with a human face. The real power of
this event is in the voice of the people.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin said he hoped the occasion would be a prototype for future
citizen gatherings. Yet newspaper accounts of the Convention's
actual procedures have cast doubt on such expectations. According
to <I>Washington Post </I>reporter John Yang, factual errors were
often not even corrected in the moderated group discussions. This
has led some to wonder how the &quot;deliberative process&quot;
was different from an ordinary barroom or dorm room &quot;bull
session.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin responded to the observation that delegates were sharing
ignorance by asserting, &quot;We were terribly concerned that
moderators might intrude their own views by giving facts to citizens.
So the moderators had to sit back. It was not their role to correct
them. Other citizens might. In the real world, when you are engaged
in political discussions, you might not have your facts exactly
right. The point was that people were not meant to make a political
judgement.&quot;
<P>
Similarly, the claim to rational deliberation has been undermined
by participants who reported emotional interchanges in group meetings.
One moderator explained, &quot;Emotion is very much a part of
it. There were many emotional moments in our conversation. I keep
coming back to the welfare mother in our group who got $10.90
twice a month from child support from the father of three of her
five children. There were times where there were tears in the
room, too. I think the level of emotion came from how close we
felt to each other.&quot;
<P>
When asked about the crying jags, Fishkin said, &quot;There's
emotion involved in the way people make judgements, can't take
it out completely, value judgements take emotion as well.&quot;
Yet Fishkin had earlier said the value of &quot;deliberation&quot;
was its rationality, not arousal of feelings.
<P>
Finally, the presidential candidates continued to make stump speeches
and hurl soundbites. No improvement there. Vice President Al Gore,
for instance, violently attacked the flat tax, calling it &quot;a
huge tax cut on those who are most able to pay, and a huge tax
increase on those who are least able to pay.&quot;
<P>
During his session Gore even resorted to an audience &quot;show
of hands&quot; to ratify his opinions, which Jim Lehrer did not
stop, simply saying, &quot;You're the Vice President.&quot;
<P>
One might also question whether the 459 Convention delegates were
truly representative of the American public. They were meant to
be a random sample of citizens by age, race, sex, region, marital
status, and voting history. But were they?
<P>
Former CBS News polling director Warren Mitofsky asserted that
such a small, and effectively self-selective sample, could not
represent the public: &quot;It's not deliberative, and it's not
a poll.&quot; Andrew Kohut, former director of the Times Mirror
polling center and an advisor to the project concurred, &quot;It's
not a poll.&quot;
<P>
Even non-experts could question the delegate sample: a mere seven
percent of the group earned $40,000 $49,000; 18 percent listed
&quot;Other&quot; as religion, rather than Protestant, Catholic
or Jew, and 12 percent listed &quot;None.&quot; Young people seemed
to outweigh the elderly: only 9 per cent were aged 6069, 12 per
cent aged 5059, and 21 percent aged 4049. NORC could not provide
a breakdown by occupation, and it did not provide statistics giving
comparable U.S. averages for age and occupation.
<P>
<I><B>DEVELOPING &quot;THE KETTERING TECHNIQUE&quot;</B></I> 
<P>
So what were the foundations get
ting for their money, if not a poll? <BR>
On its face, the Convention appears to have provided a pleasant
and perhaps edifying vacation for some four hundred Americans,
air-time for some Presidential candidates, a moment of celebrity
for Professor Fishkin, and stupefying boredom for anyone mistaken
enough to have watched the PBS coverage.
<P>
A closer look at the organizations and individuals supporting
the Convention provides clues to the real agenda and issues at
stake. <B> </B>Materials published in support of the Convention
suggest that the issues raised in the televised &quot;deliberative
poll&quot; owe less to the real concerns of the American people
or even the professional interests of<B> </B>Professor Fishkin
than to the long-standing interests of the Charles F. Kettering
Foundation. Under the direction of its president, David Mathews,
the Foundation has developed and promoted its ideas on &quot;encouraging
deliberation.&quot; It may well be that what Fishkin calls the
&quot;voice of the people&quot; is actually the &quot;Voice of
Kettering.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin's deliberative polling techniques are not unlike those
used by the National Issues Forums which the Kettering Foundation
has sponsored since 1981. (The one major difference is Fishkin's
selection of the Convention's participants by random sample rather
than by pure selfselection.) Moreover, both the National Issues
Convention and the National Issues Forums use materials on public
affairs prepared by the Public Agenda Foundation. Both also rely
on intensive small group discussions with moderators and use participant
polling<B> </B>before and after group discussions.
<P>
The Kettering Foundation was established in 1927 by Charles F.
Kettering, inventor of the automatic starter and the Delco generator.
A private operating foundation headquartered in Dayton, Ohio,
with offices in Washington, DC and New York City, Kettering maintains
a staff of twenty-five full-time professionals and about as many
support personnel. Kettering says it does not make grants, although
its grants are clearly reported on the IRS forms of the Public
Agenda Foundation. Nor does it publish an annual report. It reported
spending almost $8 million dollars in 1992. Kettering is ostensibly
non-partisan, and the roster of board members includes several
corporate executives and Republican Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa.
<P>
A recent brochure summarizes the Foundation's mission and methods:
&quot;Kettering treats politics in its broadest sense: politics
as a dimension of everyday life rather than only what officeholders
and governments do. The research is done for practical purposes;
it goes into crafting `tools' (study guides, community worksbooks,
and other exercises) that help a public act responsibly and effectively
on its problems.&quot; The Foundation reports that these materials
are used by a network of over 6,000 civic and educational organizations,
ranging from literacy groups to religious groups and neighborhood
associations.
<P>
Kettering's interest in reshaping the deliberative process can
be traced back to the early 1960s<B> </B>during the Cold War.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->At that time, the
foundation was a supporter of the Dartmouth Conference, a project
of <I>Saturday Review</I> editor Norman Cousins, a Kettering board
member. The Conference's mission was to ease U.S.-Soviet tensions
by promoting East-West &quot;understanding.&quot; It did this
by<B> </B>sponsoring &quot;face-to-face&quot; meetings between
selected Soviet and American citizens.
<P>
The concept of promoting personal encounters between people of
different backgrounds to talk about politics was established in
this dubious context. From the first Dartmouth meeting in 1960
through subsequent international affairs programs in the Soviet
Union and China in the late 1980s, Kettering has always taken
a keen interest in promoting discussion processes &quot;designed
for situations where traditional negotiation and mediation are
of limited usefulness.&quot;
<P>
At home, Kettering's support for the Domestic Policy Association,
the original sponsor of what became the National Issues Forum,
had a similar aim. Other Kettering projects have included the
Community Foundations Network, which links local foundations with
one another; Youth At Risk Forums and Classroom Forums, held in
cooperation with schools and colleges; the Humanities Project,
done in collaboration with libraries and educators; the Civil
Society Exchange, to smooth international relations in the way
of the Dartmouth Conference; Public Journalism seminars, and the
Public Voice PBS program, sort of stripped-down versions of the
National Issues Convention. All share the same premise that &quot;public
talk fosters knowledge, deliberation, and reason qualitatively
superior to narrowly focused and particularized points of view...&quot;
<P>
One 1987 project was described in the Kettering newsletter thus:
&quot;prisoners at the Westville Correctional Center in northern
Indiana have taken on a new role: that of public policy experts
on farm, immigration, and crime issues.&quot; This event was repeated
at a number of other prisons.
<P>
Clearly, the National Issues Convention was a logical outgrowth
of these Kettering activities. They have been described as &quot;deeply
interdependent&quot; and &quot;mutually reinforcing&quot; by president
David Mathews. &quot;They fit together like one of those pyramids
of oranges in a supermarket,&quot; he wrote in <I>Connections</I>,
the Kettering newsletter.
<P>
<I><B>THE PEOPLE OF KETTERING</B></I> 
<P>
<B>DAVID MATHEWS </B>The president of Kettering, age 61, is a
political &quot;independent&quot; who was Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare in the Ford Administration from 1975-77,
then president of the University of Alabama. He joined Kettering
in 1981. Mathews whose salary of over $190,000 a year is more
than Bob Dole's, Phil Gramm's or Al Gore's<B> </B>is also a trustee
and member of the executive committee of the Public Agenda Foundation.
<P>
Mathew's foreword to a 1991 Kettering study, <I>Citizens and Politics:
A View from Main Street America</I> referred to &quot;the erosion
of political legitimacy&quot; which requires changes to &quot;the
basic conditions of political practice.&quot; Mathews expressed
concern over the public's distrust of politics and government,
but marvelled at its involvement in local community affairs. He
concluded, &quot;The real challenge is to get the formal political
system reattached to the politics that people practice in trying
to deal with local problems.&quot; Interestingly, the study was
conducted by Richard Harwood, a former staffer at the Public Agenda
Foundation.
<P>
In 1980, in the <I>Washington Post</I>, writer Walter Shapiro
described Mathews as &quot;...the best recent example of a cipher
in the cabinet. As one high ranking veteran of the Ford White
House put it, 'We sent Mathews to HEW and never heard from him
again. He used to show up at cabinet meetings every three or four
weeks but nobody was ever sure why...'&quot;
<P>
Mathews' one major venture into the headlines may have stimulated
his interest in &quot;deliberation.&quot; <I>The Swine Flue Affair:
Decision Making on a Slippery Slope</I>, a special report prepared
by Richard Neustadt for Joseph Califano, Mathews' successor at
HEW, concluded that<B> </B>Mathews played a central role in the
failure of<B> </B>a 1976 federal program against an epidemic which
never materialized, an enterprise which cost taxpayers $135 million,
left 12 people dead, and over 250 paralyzed.
<P>
On March 15, 1976, Mathews wrote OMB director James T. Lynn, &quot;There
is evidence there will be a major flu epidemic this fall...The
projections are that this virus will kill 1 million Americans
in 1976.&quot; In fact, the only deaths reported from swine flu
were those resulting from Mathews' vaccination program.
<P>
As detailed by<B> </B>Neustadt, the litany of Mathews' failures
in judgement included:
<UL>
<LI> &quot;overconfidence by specialists in theories spun from
meager evidence;&quot;
<LI> &quot;conviction fueled by a conjunction of some preexisting
personal agendas;&quot;
<LI> &quot;zeal by health professionals to which make their lay
superiors do right;&quot;
<LI> &quot;premature commitment to deciding more than had to be
decided;&quot;
<LI> &quot;failure to address uncertainties in such a way as to
prepare for reconsideration;&quot;
<LI> &quot;insufficient questioning of scientific logic and of
implementation prospects;&quot;
<LI> &quot;insensitivity to media relations and long term credibility
of institutions.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
Not surprisingly Mathews is also trustee of the Public Agenda
Foundation -- and a member of its executive committee. Kettering
gave over $1 million to the Public Agenda Foundation in 1992.
<P>
Some years earlier Mathews was an executive committee member for
a Public Agenda project, &quot;Public Summit,&quot; which challenged
Americans to engage in &quot;cooperative problem solving&quot;
with the Soviet Union.
<P>
<B>ROBERT KINGSTON </B>Fishkin worked closely with Kingston, editor
of <I>The Kettering Review</I>, to train moderators for two earlier
British public affairs telecasts based on his book and in preparing
subsequent procedures for the Convention.
<P>
Kingston, born a British subject, has considerable experience
in directing programs for public uplift. Like Mathews, he was
an official in the Ford administration. As a former acting chairman
of the National Endowment for the Humanities, he ran comparable
discussion groups on the 200th anniversary of the Declaration
of Independence. Later, Kingston headed the College Board, which
administers the national Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT). Kingston's
fee as a Kettering &quot;Associate&quot; was $132,431 in 1992.
<P>
<B>DIANE EISENBERG </B>Eisenberg, another Kettering &quot;Associate,&quot;
was the first to initiate discussions with Fishkin about the project
in 1991, in her work for the foundation's Washington, DC operation.
She is a classic &quot;educrat,&quot; former Washington representative
of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges and
executive director of the Washington, DC<B> </B>Council for the
Advancement of Citizenship. Eisenberg was paid $94,011 by Kettering
in 1992.
<P>
<B>NOELLE McAFEE </B>Fishkin's assistant director for the National
Issues Convention and a graduate student in the department of
philosophy at the University of Texas, McAfee is also an editor
of <I>The Kettering Review </I>and has worked with Kettering for
eight years. In 1987 and 1988, she worked as an &quot;organizer&quot;
with &quot;Congress Watch,&quot; a project of the Naderite group
Public Citizen. At the time, Public Citizen was helping to organize
the vicious media and political campaign to defeat President Reagan's
nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
<P>
<B>KATHERINE FANNING </B>Fanning is chairman of the board of the
Kettering Foundation. She is former editor-in-chief of the <I>Christian
Science Monitor </I>and<I><B> </B></I>the mother of Frederick
W. (Ted) Field, a Hollywood movie producer and heir to the Marshall
Field family fortune worth an estimated $700 million. (According
to <I>The Los Angeles Times</I><B>, </B>Ted Field is the fifthlargest
donor to the Democratic Party, having personally contributed over
$1.2 million since 1986. Field explained his partisan generosity
this way: &quot;I consider the Religious Right in the Republican
Party to be very close to Nazism.&quot; He also owns the gangsterrap
label Interscope Records, which Sen. Bob Dole has criticized for
producing songs containing violent and offensive lyrics.)
<P>
In the late 1980s Fanning was a member of the PBS program policy
committee.<B> </B>Currently she sits<B> </B>on the board of the
Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, which has assets of over one
billion dollars. Out of annual grants exceeding $40 million, the
Mott Foundation contributed $300,000 to The Kettering Foundation
in 1993.
<P>
In the area of &quot;public affairs broadcasting,&quot; the Mott
Foundation has granted $70,000 to the Council on Foreign Relations
for a weekly NPR series on international issues and $49,450 to
the Tides Foundation of San Francisco to &quot;support the devlopment
of an eightpart series for public television and other forums
that will explore major American Issues.<B>&quot;</B> The Tides
Foundation's Institute for Global Communications helps provide
computer networking for PeaceNet, EcoNet and feminist groups,
among other political advocates.
<P>
The Mott Foundation has also contributed $500,000 to Independent
Sector, $290,000 to the Union Institute and $75,000 to the National
Council for Responsive Philanthropy, all liberal social policy
outifts which have well-developed networking strategies.
<P>
<I><B>&quot;DELIBERATION,&quot; BUT NO DEBATE</B></I><B> </B>
<P>
Key to the &quot;Kettering Technique&quot; is the sidestepping
of direct debate on specific issues, an emphasis on collective
decision-making by groups, and the goal of consensus.
<P>
Many of the Convention's discussion group moderators, some trained
by Kettering, others fulltime Kettering employees, had experience
in running earlier National Issues Forums.
<P>
Predominantly educators, they were told to begin each session
by distributing a preforum ballot to determine initial participant
attitudes. The &quot;ground rules&quot; begin with Rule Number
One in bold faced capital letters:
<P>
&quot;MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DISCUSSION WILL NOT BE A DEBATE. Stress
there is work to do, and that the work is to move toward making
a shared choice on a public policy issue. The work will be done
through deliberation.&quot;
<P>
Deliberation sounds suspiciously like group therapy. Among Kettering's
other guidelines are, &quot;Get beyond the initial positions people
hold to their deeper motivations...&quot; and &quot;WORK THROUGH
(emphasis in original) the conflicting emotions that arise when
various options pull and tug on what people consider valuable.&quot;
<P>
To avoid &quot;debate,&quot; it appears that genuine philosophical
and religious disagreements were deliberately sidestepped. For
instance, in the PBS broadcast, speakers from the liberal People
for the American Way and the conservative Concerned Women for
America said that they agreed in their support for &quot;family
values.&quot; By prohibiting debate, the Kettering &quot;rules
of engagement&quot; forced a phony verbal consensus.
<P>
Dr. Everett Carl Ladd, president of the Roper Center for Public
Opinion Research, has called Fishkin's method &quot;flawed science
and dubious democracy.&quot; As editor of the December 1995 issue
of the journal <I>The Public Perspective</I>, Ladd published a
series of essays raising objections to the National Issues Convention.
Scholars criticized the absence of a control group, selectivity
and bias in briefing materials, the likelihood that group dynamics
would affect individual perceptions in the polling sample, and
the danger that participants would attempt to please event organizers.
Far from promoting the ideal citizen<B>, </B>the Kettering Technique
appears to use controlled small groups to manipulate the individual's
perception of reality.
<P>
Before the event, Fishkin had replied that these are &quot;empirical
matters which the National Issues Convention will provide the
data to address. Let us get the data and see.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>INSIDE THE PUBLIC AGENDA FOUNDATION</B></I> 
<P>
Kettering relied on the Public Agenda Foundation to select the
topics for the delegates' reading and discussion. Founded in 1975
by pollster Daniel Yankelovich and Cyrus Vance, Jimmy Carter's
Secretary of State, the Public Agenda Foundation is a $3 million-dollar-a-year
operation based in New York City which conducts polls and focus
groups for foundations and corporate clients on a variety of issues.
It has also coordinated many of the issues used in &quot;public
journalism&quot; special issues of Knight-Ridder newspapers. One
paper, the <I>Tallahassee Democrat</I>, even called its series
&quot;The Public Agenda.&quot;
<P>
Public Agenda's 1992 annual budget was $3,319,158. Public Agenda
received a total of $1,197,475 in &quot;general support&quot;
from Kettering in 1992, as well as $400,000 from the Ford Foundation
and $100,00 each from Metropolitan Life, Baxter Healthcare, and
IBM. Union Carbide contributed $208,000, the Carnegie Corporation
$225,000, and the Markle Foundation $427,000.
<P>
The organization received grants of $10,000 from the New York
Times Company Foundation, $150,000 from the Edna McConnell Clark
Foundation, $250,000 from the Bohen Foundation, $50,000 from the
Ford Foundation, $16,000 from the Markle Foundation, $7,500 from
General Mills, $5,000 from Ford Motor Company, and $149,000 from
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to study the priorities
of American &quot;opinion leaders.&quot; The research was used
to make programming decisions for PBS.
<P>
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave Public Agenda $250,000
in 1992<B> </B>to prepare materials for small group discussions
and polling on health care options.
<P>
Public Agenda's &quot;policy review board&quot; provides further
evidence of its private issues agenda. It has included John W.
Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Johnson
Administration and founder of Common Cause; Newton Minow, co-chair
of the advisory board for the National Issues Convention; economist
Lester Thurow, a panelist on the Convention broadcast; D.C. delegate
Eleanor Holmes Norton; Children's Defense Fund founder Marian
Wright Edelman and CDF then-chair Donna Shalala, and David Mathews.
<P>
Retired Admiral Bobby Inman (a Public Agenda trustee), Elliott
Richardson, and George Romney are about as conservative as the
list gets.
<P>
Public Agenda has prepared background materials and conducted
polling for Kettering's National Issues Forums since 1981.
<P>
Even earlier, it prepared the 1976 presidential debate briefing
books for Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford on three issues: foreign
policy, inflation and employment, and moral leadership.
<P>
For the Convention, Public Agenda did not restrict itself to the
most-talked-about issues. According to a tabloid distributed to
delegates, the Foundation chose to include issues &quot;that citizens
are having a hard time sorting out for themselves.&quot; Public
Agenda and the Kettering Foundation<B> </B>selected three major
themes for discussion by Convention participants: &quot;Mission
Uncertain: Reassessing America's Global Role,&quot; &quot;Pocketbook
Pressures: What Should Be Done About Them?&quot; and &quot;The
Troubled American Family: Which Way Out of the Storm?&quot;
<P>
Public Agenda selected issues that it thought the public ought
to care about. But it managed to avoid the debate over education
choice and Goals 2000, the death penalty, &quot;three-strikes
and you're out&quot; crime legislation, drug policy, or, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's favorite, the information revolution and
the economic potential of cyberspace. Instead, Public Agenda focused
on America's place in the world and on arguments over the cause
of the wage-gap in the current economy.
<P>
The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) received $500,000
for its polling work. According to Warren Mitofsky, this was more
than ten times what CBS would pay for an election-year opinion
poll. But the questions NORC asked were based on materials provided
by Kettering and Public Agenda<B>. </B>In response to a call from
Capital Research Center, a NORC spokesman confirmed that its questions
were developed in consultation with the two foundations in addition
to Fishkin. NORC's representative said that it often works from
a list of client questions when it is on contract.
<P>
<I><B>HOW SPECIAL INTERESTS DEFINED THE &quot;PUBLIC AGENDA&quot;
</B></I>
<P>
If the Austin agenda was not set by the participants themselves,
where did Public Agenda get its priorities? The answer, of course,
is that the &quot;deliberative&quot; conclusions of Fishkin's
prototype &quot;ideal citizens&quot; are mere surrogates for the
conventional wisdom of the government and foundation liberal elites
who line the Northeast corridor.
<P>
For, after being concocted by the Kettering and Public Agenda
foundations, the Convention's issues were reviewed and approved
by a distinguished advisory board of ex-officeholders and lobbyists,
many of whose current clients include government-dependent special
interests.
<P>
Calling the advisory board's cochairs &quot;the voice of the people&quot;
with a straight face would be a stretch. They included former
United States Representative Bill Frenzel, a fellow at the Brookings
Institution; Newton Minow, remembered for calling television a
&quot;vast wasteland&quot; several decades ago, but since then
a director of CBS and an attorney at the Chicagobased Sidley and
Austin law firm who sits on corporate and foundation boards; and
super-lobbyist Charles E. Walker, nemesis of the capital gains
tax. At one time Walker's firm reportedly had 129 lobbying clients
registered with the clerk of the House of Representatives.
<P>
Other board members included former Senator David Boren (D-OK),
president of the University of Oklahoma, a federal grant recipient;
former Representative William Gray (D-PA), who heads the United
Negro College Fund; and erstwhile liberal Bill Galston, who was
President Clinton's domestic policy czar.
<P>
No wonder the role of government was the overriding concern of
the National Issues Convention. If the delegates had known more
about the backgrounds and interests of those advising their meeting,
they might have reconsidered its basic assumptions.
<P>
<I><B>THE PEOPLE OF PUBLIC AGENDA</B></I> 
<P>
Also revealing are the interests of Cyrus Vance and Daniel Yankelovich,
co-founders of the Public Agenda Foundation, whose board of directors
lists Judith Davidson Moyers, wife of PBS ominipresence Bill Moyers.
<P>
Department store mogul Maurice Lazarus is chairman of the executive
committee. Other trustees include Adm. Bobby R. Inman (Ret.),
Ann McLaughlin, former Secretary of Labor in the Reagan administration,
businessman Sidney Harman, and William T. Coleman, Jr., from Secretary
of State Warren Christopher's law firm, O'Melveny and Meyers.
Frank Stanton, former CBS president, is a member emeritus.
<P>
<B>CYRUS VANCE</B>, the chairman of the board, is a quintessential
establishmentarian. He is a director of The New York Times Company,
a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a director
of the liberal nonprofit Center for National Policy, formerly
headed by UN ambassador Madeline Albright and chaired by Vance's
successor at State, Edmund S. Muskie.
<P>
Last year Vance was hired by<B> </B>Archer Daniels Midland to
defend the agribusiness giant against federal charges of price-fixing
in its sales of high-fructose corn syrup. Vance also reportedly
donated $1,000 to President Clinton's legal defense fund.
<P>
1992<B> </B>political contributions by Vance include $250 to Senator
Arlen Specter, $250 to Geraldine Ferraro's 1992 Senate bid, two
$1,000 contributions to the Democratic National Committee, $450
to Rep<B>. </B>Les Aspin and $1,000 to the Clinton for President
Committee. In 1994, he gave $1,000 to Senator John Chafee, $1,000
to the Democrats' Senate Victory '94, $1,750 to Senator Daniel
Moynihan, and $250 to Tennessee's Jim Cooper.
<P>
<B>DANIEL YANKELOVICH</B>, Public Agenda's president, is chairman
of DYG, Inc., a private polling company. He also sits on the board
of directors of the Kettering Foundation, which pays him $12,000
in annual compensation. Yankelovich has served on the board of
the Loral Corporation, a defense contractor with annual revenues
of over $1 billion; and he is on the boards of directors of telecommunications
giant US West and the Meredith Corporation, a media giant whose
$790 million in annual revenues derives from publishing magazines
like <I>Better Homes and Gardens</I>, broadcasting, real estate,
and franchising.
<P>
Yankelovich contributed $500 in 1998 to Les Aspin, $1,000 in 1992
to Jane Harman, a liberal California Democratic candidate for
Congress, and $500 again to Harman in 1994. Harman's husband,
Sidney, is on the board of directors of the Public Agenda Foundation,
as noted earlier.
<P>
In a 1995 article in<B> </B><I>Mother Jones</I>, &quot;Restoring
Public Trust,&quot; Yankelovich urges liberals to recover their
moral authority by &quot;internalizing the public's point of view&quot;
in order to better change public perceptions of the liberal agenda.
This tactic follows the model used by the Convention.
<P>
<I><B>SPREADING THE `KETTERING TECHNIQUE'</B></I> 
<P>
While a breakdown of revenue sources was not available at press
time,<B> </B>the National Issues Convention received considerable
support from a range of interests. The Kettering and Public Agenda
connections and<B> </B>the fundraising skills of lobbyist Charls
E. Walker helped attract financial and in-kind support from private
corporations like American Airlines, Freddie Mac and Southwestern
Bell; from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a United Parcel Servicebased
philanthropy; and from public sector institutions like PBS, the
LBJ presidential library, the city of Austin, and the University
of Texas. They supplemented the initial in-kind support for the
project from the Charles F. Kettering Foundation, whose research
and materials were the basis of the &quot;deliberation.&quot;
<P>
Who benefitted? The noted historian Daniel Boorstin has provided
a way to understand the significance of the National Issues Convention.
In his 1987 study, <I>The Image</I>, Boorstin observed that modern
society has created a new public phenomenon. It is situated between
real events, which are the subject of history, and staged propaganda,
which substitutes lies for truth. Boorstin called it the &quot;pseudo-event.&quot;<B>
</B>It would provide &quot;..synthetic facts which move people
indirectly, by providing the `factual' basis on which they are
supposed to make up their minds.&quot;
<P>
The first targets of those who organize pseudo-events are fact-hungry
journalists, and it is they who have most to lose from programs
like the National Issues Convention and further applications of
the &quot;deliberative poll.&quot; Similarly, &quot;public journalism&quot;
projects imperil the credibility of the American media which may
end up serving as propagandists for the agenda of grantmaking
foundations.
<P>
But as for most American citizens? They probably have much less
to fear.<B> </B>Would the Convention delegates act on their &quot;deliberations&quot;
when they returned to their homes?
<P>
Or is it not more likely that they will consult their real principles,
life experiences, and interests once liberated from the enforced
group-think of the &quot;Kettering Technique?&quot;<HR>

<h2>PBS's &quot;Democracy Project&quot; : Is It Really The Democrat

<I>Although they profess impartiality,a look at the list of
key personnel in PBS's &quot;Democracy Project&quot; reveals a

<h2>National Issues Convention Sponsors Show A Liberal Bent</h2>
<P>
<I>Although the Kettering Foundation was not listed as a sponsor
in the on-air television credits (a Kettering spokesman preferred
the term &quot;collaborator&quot;), the PBS broadcast noted three
&quot;underwriters.&quot; They were the <B>Annie E. Casey Foundation,
Freddie Mac</B>, and<B> Southwestern Bell</B>. </I>
<P>
Robert V. Pambianco recently characterized the <B>Annie E. Casey
Foundation</B> -- a United Parcel Servicebased philanthropy whose
board contains current and retired UPS executives -- as a &quot;progressive
philanthropy&quot; which &quot;rarely strays from the liberal
social agenda&quot; (see CRC's<I> Organization Trends</I>, December
1995). Grants included: $200,000 to the Children's Defense Fund,
formerly chaired by First Lady Hillary Clinton; $5.1 million for
Sustainable Milwaukee, &quot;nothing more than a creation of the
radical left&quot;; and $252,00 to HandsNet, &quot;a conduit for
political information aimed at mobilizing activists.&quot;
<P>
Austin Fulk and Stuart Nolan analyzed the donations of <B>Freddie
Mac </B>and <B>Southwestern Bell</B> (in CRC's <I>Patterns of
Corporate Philanthropy IX</I>, 1996) and scored giving on a scale
of 1 to 8 from left to right.
<P>
<B>Freddie Mac</B>'s gifts included $129,800 to the Children's
Defense Fund, $25,000 to Planned Parenthood, and $10,000 to the
Center for Population Options. Its score was 2.55 and its giving
pattern &quot;Liberal.&quot;
<P>
<B>Southwestern Bell</B> gave $45,000 to NAACP chapters and $25,000
to the Public Agenda Foundation. The phone company's score was
3.52 and giving pattern analyzed as &quot;Center-Left.&quot;<HR>

<h2>Ridings New President of Council on Foundations</h2>
<P>
Dorothy S. Ridings was appointed president of the Council on Foundations
on February 5th. President of the League of Women Voters from
1982 to 1986, Ridings has been publisher of Florida's <I>Bradenton
Herald</I> since 1988, and an executive with Knight-Ridder. Ridings
is a trustee of the Ford and Benton foundations, an advisor to
the Knight and the Mary Reynolds Babcock foundations, and active

<center><h2>
Why Is New York Times Columnist Maureen Dowd Driving the White House Crazy?
</h2></center>
<img src="/crc/images/cw-0796.gif" ALIGN = "left">
<p>
Maureen Dowd is the iconoclast of The 
	New York Times. She is known for her 
	feisty and cutting accounts of life in 
	Washington, especially her tart ridicule of the antics of the current occupants of the White House. This has made her public enemy number one for President Clinton's supporters in the press. James Fallows, a Carter speechwriter and Clinton appointee, blasted Dowd in his book Breaking the News, objecting to this opening sentence from a June, 1994 news story: "President Clinton returned today from a sentimental journey to the university where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted and didn't get a degree." Fallows said the columnist's caustic style "aggravates today's prevailing despair and cynicism about public life." Following his lead, Dowd was lambasted as a "fifties sweater girl" in The Nation by feminist Susan Faludi and charged with "making mischief" in The New Yorker by James Woollcott.
<p>
Dowd is so radioactive at the White 
	House that when press secretary 
	Michael McCurry accidentally found 
	himself joking about her writing before a briefing on terrorism, he begged assembled reporters, "Isolate the 'I agree with Maureen Dowd' part, guys." One reason Dowd is unpopular -- and pointedly not invited to state dinners at the White House -- is her savage criticism of the First Couple.  In a column headed "The State of the Fish," she describes Hillary Clinton's memories of working in an Alaskan seafood processing plant during summer vacation, and quotes the First Lady's description of fish as "purple and black and yucky looking." Comparing the fish to Mrs. Clinton's professional and business record, Dowd concludes: "If anybody notices something yucky about her financial and political entrails they are supposed to trust that she is working for the greater good... As she must remember, the fish rots from the head down.'" 
<p>	
Dowd was not always a political pundit. But she 
		is no stranger to controversy. During the 
		Reagan years, she created a stir with a page one story drawing on Kitty Kelley's biography of Nancy Reagan -- reportedly assigned by an editor who received an advance copy of the book from Kelley's agent, Kathy Robbins, who asked that the naughty bits be rushed into print. After her editors placed the story on the front page,  Dowd was chewed out by then executive editor Max Frankel, who felt the gossip was unfit to print.  Only the intervention of Joseph Lelyveld (Frankel's successor as executive editor) persuaded Dowd, practically in tears, to stay on the job. It was good for the paper that she did. Dowd was made White House correspondent in 1988 and nominated for a Pulitzer prize in 1992. In 1994 Times columnist Anna Quindlen presented her with a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Within a year, Quindlen would resign her job, and Dowd took over the position of resident essayist for the woman's point of view. 
<p>
Compared by some to Maureen O'Hara, Dowd
		drives a zippy Mazda Miata convertible, and 
		remains loyal to her Hibernian roots, praising President Clinton when he visited Ireland, and writing in her column about lunching at "The Irish Times" pub on Capitol Hill with The New Yorker writer Michael Kelly, newly named editor of  The New Republic . Dowd was squired around town by Crossfire's Michael Kinsley before he departed for Seattle, Vanity Fair reported. But she is intensely private, and little is known about her personal life. Only once has Dowd been victimized by the tabloid press, in revenge for columns satirizing Barney's,  the New York temple of fashion intimidation. A practical joker pretending to be her stormed into the store  and demanded a discount -- resulting in a Page Six story in The New York Post headlined "Dowd in dither over discount denial."  Dowd fought back in print in The Times.  Her alibi: She was in Washington interviewing Senator Strom Thurmond at the time of the alleged incident. Thurmond graciously confirmed her account, and later the prank was revealed to be a hoax by Spy magazine. No wonder she prefers maintaining a Woman of the Year pose as a "woman of mystery." 
<p>
Darling of her paper's editors and publishers, 
		Dowd is also respected by her peers. Liberal 
		Times columnist Frank Rich worked with her covering the 1992 political conventions. Rich, then Times drama critic, told Culture Watch, "It was great fun, and I had the time of my life working with Maureen," who was the paper's White House correspondent. They were good friends then and are good friends now, he says. Dowd's writings are widely read and quoted in Washington, whether she is chastising "Bill Clinton's style of casuistry and prevarication," conjuring up a debate between  Elizabeth ("Sugar Lips") Dole and Hillary ("Sister Frigidaire") Clinton, or noting how "novelistically interesting" Bob Dole's candidacy has become, dubbing him "the candidate of not." Dowd commented, "If we voted on the basis of overcoming adversity, Bob Dole would win easily. But we want to know where he's going as much as where he came from." Against the Kansas Republican's primary opponent, she argued that "you don't have to be anti-Catholic to be anti-Buchanan," citing William Bennett and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, but also pointed out that she and Pat Buchanan are "two peas in a pod," Irish-American journalists from northwest Washington. Dowd revealed that her mother asked her not to be mean to Dole's rival for the Republican nomination because "he's one of us."  Another column tagged President Clinton "the man from Hot Springs, the old hangout of gamblers and roues where he grew up...the golden boy who leaves his messes behind for others to clean up, sliding out of predicaments that would be fatal to less nimble pols. " A keen observer of America's hurly-burly, she punctured the hype around the tragic flight of seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff by simply saying, "Why didn't we all just get up and begin screaming: THIS IS CRAZY?" So influential is Dowd's writing that Fallows notes she "has found herself cited in almost every article about excess cynicism in the press."
<p>
Not bad for a working-class Irish-American girl, 
		born in 1952 to Michael Dowd, a District of 
		Columbia police inspector whose duties included assignments on Capitol Hill. A good student, Dowd is remembered fondly by her senior year homeroom teacher at Immaculata High School, class of 1969. "She was outstanding," Sister Petra (S.P.) told Culture Watch, "and very promising."  Dowd earned  her English literature degree from Catholic University, and began her career in journalism at the age of twenty-two at the dictation desk of the now-defunct Washington Star.  She patiently paid her dues for almost a decade, writing obituaries and weather stories, writing her way onto the sports pages (then written by guys for guys) and  the paper's city desk and "Portfolio" section, which competed with The Washington Post's "Style" section in covering society and fashion. Dowd was loyal and stayed on even as other staffers migrated elsewhere during the paper's final days. After the Star closed, Dowd was hired by Time magazine, which moved her to New York in 1983. She joined the metropolitan section of The New York Times a few months later, then transferred to the Washington bureau in 1986, where ever since she has delighted readers with her caustic observations on politics and politicians. Now the focus of celebrity gossip in the national press, Dowd's every word echoes in the corridors of power. She is definitely unpredictable as a writer, calling herself a "pathological truthteller." Her motto remains: "No one is safe."

<br>
<i>April, 1996</i>
<P>
<H3>SEMINAL TRIBE</H3>
  <H4>  <EM> Hopwood, et al., v. State of Texas</em><BR></H4></CENTER>

<P>Cooperating Counsel:  Theodore B. Olson, Douglas Cox (Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher)<p>
What can we tell you?  In a landmark decision, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that 
the University of Texas Law School may not take race into account in admitting students to its illustrious institution.  
<P>
<P>The Law School, the court held, had produced no evidence that its affirmative action program was in any 
way tailored to redress the present effects of its own past discrimination, there being no such cognizable effects.  
Moreover, racial &quot;diversity&quot; is not a compelling government interest that would permit the government to discriminate on 
the basis of race.  Justice Powell's lone opinion in 
<I>Bakke</I>, the Fifth Circuit declared, was never the law of the land.  
The court expressed confidence that the defendants would henceforth cease to consider race  in student admissions; 
should they fail to do so, the court added, the plaintiffs may be entitled to compensatory and punitive damages.
<P>
<P>The defendants have vowed to ask the Supreme Court to review <I>Hopwood</I>, to the dismay of many liberal 
civil rights groups.  They have also hired Harvard eminento Laurence Tribe.  Making his first appearance on the 
defendants' motion for an emergency stay of the Fifth Circuit's order and decision, Tribe argues that the observance of 
non-discrimination norms would confront UT with administrative burdens, which is what the segregationist South told 
the courts some three decades ago.  Tribe argues further that the damages provision of Title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded institutions, is <I>unconstitutional</I>, especially in light of the 
Supreme Court's recent decision in the <I>Seminole Tribe</I> case.  Last we looked,<I> we</I> were supposed to be the extremists.
<P>
<P>Judge Jerry Smith's opinion speaks for itself, and we will permit it to do so 
(<I>see</I> excerpts nearby.)  But we'll comment upon a few aspects of the Fifth Circuit's ruling that aren't entirely obvious.
<P>
<P>Judge Smith's opinion owes its persuasiveness largely to the recognition of the weaknesses of Justice 
Powell's <I>Bakke</I> opinion, which enshrined the notion that diversity justifies small race preferences or &quot;plus factors.&quot;  In letter and spirit, the Powell opinion prohibits &quot;rigid&quot; quotas and permits no more than limited, flexible, and temporary preferences of the kind state agencies may use to redress the on-going effects of their own past discrimination.  But in real life, given the higher ed establishment's impulses, diversity-based preferences tend to drift into permanent 
racialism and <I>de facto</I> quotas (as happened at UT).
<P>
<P>Arguably, the very notion of preferences as a &quot;non-decisive&quot; &quot;plus factor&quot; is incoherent:  Unless a race 
preference is so small as to be irrelevant, it will be decisive in the marginal case; we're just haggling over the size of the 
preference and the number of cases in which it will be decisive.  Similarly, the distinction between &quot;rigid quotas&quot; and 
&quot;flexible&quot; diversity-based preferences has proven a mirage.  Diversity advocates insist that minority participation must be 
more than &quot;token.&quot;  And when a tiny thumb on the race scales doesn't produce the desired result, lo! we're back to 
a proportionalist standard of &quot;meaningful&quot; representation and to racial preferences whose scope or weight is 
determined by the need to obtain an &quot;adequate&quot; number of minorities.  That is, we're back to quotas in disguise.
<P>
<P><B><I>VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO THEODORE B. OLSON AND DOUGLAS COX OF GIBSON, 
DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER FOR THEIR</I> PRO BONO <I>ASSISTANCE.  WITHOUT THEIR COURAGE, SKILL, 
AND DETERMINATION,</I> HOPWOOD<I> WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.</B></I>
<P>
<P>Finally, unlike remedial preferences, diversity-based preferences cannot be temporary.  In a free country, 
institutions will <I>never</I> match a social engineer's diversity standard.  Thus, any deviation from some preconceived, 
fanciful norm of racial diversity will justify renewed racial meddling.  Whatever the so-called civil rights groups may say, 
&quot;diversity&quot;--as they understand it--isn't even inspired by the ideal of a colorblind Constitution.  
<P>
<P>As for a <I>proper</I> understanding of diversity, Judge Smith's opinion leaves considerable latitude: 
universities may consider a host of factors in admissions, including factors other than merit and factors that correlate highly with race.  What universities may <I>not</I> do is to use race, either for its own sake or as a proxy for permissible characteristics; or to use permissible criteria for racial reasons or in a racially discriminatory manner.
<P>
<P>Predictably, diversity fanatics have denounced this holding as &quot;absurd,&quot; as an endorsement of &quot;affirmative 
action for rich alumni kids but not for minorities,&quot; etc.  On the other hand, the idea that admissions need not be based 
on merit may distress some conservatives.  To us, the Fifth Circuit's holding seems exactly right; we suppose this makes 
us moderates.
<P>
<P>The diversity crowd is right to insist that universities need not admit &quot;strictly on merit.&quot;   Of course, merit is 
not remotely so subjective as diversity enthusiasts suggest.  But, as we've readily conceded throughout the 
<I>Hopwood</I> litigation, lots of things other than test scores may enter into a decision as to who would make a good lawyer (race, 
we submit, isn't one of them).
<P>
<P>That aside, factors other than merit may play a legitimate role in education.  Yale may try to admit a few 
applicants from Arkansas, on the theory that Arkansas is best run by Elis or that Arkansans add value to the Yale's student body. 
 (You wouldn't understand, unless you've been to Arkansas or Yale.)  State institutions may prefer in-state applicants 
and have quotas on outsiders.  Whatever one thinks of these practices as a matter of policy, they're not 
unconstitutional--and not remotely as destructive and divisive as racial preferences.
<P>
<P>For starters, racial preferences don't end with admissions. In due course, its beneficiaries demand their own 
faculty (diverse and supportive), their own bureaucracy for minority concerns 
(<I>ditto</I>), their own curricula and degrees 
(Victims Studies), their own housing (segregated), speech codes, sensitivity training, etc.  Alumni kids have not been observed 
to make similar demands.
<P>
<P>
<P>Similarly, what we learn upon encountering a marginally qualified alumni kid on a public campus--as an 
empirical matter, a rare occurrence--is that some rich folks' kids are dunces, and that the government is corrupt.  What else 
is new?  Under racial preferences &aacute; la UT, on the other hand, students can tell who was admitted under lower 
standards simply by looking at people's skin color.  This is a very nasty thing.
<P>
<P>The long and short of it is that government constantly &quot;discriminates&quot; among its citizens.  Many such 
distinctions are unjust, arbitrary, and inefficient.  But none carries the stigma and the explosive force of race.  Only religion 
comes close.  But we wisely prohibit the state from making distinctions based on religion. 
<P>
<P>Race (and here again, the diversity folks have a point) is central to people's lives--so central that people 
easily come to blows over it.  But this isn't an argument for public race consciousness.  It's the central reason why race, 
unlike other factors, must <I>not</I> be taken into account; why race, like religion, must be put beyond the reach of the state. 
 <I>Hopwood</I>, whatever may eventually come of it, is a huge step towards this elusive goal.

<BR><BR><BR>
<B>FROM JUDGE JERRY SMITH'S OPINION</B>
<P>The law school has presented no compelling justification ... that allows it to continue to elevate some races over 
others, even for the wholesome purpose of correcting perceived racial imbalance in the student body.
<P>
<P>[The law school's] disparate standards greatly affected a candidate's chance of admission.... [B]ecause the 
presumptive <I>denial</I> score for whites was a TI [Texas Index, a computation of both LSAT and GPA] of 192 or lower, and the 
presumptive <I>admit</I> TI for minorities was 189 or higher, a minority candidate with a TI of 189 or above almost certainly would be 
<I>admitted</I>, even though his score was considerably below the level at which a white candidate would be 
<I>rejected</I>. ...  The stated purpose of this lowering of standards was to meet an &quot;aspiration&quot; of admitting a class consisting of 10% Mexican Americans and 5% blacks .... 
<P>
<P>[T]here is now absolutely no doubt that courts are to employ strict scrutiny when evaluating all racial 
classifications, including those characterized by their proponents as &quot;benign&quot; or &quot;remedial.&quot; ...  Under the strict scrutiny analysis, we ask two questions:  (1)  Does the racial classification serve a compelling government interest, and (2)  is it narrowly tailored to achievement of that goal?
<P>
<P>We agree with the plaintiffs that any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for the purpose of achieving 
a diverse student body is not a compelling interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Justice Powell's argument in 
<I>Bakke</I> garnered only his own vote and has never represented the view of a majority of the Court in 
<I>Bakke</I> or any other case.  Moreover, subsequent Supreme Court decisions regarding education state that non-remedial state interests will never justify racial classifications.  Finally, the classification of persons on the basis of race for the purpose of diversity frustrates, rather than facilitates, the goals of equal protection.
<P>
<P>Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher 
education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race.  
It treats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals.  It may further remedial purposes but, just as likely, may 
promote improper racial stereotypes, thus fueling racial hostility.
<P>
<P>The use of race, in and of itself, to choose students simply achieves a student body that looks different.  Such a criterion 
is no more rational on its own terms than would be choices based upon the physical size or blood type of applicants....
<P>
<P>Law schools specifically may look at things such as unusual or substantial extracurricular activities in college, which 
may be atypical factors affecting undergraduate grades.  Schools may even consider factors such as whether an applicant's 
parents attended college or the applicant's economic and social background.....  [But to] believe that a person's race controls his point of view is to stereotype him.
<P>
<P>Finally, the use of race to achieve diversity undercuts the ultimate goal of the Fourteenth Amendment:  the end of 
racially motivated state action.  Justice Powell's conception of race as a &quot;plus&quot; factor would allow race always to be a potential factor in admissions decisionmaking....
<P>
<P>[T]he use of race to achieve a diverse student body, whether as a proxy for permissible characteristics, simply cannot be 
a state interest compelling enough to meet the steep standard of strict scrutiny.  These latter factors may, in fact, turn out to 
be substantially correlated with race, but the key is that race  itself not be taken into account....
<P>
<P>The Supreme Court has &quot;insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved 
before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.&quot; ...  [T]he district court erred in 
expanding the remedial justification to reach all public education within the State of Texas.  The Supreme Court repeatedly has 
warned that the use of racial remedies must be carefully limited, and a remedy reaching all education within a state addresses a 
putative injury that is vague and amorphous.
<P>
<P>By the late 1960's, the school had implemented its first program designed to recruit minorities ... and it now engages in 
an extensive minority recruiting program. ...  The vast majority of the faculty, staff, and students at the law school had 
absolutely nothing to do with any discrimination that the law school practiced in the past. ... In such a case, one cannot conclude that 
a hostile environment is the present effect of past discrimination.  Any racial tension at the law school is most certainly the 
result of present societal discrimination and, if anything, is contributed to, rather than alleviated by, the overt and prevalent 
consideration of race in admissions.
<P>     
<P>In summary, we hold that the University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a factor in deciding which 
applicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived effects of a hostile environment at the law 
school, to alleviate the law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to eliminate any present effects of past 
discrimination by actors other than the law school.

<P>
 
<BR>
<B>SAY WHAT?</B>
<P>University of Texas Provost Mark Yudof called 
<I>Hopwood</I> &quot;the A-Bomb.&quot;  This was to remain the single astute 
and accurate observation from the Quota Camp. 
<P>
<P><B>*</B> John A. Blackburn, dean of admissions and Chairman of the Department of Frontal Lobotomy at the University 
of Virginia, called <I>Hopwood</I> &quot;an incredibly stupid decision.  All of us are dazed, wondering, 'What does it mean?'&quot; 
(<I>Chronicle of Higher Education</I>, March 29.)  The decision means what it saysread it.  
<P>
<P> <B>*</B> On the UT faculty, affirmative action stirs strong emotions, shame not among them.  At a 
post-<I>Hopwood</I> meeting for concerned UT students, a minority student complained that UT students seem to think that minorities are admitted 
under relaxed standards and implored Dean Michael Sharlot and Professor and defense counsel Sam Issacharoff to tell 
everyone that this wasn't so, &quot;like you told us at the minority orientation dinner.&quot;  Go right ahead. 
<P>     
<P><B>*</B> Announcing the defendants' decision to take 
<I>Hopwood</I> to the Supreme Court, Texas Attorney General Dan 
Morales expressed confidence that the Fifth Circuit's ruling would be overturned because &quot;the vast majority of Texans are not racist. 
 The vast majority of Americans are not racist.&quot;  That's one way of endearing oneself with the federal judiciary.
<P>
<P><B>*</B> John Sexton, dean of N.Y.U. law school at N.Y.U. and incoming President of the Association of American 
Law Schools, said that &quot;The enlightened admissions committee will choose ... students who play well with each other,&quot; and 
let's hope they're adults.  &quot;You start with a set of musicians, all of whom are virtuoso, and try to choose some violinist, some 
oboists, and some woodwinds.&quot;  
(<I>Chronicle</I>, April 5.) Let windbag conduct the crowd 
and--<I>presto!</I>--it's like the Yoko Ono Band playing Schoenberg.
<P> 
<P><B>*</B> Brandy Copley, UT Law School student, opined that &quot;we [whites] need to be arbitrarily discriminated against 
to redress past wrongs.&quot;  (<I>Texas 
Lawyer</I>, March 25.)  Who is &quot;We,&quot; Kemosabe?  &quot;Sean McCann, a white senior at 
Texas-Austin, [said] that white males are more likely to die of mad-cow disease than to be the victims of reverse discrimination.&quot;  
(<I>Chronicle</I>, April 5.)  Why is it that reverse discrimination never seems to hit the people who deserve it?
<P>
<P><B>*</B>  Throughout the litigation, the defendants harangued Cheryl Hopwood for her failure to submit with her law 
school application a statement on her history of personal hardships (such as a childhood in poverty).  But Cheryl Hopwood 
didn't want to win the <I>Queen For A Day</I> sweepstakes; she wanted a fair shot, which UT didn't give her.  To us, her reluctance to 
tell the world that she, too, was a <I>VICTIM</I> is a sign of dignity; UT's enlightened admission committee concluded that she's 
too dumb to become a lawyer.  On the same note, Michael A. Olivas (University of Houston Law Center) berated the 
plaintiffs for their arrogance in demanding their &quot;rightful seat&quot; at UT Law 
(<I>Chronicle</I> , March 29).  Buried under a mountain 
of evidence to the contrary, Olivas squealed that &quot;it was not 'lesser qualified' minorities who displaced the 
<I>Hopwood</I> plaintiffs.&quot;  
<P>
<P><B>*</B> UT maintains that there are no race-based preferences and, moreover, that the abolition of non-existent preferences 
in the wake of <I>Hopwood</I> would entail the &quot;virtual resegregation of higher education,&quot; to quote UT Austin President Robert 
M. Berdahl, who in turn echoed the UT attorneys' briefs in 
<I>Hopwood</I>.  This prediction is most plausible on the 
assumption (blurted out not long ago by the President of Rutgers University) that Blacks are naturally incapable of participating fully 
in American life--a belief that has also sustained such fine Texan traditions as segregated water fountains.
<P>
<P>Berdahl &amp; Co. differ with this interpretation.  They claim that the Texas K-12 school system is doing a lousy 
job, especially for Black children.  This is probably true; the schools may well be run by men of Mr. Berdahl's competence 
and integrity.  Still, having set aside some 25 Black seats at UT Law, and having filled two-thirds of them with Blacks from 
outside Texas, what does Berdahl expect from the thousands of kids who are trapped in the Texas school system--a medal?
<P>
<P><B>*</B> It's not our business to run UT's admission system.  But since UT won't shut up about resegregation, we'll offer an 
easy solution:  consider every applicant who meets the minimal qualifications for preferred minority applicants (which, 
according to UT, means &quot;fully qualified&quot; for UT Law).  In 1992, this pool would have been about 20 percent minority.  Then, have 
a lottery for the seats. UT would still be a Top-30 law school.  Except, it's now a Top-20 law school.  It wants to be a Top Ten 
law school, and it can't be tops with the merely qualified students:  it needs the best, few of whom will be of the desired minorities. 
 UT, in short, wants to be an elitist institution with a democratic veneer.  
<I>This</I> is UT's real &quot;compelling interest&quot; for 
race discrimination.  The hell with it.

<H3>THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOM</H3>
<H4><EM> Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute, et al.</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>
<P>Cooperating Attorney:  W. David Paxton, Esq. (Gentry, Locke, Rakes &amp; Moore)
<P>
<P>Leave it to the feminist shock troops to turn a proceeding over alleged rape--recognized by all concerned as a 
serious matter--into an ideological circus.
<P>
<P>In a case pending before U.S. District Judge Jackson L. Kiser, the nominal plaintiff, Christy Brzonkala, a 
former student at Virginia Tech, has raised federal and state claims against Virginia Tech and three individuals.  The 
individual defendants are male Virginia Tech students and, much to their detriment, members of its football team.  We serve as 
co-counsel to one of the defendants, Antonio Morrison.
<P>
<P>The case arises from the following facts:  Returning from a party at around 2:00 am on a fateful morning in 
September 1994, Brzonkala and a female friend knocked on the dorm room door of the defendants, whom they had never met.  
They were let in.  The talk quickly turned to sex.  Brzonkala's friend left; no attempt was made to hold her back.
<P>
<P>At this point, the accounts diverge.  Brzonkala claims that Morisson and his roommate, James Crawford, took 
turns raping her.  Morrison denies the rape allegation, and has steadfastly maintained that he was involved only in a 
consensual encounter.  Crawford denies any involvement with Brzonkala, and even she admits that Crawford left shortly after 
her friend did. Crawford returned some time later with a teammate, Cornell Brown; in a prank on Morrison, the two 
clamored that the coach was checking up on the players.  Morrison hurried the girl out of the room. 
<P>
<P>We'd be happy to demonstrate that Morrison is telling the truth, were it not for the fact that the requisite 
documents--principally, transcripts of two hearings on the case at Virginia Tech--are under a protective order.  For now, let's just 
say that Morrison's story, unlike the plaintiff's, fits with the accounts given by his buddies and by Brzonkala's friend; that 
there is no physical evidence to suggest rape; and that 
<I>none</I> of the numerous officials called upon to examine the case has 
been able to find Morrison or Crawford guilty of rape. On April 10, 1996, a grand jury refused to indict the two.
<P>
<P>Brzonkala did not seek medical treatment after the alleged incident, and she did not complain to any public 
authority until April 1995, seven months after the alleged incident.  Then, she fell into the hands of the Virginia Tech women's center. 
 At the center's urging, Brzonkala brought administrative charges under Virginia Tech's &quot;Abusive Conduct Policy,&quot; 
alleging &quot;gang rape&quot; by Morrison and Crawford.
<P>
<P>On less than a week's notice, Morrison and Crawford were drummed through a hearing that featured the 
usual irregularities.  For instance, there was never a face-to-face confrontation between the accuser and the accused; 
Brzonkala testified over the phone.  Asked to describe the alleged rapists (whose pictures she claimed to have recognized in a 
football program given to her in April 1995), just about the only thing Brzonkala got right was that the offenders were 
black.(Brzonkala herself is white.)
<P>
<P>No disciplinary measures were taken against Crawford, meaning that the hearing committee didn't buy the rape story. 
 Morrison was found guilty, though not of rape but of &quot;sexual misconduct.&quot;  It was not explained what precisely 
that misconduct might be.  Perhaps, it was consensual, interracial sex; perhaps, it was Morrison's rude, post-coital remark 
that &quot;you better not have any diseases.&quot;  In any event, Morrison was hit with a one-year suspension, effective immediately.
<P>
<P>Trouble was, the policy on sexual misconduct had not been published at the time of the event; Morrison had 
violated a standard he had no way of knowing.  Thus, the suspension was set aside, and a new hearing--as problematic, from 
a procedural perspective, as the first-- was held.  Morrison was found guilty of the offending &quot;diseases&quot; remark, and the 
one-year suspension was re-instated.  In an act of courage, Virginia Tech's Provost (her- self a woman) determined that 
the penalty was a bit much for a single remark and deferred the one-year suspension, meaning that Morrison was placed 
on probation.
<P>
<P>It appears that at this point, the American Association of University Women referred the plaintiff to Eileen 
Wagner, an attorney and long-time feminist activist.  Wagner took Brzonkala to federal court, so to speak.  She alleges, on 
the plaintiff's behalf, a sex discrimination claim against Virginia Tech under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.  In essence, 
she claims that Virginia Tech &quot;discriminated&quot; against Brzonkala by granting Morrison due process (such as it was) 
&quot;solely because he is a member of Virginia Tech's all-male football team.&quot;  Virginia Tech has moved to dismiss the claim.


<P>
<P>Wagner further asserts federal claims against the individual defendants under the federal Violence Against 
Women Act.  This statute owes its 1994 enactment in large measure to Ms. Lorena Bobbit, a feminist matron saint who hacked 
off her hubby's organ with a kitchen knife, took the bleeding thing for a car ride, and eventually tossed it onto a 
Virginia highway, where state troopers found it and returned it to its rightful owner.  (The owner recently had the object 
surgically enlarged, perhaps to facilitate its retrieval in the event of another untoward accident.  But we digress.)  
<P>
<P>For NOW President Patricia Ireland, the Bobbit affair &quot;underscore[d] the need for Congress ... to get about 
the business of passing a comprehensive violence against women act.&quot;  Congress complied, and threw everything into the 
Act but free meat cleavers.  Of relevance to the Brzonkala case is VAWA's creation of a federal tort claim for crimes 
against women that are motivated wholly by discriminatory animus toward the victim's gender.  (Nothing wrong, it appears, 
with rape by people who <I>like</I> women.)
<P> 
<P>We have moved to dismiss the VAWA claims against Morrison on the grounds that the enactment exceeds 
Congress' power under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although the plaintiff, NOW, and 
the Justice Department are opposing this motion, we think we have the better argument.  But while the VAWA claims 
are pending, they merit closer inspection.
<P>
<P>The evidence of Morrison's misogynist animus is said to consist of his alleged failure to use a condom during 
the alleged incident; the &quot;disease&quot; remark; and an allegation by the plaintiff's roommate that Morrison once graphically 
expressed his desire of having sex with drunk girls.  Morrison categorically denies making the latter remark, which the 
witness claims to have overheard in a dining hall full of football players. 
<P>     
<P>The suit further alleges assault and battery, false imprisonment, and defamation (on the theory that Morrison's 
insistence that any sex was consensual amounts to an accusation of fornication, a crime of moral turpitude in Virginia).  
These state law claims might be viable  assuming that the plaintiff can prove them, which she cannot.  Wagner's federal 
claims, on the other hand, are transparently absurd.  Why, then, does she assert them?
<P> 
<P>The answer is that Eileen Wagner and a gaggle of feminist groups are on a crusade against misogynists, 
especially college athletes.  Wagner herself has told us so:  in response to our motion to dismiss the VAWA claim, she 
submitted a harangue (reprinted nearby) that's lifted nearly verbatim from the works of Suzy Estrich and Kathy MacKinnon. 
 When she filed the suit, Wagner demanded $8.3 million in damages, this being the amount Virginia Tech earned in 
last year's Sugarbowl game.  She demands &quot;an injunction directing Virginia Tech to provide at least five hours of 
mandatory sexual assault awareness education to student athletes ... and to bring nationally recognized speakers on 
sexual harassment and sexual assault issues to its university forum at least twice a year.&quot;  And, Wagner wants the 
entire starting line-up and coaching staff of Virginia Tech's football team to appear at trial, for whatever bearing the 
testimony may have on the case.  For good measure, Wagner asserts a VAWA claim against Cornell 
Brown--Crawford's fellow prankster, whose only conceivable crime is that he, too, is a male football player.
<P>
<P>As Wagner said on the <I>Geraldo Show</I>, she wanted a test case for VAWA.  Having dragged Christy Brzonkala 
into an awful case, Wagner has been trying to divert attention from the facts and to frame the case as a referendum on 
an issue.  We can't stop her.  But let's be clear what the issue is:  To make a point about misogyny, the NOW clan is 
trying to hang a rape charge on innocent black men.  
<P>
<P>By all means, let's have a vote.<P>

<B>ON A MISSION FROM MOLLY YARD</B>
<P>From Plaintiff Brzonkala's Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's 
federal claims under the Violence Against Women Act:  
<P>
<P><I>Plaintiff believes her case will forever change the cavalier attitude widely used to dismiss the sufferings of sexual 
assault survivors everywhere.....  Plaintiff anticipates this litigation will re-focus crime prevention efforts for sexual assault on 
the behavior of the perpetrator ....  Plaintiff expects this litigation to dissect the ancient misogynistic myth that women 
secretly desire to be raped ....  Further, she hopes for a wide national debate about why the &quot;no means yes&quot; myth still persists.... 
 Plaintiff expects litigation in this forum will set a high level for national legal discourse about the true seriousness of 
criminal sexual assault as it affects the majority of American victims--females.

<H3>TOE TO TOE</H3>
<H4><EM> Scallet v. Rosenblum, et al.</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>
<P>Cooperating Attorney:  Ted Scallet, Esq.
<P>
<P>Still more news on the abuse of sexual harassment charges comes from the University of Virginia's Darden 
Graduate School of Business Administration.  The School's decision to brand an inconvenient faculty member as a sexual 
harasser has led to two lawsuits--a defamation action in state court, and a federal lawsuit over violations of the teacher's 
First Amendment rights.  
<P>     
<P>Our client, Robert &quot;Cid&quot; Scallet, became Darden faculty member in 1985.  He taught a first-year Analysis &amp; 
Communications course, to wide acclaim among his students.  In May 1992, Darden fired Scallet, ostensibly for poor 
management of the A&amp;C course (which Scallet wasn't managing at the time); &quot;lack of collegiality,&quot; whatever this might mean; 
and &quot;undermining the mission of the school,&quot; whatever it might be.
<P>
<P>This was classic pretext.  The real reason for Scallet's removal was that Darden's powers-that-be hated his 
politics (left-wing) and his popularity with students (considerable).    Scallet did indeed raise issues of diversity and other 
liberal nostrums in class.  However, prior to his firing, Scallet never received any official notice that the Darden folks in charge 
of overseeing him and his course had a problem with his teaching.  In fact, his personnel file was squeaky clean.
<P>
<P>Scallet's removal did not go over well with Darden's students.  Over half of them signed a petition to &quot;let Cid 
teach,&quot; to no avail.  Scallet himself requested a grievance hearing.  Seventeen months and two investigations later, the 
University had still not published a decision on Scallet's grievance.  In March 1994, Scallet sued.
<P>
<P>Soon after Scallet had filed his original grievance, though, it had occurred to the Darden deans who fired him 
that, since they didn't have a plausible reason for the action, they had better make one up.  Accordingly, various officials 
started to spread rumors that Scallet was &quot;evil and dangerous&quot;--specifically, that he harassed women.  
<P>
<P>In depositions, the Darden folks averred that two incidents of &quot;harassment&quot; played a particularly large role in 
Scallet's removal.  First, over a year before he was fired, Scallet reprimanded a female teaching assistant for her lousy 
performance and personal conduct.  Scallet insists the TA had it coming, and by the looks of it, he's right.  The details need not detain 
us; what matters is that at the time, the &quot;victim&quot; complained about Scallet's behavior to his higher-ups, who consulted 
about the matter with the Equal Employment Office, which--miraculously--told Darden that Scallet's behavior wasn't 
sexual harassment but a routine personnel squabble.  The deans told Scallet not to worry about it.  It was only 
<I>after</I> Scallet's removal that the deans changed their minds.
<P>
<P>The second allegation is that Scallet once jumped on a table in the front of his classroom and wiggled his toes in 
a provocative manner.  Word of this shocking behavior came from a female faculty member, who heard it from the 
TA mentioned above, who heard it from a student, who heard it from another student.  This isn't even hearsay; it's the 
grad school version of Let's Play Gossip.
<P>
<P>The mudslinging intensified when UVA's lawyers got into the act.  Led at the time by the esteemed Jim Mingle, 
who is now at Cornell and working his legal magic on Jim Maas (see 
<B>MINGLE-RANDEL WRANGLE</B>, page 13), UVA's 
legal team made additional allegations against Scallet.   These ranged from the swinish and invented 
(<I>e.g.</I>, a claim--which has Scallet hopping mad--that he described his wife's sexual prowess to a teaching assistant) to the factual but irrelevant 
(<I>e.g.</I>, umpires ejected Scallet a decade ago from a couple of softball games for protesting close calls).  All of this fruit of the 
loon stuff is the result of the University's post-firing detective work; none of it was raised before or at the time of Scallet's 
firing, never mind being relevant to it.
<P>
<P>In January 1996, a federal district court found that Scallet's in-class speech was not protected under the First 
Amendment.  This strikes us as flat-out wrong.  While public universities have a perfect right to control their curricula, they 
<I>can't</I> fire teachers without putting them on notice that the institution has a problem with their teaching.  As noted, Scallet 
never had such notice.  An appeal to the Fourth Circuit is pending.     
<P>
<P>And there's another thing educational institutions can't do:  they can't defame their employees in an effort 
to create a pretext for indefensible personnel actions.  Scallet's defamation claims against various Darden officials 
are pending in state court.


<P><B>SEX, LIES, AND WE SWEAR THIS IS TRUE</B>
<P>On March 27, Michael Greve participated in a panel debate on 
<B><I>Sexual Harassment:  Scholarly Definitions 
and Everyday Realities</B></I>, sponsored and aired to colleges around the nation by Black Issues In Higher Education.  The 
other speakers were Anne L. Bryant of the American Association of University Women; Beth Wilson (Vice Provost, 
Columbia); EEOC Counsel Ellen Vargyas; and the authors of the blockbuster 
<I>Race, Gender, and Power In America</I>, Emma 
Coleman Jordan and Anita Hill.
<P> 
<P>Justice Clarence Thomas's oath at his 1991 confirmation hearings--a filmclip of which was shown at the start of 
the program--was one of the few truthful statements in a two-hour &quot;debate&quot; that was actually a serenade to the 
Loathsome Dove, a/k/a A. Hill. Still, in the presence of feminism's leading ladies, Greve held his own (if one may still say so).  
Asked by one of the hosts to describe the travails of CIR client Don Silva, who was drummed out of his teaching job over 
two harmless remarks of a mildly sexual content, Greve said that the female complainants against Silva had gone 
&quot;berserk,&quot; whereupon the panelists went berserk and harangued Greve for failing to validate women's narratives.  Anita 
&quot;Call-Me-Ms.&quot; Hill was stumped when a caller asked how soon after an event harassment complaints must be brought; the 
correct answer is ten years after it didn't happen.
<P>
<P>Greve further discussed the gender wars, with special emphasis on the 
<I>Maas</I> case, at the <B>University of Texas 
Law School</B> in Austin (March 4); at the <B>Denver Chapter of the Federalist Society's Lawyers 
Division</B> (March 7); and at <B>Chase Law 
School</B> of Northern Kentucky University on a panel with, among others, Professors Lino Graglia and Richard 
Delgado, critical race theorist extraordinaire (March 29). 
<P>
<P>Delgado, who is actually a nice fellow, said that hate speech codes might not restrain sophisticated racists but would 
at least catch uneducated people such as coal miners.  This was not a good thing to say in Northern Kentucky.  
Delgado disavowed any radical ideas about regulating &quot;hate speech&quot;; all he wanted was an FDA for speech, to make sure 
the product would be safe and effective.  This was not a good thing to say to Greve.  Finally, Delgado complained about 
being the only person of color on the panel.  This was not a good thing to say to Graglia, a Sicilian who protested that he'd 
beat Delgado hands-down on a straight melanin count.
<P>
<P>Among other gender news items, the <B><I>Weekly 
Standard</B></I> (January 15) published CIR Director and Cornell 
Professor <B>Jeremy A. Rabkin</B>'s expose of the Maas affair and other edifying spectacles at Cornell.  And the 
<B><I>Roanoke Times</B></I> wrote a long and even-handed article on the Virginia Tech affair and the Violence Against Women Act, quoting CIR's views 
on these matters at considerable length.  So long as we get a fair hearing, we win.

<H4><EM> Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>

<P>Cooperating Counsel:  Michael A. Carvin (Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp; Trowbridge)
<P>
<P>On March 26, the state of Ohio agreed to pay $368,000 in damages and fees to settle our reverse 
discrimination lawsuit against Ohio State University on behalf of Jerry Henry, owner of a family-owned painting business in 
Columbus.
<P>
<P> Jerry Henry was excluded from bidding on OSU's painting and maintenance work under a categorical, 100 
percent minority set-aside program for which Mr. Henry failed to qualify on account of pigment (he's Caucasian).  
OSU's policy was being administered pursuant to Ohio's Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) Act, which establishes a 
15 percent set-aside &quot;goal.&quot;  Unable to find an adequate number of minority vendors in some lines of business, 
OSU made up the &quot;shortfall&quot; by establishing exclusive minority fiefdoms in areas where minority contractors are 
more readily available, including painting and maintenance.
<P>
<P>In March 1996, after a prolonged and pointless effort to defend this policy, OSU agreed to a settlement that, 
in addition to effecting the aforementioned monetary tranfer, prohibits OSU from using &quot;race, color, national 
origin, gender, social or economic diasadvantage, or any other factor other than standard State procurement policies 
and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->

<BR>
practices, in awarding painting contracts.&quot;  (The prohibition on social or economic disadvantage ensures that 
OSU can't resurrect its policy under a &quot;neutral&quot; disguise.)  The court will retain jurisdiction for five years.  Should 
OSU violate the decree during this period, the court may impose &quot;all sanctions and remedies authorized by law or equity.&quot; 
<P>
<P>The settlement followed our motion for summary judgment and a deposition of OSU's designated 
representative--both undertaken by CIR Director Michael A. Carvin, and both proving OSU's utter inability to defend its 
set-asides.  While we remain profoundly grateful to Mr. Carvin for his outstanding contribution, having him conduct 
the depos was massive overkill:  given OSU's position, its representative would have folded under questioning by 
an advocate of modest skills and sophistication, such as a daffodil.  
<P>
<P>Did OSU, Mr. Carvin asked, have any evidence of institutional discrimination, past or present, against 
minority contractors?  No.  Did the state of Ohio possess such evidence?  No.  Did OSU compare its set-asides to the 
availability of minority contractors in a given industry?  No.  Did OSU periodically review its set-aside policies to ensure fairness? 
 No. Did it occur to OSU that the categorical exclusion administered against Mr. Henry might be more unfair 
and extreme than the 15 percent set-aside required by the MBE Act?  No.  Will the set-aside program be terminated 
when its goal of remedying discrimination has been achieved, or will it continue forever?  The latter.  
<P>
<P>Asked, finally, what conceivable justification OSU had for its no-whites-need-apply policy, OSU's rep alleged 
a nationwide conspiracy among paint producers and suppliers to deny blacks access to paint (excerpts reprinted nearby). 
 But that's not a fact; it's affirmative action on acid.  
<P>
<P>The Ohio set-aside fish rots from the head of Republican Governor George V. Voinovich.  Until recently, 
Voinovich professed great fondness for set-asides.  By way of explanation, he pointed to discrimination against his Balkan 
immigrant ancestors--conduct that is lamentable both in its own right and for its failure to impede Voinovich's ascent to 
the pinnacle of Ohio politics.  But we suspect that Voinovich's quota enthusiasm has more to do with the fact that 
some subcontinental Indians have ponied up over $250,000 for his political campaigns.  The Guv rewarded the 
generous donors by cutting them in on the set-aside deals. One might view this as evidence of the dangers of immigration. 
 (&quot;Quotas for Indians?  Let them be 
<I>our</I> Indians!  American Indians First!&quot;)  To us, it's proof of piggishness.
<P>
<P>Ohio has taken pride that post-<I>Henry</I>, the MBE statute is still standing.  Voinovich and the Ohio legislature 
are planning to revise the law so as to steer more money to &quot;economically disadvantaged&quot; businesses, including, 
presumably, Indians and other victims of Voinovich's political shake-downs.  Meanwhile, the State and OSU have vowed 
to defend the MBE set-asides, despite the 
<I>Henry</I> settlement.
<P>
<P>If we can't get rid of the MBE masterplan, we'll shoot the set-asides down one by one, at 368 grand a pop.  
Next time, our office plants will do the depos. 
<P>     
<P>
<P><B>OH BOYCOTT</B>
<P>Under questioning by Michael A. Carvin, Esq., Ohio State University's designated representative and 
principal administrator of its set-aside programs revealed a shocking civil rights violation.
<P>
<P><I>A:  Sometimes I would just put [a contract] out for bid as a set-aside.  Then, as we did our pre-bids and walked 
through the specifications, certain requirements would emerge.  The minority vendors perhaps could not meet certain 
specifications or did not have access to certain products that might be required.
<P>
<P>Q What do you mean that they didn't have access to products?
<P>
<P>A Well, they may not be--they may not have access to products from a manufacturer, that a majority company could 
go out and get from a manufacturer.
<P>
<P>Q Let me start over.  Are there paint manufacturing companies in the United States that refuse to sell paint to minorities?
<P>
<P>A  There were at that time [1988].
<P>
<P>Q Did you know that activity was grossly illegal?
<P>
<P>A No, I didn't know it was illegal. It is stuff that had been going on for a long time.

<H4><EM> Smith, et al., v. Virginia Commonwealth University</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>


<P>Cooperating Counsel:  Charles J. Cooper, David Thompson (Shaw, Pittman, Potts 
&amp; Trowbridge); Bradley Cavedo (Shuford, Rubin &amp; Gibney)
<P>In November 1995, the Fourth Circuit heard <I>en 
banc</I> arguments in <I>Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth 
University</I>, a case that could shape up as CIR's next blockbuster. VCU, which hasn't discriminated against female faculty in its entire 
history, one fine year decided to dole out over $400,000 in salary increases--to women only.  It did so based on a regression 
analysis showing an &quot;unexplained&quot; pay gap between the teaching salaries of men and women on the faculty--provided, mind 
you, that you ignored performance factors such as teaching ability and scholarly publications.  To VCU, though, the gap 
&quot;could only&quot; be the result of sex discrimination, as opposed to the unexamined merit variables.  
<P>
<P>We've long enjoyed our cooperation with the American Association of University Professors:  the AAUP has 
stood firm in the defense on free speech and of robust protections for the accused in sexual harassment proceedings.  For 
example, the AAUP has made a big difference in the Maas affair, and has filed a fine 
<I>amicus</I> brief in<I> Scallet v. Rosenblum</I> (like, 
<I>Smith,</I> a CIR case currently before the Fourth Circuit.  Thus, we report with regret that in 
<I>Smith</I>, the AAUP sided with VCU. 
<P>
<P>Whatever may have made the AAUP lose it in this case, it can't be the merits.  It's true that other universities 
have dished out &quot;gender adjustments&quot; on even shoddier evidence than VCU's, such bribes having become the fashion in 
higher ed.  But this observation goes to the cravenness of public institutions, not to fairness or legality.  
<P>
<P>In a superb oral argument for the plaintiffs, Chuck Cooper showed that there are perfectly innocent explanations 
for the pay &quot;gap&quot; at VCU even 
<I>before</I> you get around to the merit business--for instance, the greater willingness of 
male faculty to accept higher-paying administrative positions.To award gender-based pay raises under such circumstances 
is rank sex discrimination, which is unlawful under Title VII.  Or so we think.

<H4><EM>Lamprecht v. Federal Communications Commission </EM><BR></H4></CENTER>
<P>Cooperating Counsel:  R. Hewitt Pate (Hunton &amp; Williams)
<P>Tom Lamprecht bears the distinction of being a permanent CIR client, having been with us since the day we hung 
out our shingle seven years ago.  
<P>
<P>In 1988, the FCC, under its then-extant gender preference scheme, denied Lamprecht's application for a 
broadcast license for a station in Frederick, Maryland, and instead handed it to a female applicant, a certain Ms. Marmet.  
(Ms. Marmet's lawyers are perennial players in the FCC's race and gender racket, a fact that bears on the tortured history of 
this case.)  We appealed.  In then-Judge Thomas' last decision on the court, the D.C. Circuit declared the FCC's gender 
preferences unconstitutional.  
<P>
<P>On remand, the FCC again awarded the license to Ms. Marmet, having conveniently re-arranged its scoring factors 
to reach this pre-determined result.  While we were appealing this decision as patently arbitrary and capricious, the 
D.C. Circuit, in <I>Bechtel v. FCC</I> (1993), junked the FCC's competitive licensing scheme and told the Commission to come up 
with regs that bear some semblance to rationality.  Our appeal was remanded for further consideration in light of 
<I>Bechtel</I>.
<P>     
<P>To this day, the FCC has failed to come up with new regs.  The principal hang-up, it appears, is that the FCC 
remains fond of race and gender preferences but can't find a way to make them constitutional under binding law and 
precedent, including the Supreme Court's 1995 
<I>Adarand</I> decision.
<P>
<P>In December 1995, despite our pending appeal and the lack of valid regs, the FCC staff granted Ms. Marmet's 
request to transfer the license to &quot;her&quot; station, which she has been running under an operating permit while the 
<I>Lamprecht</I> controversy has been droning on.  The staff conveniently neglected to inform Mr. Lamprecht and his attorneys of this decision.
<P>
<P>In February, we asked the FCC to reverse its decision on the license transfer.  Should this prove unavailing, 
we'll go back to the D.C. Circuit.

<H3>MINGLE-RANDEL WRANGLE</H3>
<H4><EM>James B. Maas v. Cornell University </EM><BR></H4></CENTER>

<P>Cooperating Counsel:  David A. Stoll, Esq.
<P>
<P>In January, the New York Supreme Court in Tompkins County heard oral arguments on Cornell's motion 
to dismiss our $1.5 million lawsuit on behalf of psychology professor James B. Maas, one of Cornell's most 
distinguished faculty members and most beloved teachers.  No word from the court yet, but there have been other developments 
of note.
<P>
<P>In 1994, four female former students alleged that Maas was excessively &quot;affectionate&quot; and &quot;friendly.&quot;  This 
&quot;harassment&quot;--social hugs and kisses, invitations to family birthday parties, and small gifts--occurred in front of 
Maas's wife or other third parties.  Little of it was even arguably of a sexual nature.  Virtually all of it was, by all 
appearances, welcomed and appreciated at the time.
<P>
<P>Maas was sentenced by the so-called Professional Ethics Committee (PEC) of Cornell's College of Arts &amp; 
Sciences.  The PEC's procedures were designed to make women &quot;comfortable&quot; to come forward and to &quot;level the 
playing field&quot; between the impotent accusers and the omnipotent accused.  Unfortunately, due process appears to be one 
of the things that makes the process &quot;uncomfortable&quot; for complainants, and the PEC lacked even the most 
elementary procedural protections for the accused.  For instance, Maas was barred from questioning the complainants.  
Participants in the ostensibly confidential process leaked the complaints and the prosecutor's &quot;findings&quot; to the 
<I>Cornell Daily Sun</I>, with predictably deleterious consequences to Maas's reputation.  And there were no rules of evidence or 
relevance.  Consequently, the lack of proof for any particular charge posed no obstacle to a guilty verdict:  the 
PEC concluded that Maas's &quot;inappropriate&quot; behavior 
&quot;<I>in effect</I> ... constituted sexual harassment.&quot;  Similarly, the PEC 
found that a single, six-year-old allegation of breast touching (which Maas fiercely denies) was 
<I>unproven</I>, but nonetheless &quot;especially egregious&quot; and suggestive of &quot;a pattern over time.&quot;  
<P>
<P>Then-still-Dean Don Randel, the Pontius Pilate of the Maas case, declared himself powerless to review the 
PEC's findings (&quot;Facts?  What are those?&quot;), only to turn around and declare the PEC's findings and the procedures 
just dandy.  In other words, Randel told the mob it should feel free to hang Jim Maas--and washed his hands.  In 
language later published in a Cornell press release, Randel observed that &quot;Maas was not found to have had, or sought, 
an intimate sexual relationship with any of his students nor to have engaged in the physically abusive behavior&quot; 
but nonetheless pronounced Maas guilty of the offense, whatever it may have been.
<P>
<P>Lately, though, Jim Maas has been celebrating a personal pentecost of sorts.  Doubters have examined his 
scars, and found that something went terribly wrong.  And the chorus of opposition to the administration's position on 
sexual harassment procedures, limited only a year ago to Cornell's two-and-a-half conservative faculty members, now 
includes most of the faculty and even some self-proclaimed anarcho-feminists who so often speak in strange tongues.  
<P>
<P>Don Randel deserves considerable credit for this revolt.  Only after months of dithering did he obey a 
faculty resolution and appoint a faculty committee (under the Chairpersonship of Prof. Henry Shue) to look into what 
went wrong and why with the PEC procedures.  Then, with uncharacteristic promptness, Randel and Cornell Counsel 
James Mingle sprung a draft of new, campus-wide sexual harassment procedures on the barely constituted Shue 
Committee and on the startled Cornell community, declaring that the new procedures would go into effect shortly.  
<P>
<P>Above Cayuga's waters, the core of the Randel/Mingle draft quickly became known as the &quot;sentence first, 
hearing later&quot; procedure:  the accused can demand a hearing only after he's been found guilty of sexual harassment, on 
the theory that the proceeding that led to the verdict was merely &quot;investigative.&quot;  This brilliant idea is consistent 
with Cornell's position in the pending <I>Maas</I> case--to wit, that the PEC gave Maas more procedures than he was entitled 
to, since he was entitled to none.  It's also consistent with the procedures at the University of Virginia, where Mingle 
was General Counsel before coming to Cornell. 
<P>
<P>(In another maneuver, Mingle is resisting our request for documents on past sexual harassment proceedings 
at Cornell's statutory colleges.  He insists that Cornell's public colleges aren't subject to New York open records 
laws since they aren't really public but operated with state money under a contract with the state, for what this distinction 
is worth.  We have filed suit to obtain the documents, and we can't wait to see what it is Cornell doesn't want us to know.)
<P>
<P>The Mingle/Randel draft caused consternation and alarm all around.  The American Association of 
University Professors criticized it as wholly inconsistent with the AAUP's guidelines and basic principles of academic due process. 
 Professor Mary Beth Norton, architect of the PEC procedures, denounced attempts to undermine faculty 
self-governance on sexual harassment matters in an article in the 
<I>Chronicle of Higher Education</I>.  In a letter to Randel, 29 of 
the Law School's 34 faculty members took strong exception to any procedures under which &quot;the trial follows the hanging.&quot; 
 Randel made known that the draft wasn't really a serious proposal but merely the biggest trial balloon since 
the Hindenburg in the end, at last.
<P>     
<P>In March, the Shue Committee published its findings--which, to some extent, 
<I>we</I> could have written.  The Committee stressed the imperative need for a right to face and cross-examine one's accusers, statutes of limitations, 
an explicit presumption of innocence, specific charges and findings, protection of confidentiality, rules of evidence, 
and numerous other protections Jim Maas demanded but never received.  In a pointed rejection of the PEC's verdict in 
the <I>Maas</I> case, the Shue Committee stressed that &quot;there is no such thing as 'in effect ... sexual harassment,'&quot; this being 
&quot;too much of a 'fudge phrase' to be appropiate in a finding on which sanctions are based.&quot; 
<P>
<P>At long last, the Mingle-Randel tag team circulated a revised draft of new procedures.  While still far 
from perfect, the new draft is at least partially consistent with the AAUP's guidelines and the Shue Committee's 
report--and diametrically opposed to the position Cornell continues to defend in court.  We suppose that's progress. 
<P>
<P>We can't help but wonder, though, what ordinary corporations--which are accountable to shareholders--would 
do to an officer who sits by as one of the institution's most valued and productive employees gets smeared in the 
national press; forces the employee to file a highly publicized and, for the institution, embarassing lawsuit; and incites a 
palace revolution among the workforce.  
<P>
<P>Cornell, of course, didn't ding Don Randel; it made him provost.  This would be none of our business, were it 
not for the fact that Randel now has a huge personal stake in preventing an acceptable agreement between Jim Maas 
and Cornell:  any such agreement would be an admission that things went terribly wrong in the 
<I>Maas</I> case--and on Randel's watch.  But if Randel wants to fight the Maas case to the bitter end, we're ready.
<P>

<H3>HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>Soon to be published by the American Enterprise Institute: Michael Greve's monograph on 
<B>The Demise of Environmentalism in American 
Law</B>.  Seemingly far removed from CIR's ordinary concerns, this excellent tome actually 
sheds light on the strange logic of the &quot;hostile environment&quot; claims CIR has opposed so long and adamantly:  just as the 
Endangered Species Act permits the piping plover to allege discomfort over the property owner's insistence on raking his 
beach, so members of the endangered female species may now complain under civil rights law about unwanted compliments 
and pictures of the Naked Maya.  
<P>
<P>The book isn't out quite yet.  But some day, our prints will come.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, Greve peddled portions of the book to assorted audiences.  On February 29, he debated 
environmental racism with Professor Sherilyn Ifill at an event co-sponsored by the 
<B>University of Maryland Law School</B>'s Federalist 
Society, Environmental Law Society, and Black Law Students Association.  Greve spoke out against racism and for the 
environment.
<P>
<P>Three months earlier, at the invitation of the 
<B>Goldwater Institute</B> and the <B>Federalist 
Society</B>, Greve addressed environmental issue at a conference on judicial mandates.  He spoke out against such mandates unless they're issued for 
CIR clients.  Greve was fortunate to share the panel with Professors Chris Stone and Richard Lazarus and Akin, Gump's 
Roger Marzulla--and fortunater still to complete a full round of golf without encountering Judge Randolph, who wields 
five-irons Mingle
and gavels to humiliating effect.  The proceedings of the conference will appear in the 
<I>Arizona State Law Journal</I>.
<P>
<P>On February 12, Greve addressed affirmative action at Stetson College's 16th 
<B>Annual Conference on Law and Higher 
Education</B>.  Among the 500-plus lawyers, educators, and administrators with unconstitutional job titles 
(<I>e.g.</I>, Associate Dean for Affirmative Action), Greve's confident and accurate prediction of a CIR victory in the 
then-still-pending <I>Hopwood</I> case produced hysteria; his suggestion that universities could keep the race game going by  perjury and 
the shredding of evidence was greeted with emphatic approval.
<P>
<P>Way back in November 1995, Greve debated Ralph Neas on affirmative action before the 
<B>Allegheny County Bar Association</B> in Pittsburgh.  Mr. Neas said that anti-preference legislation would not and should not go anywhere in 
Congress because the Republicans would realize that most of the benefits of such programs go to their wives and daughters, 
as opposed to disenfranchised minorities.  With this pro, Greve rested his con.
<P>
<P>Greve also debated Professor Margaret Montoya on civil rights at the 
<B>University of New Mexico Law School</B> (March 6), before the 
<B>New York Bar Association</B> (April 16), and at 
<B>St. Thomas Law School</B> in Miami (April 18).
<P>
<P>On February 17, Greve spoke at the <B>University of 
Minnesota</B> on the subject of academic freedom, at the invitation 
of the <B>Minnesota Students' Association</B> and the 
<B>Minnesota Association of Scholars</B>.  And on May 5, Greve will appear on 
a panel with Alan Kors (University of Pennsylvania) and Nadine Strossen at the 
<B>National Association of Scholars</B>' Annual Conference in Washington, D.C.  The topic is Free Speech and Higher Education.  Greve will argue that there's no 
good argument against free speech, except perhaps what now passes for higher education.

<P>
<P>We have settled our reverse discrimination lawsuit on behalf of &quot;Michelle Doe,&quot; a 14-year-old girl from 
Corpus Christi.  As reported, Michelle applied to an environmental study program called &quot;Planet Earth,&quot; a summer study 
camp financed in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and administered by a University Outreach Program 
sponsored by Texas A &amp; M University.  Being Caucasian, Michelle was denied admission because the NSF's funding 
guidelines specified that Planet Earth was to be reserved for selected minorities.
<P>
<P>The defendants have agreed to settle the case for $20,000 in damages and fees.  They have also promised not 
to discriminate in the future.  The feds will take steps to ensure that summer science camps that discriminate on the basis 
of race, sex etc. will no longer receive NSF funding.  Until 1999, the NSF will submit its program brochures to CIR 
for inspection and compliance review. 
<P>
<P>If this case serves as a precedent, we'll soon oversee the entire federal government:  a slew of departments 
and agencies, from Defense to Energy to Agriculture to the EPA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), still 
fund minorities only programs. 
<P>
<P>How do we know this?  Why, having been denied admission to Planet Earth, Michelle cast about for another 
summer program and stumbled upon a nifty six-week science apprenticeship program for high school students.  Run, like 
Planet Earth, by Texas A &amp; M, the program involves lab work in biochemistry.  It pays room and board scholarships, as well as 
a stipend.  The apprenticeship program is partially funded by the USDA and NIH.
<P>     
<P>This time around, Michelle was told she shouldn't even bother to apply:  the summer apprenticeship program 
is reserved for applicants who can identify themselves as Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native, or 
Pacific Islander/Asian. We're cloning our first 
<I>Doe</I> complaint as we speak.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, in Delaware, the United States Department of Justice is participating in the so-called Redding 
Fellowship, a summer clerkship program for first-year law students.  Run by the Delaware Bar Association, the program 
pays participants $600 per week for eleven weeks of work with various state and federal agencies and private law firms, plus 
a $2,000 payment upon successful completion.  Eligibility for the program is limited to members of selected minorities.  
<P>
<P>The program's namesake, Louis L. Redding, is familiar with such restrictions:  the first black (and highly 
distinguished) member of the Delaware Bar, he was the plaintiff's counsel in 
<I>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority</I>, an 
important 1961 civil rights case in which the Supreme Court ruled against the race-based exclusion of black customers from 
lunch counters.  As far as we're concerned, these games don't cease to be odious when they're being played 35 years later and 
in reverse.
<P>
<P>Yes, the Delaware Bar once discriminated against Blacks.  But this nefarious past fails to explain how Asians 
and Hispanics made it into the Redding program; why the program is targeted at law students who are not from Delaware; 
and why the feds think they can participate in a program that's plainly unlawful.  The Redding program doesn't even pretend 
to interest minority youngsters in the practice of law.  At best, it's an attempt to induce minorities to practice law in 
Delaware rather than someplace else; at worst, it's PC on autopilot.
<P> 
<P>We are challenging the program on behalf of three unsuccessful Caucasian applicants.  Something tells us the 
case won't go to trial.

<P>
<H3>INTERNAL AFFAIRS</H3></center>
<P>CIR's merry band of warriors increased in strength and numbers.  On April 1, 
<B>Hans Bader</B> (Harvard Law School, Class of '94), joined CIR as Associate Counsel and third full-time litigator.  
<B>Kipp Coddington</B>, formerly of the firm of Ropes &amp; Gray, is CIR's new Counsel and Director of Communications; he will assume his new position on May 1.
<P>
<P>In December 1995, <B>Seung Baik</B> finished his internship with CIR, under the auspices of Cornell University's 
Washington program.  In January, <B>Curt Levey</B> (Harvard Law School, Class of '98) spent a one-month, Harvard-paid 
clerkship with CIR.    <B>Robert Alt</B>, a student in political science at Azusa Pacific University, has been spending part of 
his Semester-in-Washington as a research assistant with Judge Robert Bork and is now with CIR.
<P>
<P>Over the summer, we'll be joined by <B>John 
Sheahan</B> (Chicago Law School) and by <B>Howard 
Nielson</B> (Chicago Law School).  Mr. Nielson's clerkship will be paid by the firm of 
<B>Steptoe &amp; Johnson</B>, whose generous support we 
gratefully acknowledge.
<p>
<B>GOTCHA</B>
<P><I>The Center for Individual Rights, which just won a reverse discrimination case against OSU, was described in 
the</I> Columbus Dispatch <I>as a &quot;nonprofit group that provides free legal assistance in free-speech and civil rights cases.&quot;  
Actually, it is a law firm dedicated to dismantling affirmative action, civil rights, and sexual harassment laws as well as 
attacking what they perceive as &quot;political correctness.&quot;  CIR's slogan is &quot;Better Living Through Lawsuits.&quot;
<P>
<P>Columbus Guardian</I>, March 28, 1996


<P><P><B>IN OTHER CASES</B>
<P>
<P>Ron Reisner's reverse discrimination lawsuit against John Jay College is proceeding apace.  The case arises 
over John Jay's repeated failure to appoint Reisner to a tenure-track faculty position, despite his excellent credentials 
and equally excellent faculty evaluations.  Memos and other materials obtained through discovery show that John 
Jay refused to hire Reisner because he isn't diverse but Caucasian.  The College administration viewed the faculty's 
painstaking search and evaluation process, under whose rules Reisner should and would have been hired, as a charade 
to disguise a minorities-only hiring policy.  The process was 
<I>supposed</I> to be a joke, and Reisner was supposed to be 
the clown in the diversity circus.  We predict he'll have the last laugh.
<P>
<P>CIR star litigator Michael Rosman schlepped to California on our First Amendment lawsuit on behalf of 
three Berkeley residents who were &quot;investigated&quot; for almost a full year by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.  Our clients ran a neighborhood association to oppose, through constitutionally protected speaking and 
petitioning, the conversion of a local motel for use by homeless, severely dysfunctional residents.  So HUD went 
after them, on the theory that peaceful opposition to HUD-favored housing projects violates the Fair Housing Act.  
HUD demanded our clients' membership lists, copies of newspaper articles and letters, and transcripts of public meetings.  
<P>
<P>In a January 5 decision, U.S. District Judge Patel denied the defendants' motion to dismiss our damage 
claims, calling HUD's argument that <I>no</I> investigation could run afoul of the First Amendment &quot;striking in its audacity.&quot;  
Mr. Rosman, on his West Coast trip, presented our clients' demand for injunctive relief, which is 
<I>sub judice</I>.  
<HR>
<P>In a long-running dispute, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, affectionately known as &quot;FAM 
YOU,&quot; disciplined assistant professor and CIR client Gerald Gee for a single controversial remark in his Public 
Relations class.  (The remark contained a racial epithet, but was in no way calculated to insult.)  When six students 
complained, characterizing the remark as &quot;derogatory,&quot; &quot;unethical,&quot; and &quot;most importantly, inappropriate,&quot; FAMU declared 
Gee guilty of &quot;racial harassment&quot; and imposed a two-week suspension.  After a court hearing on our motion for a 
preliminary injunction, FAMU agreed to revoke what remained of Gee's suspension.  We have filed for partial 
summary judgment.

<b><font size=3> TRADITIONAL READING INSTRUCTION GETS A BIG BOOST IN CALIFORNIA</font></b>

Gettysburg was one battle that changed a war. This month, education 
reformers, parents and everyday citizens who support phonics won such a 
fight in Sacramento. The outcome of a vote by the California Board of 
Education signals a decisive change in how public school children will be 
taught to read -- not just in the Golden State, but nationwide. 
<p>
The state board voted Dec. 12 to approve 16 reading programs by 10 
publishers that will be used in California's public schools for the next 
seven years. But more important in the continuing controversy over reading 
education, the board rejected unanimously books by Rigby Education, Inc. 
and the Wright Group because they did not emphasize phonics enough. 
<p>
The board's decision comes almost two years after California's students 
tied for last with Louisiana in reading skills on the National Assessment 
of Educational Progress. A special state reading task force concluded in 
September 1995 that the state's decade-long approach to reading 
instruction, Whole Language, was the reason for students' abysmal 
performance and recommended that it be replaced. 
<p>
Whole Language theory holds that children learn to read much as they learn 
to speak -- by simple immersion. WL advocates believe books with pictures 
and whole words are better than simple, direct instruction in phonics. 
Phonics, in their view, is "boring." Whole Language, on the other hand, is 
supposedly "child-centered, reflective, authentic, social, collaborative, 
democratic and challenging." So zealous were WL supporters in the state 
bureaucracy they began to eliminate spelling textbooks in order to prevent 
kids from learning to sound out words and spell the fundamental blocks of 
language. 
<p>
The most notorious byproduct of the whole language is "invented spelling." 
Teachers wanted to shift "from a focus on error to a focus on creation." 
The reality was that teachers weren't supposed to correct spelling mistakes 
for fear of bruising the child's self-esteem. It's no surprise, then, that 
the Golden State's peers in reading are Louisiana and Mississippi. 
<p>
Phonics teaches kids to read by sounding out words through drill and 
repetition. But phonics is anything but "boring," if the growing popularity 
of such products as "The Phonics Game" is any indication. And research has 
concluded time and again that intensive, systematic phonics is the most 
effective method of reading instruction. 
<p>
But it wasn't simply that the Board of Education rejected the Wright and 
Rigby books because they were bad. They were also illegal. California law 
changed last year to reflect the recommendations of the California Reading 
Task Force. A recent state appropriations bill, AB170, requires that all 
new reading instruction materials contain phonics, phonemic awareness, and 
"decodable" text. And California's Budget Act of 1996 prohibits state money 
from being spent in support of "any program, network, or material that (a) 
promotes or uses reading instruction methodologies that emphasize 
contextual clues (WL) in lieu of fluent decoding (phonics), or (b) 
systematically uses or encourages inventive spelling techniques in the 
teaching of writing." 
<p>
Wright and Rigby's programs did not meet the new standards. So they were 
rejected, despite the best efforts of the publishers to mount an intense 
lobbying effort that included hundreds of form letters and even a good word 
from former Gov. George Deukmejian, whose law firm was retained by the 
Wright Group. 
<p>
The board's decision will have a major national impact. California accounts 
for 11 percent of the nation's textbook market, the largest in the country. 
Textbook publishers therefore tend to cater to the California market. 
<p>
Not surprisingly, Rigby's president, Steve Korte, says his company is 
considering a legal challenge to the board's vote. "We are being denied 
access to a substantial amount of revenue," Korte said. In fact, Wright and 
Rigby stand to lose a hefty portion of the more than $600 million that 
California's school districts will spend on textbooks over the next seven 
years. 
<p>
Phonics supporters are right to feel good about this victory, but the war 
is by no means over. Kathryn Dronenberg, the board member who led the 
opposition against Wright and Rigby, says that the 16 other programs 
adopted by the board at its meeting "more fully meet the criteria (set by 
lawmakers). All of the programs have, to varying degrees, spelling, phonics 
and phonemic awareness. But that means some of the programs rely more 
heavily on the Whole Language approach than others. And it is safe to 
assume that the same WL zealots who removed basic skills from classrooms a 
decade ago are still in the state education establishment, where they are 
unchecked and unaccountable. 
<p>
California took its first step toward returning to the top in education. 
But there are many more votes to come.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>A TALE OF TWO BUDGETS</B></FONT><BR><B> By Tom McClintock</B></P>





"[The Governor] was aided in his [budget] by the strength of California's economy, which gave him more new money to distribute than he had a year ago," reported one major newspaper.  Education was a big winner, said the state Finance Director, simply reflecting "that the budget is roomier this year…and that the Governor will devote more money to education whenever he can." There were expressions of bi-partisan support, with the Senate Democratic leader calling the budget "relatively generous in terms of funding for the status quo."<P>
Again of the state budget, a major newspaper said, "[it is] a big-spending document made possible by rising revenues from the state's recovering economy." Another crowed, "The biggest winner…was--as it should have been--education." More expressions of bi-partisan support heard. Said the Assembly Democratic leader, "When you look at this budget from the standpoint of working men and women, seniors and children, this budget does the best we can for them."<P>

Same show. Different years. The first observations were made eight years ago when George Deukmejian unveiled his 1988 spending plan; the second were made this week, when California's 1996 state budget was adopted. We have heard this song before.<P>

1987 and 1988 were fat years for Sacramento's budget-writers. In 1987, surging revenues--and polticians' eagerness to spend them--pushed the budget over the state's maximum spending limit for the first and only time. In 1988, state expenditures exploded 10.3 percent in a single year. A billion dollars of new funds for education produced a truce in the feud between Deukmejian and state schools superintendent Bill Honig (although test scores continued to decline).<P>

Everyone but a few conservative malcontents were effusive in praise for their mutual munificence. Sighed one Republican assemblyman as he surrendered to temptation, "I guess we'd better spend all this new money before the big spenders get hold of it."<P>

But in mid-1988, the economy began to turn downward, and within a year red ink was seeping onto the state's ledgers.<P>

California's experience was typical of the states that shopped til they dropped in the 1980's. Writing for the Cato Institute in 1991, budget analyst Stephen Moore summarized the fiscal wreckage of California and other high-spending states with words which should be haunting in 1996: "With few exceptions the states with the most severe deficits today are those that saw their economies and tax revenues grow rapidly over the past decade, but allowed spending to grow even faster."<P>

The growth of California spending, for example, had outpaced the national average by 15 percent during the 1980's. Beneath the "Iron Duke's" dour exterior, it turns out, there beat the heart of a party animal.<P>

According to Moore's study, the frugal states that had restrained their growth in the 1980's as a whole avoided crippling tax increases and massive budget deficits when boom turned to bust. Many ran surpluses.<P>

California, of course, was not one of them. As recession ravaged revenues could no longer maintain the bureaucracies in the style to which they had grown accustomed, lawmakers attempted to fill the widening budget gaps with unprecedented tax increases and borrowing. The record-shattering 1991 tax hike plunged the state's economy from recession to near-depression, while California's total debt skyrocketed from $18.2 billion to $28.6 billion between 1990 and 1994.<P>

Deukmejian at least maintained a three percent reserve until the last year of his administration, without which the state's fiscal plight would have been even worse. This year's budget provides about one third of that cushion.<P>

California's 1996 budget repeats the 1988 experience in almost every detail. State spending will leap nine percent in a single bound, and Sacramento's solons have been able to appease every bureaucrat in town. Three billion dollars more will go to California's public school system this year, although serious proposals to change performance incentives were abandoned.<P>

The old parable of the ant who stores a surplus in the summer to endure the winter while his cousin the grasshopper first feasts then starves is as true for governments as it is for families and businesses. Frugality in good years softens the bitter choices in the lean ones.<P>

Ironically, an administration which has grappled for six years with the harsh consequences of profligacy now sets in motion the same cycle for its successor when the economy turns downward again.<P>

It's the same old song, a familiar California medley: "Let the Good Times Roll," followed by "The Party's Over."<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>THE HIGH COST OF RACIAL AND GENDER PREFERENCES</B></FONT><BR><B> By Tom McClintock</B></P>



It is ironic that one of the hottest political controversies today revolves around an issue which the nation's founders declared a "self-evident" truth 11 generations ago: "that all men are created equal." <P>
The debate over the racial preferences inherent in modern "affirmative action" programs ultimately will turn on differing notions of justice and equality before the law. But there is a secondary issue which should also be noted. When arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. Sometimes they are the direct costs of preferential programs. More often, they are the indirect costs of inflated prices, bureaucratic delays, and overall inefficiencies which are inescapable consequences of restricting competition. <P>
Racial and gender quotas now permeate virtually every aspect of California's government, including the awarding of state contracts, the hiring and promotion of state employees, the admission of students to the state's universities, and the appropriation of funds for school children. These laws cost California taxpayers and consumers at least $343 million annually, and quite probably several times this amount. <P>
The direct cost to state government alone for administering and implementing race and gender based programs exceeds $155 million each year. In virtually every office of California's bureaucracies, coordinators are paid to shuffle mountains of paperwork to administer racial and gender preferences. In response to a recent inquiry from Governor Pete Wilson, agencies which account for less than half of state spending estimated their administrative costs for racial and gender programs to be $12.8 million.  <P>
According to the Legislative Analyst, $47 million is spent annually for race-based programs in the state's two university systems and another $10 million in the public schools and community colleges. (According to other studies, the cost to the universities could be as high as $274 million annually). $82 million is spent annually on "voluntary desegregation" programs in the schools, even though no finding of past racial discrimination has been made. <P>
There are also significant indirect costs. California state government requires that fully one fifth of all state contracts must be set aside for companies owned by specific racial groups or women. As the bidding pool is reduced, prices rise, and California taxpayers must pay between $41 million and $48 million due to restricted competition. <P>
Another indirect expense is the cost of delays in awarding contracts because of the complexity of complying with quotas. In response to a survey by the Construction Industry Research Board in 1986, 78 percent of contractors reported delays in awarding affirmative action contracts. Furthermore, according to the Department of General Services, the time for submitting bids has increased an average of four weeks to allow bidders time to comply with these requirements. These delays cost taxpayers at least $15 million annually. <P>
Under this panoply of racial and gender laws, any business which wants to bid for a state contract must go to extraordinary lengths to recruit minority and woman businesses, including advertising in minority trade publications and meticulously documenting their recruitment efforts. According to the state's Little Hoover Commission, this costs each bidder an average of $1,000 per contract, or $240 million annually. Who pays? Ultimately, consumers pay through higher prices, taxpayers through higher government costs, employees through lower wages, and investors through lower earnings. <P>
Other costs are impossible to estimate. Perhaps the largest(and the most tragic(is the opportunity cost to society of racially discriminatory practices which divert resources from their most productive use. If a highly qualified young woman is denied admittance to the UCLA School of Medicine solely because of her Asian ancestry, how much have we detracted from the potential safety and prosperity of our society? <P>
The price tag for official discrimination in California runs from a low of $343 million to more than $677 million, strictly to maintain a system of racial and gender discrimination in state law. But this doesn't tell the whole story. There are a number of bureaucracies and businesses for which cost information is not readily available and some costs are simply incalculable. Finally, these estimates are for California state government only; they do not account for similar costs incurred by cities, counties and special districts, which would easily double the numbers. <P>
Official discrimination inflicts irreconcilable damage upon the founding principles of the nation; it poisons the social tolerance which is a necessary condition of a free people; it undermines respect for the law and for governmental institutions. These are social costs, and they are astronomical.   <P>
But it also costs money. A lot of it. <P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Diversity is Good--Discrimination Isn't</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#E6E8EA" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#008080" ALINK=000080>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DIVERSITY IS GOOD--DISCRIMINATION ISN'T</B></FONT><BR><B>By Paul Marshall</B></P>

Governments, universities and corporations are caught up in the same "diversity" craze. They routinely defend discrimination by relying on Justice Powell's commendation of "exposure...to students as diverse as this nation of many peoples" in the 1978 Supreme Court Bakke case.  <P>
Of course, as Shelby Steele has said, "No one really knows what diversity means." But that has not dampened the enthusiasm. Currently, three-quarters of the 50 largest U.S. firms have "Diversity Managers." The federal government grades for "promoting diversity" on its management appraisals. The San Francisco School Board adjusts admissions to produce "value-added diversity."<P>
The Clinton Administration defends this with monotonous regularity. On May 24, it urged the Supreme Court to overturn Texas vs. Hopwood, which outlaws discriminatory university admissions, on the grounds of "achieving meaningful educational diversity." 
However, the Clinton Administration has a narrow view of diversity. Hopwood has a blue-collar background, is married to a serviceman, raising a disabled child, and was too poor to take up a partial scholarship to Princeton. The Appeals Court in Hopwood said she "would bring a different perspective to the law school." <P>
For the administration, this is the wrong kind of difference. They want the law school to be able to exclude her because of racial quotas.  <P>
This plea for discrimination causes many conservatives to reject diversity entirely. That would be a mistake, since genuine diversity is marvelous. One of the wonderful things about America is that people have come here from all over the world. Our lives can be enriched by knowing men and women with different views and histories. At a more mundane level, imagine how boring life would be if we were all Puritans and could eat only English food. <P>
The problem is not real diversity, but the use of discrimination in service of a counterfeit "diversity." Real diversity grows when free and equal people make choices about their lives without government control or manipulation. Quotas and discrimination can never produce real variety. They only enforce an administrator's view of who people are and what they should do and think. The result is conformity.<P>
Our universities, corporations, politics and media don't need imposed sameness. In a country rent by "culture wars," we need the challenge of differing and well-formed ideas.
But our universities, are remarkably alike. In the humanities and social sciences, the faculty are routinely secular and liberal. What is desperately required is not more ethnically and sexually "diverse" liberal clones, but people with alternate political, cultural and religious views. <P>
Yet people with religious faith,for example,are often marginalized. Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that he would advise evangelical Christians looking for a career in the media to remove hints of their faith from their resume. "I would say leave it off, just as twenty years ago, if you were a member of a gay rights organization, I would have said leave it off."<P>
Commissioner Robert George noted that religion "doesn't seem to be treated as an issue in diversity, even among people...[responsible] for promoting diversity within their organizations." <P>
Instead, we are left with the dubious proposition that there is something called a "woman's voice" or a "black voice." But women who are conservative Catholics are not well represented by women who are radical feminists, and vice versa. Nor are African-American Pentecostals well represented by secular liberals. <P>
The solution is not some new, approved religious quota. This would only add to the disease. Individual believers are no more reducible than anyone else to a group identity. Instead we need free exchange and competition in place of liberal bias.<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court recently drove this point home. On June 13, in Bush vs. Vera and Shore vs. Hunt, it struck down bizarrely-shaped, racially-gerrymandered voting districts. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asserted, in the major opinion, that such "districts cause constitutional harm insofar as they convey the message that political identity is, or should be, predominantly racial." <P>
Real diversity is good. Discrimination isn't. As O'Connor said, government shouldn't encourage the assumption "that people will vote or think" according to skin color.<P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DON'T LOOK FOR THE TERRORISTS</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN=center><B>By Bruce Herschensohn</B></P>


President Clinton said that he will dispatch FBI agents to Saudi Arabia to help in the investigation into who committed the terrorist act, and he said he would "make sure that those responsible for this hideous act are brought to justice." <P>

That was seven months ago, last November 13, when a terrorist attack killed five Americans and injured 60 others in Saudi Arabia.<P>

On June 25, 1996, after it was reported that another bomb blast killed 19 Americans and injured 105 more in Saudi Arabia, President Clinton said that he will dispatch FBI agents to Saudi Arabia to help in the investigation to find out who committed the terrorist act and he said "those who did it must be brought to justice."<P>

Forget it.<P>

The Saudis captured and beheaded four terrorists who might have been involved in last November's attack, but it resulted in little if any deterrence. If we are serious about stopping terrorism against Americans we must fight terrorism as we fight a war. When a hand-grenade lands in a foxhole in a battle, there is no attempt to find who threw it because it's irrelevant. The enemy must be attacked as a whole.<P>

When President Franklin Roosevelt requested a declaration of war against the Empire of Japan, he did not say, "Yesterday we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, and we are going to do everything possible to find out who those individual pilots, navigators, and bombardiers were, and bring them to justice." That would have been a guarantee that we would have lost the war. Those individuals were nothing more than tools of a larger enemy.<P>

The larger enemy today is the Nation of Terrorism. It is irrelevant if an individual group responsible for a particular attack is called "The Movement for Islamic Change" or "The Tigers of the Gulf" or some other name. Upon which terrorist group should we retaliate? Any of them.<P>

President Clinton should call a Joint Session of the Congress to request a declaration of war against terrorism, and "that from this day forward, the United States of America will regard terrorism as a sovereign state--as a nation in itself. The Nation of Terrorism is a chain of bases, training camps, safe houses, and other facilities that dot portions of the map of the world, going into and out of other sovereign states. The non-contiguous configuration that the Nation of Terrorism has enjoyed has been a shield, since its citizens-by-choice have assumed that they would always be regarded as part of other sovereign states that surrounded them. That shield must be a thing of the past.<P>

"I am not requesting a declaration of war against Iran or Iraq or Libya or Syria or Cuba or North Korea or Sudan, but against the bases of terrorism within those countries and other countries, as long as those governments permit such bases to exist within their borders.<P>

"As Commander in Chief, I will see to it that if any American is terrorized--indeed, if one hair on the head of an American is touched in hostility--there will be an immediate retaliation by the Government of the United States of America. Our military will be directed to strike at an unannounced terrorist target we think appropriate within the archipelago of 'islands' that have been built and inhabited within the existing borders of other sovereign states.<P>

"This will be a clear edict that we are no longer searching for individual terrorists alone when we can find them, but instead, we are at war against Terrorism and we have found it.<P>

"We must recognize that the Nation of Terrorism has already declared war against the United States and our nation will not allow that to continue.<P>

"If terrorists feel that our retaliatory policy puts them at risk of being targeted for individual acts of terrorism that they did not commit, there is only one option for their future safety: get out of the terrorism business.<P>

"My fellow Americans, our policy of searching is done. A new policy of swift and sure and severe retaliation against the Nation of Terrorism will be in immediate effect after you in the Congress make such a formal declaration. Let that declaration be a warning, the only warning to be given, that the citizens of the United States are to be secure against violence on their person wherever they travel throughout the world.
"Thank you and goodnight."<P>

 INDEPENDENCE DAY</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><B>By Charles R. Kesler</B></P>

As the Fourth of July approaches, Americans can look forward once again to the rockets' red glare and bombs bursting in air, not to mention some tasty burgers and hotdogs. But the nation's 220th birthday is also an occasion to look back on the changes in American politics since the glory days of the Revolution.<P>
Americans still believe, as the Declaration of Independence proclaimed, that the purpose of government is "to secure these rights," but our understanding of what those rights are has shifted so dramatically that we may speak of two distinct eras in our politics--the era of natural rights and the era of entitlement rights.<P>
In 1776, America claimed its independence on the basis of certain "unalienable rights." Jefferson elsewhere called these "natural rights" or "the rights of man," meaning that human beings received them from nature--or from "nature's God"--and that they were prior to government and even to society. <P>
As Jefferson put it in his last letter, written shortly before July 4, 1826, the Declaration meant to show that "the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God." On the contrary, all men were created equal, and their Creator intended that this equality of rights be respected by all merely human governments.<P>
Government's job was to secure our rights for us better than we could on our own. The Founding Fathers disagreed among themselves as to how extensive the resulting governmental powers had to be, but these were disagreements about means, not ends. However great the national government's powers needed  to be, no one doubted that its proper purposes were limited to a few great objects.<P>
Alexander Hamilton specified them as "commerce, finance, negotiation, and war," though to his mind they also comprehended "implied powers" sufficient to allow for a national bank, the encouragement of manufactures, and related "internal improvements." 
Jefferson's list was even shorter. In his First Inaugural Address, after enumerating the blessings that made the Americans "a happy and prosperous people," he drew attention to "one thing more" that was "the sum of good government" and would "close the circle of our felicities"; namely, "a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned."<P>
Today, however, most of American politics revolves around new kinds of rights, which in turn have called into being new purposes and institutions of government. The Constitution of 1787 is still with us, of course, but it has been overlaid by what Franklin D. Roosevelt once called "an economic constitutional order" based on a new "economic Bill of Rights." These rights are familiar to us as welfare rights or "entitlements," and include everything from Social Security and unemployment benefits to Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, and even certain kinks of affirmative action programs.<P>
These new rights are the very opposite of natural rights, insofar as natural rights precede--and therefore limit--all just government. The new social and economic rights flow <I>from</I> government. They are promises made by the government to the citizenry or to particular classes of citizens, designed generally to remedy their neediness or to satisfy their material wants. <P>
At the heart of today's social and economic rights is the notion that human dignity demands that society, acting through government, supply the defects of human nature. Rather than obeying or acting responsibly towards nature, as the Founders urged, the new rights attempt to overcome it. Health care, nutrition care, jobs, unemployment insurance, and old age benefits are not gifts of nature in the sense that, say, life and liberty are; we have no natural right to them, and hence Jefferson did not consider it the task of government to try to secure them for us. That was up to our own "industry and improvement," as he said.<P>
Of course, Jefferson would have agreed that jobs and proper health care are good things; he would have denied only that they were <I>rights</I>. For if they were rights, then it must be the duty of one's fellow citizens to supply them-and in principle, to remedy all the needs and wants of human nature. Since human desires are infinite, however, this would be a prescription for endless obligation, for a comprehensive servitude that would swallow up all freedom and individual responsibility. <P>
	This problem was apparent to the champions of the new kinds of rights. But statesmen like Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt argued that social and economic rights were necessary to relieve a new form of oppression that had emerged in American society after the Civil War and Reconstruction. The new oppressors were the large corporations and trusts that concentrated unprecedented wealth and political power in the hands of a few. <P>
Under these unprecedented conditions, the government had to intervene in order to restore economic opportunity for the little guy and to protect the working man's right to the fruits of his own labor. This economic analysis was dubious; and even if true, did not necessarily point to a revolution in the functions of government. But Wilson and Roosevelt insisted that new kinds of rights had to be added to the old forms of civil and natural rights--in order to protect American individualism from a threat the Founding Fathers could not have foreseen.<P>
In a crucial respect, however, the addition of social and economic rights did more than just pragmatically solve a novel problem: it promised to lift the nation to a higher moral plane. Wilson called this "the new freedom," meaning that it was not only different from the old but better, because it was supposedly less selfish. The bureaucrats who would be in charge of distributing benefits and opportunities to the people were supposed to be the least selfish of all, and their sense of disinterested moral superiority eventually set the tone of the era of entitlements: the condescension of governmental elites to the people they were presumably serving.<P>
Because they were "progressive" (not natural and unchangeable), the new rights could be implemented gradually and adapted constantly to the nation's changing economic and social conditions. The "economic constitutional order" was not implemented all at once, as in a political founding, but in stages, beginning modestly in the Progressive Era and accelerating in the New Deal and Great Society periods. <P>
Although presented as incremental reforms, the new agencies and departments created to carry out the new agenda were soon acknowledged to be so distinctive, so different in kind from the legislative, executive, and judicial functions of traditional American government, that they acquired a new name. Thus today we speak of "the welfare state," as though a new state or new form of government had been added to the one established by the Constitution.<P>
The chief business of the welfare state is to secure our new rights. This task involves, among other things, the large-scale redistribution of income through federal entitlement programs. Roosevelt, who launched the first and still most successful of these entitlements, defended them as affordable and just; but today, increasingly, they seem to be neither.<P>
Roosevelt claimed, even in the midst of the Great Depression, that American capitalism was phenomenally productive, that it was capable of producing "plenty" and that the redistribution of its "surplus" (a modest and fairly painless goal) was all that the welfare state required. But nowadays, the cost of American government, federal and state, exceeds 40 percent of the national income; and even at that high level, the federal budget is chronically unbalanced and all of the major entitlement programs, including Social Security, face impending bankruptcy in the next century. What's more, few Americans think they are undertaxed.<P>
Still, it proves difficult to cut or constrain entitlement spending because the second of Roosevelt's justifications remains powerful. The public remains convinced of the legitimacy or fairness of at least some parts of the contemporary welfare state. Many Americans have lost their enthusiasm for non-middle class entitlements (food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, etc.), which seem routinely to trap and corrupt their recipients; but the middle class programs remain popular, largely because of their resemblance to social insurance plans. <P>
Having been forced to contribute to them all of their working lives, at higher and higher rates of taxation, most people are loath to see their future benefits reduced. Yet surely the original proponents of the new rights would be chagrined to see their handiwork defended mainly on such self-interested grounds. And the rest of us should wonder whether the welfare state's corruptions have really been confined to the so-called underclass.<P>
In his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton proclaimed that "the era of big government is over." Neither he nor anyone else, however, knows what comes after it. Are Americans prepared to return to limited government? Is America on the verge of a revival of natural rights? On this Fourth of July, we need at least to begin to think through this possibility, if we are to make intelligent choices in the difficult years ahead.<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>THE CONSERVATISM OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</B></FONT><BR><B> By Thomas G. West</B></P>

The problem in America today is not that we have too much equality, too many rights, or too much democracy, as some critics say. The problem is that we are well along in a process of <I>abandoning</I> equality properly understood, and liberty and rights properly understood. On this 220th anniversary of America's independence, it is worth considering how those principles have been abandoned, and what can be done to restore them to their rightful and preeminent authority in our public life. <P>
America's freedoms have eroded, her families are disintegrating, and her women and children are subjected to levels of rape, exploitation, neglect, and abuse that America's Founders would never have tolerated. We can trace these problems to the abandonment of the principles of the Declaration of Independence by our elites, and increasingly by the people themselves.<P>

The Declaration of Independence states the founding principles in this way: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<P>

In many conservatives today these words arouse contradictory feelings. On the one hand, they admire the Founding Fathers and therefore respect the Declaration. On the other hand, they fear that the problem in America today is too much equality, too many rights, and too much democracy. Liberals, after all, are always talking about how much <I>they</I> care about the rights of women and the poor, how we need more equality, how we must take power out of the elites and put it into the hands of the oppressed.<P>

Our liberties are contracting, not expanding. Anyone in the business world knows this is true of property rights. What is not as well known is that free speech, freedom of religion, and many other freedoms have also been substantially reduced in the twentieth century, especially in the past 25 years.<P>

For example, the Founders regarded enabling the public to make an informed decision about candidates in elections as the most important purpose of free speech. In 1971, for the first time in American history, government began to take this right away from a large class of Americans--those who cooperate or consult with candidates for public office. Such people are permitted to spend no more than $1,000 explaining to the public why their friends deserve to be elected. This campaign finance act was passed in order to limit the influence of the wealthy in elections. The idea behind the law was that since poor people can't afford to publish their views, rich people should be severely limited in what they can publish.<P>

What would the Founders have thought of a law punishing people for publishing their views on an election contest? This is what the Revolution was all about: government would not be permitted to say who would be permitted to publish and who would be forbidden. That had been the law in Old England. Such laws violate the right to liberty, and they are anti-democratic. John Adams wrote, "If the press is to be stopped and the people kept in ignorance, we had much better have the first magistrate and senators hereditary."<P>

The result of campaign finance laws is to "stop the press"--to cut down on public information about candidates who are not favored by the established media, the major networks and the leading daily newspapers. What candidates lose out under our campaign finance laws? Those who challenge the status quo, who oppose big government--in many cases, conservatives.<P>

No surprise, then, that government by the people has to a significant extent been replaced over the past century, especially in the past 30 years, with government by so-called experts far removed from responsibility to the electorate. Democracy is not gone, but it is much further eroded than most people are aware.<P>

This has happened in two ways. First, power has been taken out of the hands of private citizens and local communities, and shifted to more centralized and more remote bodies, such as state and national governments. Second, within these governments, power has been increasingly shifted away from elected officials (the president, governors, legislators) to unelected officials (bureaucrats, agents, and judges).<P>

Consider the rise of wetlands regulation. As it happens, government got the authority to regulate wetlands without passing any law. The relevant portion of the Clean Water Act simply requires permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into the navigable waters" of the United States. Obviously, a swamp, a pothole, or a bog is not "navigable." Yet federal agencies, working in tandem with federal courts, have claimed, with a straight face, that "navigable waters" include all the "wetlands" in the U.S. This now includes, according to one set of federal regulations, land that has standing water on it for as few as 14 days a year.<P>

Wetlands regulation is but one example of how policy is often formed by officials--courts and agencies--far removed from the people. This policy process defies not only the Founders' principle of private and local control, but also the Constitution's requirement that we be governed only by laws to which our elected representatives give their consent. It also illustrates the government's contempt for the property rights of owners, who in some cases have been imprisoned for cleaning up, or building on, land they own.<P>

So much for our rights, and government by consent.<P>

Finally, our liberties are contracting because for several decades government has been in the business of undermining the conditions of freedom--namely, morality, family, and faith.<P>

The Founders believed that although freedom is every man and woman's birthright, a self-governing community that secures freedom is rare. In order for men to be able to govern themselves and not abuse their freedom, they need to have the habits and convictions that enable them to behave responsibly. <P>

James Madison once wrote, with his typical tough-mindedness, that if men do not have sufficient self-restraint, "Nothing less than the chains of despotism can keep them from destroying and devouring one another." But where do these moral virtues of moderation and justice come from? <P>

The Founders' answer: from knowledge of the rights of mankind, but above all from religion, which teaches us to restrain our passions and to respect the rights of others. Thomas Jefferson(the Founder most outspoken in his doubts about traditional Christianity-- was sensible enough to write in his <I>Notes on Virginia</I> that the liberties of a people will no longer be secure if they cease believing that their liberty is the gift of God.<P>

The government today is anti-religious in a whole host of ways. When the Supreme Court discusses religion, it uses words like "coercive," "divisive," "danger," and "irrational." In the name of the Bill of Rights, the Court has banned religion from public schools. Yet it is worth noting that the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights in 1789 also passed a law encouraging the teaching of religion in public schools in the Northwest Territories--the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.<P>

This hostility toward religion raises an intriguing question: If we refuse to acknowledge that foundation of our principles in "the laws of nature and of nature's God," what do our principles rest on? If liberty is not the gift of <I>God</I>, it must be the gift of <I>government</I>. But what government gives, government may take away. As Jefferson said, without God, liberty will not last.<P>

The government's hostility to morality and religion has had a profound effect on the family. Today, even liberals see that family breakdown is a problem. It is the direct or indirect cause of the vast majority of violent crime, child abuse, battering and exploitation of women, and much more.<P>

When the federal government changed its policy on welfare in the 1960s, it in effect began to subsidize divorce and single motherhood. Government's generosity made it possible, for the first time in American history, for large numbers of irresponsible women to get no-fault food, housing, cash, medical care, job training, higher education, and more. The new welfare policies made many males among the working poor a bad bargain for quite a few women who would have married them--and stayed married to them--before the 1960s.
At the same time that government has undermined the family by its perverse economic incentives, it has promoted the separation of sex from love and marriage. From sex education to easy abortion, from pregnant unmarried cheerleaders to homosexual rights, from no-fault divorce to free condoms--government sends young men and women the same message: just do it! <P>

Forgotten is the older view: that sex is part of the plan of God and nature for your life; that its noblest use is for the generation of children who will grow up under the daily harmonious guidance of a loving mother and father; that it is a fine thing to send children out into the world, so that they too can have the opportunity to engage in the pursuit of happiness and to polish and perfect their souls, just as the best of their forebears have done from time immemorial.<P>

The problems afflicting the health of the nation are vast indeed. It is easy to want to throw up one's hands in surrender. But Americans must devote themselves to the recovery of the healthy core of the older American tradition. On this Independence day, let us put our shoulders to the wheel, each of us doing what he can in the common enterprise of restoring "one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>REMEDIES FOR UC UNDERREPRESENTATION: RESIGNATIONS
</FONT></B>

</CENTER>

<P>

"Affirmative action" is a policy in search of a purpose. Recent attacks on the California Civil Rights Initiative and changes in University of California admissions procedures have produced a smokescreen of contradictory arguments in favor of racially discriminatory policies.

<P>

When opponents aren't patronizingly attacking the motives behind non-racial policies, or blurring the distinction between stopping discrimination and perpetuating discrimination, their most common justification has been "diversity," as if racially-charged criteria somehow lead to intellectual and cultural variety. However, as a goal, "diversity" has suffered major setbacks, in our courts.

<P>

When the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals outlawed in <I>Hopwood v. University of Texas</I> different admission standards for different races at the University of Texas last March, it ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court's supposed defense of "diversity" in its famous <I>Bakke v. Regents</I> decision was not a "binding precedent" since it "is mentioned nowhere except in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion." 

<P>

The Appeals Court also noted that the Supreme Court itself had ruled last year in <I>Adarand Constructors v. Pena</I> that racial criteria must pass a "strict scrutiny" test and that "the diversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny...."

<P>

Given the problems of "diversity," affirmative action proponents have dusted off the goal of, as UC Berkeley puts it, preferring "historically under-represented" groups in admissions. Note that the focus is not even underrepresented groups, but purportedly "historically underrepresented" groups.

<P>

This hedge is necessary since the group presently "underrepresented" is white high school graduates. In a recent Claremont Institute study, Michael Lynch shows that in 1993 whites were 54 percent of Berkeley's potentially eligible applicant pool but accounted for only 32 percent of acceptances. 

<P>

Hence the focus shifts to groups alleged to have been short-changed in the past. Somehow present admissions policies are meant to compensate for alleged past discrimination. This is an awkward and perverse position. 

<P>

Let us assume for the moment that the implied allegations about the history of UC admitting policies might be true. But even if it were so, present discrimination would do nothing about it.  

<P>

People who were unfairly excluded from UC in the past receive nothing. They didn't get a UC education then, they don't have it now. People who were unfairly admitted in the past still maintain their advantage. Absolutely nothing has changed. The claimed injustice remains. No present policy affects it.  

<P>

Instead, what is offered is more discrimination, this time against high school students who were not born at the time of their group's "overrepresentation." 

<P>

In short, today's children suffer for the alleged sins of their elders while the elders continue to savor the fruits of their transgressions.

<P>

Not only does this accept supposed past iniquities, it adds new inequities. It also camouflages one possible, if unpalatable, remedy to past "under-representation."

<P>

After all, if it is true that people in the past benefited from unfair admissions, then these people are still around in banks, foundations, the media, government bureaucracies--and universities.

<P>

One place they surely are is among the faculty and administration of the University of California itself. The University administration and teaching faculty must be teeming with people who gained their present positions through a historical process which "affirmative action" proponents now denounce. 
 
<P>

Even apart from biased student admissions, these people presumably have also benefited unfairly from a process of faculty hiring in which minorities were "underrepresented." Yet most University administrators and, according to reports, most faculty are committed "affirmative action" proponents. 

<P>

The solution to this problem seems to be fairly straightforward. A large proportion of the present UC faculty--let us call them white liberals--should resign. They are, if academic proponents of "affirmative action" are to be believed, unfairly advantaged and putatively less qualified than others.

<P>

The UC faculty probably does not wish to pursue this course. This is not surprising, and is perhaps understandable. But what the proponents of racially weighted policies among them at least could do is stop pretending that sacrificing today's teenagers will somehow atone for their own historically-acquired advantages.

<P>

In truth, the argument for remedying "historical under-representation" is incoherent. Most Americans know this. And, unless we see a large number of resignations from the University of California, we can conclude that their affirmative action advocates know it, too. Otherwise, they would be hypocrites. But that surely couldn't be true, could it?

<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE TERMINAL SILLINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT'S <I>ROMER</I> DECISION</font></b>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Ben Boychuk</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

In a 6-3 decision, the United States Supreme Court recently lit the fuse on one of the most contentious issues in America. The Court struck down an amendment to Colorado's constitution which said that homosexuals could not be given special rights. Under Amendment 2, gays and lesbians could not claim favorable status with the courts. They had the same rights as every citizen in the Rocky Mountain state. But they would not be able to use their sexuality for "minority status, quota preferences, protected status, or claim[s] of discrimination."

<P>

In the Court's opinion, minorities are only "equal" when they are separate but special. <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a unique reading of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It's not just wrong, it's dangerous.

<P>

The Court's convoluted argument, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, confuses special preference for equality under the law, and mistakes sanction for tolerance. It is a clumsy act of political cowardice, shrouded in the majesty of law. 

<P>

"It is a fair...inference from the broad language of the amendment," Kennedy writes, to say "that it deprives gays and lesbians even of the protection of general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings." He concludes, "This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws." 

<P>

Justice Antonin Scalia in his dissent characterizes this line of reasoning as "terminal silliness."  The Court, he writes, is arguing that "one who is accorded equal treatment under the laws, but cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws, has been denied equal protection of the laws." This is laughable, were it not so destructive. 

<P>

This decision is not an enlightened example of the court passing solid legal judgment. Rather, it is a symptom of America's overflowing, hubristic "rights talk," which can transform any misfortune or misconduct into an obligation for others to pay. 

<P>

This real issue at work in the Romer decision is not legal, but political. The people of Colorado were merely trying to prevent their children from being taught that homosexuality is deserving of special status under the law. Homosexuality may be legal in Colorado, but that makes it no less of a vice. 

<P>

With Amendment 2, Colorado's voters used the ballot to send the message that sex should be understood in its relation to bearing and raising children, the business of the family. But the Court in Romer disregards the long-cherished right of the people to enact religious and moral sentiment into law through the democratic process. 

<P>

Law is the expression of moral principles. We discriminate against incest and polygamy and drug-dealing because we believe these activities are a threat to society. We do not grant white, male heterosexuals3/4nor should we grant anyone else--special rights because we believe that this would threaten equality. Indeed, the Court makes a mockery of political self-determination. By striking down Amendment 2, the Court struck down a legitimate attempt by citizens to limit the unchecked granting of special rights.

<P>

Homosexuals in Colorado retained all of the rights guaranteed them under the state and federal bills of rights. The measure did not deprive them of the right to vote or to own property, nor did it strip away their protection from unreasonable searches and seizures or discrimination at the workplace.

<P>

As Scalia points out, Amendment 2 had no effect on a number of Colorado's laws, including the one governing pensions paid to retiring state employees. Homosexuals and heterosexuals alike are entitled to that benefit. The amendment would have simply prevented the state from making death-benefit payments to the "life partner" of a homosexual. The reasoning simply extends the logic that the state doesn't make such payments to the long-time roommate of a heterosexual employee. Nor would Amendment 2 have prevented assaults on homosexuals from being prosecuted, as the measure's opponents shamelessly argued. 

<P>

In essense, all Amendment 2 did--and this is what the Court didn't like but didn't have the temerity to say--was bar affirmative action for homosexuals. The Court has ruled in previous cases that homosexuality is not a "fundamental right"--states can, in fact, make homosexual acts punishible under the law. But the Court didn't overrule itself. The court stopped short of treating sexual orientation the same as race, age, or handicap. But the groundwork is there.

<P>

Activists wasted no time before playing this latest and possibly greatest legal trump in their political deck. A few days after the Court handed down its decision, an 18-year-old student in Hacienda Heights, California threatened to sue her high school after administrators refused to let her attend the senior prom with her 22-year-old lesbian lover. 

<P>

Cowed by the news of the Court's ruling, the school backed down. The girl's attorney, feminist agitator Gloria Allred, hailed the school's reversal as the first victory for homosexual rights under the Romer decision. Welcome to the gay '90s.

Hamas isn't waging a war against peace, it's waging a war against Israel. Hamas would welcome peace3/4after they have taken over Israel. All of it.<P>And from the outset, what is called the &quot;Peace Process&quot; has been a War Process. The government of Israel is resting its faith in Yasser Arafat who for most of his adult life had (and, we should safely assume, still has) the same objective as Hamas3/4to be done with Israel.<P>For decades, Arafat himself used terrorism to reach that objective, but it didn't work because Israel retaliated for every attack of the PLO with swiftness and severity. Does any reasonable person believe that Arafat has changed his ultimate objective rather than simply changing his transitory tactics?<P>Hamas wants peace to come about by terrorism while Arafat sees a smoother way3/4the gradual takeover of sections of Israel, under the short-range disguise of &quot;Land for Peace.&quot; That phrase should be recognized for what it is: a threat that land will be attempted to be seized by war if it isn't given away by peace. Why else would such a phrase have ever become part of the Mideast vocabulary?<P>But should any amount of land be granted under a threat? Would you give one room of your residence to an armed gang if it said it would give you peace in exchange? If Israel continues to give land for peace, it will have neither land nor peace.<P>But assume for a naïve moment that Arafat has changed; that he truly wants no territory beyond Gaza, Samaria, and Judea. Then can he bring peace? At best, he only has control of the fatah faction of the PLO and apparantly has no control of Hamas' military wing, Izzadin el-Quazzi. We should have little doubt that Arafat sincerely wants the Hamas terrorist attacks to stop, but we should have grave doubt as to his reasons why. Hamas terrorism undermines Arafat's power and his own course of action in the slower, but more certain, dismemberment of Israel.<P>If Israeli policy remains as it is, &quot;Land for War&quot; will be the unintentional outcome for Israel.<P>What should Israel do? Other than severe retaliations against Hamas for each attack, it must undo what can legally be undone in the process it signed in Oslo and on the South Lawn of the White House. Secondly, at a minimum, the Golan Heights must be kept under Israel's total control rather than negotiating any of its control to Syria. There is already a striking territorial resemblance between the area's maps of pre-June 1967, and scheduled maps of 1997. And all of that is being done in the name of peace, which in 1967 was a guarantee of war.<P>All of those decisions are, of course, Israel's to make. The question is what should the United States do?<P>On Sunday, February 25, two young Americans, both in their 20s, were killed by Hamas terrorists. Those Americans were doing nothing more provocative than riding in a bus in Jerusalem. <P>It isn't that Americans have already forgotten the names of Sarah Duker and Matt Eisenfeld. We never learned them. Hardly a word has been said by President Clinton about the murder of those American citizens. <P>We should have retaliated immediately. We know, with precision, the location of the headquarters, safe-houses, and training centers of Hamas' military wing. It is true that in such retaliation we may not kill or capture the individuals responsible for that particular attack--but that shouldn't be the vital goal any more than it is a vital goal to find the grenade-thrower on a conventional battlefield. Retaliation is done against the enemy as a whole.<P>Beyond retaliation, we should encourage Israel to take all the necessary steps needed for its survival. And celebrate the victory of Benjamin Netanyahu.<P>That support and celebration would come naturally if President Clinton would recognize that a person or a nation can only make peace with those who want the same objectives. If those objectives are not compatible and one side strives to make peace alone, the achievement will be the peace of the grave. Too bad, but that's just the way it is.<P>It may well be that Israel, with President Clinton's encouragement, has already gone so far that it will continue to give away land as though that will bring peace, and our government will continue to influence Israel in that direction, saying that &quot;the Peace Process must continue.&quot;<P>I'm not a man who frequently quotes Shakespeare, but one phrase of his is particularly appropriate when land for peace becomes a policy--&quot;what fools these mortals be. &quot;<P>______________________________________________<P><I>Bruce Herschensohn is a Distinguished Fellow with The Claremont Institute</I><P><B> (c) The Claremont Institute	          May 24, 1996</B></td></tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>ANNIVERSARIES FOR DISSENTERS: 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PLESSY V. FERGUSON
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Ken Masugi</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

On May 18, we mark the 100th anniversary of <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I>, the infamous Supreme Court decision which enfeebled the post-Civil War Amendments designed to give freed slaves the rights and duties of American citizenship. The <I>Plessy</I> case marked the formal beginning of an era of legalized discrimination on the basis of race--an era in which we are mired still today.

<P>

The Supreme Court held in <I>Plessy</I> that it was perfectly reasonable for a state to racially segregate persons within its jurisdiction. The Court razed all but the most modest constitutional barriers to racist behavior by state and local governments. By making the astounding assertion that black Americans should not take offense at state segregation laws, the Court weakened the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement of &quot;equal protection of the laws. &quot; 

<P>

One hundred years ago, the American conscience was unburdened of any constitutional need to fight the degradation of segregation, and its separate but unequal treatment of black Americans.

<P>

Fifty years ago, baseball great Jackie Robinson's broke through the farce of a facade of segregation. An individual effort of excellence, encouraged by private business, shamed Americans into demolition of irrational discriminatory practices. 

<P>

It would be nice to report a happier ending: racial segregation dead and Jackie Robinson triumphant. But that would be too na&iuml;ve a gloss.

<P>

In 1954, just a few years after Robinson earned Rookie-of-the-Year honors for the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Supreme Court declared in <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> that segregation laws violated the Constitution. Yet this opinion did not truly challenge the bad principle of the <I>Plessy</I> case. The <I>Brown</I> opinion rested its conclusions on highly dubious psychological testing evidence--segregation made blacks feel bad and therefore become inferior--and not principles of constitutionalism and human dignity.

<P>

Thus the reasonableness standard of <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I> remains the law of the land: It is still constitutional for government to legislate upon the basis of race, as the vitality and range of racial preference programs, set-asides, and quotas throughout the land reflects. The century-old legacy of <I>Plessy</I> lives on, dividing Americans in as irrational ways as the segregation of baseball did 50 years ago. 

<P>

The fact remains, we have yet to embrace the famous &quot;color-blind Constitution&quot; standard defended by the sole dissenting justice in the <I>Plessy</I> case, John Marshall Harlan. To quote briefly from his thundering dissent:

<P>

<blockquote>
&quot;[I]n the eye of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant ruling class of citizens.  There is no caste here.  Our constitution is color-blind....In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved...&quot;
</blockquote>

<P>

Harlan was not being utopian. He argued that the equality of rights implicit in the rule of law can be a means of making us flawed creatures more reasonable, more civilized. But such rights can be beneficial only to the extent that they are exercised in a color-blind way, that is, devoid of the passion of racial preference.

<P>

Consider the example of abolitionist orator Frederick Douglass, America's greatest black thinker, who died just a few years before Harlan's declaration of principle. Douglass urged all Americans to renounce racial pride and taught the central significance of character for citizenship. &quot;The only excuse for pride in individuals or races is in the fact of their own achievement,&quot; he declared in 1889. To cultivate racial pride is &quot;a positive evil, &quot; Douglass said. &quot;It is building on a false foundation.&quot; 

<P>

As we continue to struggle with the flawed policies of racial preference, we need to benefit from the wisdom of dissenters of a century ago. It's hard to fathom that an equal period of time separates Jackie Robinson--that 20th Century embodiment of the lessons of Frederick Douglass--from the <I>Plessy</I> case and from Americans today. We still need to learn the lessons of Jackie Robinson and call forth and repeat that heroism in both high and modest circumstances today.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY: FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW BEST
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Thomas G. West</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

Until the 1960s, the principle of religious liberty was thought to require the separation of church and state, but not the separation of religion from politics. The American tradition was full of examples of government-sponsored prayers, religious music, and religious instruction.

<P>

The Supreme Court has declared quite a few of the older practices unconstitutional. Liberals attack these traditions as relics of an earlier era of religious bigotry. Conservatives have resisted the expulsion of religion from public life, but they don't quite know how to explain or defend the older approach.

<P>

The problem with the conservative defense is that it is based on a notion of religious liberty that is totally opposed to the American Founders. In today's view, largely accepted by liberals and conservatives alike, a forbidden "establishment of religion" exists whenever government supports or promotes a particular teaching on God.

<P>

The strangeness of today's approach, from the earlier standpoint, can be seen most vividly by this fact: by today's logic, it is unconstitutional to teach the Declaration of Independence in public school.

<P>

The Declaration contains four distinct references to God: he is the author of the "laws of God"; the "Creator" who "endowed" us with our inalienable rights; "the Supreme Judge of the world"; and "Divine Providence." 

<P>

The Supreme Court has ruled that government may not teach or practice religion. It may not exert "subtle coercive pressure" on students by prayers or religious instruction.  If the Declaration were taught in a public school as the truth, the teacher would "teach religion." She would be exercising "subtle coercive pressure" on students. She would be promoting an establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment.

<P>

But this is absurd. Or are we really willing to say that our principles, announced in the Declaration at the moment of the nation's founding, forbid the public teaching of the source of our principles? Without an eternal foundation in God and nature, our rights become the arbitrary gift of government. And what government gives, government may take away.

<P>

Of course, teaching the Declaration has not been declared unconstitutional. But that is only because the Court has been unwilling to admit the full consequences of its view of  establishment. To avoid the public outrage that would follow if the Declaration were banned from the classroom, the Court falsely asserts that the document is not really religious. "Reciting official documents such as the Declaration of Independence which contain references to the Deity" bears "no true resemblance" to school prayer, says the Court. Such exercises, Justice William Brennan explains, "no longer have a religious purpose or meaning."

<P>

In other words, the Court will allow the theology of the Declaration to be taught in the classroom as long as it is understood that it belongs to a past that is dead and gone, that it has nothing to do with the world that we live in here and now, that it is not a living faith that holds God to be the source of our rights, the author of the laws of nature, and the protector and Supreme Judge of America.

<P>

The prevailing, incorrect view of religious liberty leads liberals to demand the elimination of the few remaining remnants of traditional morality and religious expression from public life. The limitation of marriage to a man and a woman, the lingering presence of Christmas holidays and songs in public schools, taxpayer support of legislative and military chaplains--all these holdovers of the repressive traditions of the past must go.

<P>

Conservatives, holding the same view of religious liberty, cannot defend themselves from these assaults. "Neutrality" between religion and irreligion necessarily results in a "naked public square." 

<P>

Liberals need to learn that although the right to free exercise of religion is indeed sacred, it is both appropriate and necessary for government to support sound religious convictions in a nation that means to remain free. They need to recover the Founders  understanding that a public life which allows no place for religious expression is not fit for human habitation. 

<P>

Conservatives need to learn not to be shy about their desire for public acknowledgment of the importance of God in our lives as long as every individual is protected in his natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and reason.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>THE GREAT UC BERKELEY ADMISSIONS WHITEWASH
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Michael Lynch</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

On March 21, two days after the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found the University of Texas Law School guilty of race discrimination, the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released the results of its seven-year investigation into the undergraduate admissions process at University of California at Berkeley (UCB). In its 15-page Letter of Finding (LOF), the OCR concluded, among other things, that "UCB does not maintain illegal quotas for Black Hispanic or Filipino applicants" and that the "admissions process, in place for students admitted in 1993, is lawful under Title VI" of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 

<P>

Proponents of racial preferences proclaimed the OCR's finding a vindication of UCB's affirmative action programs. Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel, a chief architect of UCB's admissions process, called <I>Hopwood v. Texas</I> "profoundly radical" and the OCR finding "a model of prudence" in a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> op-ed. Karabel concluded, "At stake is nothing less than the future of the American dream3/4that the United States should be the land of opportunity for all of its citizens."

<P>

Karabel has the first two issues inverted. His conclusion is right for the wrong reason. 

<P>

Some things simply can't be improved on with age. Among these is the Declaration of Independence's cogent statement of the American dream, rooted in this country's founding creed of human equality under the law: "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." 

<P>

It was this creed that Lincoln called the "standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all: constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and the value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere."

<P>

Lincoln's conception of equality is driving the current effort to abolish preferential policies.

<P>

Recognizing that race cannot benefit some applicants without hindering other applicants, the Court ruling in Hopwood rejected that race could be used in a non-discriminatory manner. "Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection," the court ruled.

<P>

In contrast, the OCR based its decision on the diversity standard set forth in Justice Lewis Powell's decision in the infamous Bakke decision. Under this standard, race and ethnicity can be considered so as to add to the educational diversity of the institution. As a result, it is erroneous to conclude from the OCR vindication of UCB that race is not a critically important factor in its admissions process. 

<P>

The OCR's own report shows that for most applicants, race is the most important factor, outside of grades and test scores. UCB judges applicants by radically different standards depending on their race and ethnicity. These different standards, according to the OCR's report, included:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
Wealthy African American, American Indian, and Chicano students who were California residents were automatically admitted in three academic achievement categories in which other California residents were automatically rejected, without even a file review.
<p>
Although UCB costs California's general fund more than $8,000 per student, wealthy, non-resident minorities were granted preferences over California residents who were not members of the right ethnic group. 
<P>
Wealthy, non-resident American Indian, African American and Chicano applicants were automatically accepted in two academic achievement categories in which other California residents were automatically rejected without even a file review.
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> 
UCB's admissions process produces entering classes in which the only underrepresented students are white. This is perhaps why the school now targets "historically underrepresented" groups. The broader point is that by utilizing a race code, public officials are playing with dynamite in a state in which taxpayers can trace their roots back to 150 countries. 

<P>

Writing in a time in which race in America was primarily conceived as a Black/White issue, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, "the destinies of the two races, in this country, are indissolubly linked together and the interests of both requite that the common government of all shall not permit the seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law." It was also Justice Harlan who wrote "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." This is a proposition to which we should all rededicate ourselves.

<TITLE>MRS. CLINTON'S VILLAGE</TITLE>

<CENTER>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>MRS. CLINTON'S VILLAGE</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Michael Warder</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps Hillary Clinton is right. Maybe it does take
a village to raise a child as she says in her new book by the
same name. On the other hand, it would take a village idiot to
regard this book as anything other than a 1996 presidential campaign
prop.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this widely publicized lite volume, not only does
Mrs. Clinton offer a series of Kodak moments in the life of the
Clinton family, she also sells hard the philosophy, programs,
and personnel of the Clinton administration. As if that is not
enough, Mrs. Clinton weighs in against &quot;the resurgence of
anti-government extremism&quot; in America and those who &quot;advance
narrow religious, political, and economic agendas.&quot; One gets
the impression that Mrs. Clinton is referring to the current crop
of Republican presidential candidates. Their &quot;narrow agendas&quot;
include, among other things, introducing a flat tax, raising the
exemption level for children, turning power back to the states,
closing several major departments of the federal government, and
returning prayer to schools.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I have not yet seen a news story raising the question
of whether or not this book, published by Simon &amp; Schuster,
is really a soft contribution to the Clinton reelection campaign.
The book is little more than a lengthy propaganda tract recounting
the glorious government programs pushed through over the last
three years of the administration. When Mrs. Clinton writes of
the problem of poor nutrition for many children, she surely intends
no harm to the re-election effort when she offers that &quot;the
village [read: government] can help. The U.S. Department of Agriculture,
which oversees school lunch and breakfast programs, has started
Team Nutrition...&quot; She adds that &quot;the President's Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports is working hard to convince schools&quot;
about the wisdom of physical development. She then informs us
that, &quot;I can't understand the political opposition to programs
like midnight basketball and other recreational activities.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps I can help Mrs. Clinton understand, as one
member of the village to another. Many citizens who live near
community centers with gymnasiums do not like platoons of unemployed,
troubled youths walking and driving around their neighborhoods
after midnight. These citizens also wonder how these young men
manage getting up the next morning to look for a job after playing
basketball all night? They wonder why their federal tax dollars
go to fund these programs when they have to work hard to save
so they can make ends meet? Finally, they wonder if midnight basketball
is such a great thing, why couldn't their community fund it locally?
After all, local programs are always much more effective and efficient
than some federal program parachuted into the neighborhood from
Washington at about 25 cents worth of program for each dollar
of taxes. Besides, in Kenosha, Wisconsin they probably would want
midnight bowling. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It should come as no surprise, but the philosophy
of government espoused by Mrs. Clinton in her book is identical
to that of President Clinton in his recent State of the Union
address. His first of seven challenges that America faces &quot;is
to cherish our children and strengthen the American family.&quot;
Like Mrs. Clinton, the President sees a direct link between the
federal government and the love and care of all American children.
But the federal government is ill-suited to assume assume that
responsibility. That most intimate of duties resides in the family,
a father and a mother joined in marriage with children. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If a father and mother do not fulfill that role,
it is the children of that family that suffer the most and no
federal program can effectively step into the breach. Grandparents
and close relatives are by nature the next in line of responsibility.
When President Clinton challenges Congress to pass a &quot;bipartisan
welfare reform bill&quot; and &quot;do right by our children,&quot;
he puts the federal government in the position of surrogate parent
for children.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a true village, where life-long relations abound,
relatives are nearby, and people work and spend their leisure
time together, a couple would adopt an abandoned child. However,
America, a nation of 260 million people, is not a village and
the federal government is not a town meeting. When our nation
was founded more than 200 years ago, it was much smaller than
today. Yet it was unimaginable to our Founders to conceive that
the purpose of our newly established government was to &quot;support
families at work and at home, and to build communities that fulfill
their obligations to families&quot; as asserted by Mrs. Clinton.
Union, justice, domestic tranquility, the common defense, and
the blessings of liberty was their more limited intent. Perhaps
in Mrs. Clinton's village, the Founders were just another unenlightened
group of &quot;anti-government extremists.&quot;</FONT>

<TITLE>BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP:  DOES THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRE IT FOR CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL ALIENS

</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Edward J. Erler</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
The Federal Government currently grants automatic citizenship
to children of illegal aliens born in the United States. This
practice is frequently abused. In Los Angeles County Hospitals,
for example, nearly two-thirds of births are now to women who
have entered the U.S. illegally.
<P>
Congress is considering a law that would deny citizenship to American-born
children of illegal immigrants. Patrisia Gonzales and Roberto
Rodriguez published a frantic and intemperate attack on that proposal
in the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, the<I> Houston Chronicle</I>,
and other newspapers. They called it &quot;xenophobic extremism&quot;
and suggested that it was somehow reminiscent of &quot;Nazism&quot;
to refuse citizenship to any person born on American soil.
<P>
Gonzales and Rodriguez write-with remarkable ignorance of the
historical record-that if Congress succeeds in its attempts to
deny birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens,
&quot;for the first time since slavery, children born in the United
States will be denied the right to citizenship.&quot; They mistakenly
assume that birthright citizenship is a right of all who happen
to be born within the geographical limits of the United States.
The fourteenth amendment states that &quot;all persons born in
the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
citizens.&quot; 
<P>
But as the framers of the amendment made clear, not all persons
in the United States are subject to its jurisdiction. Senator
Jacob Howard, the author of the citizenship clause, noted that
it &quot;will not, of course, include persons born in the United
States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families
of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&quot;
<P>
Is it reasonable to think that those who actively defy the laws
of the United States by illegal entry should have a constitutional
right to confer the boon of citizenship upon their children? It
is significant that the Supreme Court has never held that such
a right exists.
<P>
During the debate over passage of the fourteenth amendment, Indians
and blacks were the only substantial groups of non-citizens living
in America. The amendment conferred citizenship on blacks, who
were obviously not &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot; of
any other country. 
<P>
But it was widely agreed that the amendment would not confer citizenship
on Indians since they owed political allegiance to their tribes
and not to the United States. The Senate Judiciary Committee in
1870 reported that &quot;those who framed the fourteenth amendment
. . . understood that the Indian tribes were not made citizens,
but were excluded by the restricting phrase, 'and subject to the
jurisdiction,' and that such has been the universal understanding.&quot;
Indians were obviously born within the geographical limits of
the United States, and many were born outside of reservations.
Rodriguez and Gonzales ask us to believe that the fourteenth amendment
extends to the children of illegal aliens what it did not extend
to Native Americans!
<P>
In 1924 Congress extended the privilege of citizenship to all
Native Americans. The Supreme Court, however, has emphatically
ruled that becoming a citizen of the United States cannot be a
unilateral or self-selected act. As the Court rightly noted, the
jurisdiction requirement of the fourteenth amendment embodies
&quot;the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation
without its consent.&quot; In addition, once an individual consents
to subject himself to the jurisdiction of the United States, he
cannot be removed from that jurisdiction without his consent.
Thus the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment is based
on reciprocal consent-consent of the individual as well as that
of the nation.
<P>
As a result of hearings held in the House last December, key members
of Congress have rediscovered the fact that those &quot;subject
to the jurisdiction&quot; of the United States can be clarified
by legislation. Congress, through its power to enforce the fourteenth
amendment, can simply declare that the children of illegal aliens
are not within the jurisdiction of the United States and that
the citizenship of children follows that of their parents.
<P>
Congressional enactments specify the terms by which immigrants
are allowed into the country and the terms upon which citizenship
can be achieved. There can be reasonable disagreements about whether
immigration policies should be more or less generous in the numbers
admitted and the precise pre-conditions for citizenship. But who
can deny that it is a necessary attribute of a nation's sovereignty
to determine who are and are not citizens? 
<P>
Contrary to what Rodriguez and Gonzales would have us believe,
the denial of birth right citizenship to the children of illegal
aliens does not punish the children for the misdeeds of their
parents because the children do not have a &quot;right&quot; to
citizenship in the first place. Could it be that Rodriguez and
Gonzales have allowed their special interest ideology to dictate
historically inaccurate and unsound constitutional arguments?

The Claremont Institute sponsored a survey of California voters in 1995 to 
ascertain the extent and character of public understanding of affirmative 
action, preferences, quotas, and the principle of equality under law.  We are 
attempting to put the entire document up on this web site.  So far, the

<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
THE DEBATE OVER RACE AND gender-based quotas and preferences in
California law often assumes a clinical tone as lawyers, political
scientists, statisticians, and politicians present various sides
of the issue. Certainly all of these perspectives construct the
framework for rational discourse and provide a means by which
to weigh important concepts like fairness, equality before the
law, justice, and social welfare. But such a structure falls short
of offering a full understanding of the impact these race-based
preferences have on society at large. 
<P>
This debate, the unfortunate outgrowth of affirmative action policies,
cannot be reduced to mere statistics over who was excluded or
included because of these policies, or to narrow points of legal
interpretation. Far more accurately, the impact of quotas and
preferences is an indelible, often life-jarring experience in
the life of an aspiring, promising and innocent young person,
and it is their experience that must be explained for the issue
to be fully understood. 
<P>
The reason is simple. Almost never does the student come face
to face with the ostensibly well-meaning government bureaucrat,
responsible for enforcing affirmative action policies, who denied
his admission. Almost never does the aspiring fireman meet the
enforcement officer who decides that whites will be barred from
applying for new openings because of their race. And almost never
do we, as citizens, meet the people who are courageous enough
to stand up to the system.
<P>
The purpose of this paper is to explore a few of those lives,
and in a limited way, to understand the trauma, frustration, and
disappointment which have been deliberately, often systematically,
inflicted upon them by their own government. This is what the
debate over racial and gender programs is all about: not academic
discussions in lecture halls, but the sense of futility, injustice,
and frustration which is suffered often in silence by people whose
only offense is the color of their skin, and the policies which
are increasingly interrupting, derailing, scarring and sometimes
destroying the lives of innocent people. What do their experiences
tell about the true nature of these policies, the injury these
policies inflict, the tactics by which they are imposed, and the
damage which they do to the actual victims?
<P>
The victims of reverse discrimination studied and interviewed
here are involved in many areas of government including civil
service promotions, public contracting, university admissions
and college courses. There is no shortage of first-hand experience.
With nearly a fourth of public contracts set aside for special,
non-merit based preferences, with more than a third of university
admissions largely dependent upon the race of the applicants and
with promotions within agencies widely subject to racial quotas,
the only difficulty in focusing on individual instances is that
there are so many of them from which to choose. The following
cases offer an important insight into the tragic consequences
of affirmative action on the lives of everyday Californians.<BR>

<CENTER><I>The Story of Lydia McDonald, </I></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>Amber Preshica, and Hayley Ulrich<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
By any realistic measure of opportunity, Lydia McDonald should
not have come so far. It was the fall of 1995 and Lydia, like
thousands of other high school seniors, carefully polished her
application to one of the most prestigious schools in America:
the University of California at Berkeley. 
<P>
It seems cruelly implausible that she should have even entertained
such a dream. The product of a broken home, she lived with her
disabled mother and brother in a one-bedroom apartment in Los
Angeles. The family's entire annual income for the last two years
was roughly $15,000, mainly from her mother's SSI check and the
few odd jobs Lydia and her brother could find. Lydia's childhood
was a jumble of cross-country moves, charity hand-outs from local
churches and food stamps.
<P>
When her parents divorced, Lydia's mother knew she had to go back
to school to get a job which would pay for the family's needs.
Lydia remembers, &quot;She would go to school all day and work
all night and get her homework done in-between. She worked in
different jobs: data entry; McDonald's for a while. She got her
credential in architectural drafting and after that she got a
job for $12 an hour and I thought, 'wow.' That's more money than
we had ever imagined. She just loved that job because people treated
her with respect. She wanted me to get into a college. She said,
'You have to come home and do your homework. She was very strict
about when it was time to do homework. She knew it would end up
for the best. She showed us by example that if she could do it,
we could.&quot; When Lydia was 16, a back injury disabled her
mother, leaving the family destitute again.
<P>
What kept Lydia going? &quot;I don't know. I was just always thinking,
if I worked hard, just did the best in my classes; if I just did
the best that I could that I'd end up doing something good.&quot;
<P>
Whatever it was that drove Lydia McDonald, by the autumn of 1995,
she had arrived at the very gates of Cal Berkeley. Her transcripts
documented the near impossible GPA of 4.5, carried far beyond
a perfect 4.0 by the volume of advanced placement courses she
had mastered. Her Academic Index Score, the combination of various
tests required for admission, was 7,180 out of a perfect 8,000.
Hardly the bookish type, Lydia was also an accomplished athlete,
having placed fifth in her age group in the grueling Los Angeles
Marathon that year. 
<P>
Enter Allan Favish. Favish ran a small one-man law practice in
the San Fernando Valley and had developed a keen interest in racial
discrimination in California law. He had earned a reputation for
confronting the University of California with its obviously discriminatory
policies.
<P>
&quot;If you get any law or medical school application,&quot;
he explained, &quot;there's language in there somewhere that 'in
accord with federal civil rights laws, the University of California
does not discriminate on the basis of race.' Well, it's just a
lie.&quot; 
<P>
In 1993, Favish set out to prove the lie. In October, Favish requested
the GPAs, test scores, and races of all applicants to the UCLA
School of Law, which is public information as long as students'
names are omitted. He received a curt reply that the information
did not exist. &quot;I sent another letter and said, 'You just
admitted this class, and obviously that information was available
then. Why is it not available now?' I got no reply.&quot; In late
1993, Favish filed suit against the University under the California
Public Records Act. The information that had not been available
to him with a polite letter suddenly appeared on his desk under
threat of a court order. 
<P>
It took Favish eight months to enter the data from 5,000 applicants
into his home computer. &quot;I found that if you were white or
Asian, you had a very low chance of getting accepted if you were
not an &quot;A&quot; student; an &quot;A&quot; student with at
least a 3.5 GPA and at least a 90th percentile LSAT score. However,
your chances were a lot better if you were a &quot;B&quot; or
&quot;C&quot; student if you were black or Hispanic.&quot;
<P>
Favish caused a stir when he published his findings in the Los
Angeles Daily News in late 1994, followed by a unique lawsuit
against the University of California claiming consumer fraud.
Favish alleged that the University had engaged in fraudulent consumer
advertising by promising students that the University did not
discriminate on the basis of race, when in practice, clearly it
did. &quot;We took data and I made charts and tables that would
show very vividly that people's chances for admission depended
on what race they were and I asked the court to order that the
charts be published in the application material so applicants
could see whether it was worth 40 bucks just to apply to the school,&quot;
Favish explains.
<P>
One day, Favish was visiting at a friend's house. The friend's
daughter, a high school teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School
District, knew Favish was involved in the affirmative action debate,
asked Favish if she could talk with him about a situation involving
racial preferences. She said, &quot;I have a very bright student
who applied to colleges and very, very much wanted to go to UC-Berkeley.
She just got a rejection letter mentioning race and was devastated.
Would you like to look into this and see what you can do?&quot;
<P>
Allan Favish called Lydia McDonald the next day. Lydia had been
so sure of her qualifications and so determined to get into UC-Berkeley
that she had only applied to a few schools. Strapped for cash,
Lydia could not afford to file many applications. Besides, Berkeley
was her dream. 
<P>
That dream had shattered in March, when she received a form letter
from Director of Admissions Bob Laird. The letter began by explaining
that the university had received 24,900 applications for 9,000
places, and &quot;I regret that we cannot offer you admission
for the fall semester, 1996.&quot; Lydia and the teachers who
were rooting for her were dumbfounded. It was inconceivable to
them that she would not have been welcomed at Cal Berkeley. More
than one third of all applicants had been accepted, but not this
extraordinary student who had overcome so much.
<P>
&quot;I went to school the next day and so many people I went
to school with had gotten in there and many of them weren't into
studying and doing their work,&quot; Lydia recalls. &quot;I just
cried.&quot;
<P>
She didn't tell her mother about the rejection. She kept it a
secret from her family while she waited to hear from the few other
schools to which she applied. 
<P>
Laird's letter gave a glimmer of insight into the reason for her
summary rejection. &quot;While giving preference to California
residents, we sought an academically strong freshman class which
includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic,
racial and socio-economic backgrounds, as well as one that represents
a broad array of talents and interests.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;When I first talked to her,&quot; says Favish, &quot;I explained
to her what I was doing with my fraud suit against the University
of California. She had actually read that boiler plate language
(regarding the University's non-discriminatory policy) in the
application. She had heard of affirmative action before, but it
never hit home as something that could affect her.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;She was really devastated,&quot; Favish recalls. &quot;Especially
after working so hard under very difficult socioeconomic conditions.
She was really crushed. Lydia's teacher said she was just a different
person after she got the rejection letter. The racial aspect to
the letter just totally shocked her.
<P>
&quot;I don't know why she didn't try to appeal the rejection.
She was just very sad. I said, 'Let me look into how an appeal
is filed. I will file it for you.'&quot;
<P>
Favish prepared a three-page protest to Laird, reiterating Lydia's
background, her struggle against adversity, and her stellar academic
and extracurricular record. He went on, &quot;Her rejection is
even more troubling given the professed concern by so many supporters
of race and sex preferences for the alleged plight of high school
females who are supposedly too intimidated to achieve their full
potential in math and science courses. In Lydia you have an applicant
who is female, socio-economically disadvantaged, excellent in
math and science and wants to be an engineer. I would have thought
that you would want to admit Lydia, if for no other reason than
to study her.&quot;
<P>
What Favish already knew, and stated quite bluntly in his protest,
is that there was no other &quot;reason for Lydia's rejection
other than the fact that she is not black, Chicano or Native American.&quot;
<P>
The University's first response was the same stone wall that so
many applicants encounter. Although Favish was acting pro bono
as Lydia's attorney, Laird simply dismissed his formal protest
as a &quot;third party inquiry.&quot; She could write directly,
Laird said, but he clearly implied it would do her no good. &quot;Although
we received over 500 decision appeals in our fall 1995 admissions
process, fewer than 30 were ultimately granted admission.&quot;
<P>
Amber Preshica had run into the same wall of silence at Cal Berkeley.
She had applied for admission to the same freshman class, with
a 4.5 GPA, and SAT scores almost identical to Lydia's. Amber had
been Senior Class President at her high school, and worked part
time jobs to save for her expected admission to Cal Berkeley.
The material she received promised that her test scores should
have summarily qualified her for the freshman class. She, too,
was baffled by her letter of rejection.
<P>
Amber simply wanted to know why she did not measure up. &quot;I
had (minority) friends who got in with lower GPAs.&quot; She wrote
letters. She filed an appeal. She even visited the campus. An
admissions counselor told her she should go to a two-year junior
college &quot;because it was easier to qualify.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;They never really told me why,&quot; Preshica lamented.
&quot;I kept asking, please answer why I was not accepted.&quot;
Her parents, and even a UC Regent, tried to get answers. &quot;Everybody
in the University we've talked to, they try not to talk to us
too long. They don't want to tell us.&quot;
<P>
Hayley Ulrich also applied for the same freshman class. She had
a GPA of 4.4 and SAT scores placing her in the 90th percentile
of California students. Like Preshica and McDonald, Ulrich had
a Hispanic friend who had been admitted to Cal Berkeley with only
average grades and test scores. Indeed, according to the University's
own statistics, about half the entering class had academic records
inferior to hers. Ulrich was valedictorian of her senior class
and competed on the varsity track team. She worked part time and
volunteered in a homeless-aid program. She received the same form
letter from Bob Laird. 
<P>
&quot;If some less-qualified students were admitted to UC-Berkeley
on the basis of their race and color...then my daughter's face
is the face of the entire affirmative action debate,&quot; Hayley's
father wrote to Governor Pete Wilson. Hayley applied instead to
West Point, and was immediately accepted.
<P>
Favish prepared a letter for Lydia McDonald to sign, formally
appealing her rejection and asking the precise reasons for it.
She asked specifically to know her Personal Characteristics and
Achievement Score, a number determined by a highly subjective
and secretive formula which the University assigns to applicants.
<P>
Faced with the imminent threat of a lawsuit, the University backed
down, but told Lydia that she would not be allowed to enter until
the spring semester, and could not enroll in any other four-year
institution in the meantime. This presented Lydia with an impossible
situation. After her rejection from Berkeley, she had half-heartedly
accepted admission to UC-Santa Cruz and had already made living
arrangements there. But there was more. The gutsy coed who had
overcome so much adversity in her lifetime had grown completely
disillusioned with the process. Cal Berkeley no longer shined
with the same luster and allure that had made it her best hope.
Lydia's dream had soured. When Lydia McDonald finally received
her letter of acceptance, she turned it down.
<P>
&quot;There were many reasons,&quot; Lydia reflects. &quot;Everybody
I knew who had gotten in were either white and rich or a minority.
I was white and poor. That left me nowhere. I doubt I would have
fit in. If that's the way they choose their students, just based
on what race they are or what culture they are, I didn't want
to go there. I lost all respect for what I thought was a good
school.
<P>
&quot;For me it didn't end at Berkeley. Even though I worked hard,
I'm still going to have a strong work ethic. Just because I don't
go to school with a big name doesn't mean I'm not going to learn
what I need to know.&quot;<BR>

<CENTER><I>The Story of Janine Jacinto<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Janine Jacinto simply wanted to help less fortunate people through
a career in social work. Despite the demands of raising four children,
she had found time to serve for many years on her church's Board
of Social Ministry. She worked actively in &quot;Habitat for Humanity,&quot;
the organization devoted to providing housing for poor families,
whose boosters include former President Jimmy Carter. But she
wanted to do more.
<P>
In 1989, Janine decided to go back to school. She enrolled in
community college classes at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton,
earning an Associate of Arts Degree in June 1991. That fall, she
entered the California State University at Sacramento. The burdens
of raising her children, driving nearly an hour each way to classes
from the little town of Lodi, and struggling to pay the bills
with part-time work as a tutor and teaching assistant, weighed
heavily on her. Yet, through all her travail, she maintained a
GPA of 3.89. She developed a keen interest in cultural anthropology.
She conducted extensive field work with underprivileged groups,
including Mexican-American farm workers in Galt and Southeast
Asian women in Stockton.
<P>
Janine's professors saw tremendous potential in her work, and
encouraged her to apply to the University's Graduate Program for
Social Work to begin studying for her masters degree. As she read
the University's prospectus, she thought it seemed as if the program
had been developed with her in mind. The application promised
that students would be chosen for their intellectual capacity,
personal maturity, motivation, previous academic work, background
experiences and potential for successful professional practice.
Her professors told her she was a natural. She spent hours perfecting
her application.
<P>
In June 1994, with her children looking on, Janine received her
Bachelor of Arts Degree, magna cum laude, in anthropology. A few
months before, she had been inducted into the Gold Key National
Honor Society. 
<P>
Even more prestigious, though, was her induction into the honor
society of Phi Kappa Phi. The night of the installation dinner
was one of the proudest moments in Janine Jacinto's life. University
President Don Gerth told the small group of honorees that they
were &quot;the cream of the crop,&quot; and the &quot;best the
University had to offer.&quot; He challenged them to go forth
and to become leaders in the community.
<P>
Just a few days after that memorable evening, with President Gerth's
proud challenge still ringing in her ears, Janine received the
long-awaited letter from the graduate school. The form letter,
from program Director Juan D. Hernandez, explained that &quot;The
faculty evaluated applicants on the basis of the personal statement,
depth and breadth of experience in social work, personal references
and academic qualifications. Applicants were rated on the above
factors, and those with the highest ratings have been offered
positions in the entering class.&quot; 
<P>
Janine, however, would not be one of them. Because of so many
qualified applicants, &quot;we cannot offer you a position...We
trust that you will have other opportunities to realize your career
goals in the field of human services.&quot;
<P>
Janine was crushed and confused. &quot;It was a tremendous blow
to my self-esteem. My initial reaction was, 'I'm not good enough.'
Then I began to think about some things I had been told, that
some of my professors said. One professor told me to 'Check the
Hispanic box. Your name sounds Hispanic.' But that wouldn't have
been true. Another professor told me, 'I'm glad you're going to
apply, but I want you to know that they're weighing ethnicity
heavily.' But I figured my own qualifications would compensate
for that.&quot; 
<P>
The next day, she waited until the end of her &quot;Poverty and
Homelessness&quot; class to speak with the professor who had been
so supportive of her application. The professor was incredulous.
&quot;Oh Janine,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm surprised. You're one
of the best students I've had.&quot; Janine had obviously fallen
short in some part of the admissions process, but the professor
said it would be difficult to pinpoint the precise reason. The
criteria used by the admissions committee to evaluate applicants
were &quot;extremely confidential,&quot; and known only to the
professors on the committee.
<P>
With no way of knowing why she had been rejected, Janine had no
hope of proceeding. The dream she had worked so hard to attain
had just crashed into a solid wall. How many other Janine Jacintos
have been forced at that point to abandon their plans is impossible
to speculate. An inconsolable sense of resignation would have
been the natural response.
<P>
The only reason we know of Janine Jacinto's case is because of
one of those extraordinary coincidences that happen perhaps once
in a lifetime. 
<P>
Another student who had been waiting to see the professor jumped
into the conversation. &quot;I know how they do the ratings.&quot;
<P>
&quot;How can you know?&quot; the professor asked dismissively.
&quot;I don't even know.&quot; 
<P>
The student was quite matter-of-fact as she rummaged through her
knapsack. &quot;Because I have the rating sheet.&quot;
<P>
The professor was appalled. &quot;How did you get hold of that?
That's highly confidential.&quot;
<P>
The student explained that as she had waited for an appointment
to see a faculty advisor earlier in the day, she had noticed a
photocopied rating sheet in a stack of admission material on a
table in the waiting area. Thinking it was an informational hand-out,
she had taken it. Now she realized what she had. In her knapsack
was the crumpled dream of Janine Jacinto. Janine intensely studied
the three pages of rating instructions. 
<P>
Each applicant was awarded points for various aspects of his or
her background and qualifications, with a perfect score being
38. Applicants were required to have a minimum GPA of 2.5, for
which they automatically received five points, leaving a discretionary
range of 33 points. The difference between the minimum GPA of
2.5 and a perfect GPA of 4.0 was three additional points. This,
obviously, wasn't the most important criterion. Although neither
the university admissions catalogue nor her letter of rejection
even hinted at it, the most important single quality the university
sought was not academic background, personal maturity, experience
or potential. Although the difference between the minimum and
maximum GPA was three points, the race of an applicant was worth
an automatic five points. Of the 33 discretionary points awarded
to applicants, all aspects of race and ethnicity accounted for
up to 13 points. Janine Jacinto had been born the wrong color.
<P>
Janine made another appointment to see Professor Lum, a faculty
advisor. She began the meeting by describing the irony and anguish
she felt when she received the letter of rejection, just days
after being inducted into Phi Kappa Phi. The advisor feigned sympathy
and puzzlement. &quot;I'd like to see my evaluation sheet,&quot;
she told him.
<P>
Prof. Lum frowned. &quot;No,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;That
is confidential.&quot; Instead, he asked her about her qualifications.
He asked her about her volunteer experience in social work. He
asked her about her language skills; did she speak a second language?
She replied that she not only spoke a second language fluently,
but that she tutored it. But it was the politically incorrect
language of Italian. That's worth extra points, he assured her.
&quot;No, I don't believe it is,&quot; she said. &quot;Of course
it is,&quot; soothed Prof. Lum.
<P>
Janine had finally heard one untruth too many. She informed Lum
that she had seen the rating instructions, and that it was her
race that was wrong. Janine was amazed at the look of shock which
suddenly crossed the advisor's face. &quot;That stopped him cold,&quot;
she remembered. &quot;That was the end of the questions about
my qualifications.&quot; Lum immediately directed her to the graduate
advisor or the school's director, Prof. Hernandez. &quot;I know
you'll be admitted to the program,&quot; he told her.
<P>
It was an ironic moment in Janine Jacinto's life. She had been
driven by a commitment to improve opportunity for the disadvantaged,
the underprivileged, those who had been victims of discrimination.
Now she was staring straight into the face of official discrimination,
with all its smarmy prevarication, rank hypocrisy and moral cowardice.
And she was the victim.
<P>
During the next several weeks, Janine pondered her options. The
demeanor of her &quot;Poverty and Home-lessness&quot; professor
changed. &quot;What are you going to do now, Janine?&quot; the
professor would repeatedly ask her. &quot;It's not like you to
make a lot of noise about something like this.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;I got the feeling she was being pressured to find out what
I was going to do,&quot; Janine said. Janine finally decided to
make another appointment, but not with the Department chair. One
spring day in 1994, Janine's sense of social conscience brought
her to a fledgling law firm in Sacramento, Diespenbrock and Costa,
which handled a growing caseload of civil litigation.
<P>
As her story unfolded, attorneys John Virga and Dan Costa knew
that Janine presented an opportunity to drive deep into the University's
darkest secret: systematic, deliberate and officially sanctioned
racial discrimination. Although she could certainly use the money,
Janine wasn't looking for the kind of multi-million dollar awards
which are routinely given to victims who suffer far less injustice
than had she. Janine wanted something far more important to a
woman with her sense of social duty: she wanted to stop the injustice.
<P>
Costa was excited as he thought of the coming trial. Subpoenaed
material and testimony would clearly reveal the nature of racial
discrimination within the University, its extent, and the way
it has been covered up. It would also help to discover other Janine
Jacintos whose dreams are killed every day by a process which
is hidden behind the sympathetic shrugs of faculty advisors and
the inertia of the bureaucracy.
<P>
Obviously the University sensed precisely the same outcome. Shortly
after the suit was filed, the University's legal counsel contacted
Janine's attorneys. The State of California was intensely interested
in settling the case immediately-and quietly. 
<P>
&quot;What does she want?&quot; the University's attorney asked
Costa at a preliminary hearing. &quot;Does she want into the program?
She's in,&quot; he said.
<P>
The answer was simple. For herself, she only wanted to be made
whole for the time she had lost and the expenses she had incurred.
But for others who followed, she wanted the University to stop
the sham. 
<P>
The only thing the University wanted was to keep the entire affair
quiet. They wanted no discussion of the case in the press, no
publicity, no stories like this one to tell of Jacinto's experience.
Oddly, the University's motto is &quot;Vox, Veritas, Vita&quot;-Voice,
Truth, Life - but officials were insistent that the truth Janine
Jacinto had discovered within the University would be given no
voice. She quickly responded that there would be no negotiation
on this point: what the University was doing was wrong, and it
would not be covered up.
<P>
On April 29, 1996, California State University officials paid
Jacinto her expenses and legal fees. That day, the University
also signed a settlement agreeing that the CSUS graduate program
for social work would never again consider applicants on any grounds
other than merit, and under no circumstance allow &quot;ethnicity&quot;
to be considered. 
<P>
On that day, one injustice, in one program, at one public university,
had been abolished because of a remarkable chain of events and
an equally remarkable mother of four whose ambition had been to
help others and whose only sin had been to have been born the
wrong color. How many such programs remain at other Departments
of CSUS, and at other institutions across California, is anyone's
guess.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Michael Cornelius </I></CENTER>
<P>
More than a century ago, a man named Plessy boarded a train in
New Orleans, announced he was a Negro, and boldly proceeded to
seat himself in the coach designated for white passengers. Upon
refusing to move to the &quot;colored coach,&quot; he was arrested.
<P>
The vestiges of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine laid
down in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 still pervade California in
1996. Three years ago, a group of construction firms put up the
best bid to build part of a new subway system in Los Angeles.
Like Plessy, they also were denied their place on the train because
of their race. 
<P>
Just as Mr. Plessy confronted the segregationist philosophy of
the Jim Crow South then, so now the public challenge to separatist
racial policies is continued by Michael Cornelius of San Diego
in his battle against the Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority.
<P>
As Vice President of Operations for Wagner Construction of San
Diego in 1993, Cornelius believed the hard work he put in on a
subcontract bid had ensured his company a portion of the largest
public-works project in the nation: the $5.8 billion subway project
underneath the city of Los Angeles.
<P>
Cornelius successfully bid to a general contractor, PCL Construction
Services, for a contract to build a subway station at Western
and Vermont Avenues. Its share of the $38 million project, about
$7 million, represented a potential windfall to Wagner and its
60 employees, who did about $10 million in business each year.
<P>
The close of bidding brought celebration to the Wagner offices.
PCL Construction's bid had beaten all others by more than $3 million.
Employees at Wagner were in a &quot;euphoric mode,&quot; as Cornelius
describes it. In anticipation of the final award, they began planning
for the great challenge that lay before them.
<P>
They would never have the opportunity to meet that challenge.
The first bad news for Cornelius and his colleagues came soon
after the celebration began. The general contractor with the second-lowest
bid had filed a protest, charging PCL Construction with failure
to meet the goals for &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises,&quot;
and demanding the company's disqualification. The Los Angeles
Metro Transit Authority required 29 percent of all construction
work to go to &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises&quot; (DBE's).
PCL Construction's bid included about 26.5 percent minority participation.
<P>
The MTA ruled in PCL's favor after a hearing. It found PCL indisputably
had the superior bid even though the minority participation was
technically below the goal. PCL Construction and Wagner now had
the issue settled. The award, they now believed, was finally theirs.
<P>
They were wrong. Unbeknownst to Cornelius or any of his colleagues
at the time, Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority had never before
accepted a bid that did not meet or surpass its &quot;goals&quot;,
and it did not intend to start. 
<P>
One month later, MTA bosses met behind closed doors and disqualified
PCL's bid, granting the contract instead to the bidder who had
filed the protest. MTA informed PCL that participation of minority-owned
businesses in their bid was unacceptably low. Nor, MTA continued,
had PCL and its subcontractors shown &quot;good faith&quot; in
working to meet those goals. 
<P>
Needless to say, the bid participants, white and minority alike,
were mystified as to how their recruitment efforts and their 26
percent level of minority participation constituted a lack of
good faith. Michael Cornelius, who had enlisted the help of minority
subcontractors for 35 percent of Wagner's subcontract without
the prodding of preferential regulations, wondered why the MTA
now seemed to enforce its &quot;goals&quot; as strict quotas.
<P>
PCL Construction brought legal action, charging MTA's preferential
policies were extreme-nearly three times the federal standard-and
discriminatory. However, the apparent discovery of an accounting
error soon after changed all of PCL's calculations. They determined
the bid of $38 million was too low to be profitable, and dropped
the case. 
<P>
It was obvious to those involved that political pressures had
more to do with PCL's decision than accounting errors. Wagner
Construction and the other subcontractors were also unwilling
to risk involvement in a high-profile case dealing with racial
politics. 
<P>
Cornelius, no longer with Wagner, was of a different mind. MTA
was enforcing racial quotas and that, he decided, was fundamentally
wrong. Now with little left to lose, Cornelius decided to fight
the burdensome and unfair system of racial quotas in the Los Angeles
Metro Transit Authority. 
<P>
Since he represented none of the companies directly affected by
the MTA's decision, the first challenge was to establish Cornelius'
standing in court. He could have claimed his lost commission,
but Cornelius sought no personal compensation by pursuing the
case. He had a larger purpose in mind. 
<P>
For years, Cornelius saw the tremendous waste of public money,
in the hundreds of millions of dollars in California alone, that
resulted when agencies refused to accept the lowest bid for public
contracts. He had seen the most qualified bid passed over time
and again for the second, third, and even fourth-lowest bid. In
the case of the L.A. subway, a boondoggle of a project already
$2 billion over budget and three years behind schedule, MTA's
insistence on continuing its preferential policies cost taxpayers
an additional $3 million to build the Western Avenue station.
<P>
To make matters much worse, the contractor who had successfully
protested Cornelius' bid was involved in the most spectacular
disaster of the entire project. In 1994, the ground underneath
the site of a Hollywood Boulevard station gave way. Portions of
the Hollywood Walk of Fame were swallowed by a sinkhole, and businesses
along the strip were forced to close. Given their predicament,
MTA's emphasis on hiring the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; rather
than the most qualified contractors seemed particularly inappropriate.
<P>
With the overwhelming evidence of his own experience, Cornelius
filed suit not only on his own behalf, but on behalf of all taxpayers.
He asserted that the use of quotas by government agencies violated
the public trust in preventing taxpayers, the financiers and beneficiaries
of these projects, from getting the best work available at the
lowest price. After spending $32,000 out of his own pocket on
legal fees, attorneys Robert Corry of the Pacific Legal Foundation
and Paul Mahoney agreed to take on MTA's high-priced lawyers pro
bono.
<P>
The trial appeared at first to be a monumental mismatch-a $6 billion
government agency against a solitary citizen. But in 1995, the
lower court found in favor of Cornelius and the taxpayers, ruling
MTA's system of quotas unconstitutional. The court cited U.S.
Supreme Court rulings that policies of group preference must be
designed to remedy a proven pattern of past discrimination. MTA
had no basis on which to justify its 29 percent quota.
<P>
Proceedings for MTA's appeal begin this fall. With that, Cornelius
notes an additional waste of taxpayer money: local agencies are
required to take advantage of every legal channel available when
the court rules against standing law. As rulings against quotas
and preferences in public contracting increase, so do the costs
to taxpayers for those appeals. 
<P>
Cornelius hopes his case takes another step towards alleviating
this unfair burden to the nation's hard-working taxpayers, but
there is still a considerable legal fight ahead. The Clinton Administration
is now weighing-in on the side of MTA, as are the City and County
of San Francisco. The continuing legal battle also means Cornelius
must continue to bear the ridicule of the local press. &quot;I'm
their proverbial 'angry white male,'&quot; Cornelius shrugs; &quot;I
don't consider myself an angry person.&quot; 
<P>
All told, preferential treatment policies amount to billions of
dollars in inefficiency and waste nationwide. But the greater
iniquity, which Michael Cornelius so selflessly overlooks in his
public quest, is that which he has suffered because of his race.
And that injustice can never be undone. <BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>&quot;Then We Can't Use You&quot;: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Fontana Steel<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Paul Ware grew up in the dusty little town of Fontana, California,
about 54 miles inland from Los Angeles. &quot;It was just a little
chicken town, population 6,000,&quot; his son, Don, remembers.
Paul and his wife, Dorothy, had taken over the small family farm
after the Second World War, raising chickens and selling a few
hundred boxes of produce each year. It was enough to get by, but
with a growing family of seven children, Paul and Dorothy knew
that the modest family farm would not be enough.
<P>
In 1946, Paul foresaw the coming of a post-war construction boom
in California. He lacked the start-up capital he needed for a
business, but he found he could make a little extra money by contracting
out labor on local steel projects. Little by little, his business
grew.
<P>
He worked 14-hour days and seven-day weeks to keep the farm running
and to build his backyard steel contracting business, helped sometimes
by friends he could hire on weekends. &quot;I remember the first
job I went out on,&quot; says his son Don, now the company president.
&quot;I was eight. Dad had a 1947 Chevy Woody that held nine people.
The guys would all show up at the house and drive all the way
to Tehachapi, about 140 miles, to the job.&quot; Everyone in the
family worked, and Dorothy's thriftiness became legendary, even
catching the attention of the Los Angeles Times in 1953.
<P>
The Ware family's sweat and sacrifice those years slowly amassed
the nest egg that Paul needed to buy steel directly, and become
a supplier himself. He bought a small yard in Fontana and devised
make-shift equipment to handle the steel. But when he tried to
place his first order, he was stopped dead. The steel mills' customers
didn't welcome the additional competition that the gritty upstart
promised, and Paul could not find anyone to sell him the steel
he needed to enter the market. &quot;He was just a little guy
getting too big for them,&quot; his son recalls.
<P>
Paul was getting desperate as payments on the idle yard mounted
and the prospect for expansion grew dimmer. But Paul Ware was
a fighter, and every time a door slammed in his face, he tried
another. Four hundred miles from Fontana, he knocked on the door
of Pacific State Steel of San Francisco. Within a few weeks, the
first delivery reached Paul Ware's backyard operation, which he
dubbed &quot;Fontana Steel.&quot;
<P>
In the years that followed, Fontana Steel grew into a thriving
enterprise that played a role in some of the biggest public works
projects in California's history: the California Water Project,
the Feather River Project, the Golden State Freeway, the Century
Freeway. At its zenith, Fontana Steel employed more than 500 employees.
<P>
Ware built his business on a solid reputation. Don Ware remembers,
&quot;He was one of these guys who always kept his word. He never
once reneged on making a payment. He was so sympathetic to the
small businesses that we bought things from, I saw him borrow
from the bank to pay his bills on time. He was never one to wait
till he got paid to take care of his commitments. He's 87 now,
and still comes to the office in the morning and if he finds a
bill that says 'SECOND REQUEST,' he circles it and writes something
like, 'How come?' on it and our accounts payable person gets called
on the carpet.&quot; 
<P>
Ware's workers are a mix of the surrounding communities, about
52 percent white and 48 percent from minority groups, mainly Hispanic
and African-American. &quot;This company's always felt that a
person's color is not important,&quot; Don says. &quot;If a person
can do the job, that's all that matters. We always looked at the
ability. If they had the ability, they had the job.&quot; 
<P>
The sense of family goes far beyond the management. &quot;We have
second generations working here. I know of a couple of guys who
worked here over 20 years. Their dads worked here and retired
from here.&quot; 
<P>
Don recounts times when Fontana workers got into minor scrapes
with the law. &quot;We got them job furloughs so they could keep
working. We picked them up in the morning and dropped them off
at night. They were family people; retired now. Guys who had wives
and kids. You know.&quot;
<P>
Today, Fontana steel is only a fraction of its former size. The
booming 500-employee company is now down to only 125 workers,
in large part because state law disqualified the Ware family from
bidding on public works contracts, which made up about 65 percent
of its business. It's not the fault of the company or the workers.
It's Paul Ware's fault. He is white.
<P>
In the 1980s the state of California enacted a series of laws
requiring that a fifth of all contracts be set aside for minority-
or women-owned companies. Despite the fact that half of Fontana's
employees are from minority groups, the fact that Paul is white
makes it impossible for the company to bid on Caltrans contracts
except as a supplier. The impact on Fontana Steel was devastating.
<P>
&quot;It started happening in the '80s,&quot; Don recalls. &quot;We
would bid jobs and the contractor taking our quotes would ask
us if we were an MBE (minority business enterprise) or a WBE (woman
business enterprise). When we said 'no,' they said, 'then we can't
use you.'&quot; 
<P>
Ten years ago, contractors across California sought out Fontana
Steel because of a rock-solid 50-year reputation for dependability,
reliability, and cost control. Now, a recent letter from Kasler
Corporation to Don Ware is commonplace:
<P>
&quot;We appreciate your quote for furnishing and installing the
rebar on the Chino Hills project...Although your quote was low,
we were unable to use it as we had to accept a higher price from
a certified minority in order to meet Caltrans' requirements.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The first time we were told that, we just couldn't hardly
believe it,&quot; Don says. &quot;We'd been in business and done
jobs for these contractors for years and suddenly we weren't going
to be eligible.&quot;
<P>
Fontana is now limited to being a material supplier on public
contracts; but that, too, has been fraught with peril for the
company. As minority firms with no previous business experience
suddenly flooded the vacuum, Fontana began selling steel to them.
&quot;Sixty percent of those guys went bust, owing us money,&quot;
Don recalls.
<P>
Although state laws require 23 percent of state contracts to be
set aside for minority, woman, or disabled veteran-owned businesses,
sub-contractors like Fontana have been shut out completely. Don
explains, &quot;Say you have a bridge [contract]. All they need
is to put a little dirt up there for a fill. The general contractor
does that. They do the dirt work and the concrete. They've always
done the concrete themselves, so where else can they get the minority
[business] except the rebar?&quot; Thus, a 23 percent set-aside
becomes a 100 percent quota for firms like Fontana.
<P>
The future of Fontana Steel is uncertain. &quot;We may end up
sooner or later becoming only a fabricator,&quot; Don worries.
&quot;If we closed out the installation part of our business,
it would leave at least another hundred people out of work.&quot;
<P>
Don grows solemn. &quot;I've done my best to take care of the
success of the company so that my sons could go on. My Dad has
given his whole life to the business. He had done without his
whole life and put all his money back in the company so that it
could survive. He's now an old man, and he's watching the company
get placed in a position where it cannot grow.&quot; <BR>

<CENTER><B>Starting Out 10 Points Down:</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Jack Bras<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Jack Bras has been an architect in Northern California for 32
years. In that time he has worked with cities, counties and state
agencies, building his relationships with clients and a reputation
for quality work. The competitive nature of his profession demanded
such. Still, it was his solid reputation that made Jack most proud,
and enabled his small firm to prosper.
<P>
J. Jack Bras and Associates performed most of its contract services
with public utilities in California, like Pacific Bell. Bras first
worked with Pacific Bell in 1969, carefully cultivating that partnership
for many years. It was well worth the effort, as PacBell consistently
rewarded Bras' skill and hard work with new contracts. After Bras
added AT&amp;T to his clientele, the two utilities accounted for
more than half of his annual commerce.
<P>
The firm was enjoying its peak years in the late 1980's when the
rug was pulled out from under it. The California legislature passed
new requirements for state agencies to implement &quot;affirmative
action goals.&quot; These regulations required agencies to create
racial goals and timetables, including a minimum 23 percent participation
rate for &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises&quot;-any business
under at least 51 percent ownership of people from preferred racial,
ethnic and gender groups. As for many other white-owned firms,
the end of non-discriminatory competitive bidding meant turmoil
for Bras and Associates. 
<P>
In 1988, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the
governing body of the public utilities, began implementing its
policies to meet those demands. CPUC issued General Order #156,
ordering each of the utilities to create its own goals and timetables
for hiring minorities. Though state law specifically expressed
that goals were neither &quot;a requirement nor a quota&quot;
but merely a &quot;target,&quot; the order empowered the Commission
to sanction utilities for failing to make &quot;acceptable progress
in the hiring of minority businesses.&quot;
<P>
Naturally, the threat of sanction had a chilling effect on the
utilities. The pressure to meet the &quot;goals&quot; and avoid
regulatory penalties forced Pacific Bell to create whole new contracting
procedures. These procedures included a form for &quot;prequalification
criteria&quot; sent out to contractors in February 1991.
<P>
PacBell normally evaluated its partners every three years, but
for the first time, Bras had to apply for an &quot;improved business
partnership&quot; with Pacific Bell. Though advertised as a way
to improve PacBell's competitiveness, the whole procedure struck
Bras as very unusual, since PacBell had always contracted with
many firms across the state. Nonetheless, he filled out the form
for &quot;prequalification criteria&quot; confident that he was
indeed qualified to continue the work he had performed for 22
years. 
<P>
Several months after the application process, rumors circulated
that Bras' company had not been chosen among those firms to enjoy
an &quot;improved business partnership&quot; with Pacific Bell.
A disconcerted Bras immediately fired off a letter to PacBell
executives for an explanation.
<P>
Bras received a response in June that indeed his firm would no
longer have a working relationship with Pacific Bell. Of 13 firms
from the San Francisco Bay Area, PacBell had chosen to do business
with just three. The results of the prequalification forms showed
Bras and Associates placed sixth out of the 13. PacBell admitted
that race and gender had been a factor, but would not have affected
his standing. They then assured him that &quot;your firm was very
competitive and was not eliminated due to any unsatisfactory performance.&quot;
<P>
Bras requested a personal meeting with his former partners for
further explanation. Behind closed doors, PacBell officials acknowledged
they used race and gender criteria in their decisions. PacBell
had been forced to limit its partnerships, and set aside the lion's
share of architectural contracts for minority businesses. 
<P>
Shocked by the news, Bras left that meeting with plenty of incentive
to challenge those policies. PacBell's procedure of awarding contracts
based on the contractor's race seemed to him grossly unfair, even
immoral. In 1992, Bras filed suit against Pacific Bell and the
Public Utilities Commission alleging discrimination on the basis
of race and gender. 
<P>
The evidence that came out during trial proceedings told the whole
story of the discrimination which Jack Bras and the other white
contractors suffered under the policy. Despite PacBell's earlier
contention that he was not eliminated due to his racial status,
Bras discovered he would have taken the third and final partnership
offered had race not been a consideration.
<P>
Specifically, Question #10 on the form asked, &quot;Are you currently
certified through the Cordoba Corporation Clearing House process
for Minority/Women Business Enterprise Status?&quot; The wrong
answer on this question proved very costly: Bras answered that
question in the negative and lost 10 points to his &quot;disadvantaged&quot;
competitors, the difference between placing sixth and third. 
<P>
These revelations encouraged Pacific Bell to settle its case with
Bras, but he continued the fight for an injunction against the
discriminatory policies employed by the Public Utilities Commission.
A lower court dealt Bras an early setback, but an appeals court
reversal in 1995 reestablishing Bras' legal standing sent CPUC
to the bargaining table. The case was finally settled in April
of 1996, when the CPUC agreed to remove any provision that &quot;authorizes
or permits a utility to utilize set-asides, preferences or grant
preferential treatment to&quot; businesses owned by women or minorities.
<P>
The efforts of Jack Bras were truly a significant victory for
equal rights and equal treatment for Californians. The settlement,
however, was some matter of sacrifice for Bras personally: during
his suit against Pacific Bell he lost his contract with AT&amp;T,
also resulting from CPUC racial policies. 
<P>
In an attempt to reinvigorate his enterprise, Bras found other
instruments of California government also excluded him because
of his color. He received an offer to bid from the Lawrence Livermore
Lab, a prestigious prize for any contractor. Unfortunately, when
the contract was finally placed up for bid, Bras found it was
limited to &quot;small disadvantaged firms only.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;If that's not plain discrimination, I don't know what is,&quot;
Jack contends.
<P>
Bras assuredly does know what discrimination is, especially of
the sort that descends from his own government. Its persistent
abuse, combined with forces of economic recession, withered his
enterprise to the breaking point. Bras was forced to lay off all
of his employees. 
<P>
Though the legal battle is over, Jack Bras' fight for fairness
continues. The Public Utilities Commission is still deciding how
to create a fair system of contracting, and he attends every PUC
meeting where his demands are being deliberated. The fight for
his business, however, is over. At 66, Jack admits it is time
to retire, but his disappointment is unmistakable.
<P>
As the only remaining employee, he is preparing to close up what
is left of J. Jack Bras and Associates. &quot;I've decided to
let things just taper off, but it's sad. It was a practice of
considerable value, that could have succeeded into the future,
and now we've lost the clientele we worked so hard to build up
over the years.&quot;<BR>

<CENTER><B>When White is Wrong: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Peter Schembri </I></CENTER>
<P>
Peter Schembri's life began with uncertain odds of survival, much
less success. He was born in Malta to poor parents, his father
was a blacksmith who earned four pennies a day. After burying
five of their twelve children in their homeland, the Schembris
moved their family to the United States in 1952, where Peter grew
up in the impoverished Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood of San
Francisco. 
<P>
Life in San Francisco was not immediately easier, as the Schembris
soon lost another child. Each of the surviving children went to
work when he was old enough. As it was, the family could only
scrape together enough money to send Peter and two of his sisters
to private school. Despite their desperate circumstances, the
Schembris instilled in their children the philosophy that hard
work and a good education would eventually enable them to succeed.
<P>
Peter Schembri took those words to heart. After a tour of duty
in Vietnam, he came home to work with the troubled youth of San
Francisco. In four years of college, Schembri amassed an impressive
college record, with degrees in psychology, sociology, and criminology,
and a minor in counseling. After five years with the Juvenile
Probation Division in San Mateo, California, Schembri found his
true calling to public service. In 1978, he became a San Francisco
firefighter. 
<P>
Now with a family of his own to support, Schembri looked to advance
through the fire department's ranks. &quot;I believed I should
try to give my children a better chance than I had.&quot; He devoted
himself to years of extra work, taking college courses and educating
himself in his field. He took numerous advanced training courses,
served on 15 different safety committees within the fire department,
and earned a degree in fire science. When promotional opportunities
arose, Schembri would often work 15-hour days months in advance
to study. 
<P>
So determined was he for a promotion that Schembri tested for
three different positions in 1984, including a lieutenant's position.
Testing procedures used by most local government agencies rank
all applicants by scores, then hire from the list in successive
order. He scored well on all three tests, but two of those were
thrown out by a federal circuit court judge as &quot;discriminatory&quot;
when analysis of the results showed &quot;disadvantaged&quot;
groups generally scoring lower than their white-male colleagues.
<P>
Under court order, the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) replaced
the lieutenant's exam with one designed by an outside firm with
consultation from groups representing protected classes. However,
the results were the same. In response, the department was ordered
to hire strictly by racial quota. Using scores from the first
test, the first 33 white males were hired, then the top 50 applicants
from protected classes. Though Schembri had a chance for promotion
if the list had been open, he was not in the running when racial
classifications were applied. When it was all over, Schembri was
passed over for promotion by minority candidates scoring as many
as 200 places below him. 
<P>
When the local firefighters' union informed its members about
the decision, Schembri and others in the department felt betrayed.
The game was already over, and someone was now changing the rules.
All of Peter Schembri's commitment, hard work, and study went
out the window with the stroke of a judge's pen.
<P>
The disappointment might have been too much for some, but Peter
Schembri had known heartache before. Still, the SFFD's wanton
disregard for fairness devastated Peter and his family. In an
eloquent letter to the city attorney, Schembri's wife Mary wrote,
<P>
&quot;This decision has affected me as a wife and mother... My
husband studied for three years for these tests. He made over
four thousand flash cards and several manuals. I quizzed him for
an hour every night...Four months before the test (I) hosted nightly
study group meetings in my living room for 6 to 8 firefighters...
My daughter missed her father for three years. That time will
never come again...
<P>
&quot;My husband says that regardless of how hard he studies for
another exam, the outcome will be fruitless because promotions
will be given based only on gender and race, and the numbers are
stacked against him.&quot;
<P>
In 1994, Schembri applied for two more lieutenants' positions.
He placed eighth on one test, and with eight positions opening
over the course of two years, Schembri should have been the last
hired. Unfortunately, three firefighters with lower scores were
selected in front of him, leaving him the top candidate remaining
as the promotions list expired in 1996. All three were listed
in protected classes. 
<P>
On the other test Schembri was passed over in favor of a minority
firefighter who scored significantly lower. That was Peter's last
chance at lieutenant. A superior officer sympathized with Schembri's
plight, &quot;I'm sorry, but you're white at the wrong time.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I feel I've been robbed of the promise of equal opportunity,&quot;
Schembri remarks, &quot;I don't think I'll be trying for another
promotion any time soon.&quot; Resigned to defeat, Schembri has
now obtained his teaching credential and hopes to find work at
a community college for additional income. Schembri also spends
more of his time serving his community as a volunteer. He works
for a number of local causes, including his neighborhood association,
Meals on Wheels, and fundraising for a program to aid needy children
and their families.
<P>
But Peter Schembri is not the only victim of discrimination here.
Not only were his dreams dimmed by the discriminatory policies
of the San Francisco Fire Department, but also those of two poor
immigrant parents from Malta who gave everything of themselves
for their children, and asked only that they be given their fair
chance in the land of opportunity. 
<P>
Just a few months ago Peter finally summoned the courage to tell
his parents, now in their 80s, that he again did not receive the
promotion to lieutenant he has sought for so long. 
<P>
&quot;All those years my parents never took time off, never took
a vacation. They never bought anything for themselves, they were
dedicated to their children. I would like to be able to go to
them some day and say, 'I've worked hard and look at what I've
done. Thank you for the opportunities you've given me.' It really
hurts to go back and tell them what has happened.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>A House Divided: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Janice Camarena Story</I></CENTER>
<P>
Janice Camarena is an unlikely crusader. She left an unstable
home at the age of 15. Within a year she was pregnant with the
first of two children she would have with a drifter. As her classmates
were graduating from high school, Janice was alone in San Diego
with a baby, no diploma, no husband, no home, and no job. 
<P>
One day Janice encountered a high school friend named Jeff Camarena,
and her careworn life suddenly brightened. She and Jeff fell in
love and were soon married. Little Jessica was born in August
of 1988, and the struggling couple looked ambitiously and optimistically
to the future. 
<P>
Jeff had just landed a job in their hometown of Crestline, in
neighboring San Bernardino County. Two weeks after Jessica's birth,
he set out to look for a small home for his young family. He would
stay with his parents in Crestline, and return on Saturday to
help Janice pack their few belongings. 
<P>
Jeff, however, would never make it home. Climbing the hill to
his parent's house, a climb he made thousands of times before,
he died of heart failure from an undiscovered heart defect. A
passer-by discovered Jeff's body, laying half-way up the hilly
path that led to the back door. He was 19 years old.
<P>
Because Jeff had died from natural causes, the couple's accident
insurance was useless. Janice was now 18-years old, a widow, penniless,
and without a high school diploma. She also had a two-week old
baby and a two-year old toddler who were now depending solely
on her.
<P>
The next three years would have crushed most people. Janice supplemented
her meager social security checks with baby-sitting jobs. She
made a vulnerable target when the father of her first child returned
in 1990. He stayed just long enough to leave her with a third
child; she was four months pregnant when he walked out for the
second and last time. 
<P>
&quot;The bills were piling up and I knew I had to do something,&quot;
Janice remembered. She knew that the future of her three young
children would be bleak if she didn't take dramatic steps to pull
herself together and improve her prospects for employment. In
the months of despair that followed, a childhood dream of becoming
a nurse flickered back to life. As a child, Janice had succored
pill-bugs in a cardboard hospital, dreaming of the day when she
could become a nurse. But in the years since Jeff's death she
hadn't dared to think about it. Now, necessity intervened. 
<P>
Janice obtained her high school proficiency certificate and in
the spring of 1993 enrolled in an English course at San Bernardino
Valley Community College. She discovered she couldn't balance
her time commitments, and dropped the course before it began.
That summer, she finally took the plunge, taking a single class
in speech. It was the first class she had taken in eight years;
but the plucky high school drop-out received her first &quot;A.&quot;
The next semester, Janice enrolled in an algebra and psychology
class, somehow managing to juggle the schedules of her three children,
her classes, and the few odd jobs she was able to do, including
baby-sitting and working in an arcade.
<P>
&quot;Christmas was always a stressful time for our family,&quot;
Janice recalled, but the Christmas of 1993-the sixth since Jeff
had died-offered the family its first real glimmer of hope. Janice
aced both of her classes, and now had every reason to believe
that a career in nursing was more than just a child's pipe-dream.
The fire department helped with toys that year for Janice's three
little girls. &quot;But we were getting further behind on bills
and I needed to graduate as quickly as possible,&quot; Janice
said. &quot;And to qualify for grants, I needed to take at least
12 units that semester.&quot;
<P>
Taking 12 units of college courses, continuing her odd jobs and
conforming to her children's needs meant that Janice needed to
piece together an intricate puzzle of a schedule. There was one
break: the English 101 course required for her degree offered
34 different time slots, and one of those fit perfectly.
<P>
On January 19, 1994, Janice Camarena took her seat in the classroom
and began fidgeting with her pen. According to Janice, something
didn't feel right: she sensed a restlessness and even hostility
around her. She began to feel very uncomfortable.
<P>
Instructor Diana Anderson glared at her, and Janice knew something
was terribly wrong. &quot;This class is for African-American students
only,&quot; Anderson said coldly. &quot;You'll have to leave.&quot;
The restlessness in the classroom suddenly erupted into jeers
and derisive laughter. Janice packed her things and quickly left
the class. 
<P>
She was between tears and anger as she hurried to the administration
building, groping for the words she would need to convey her experience
to college officials. &quot;I was shocked about it and I thought,
this can't be happening. Did I just get kicked out of this class
because I was white?&quot;
<P>
College administrators were unsympathetic. They explained the
class was for disadvantaged students and that Janice had no right
to be there. She thought of the obstacles she had surmounted.
Janice later talked to one of the students in the program. &quot;She
was telling me how great the program was. Her mom and dad were
both doctors.&quot;
<P>
Janice barely held her composure until she left the building.
&quot;I was standing by a tree, and I was really crying,&quot;
she remembered. &quot;The speech teacher I had the first semester
walked by just then. He saw me crying and asked what was wrong
and I told him. He said he would check into the program from his
side. He called me later that evening and said that he didn't
agree with it, but there wasn't anything he could do.&quot; 
<P>
The class Janice had intruded upon was part of a preferential
curriculum called the &quot;Bridge&quot; Program, and offered
qualifying students an inside track to the prestigious University
of California. Students who met the program's qualifications received
their own personal counselor, a professional off-campus mentor,
special computer services, and a stream of invitations to private
seminars and receptions with academic and professional leaders.
<P>
The qualification to enter this world of privilege was quite uncomplicated.
One had to be born a certain color, and Janice Camarena failed
the entrance exam.
<P>
As Janice scrambled to find another English class, she learned
that the college also operated a similar program for Hispanic
students, called the Puente Project. This hit Janice harder than
anything she had yet learned about the new, racially segregated
college society. She thought about her own three children. Jeff's
grandparents had immigrated from Mexico, so Jessica would qualify
for the program. Ashley and Kayla would be unceremoniously thrown
out, just as Janice had been. These college officials would drive
a racial wedge between the three little girls of Janice Camarena's
family.
<P>
Janice did not have the resources to fight the system. She just
wanted to be a nurse so she could better take care of her kids.
She tried to shrug off the incident, but it kept haunting her.
<P>
The following semester, Janice rearranged her life to fit into
a time slot for a non-preferential English 101 course. She received
straight-&quot;As&quot; on her papers. The final class assignment
was to prepare a research paper on a subject of the student's
choice. Janice quickly outlined her project for the instructor:
racially discriminatory programs. The professor was hostile. &quot;I
can't suggest you write this,&quot; he snapped. Janice decided
to try anyway.
<P>
Janice threw herself into the project. She interviewed students
who had come through the &quot;Black Bridge&quot; and &quot;Puente&quot;
programs. She interviewed Diana Anderson, the instructor who ejected
her from the class. (When Janice told Anderson that her own children
would be separated by the racial requirements, Anderson laughed.)
Janice devoured the few articles about the &quot;Black Bridge&quot;
program she could find. She learned of the landmark civil rights
cases of the 20th century, and her readings led her to George
LaNoue, a civil rights professor at the University of Maryland
at Baltimore. He, in turn, led her to Robert Corry, a young litigator
at the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento.
<P>
For all of his legal experience and success, Corry was not much
older than Janice Camarena. While still a student at Stanford
Law School, he had mounted a successful First Amendment legal
challenge to the University's politically correct speech code.
Since joining the Pacific Legal Foundation in 1994, he had made
national news by filing a legal challenge against racially discriminatory
practices in the largest public works program in the country,
the Los Angeles Metrorail. 
<P>
&quot;She wanted to know about the history of racial discrimination,
and I cited Brown v. Board of Education and other anti-segregation
cases,&quot; Corry remembered. &quot;We kept on talking, and she
mentioned her own experience. I asked her about filing a lawsuit.
She was reluctant to do so. She was frankly afraid there could
be retaliation from the school if there was a suit, and money
was a problem,&quot; Corry said. &quot;I told her I totally understood
her concerns by relating my own experience at Stanford to her,
having sued my own law school. I think she could have received
substantial monetary damages, but she wasn't interested in that.&quot;
For both of them it was a matter of principle that discrimination
be fought.
<P>
A few weeks later, Janice called the college to get her final
grades. She was anxious about keeping up her straight A's, and
was shocked to learn she had received a &quot;C&quot; in the English
class. Every grade she had received in the class had been an &quot;A.&quot;
How could that be? She made an appointment with the professor,
who informed her that she had failed her final paper, bringing
her &quot;A&quot; average in the class to a &quot;C.&quot; She
asked to see his comments on the paper, and found he had not made
any. He explained that poor grammar in several passages justified
her &quot;F.&quot; Janice explained that the poor grammar was
in direct quotations from English professor Diana Anderson. She
tape-recorded the interview with Anderson and could back the quotes
word for word. The professor replied that he would not change
her grade.
<P>
In March 1995, Corry filed suit in U.S. District Court against
the San Bernardino Community College District, the California
Community Colleges, and the University of California on Camarena's
behalf. The lawsuit received substantial media attention on evening
radio and television broadcasts, and was front page news in the
local paper the next morning.
<P>
College officials reacted immediately and viciously. San Bernardino
Valley College President David Singer called a campus assembly
the next day to discuss the lawsuit with faculty and students.
Janice was surprised to hear that the campus administration was
giving her case such public notice. &quot;I was in an anthropology
class when one of my friends came running over to me and said,
'I've been looking everywhere for you,'&quot; Janice recalls.
&quot;They're having an assembly about you.' I said 'Let's go.'&quot;
<P>
Janice and her friend took seats in the front row. President Singer
mounted the stage, played a video tape of Corry's press conference
and denied that the incident had occurred. He then opened Janice's
confidential student records, and in front of faculty and students,
announced that she had dropped out of one English class and had
just received a &quot;C&quot; in another. Janice Camarena was
obviously a disgruntled failure trying to blame the college for
her own problems.
<P>
Corry was dumbfounded. &quot;It was obviously a very uncomfortable
experience for her,&quot; he related. &quot;To be singled out
and talked about that way by the chief administrator of your school
and ridiculed...nothing like that happened to me [at Stanford].
But it backfired.&quot;
<P>
To Singer's amazement, the vast majority of the campus assembly
did not turn against Janice. They supported her. By the next morning,
several hundred students had signed a petition on her behalf.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Paul Craig Roberts wrote of the lawsuit,
&quot;Unlike many plaintiffs who have turned civil rights litigation
into a multimillion-dollar racism racket for such slights as dilatory
service in restaurants, Janice Camarena wants no monetary damages
for the undisputed intentional racial discrimination committed
against her. She seeks the simple justice of an injunction eliminating
her school's racially segregated curriculum, and she is willing
to take her case to the Supreme Court to get it.&quot; 
<P>
The University of California General Counsel, a powerful law firm
hired by the California Community Colleges and the state Attorney
General all stood against the 25-year old widow and her 27-year
old lawyer. &quot;It was very difficult to obtain the documents
we needed,&quot; Corry said. &quot;At first, they put up road
blocks to turning over these documents, which are public records.
The whole point of discovery is to get at the truth and when a
lawyer puts up barriers to discovery they obscure the truth. I
think a lot of these programs are conducted outside the public
eye. If most people knew what was going on, these affirmative
action programs would not survive.&quot; 
<P>
When Corry threatened to file a motion to compel the college officials
to divulge their papers on the Bridge and Puente programs, their
resistance suddenly collapsed. Corry received a phone call. The
state of California wanted to settle.
<P>
A little over two years after she was thrown out of her classroom,
this remarkable single mother who just wanted to provide for her
three daughters, had forced the entire legal establishment of
the state of California to capitulate. 
<P>
In 1948, Topeka, Kansas officials turned a little girl away from
a classroom because of her race. The result was the landmark decision
that ended America's &quot;separate-but-equal&quot; public education
systems. Nearly a half century later, Janice Camarena forced the
106-campus California Community College system to renounce its
own segregated classes, and forbade it ever again to discourage
another student from entering a classroom based on that student's
race.
<P>
Lawyers in the field say that Camarena's is not an isolated case.
Whether this becomes the story of a single, transitory legal victory,
or the saga of a permanent constitutional prohibition upon all
racial discrimination in California, is a matter of intense debate
in the state today. Janice Camarena's experience, and the vision
she has for the world in which her three children will grow up,
is an important part of that debate. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
What do we conclude from these cases? Are they representative
of the wide body of experience with these programs? How do these
racial policies actually work in practice? How do they co-exist
with the strong societal consensus for equality? What harm ultimately
is done?<BR>
<P>
<B>Insights on Racial Discrimination</B>
<P>
No single story or selection of stories can faithfully represent
the experience of the broad population. Many of these stories
come to light only because of an extraordinary set of coincidences
or uncommon determination and courage on the part of victims.
Janice Camarena's story surfaced because a research paper for
an English class caught the attention of a top civil rights litigator.
Janine Jacinto would never have been sure racial discrimination
kept her out of California State University Sacramento's social
welfare program, except for a chance encounter with another student,
who, also by chance, had stumbled upon confidential instructions
for rating applicants. 
<P>
Contractors' stories are easier to obtain, since racial quotas
in contracting work are constantly at odds with older, merit-based
public contract laws that strictly require awards to the lowest
bidder. Those who administer these racial laws seem far more unabashed
in their pursuit. Nevertheless, for every contractor who chooses
to buck the system and incur ponderous legal expenses, how many
others meekly withdraw from the public contracts market, or close
their doors, or manipulate the system to meet quotas by sham arrangements
with minority fronts? One Bay-area contractor, denied WBE status
because her husband works for her company, told us of ordering
from her existing suppliers through minority-owned brokers who
merely add a mark-up passed on to taxpayers.
<P>
How many students face the embarrassment and trauma of rejection
with a simple shrug of the shoulders and the conclusion that &quot;I
just don't measure up?&quot; After her encounter with California
State University Sacramento officials, Janine Jacinto decided
to turn down admission to the graduate program for fear of retaliation.
As Janice Camarena discovered, those fears were well founded.
Her extensive essay on discriminatory practices at San Berardino
Valley Community College received a summary &quot;F,&quot; despite
an unbroken series of &quot;As&quot; on all her previous papers.
<P>
For every victim willing to tell his or her story, many others
shrink from the public eye, fearful of retaliation. The father
of one student whose case was particularly egregious pleaded with
us not to discuss the matter. &quot;My son has another year to
go [in school] and they can still get at him.&quot; A Los Angeles
city employee who filed a grievance action based on racial discrimination
in promotions said he was told &quot;'You've been labeled a trouble-maker'
and that I was basically stuck in my position for the rest of
my term (of employment).&quot;
<P>
Thus cases such as these offer just a glimpse of the public's
experience with these programs.<BR>
<P>
<B>Quotas in Theory and Practice<BR>
</B>
<P>
According to defenders of racial preferences, these policies are
not rigid quotas, but merely voluntary &quot;goals.&quot; Contractors
need only demonstrate &quot;good faith&quot; efforts to meet these
&quot;goals&quot; to qualify for public contracts. Students need
not despair; race is only one of many factors considered in university
admissions to ensure a &quot;diverse&quot; student body. 
<P>
The experience of Michael Cornelius, who lost to a much higher
bidder because he fell 2.5 percentage points below the MTA's &quot;goal&quot;
for minority participation, suggests a rigidity that is uncompromising.
So, too, does the experience of Hayley Ulrich, Amber Preshica
and Lydia McDonald, none of whom was among the 37 percent of all
applicants admitted to the University of California at Berkeley,
despite admissions scores which placed them in the top 10 percent
of high school seniors in the state, GPAs which far exceeded a
perfect 4.0, and extensive extracurricular achievements. The San
Francisco Fire Department denied promotion to Peter Schembri while
advancing candidates scoring 200 places below him, solely because
of his race.
<P>
We also learn that because of the way these quotas are often administered,
some groups face total exclusion from opportunity. For Don Ware
and Jack Bras, for example, it is more than just an unlevel playing
field; they have been locked out of the stadium. Although 23 percent
of state contracts are subject to set-asides, subcontractors like
Ware and Bras must absorb 100 percent of the burden to provide
mathematical balance with other sub-contractors who meet none
of the quota. (Abraham Lincoln once mused about the mystery of
a six foot man who drowned in a lake whose average depth was just
four feet.) Although quotas ostensibly apply to just 23 percent
of the state contracts, Bras and Ware have found themselves subject
to a 100 percent quota. These practices have pushed them completely
out of a market that they had earned a place in by offering reliable
service at competitive prices.
<P>
In Janice Camarena's case, the single criterion for entry to the
world of academic privilege through the &quot;Bridge&quot; and
&quot;Puente&quot; programs was the color of the student's skin.
<P>
Another theory is that these policies are carefully targeted to
assist disadvantaged individuals whose circumstances of birth
would otherwise deny them equal opportunity to compete. These
cases show us that the practice is altogether different, and that
racial quotas often victimize the very people they are supposed
to help. Nearly half of Don Ware's employees are African-American
or Hispanic. Yet because Fontana Steel's owner has white skin,
the jobs of all of the employees, regardless of race, are imperiled.
This is a particularly bitter experience for Ware and his employees:
they had struggled hard to earn a place in the market by offering
a better service at a lower cost than their competitors. What
they had earned by their hard work has now been denied them by
preference laws designed to &quot;help&quot; them.
<P>
These cases also teach us that these policies often heap greater
disadvantages on the disadvantaged and greater privileges upon
the privileged. How else does one explain the &quot;Bridge&quot;
Program? At 25, Janice Camarena had already suffered the injuries
of a broken home, widowhood, abandonment, single-parenthood and
poverty. Yet she was brusquely turned away from a class that admitted
a student whose mother and father were both doctors. In 1990,
the same California taxpayer-funded program in San Diego was criticized
for admitting the son of physicist Walter Massey, an Illinois
resident and vice president for research at the University of
Chicago. Meanwhile, the academically qualified children of Vietnamese
refugees who were legal residents (and taxpayers) of California,
were turned away.
<P>
<B>The Tactics of Exclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
These cases highlight several inherent contradictions between
the stated aims and actual results of officially- sanctioned racial
discrimination. The contradictions are further highlighted when
exposed to a fundamental and widely held belief in our society
that individuals ought to be judged on their own talents, merit
and performance, and not on the circumstances of their birth.
This consensus dates to the nation's founding, and has been a
constant theme through the most momentous epochs of the nation's
history, the American Civil War and the 20th Century Civil Rights
Movement.
<P>
These programs are practiced, perpetuated and promoted despite
the obvious internal contradiction with their stated purpose,
and the external contravention of established and fundamental
principles of equality. Such a formidable undertaking requires
powerful stratagems. These cases shed some light on the tactics
employed by the bureaucracy in order to maintain racially discriminatory
policies on such a vast scale.
<P>
One tactic common to many of these cases is official denial. College
officials assured Janine Jacinto that her race was an inconsequential
issue for admission, when in fact it was weighted more than four
times heavier than the maximum spread for GPA. Officials at San
Bernardino Valley Community College called a school assembly to
deny the existence of a program for which they had widely disseminated
promotional material. 
<P>
When Don Ware wrote to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and U.S.
Senator Barbara Boxer for relief, Brown replied that these laws
merely established &quot;participation goals.&quot; According
to Brown, &quot;They create no 'Affirmative Action Quotas' or
'Affirmative Action Statutes.'&quot; Boxer replied that such programs
&quot;may be voluntary.&quot;
<P>
A second, common tactic is silence. When Allan Favish requested
simple statistical information on UCLA's law school applicants,
he was told it did not exist. Only after he filed a lawsuit under
the California Public Records Act was the material finally provided.
When Janice Camarena's attorney entered into discovery, college
officials stone-walled until a court order was imminent. California
State University officials seeking to settle Janine Jacinto's
lawsuit out of court wanted above all an agreement that she would
never discuss the case. 
<P>
Silence is what stopped Amber Preshica at the gates of Cal Berkeley:
University officials would never give her a straight answer as
to why her application had been rejected in favor of less qualified
applicants. CSUS officials jealously guarded their admissions
formula for the graduate program in social welfare until an unlikely
chain of events exposed it. 
<P>
A third tactic used to perpetuate these programs is intimidation,
often quite viciously applied. San Bernardino Valley Community
College President David Singer called a student assembly, ridiculed
Janice Camarena in front of her friends and faculty, and revealed
her confidential student records after she challenged the &quot;Bridge&quot;
Program. Michael Cornelius endured withering ridicule when he
first challenged the contracting quotas of the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Transit Authority. UC-Berkeley Admissions Director Bob Laird tried
to discourage Lydia McDonald from appealing her rejection, telling
her attorney that nearly 95 percent of admission appeals failed.
<P>
A fourth tactic is to co-opt complaints when they appear to be
resolute. When Janine Jacinto revealed she had seen the CSUS rating
instructions, college officials immediately guaranteed her admission.
&quot;What does she want?&quot; the CSU attorney asked Jacinto's
lawyer at a preliminary hearing. &quot;Does she want into the
program? She's in.&quot; When Lydia McDonald obtained legal services
and litigation appeared imminent, UC-Berkeley officials suddenly
decided to admit her. When it was clear Janice Camarena's attorney
would obtain embarrassing material through discovery, the college
decided to cut its losses and settle out of court. <BR>
<P>
<B>What's the Harm?<BR>
</B>
<P>
Lawyers can argue the damage done to fundamental principles of
equality under law. Philosophers can ponder violence done to the
founding principles of a nation &quot;dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.&quot; Economists can assay the
impact of exclusionary policies in the marketplace. Sociologists
can fathom the implications of a nation divided along racial lines.
But in the final analysis, the harm done by racially discriminatory
policies cannot be understood in a macrocosm. 
<P>
There is a poignancy in these stories that cannot be glossed over
in clinical analysis if a true understanding is to be achieved.
The genuine impact of these policies can only be understood through
the tears of real people like Janice Camarena, Jack Bras, Lydia
McDonald, Janine Jacinto, Peter Schembri, Don Ware, and the countless
others like them. They are often Horatio Alger stories, ruined
by exclusionary racial discrimination that today is practiced
systematically by a government founded on the opposite principles
of equality, inclusion and fairness.
<P>
&quot;She really was not the same person after she got the letter,&quot;
Allan Favish was told by those who knew Lydia McDonald. 
<P>
It took all the courage that veteran fire fighter Peter Schembri
could summon to tell his elderly Maltese parents he had been passed
over again for promotion, despite every objective qualification.
&quot;I would like to be able to go to them some day and say,
'I've worked hard and look at what I've done. Thank you for the
opportunities you've given me.' It really hurts to go back and
tell them what has happened.&quot; 
<P>
When Don Ware reflects on the business his father started, he
talks about the responsibility he feels to preserve it for his
children and employees. &quot;I've done my best to take care of
the success of the company so that my sons could go on. My Dad
has given his whole life to the business. He had done without
his whole life and put all his money back in the company so that
it could survive. He's now an old man, and he's watching the company
get placed in a position where it cannot grow.&quot;
<P>
Jack Bras has simply closed the doors on a once thriving firm.
&quot;I've decided to let things just taper off, but it's sad.
It was a practice of considerable value, and now we've lost the
clientele we worked so hard to build up over the years.&quot;
<P>
What harm is done? One of the seminal writings of the 20th Century
Civil Rights Movement, by Langston Hughes, perhaps answers it
best with another question:
<P>
&quot;What happens to a dream deferred?
<P>
Does it dry up
<P>
Like a raisin in the sun?
<P>
Or does it fester like a sore-
<P>
And then run?
<P>
Does it stink like rotten meat?
<P>
Or crust and sugar over-
<P>
Like a syrupy sweet?
<P>
Maybe it just sags
<P>
Like a heavy load
<P>
Or does it explode?&quot;

<P>
<font size=-1><I>&quot;Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor
tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights,
all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer
of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no
account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights
as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;</I>

<P>
BACK IN THE COLD WAR, when the United States and the Soviet Union
divided the power of the world between them, Americans referred
to their country and its allies as the Free World. Supporters
of the Soviet Union did not buy this: freedom as they understood
it could only be attained through communism. Indeed, they looked
on Americans and other citizens of capitalist democracies as slaves.
<P>
A visiting Martian watching a Crossfire debate between a pro-American
and a pro-Soviet about freedom could only have become confused.
He would need to understand the debaters' near-opposite definitions
of freedom before he could even hope to make sense of the argument
or form a reasonable opinion of his own. 
<P>
So it is today with the debate over &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
This debate, which has plagued American politics for over three
decades, has become especially contentious in 1996 due to Proposition
209, which would amend the California constitution to prohibit
state-sponsored &quot;preferential treatment&quot; on the basis
of race, ethnicity or gender. [*The key provision of Proposition
209 states: &quot;The state shall not discriminate against, or
grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group, on the
basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the
operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.&quot;]
<P>
But as the affirmative action debate has grown in volume, it has
also grown increasingly muddled. There is a simple reason for
this: people on opposite sides use the same words, but mean different-indeed,
mutually exclusive-things by them. 
<P>
Below we will explain the different ways in which supporters and
opponents of Proposition 209 use four important terms: preferential
treatment, equal opportunity, affirmative action and civil rights.
In doing so, we will not present a comprehensive account of the
history of affirmative action. This has been accomplished elsewhere,
and we will draw upon that history as needed.<sup>1</sup> Rather, in focusing
on definitions, we aim at enabling ordinary citizens to interpret
the debate over Proposition 209 and make a clear-minded decision
on November 5. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Senator Hubert Humphrey, an old-fashioned liberal who spearheaded
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, defined &quot;discrimination&quot;
at the time as &quot;a distinction in treatment given to different
individuals because of their different race.&quot; This in a nutshell
is what supporters of Proposition 209 understand as &quot;preferential
treatment.&quot; 
<P>
Indeed, the authors of 209 purposefully wrote it to echo the 1964
Civil Rights Act, which outlawed &quot;preferential treatment
to any individual or group&quot; based on race. Likewise the antecedent
of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, ratified in 1868, guaranteed &quot;equal protection
of the laws&quot; to every individual American. 
<P>
According to this traditional understanding, there are two essential
components of non-preferential treatment: color-blind law and
legal treatment of citizens as individuals. To the extent that
the law recognizes race or ethnicity, or to the extent that the
law recognizes citizens as members of groups rather than individuals,
the result is preferential treatment.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
The &quot;Media Action Kit&quot; of Educators for Justice, a modern-liberal
group opposing Proposition 209, calls 209 an attempt to &quot;take
away a hard-won anti-discrimination program.&quot; This newer
understanding of discrimination arose in the early 1960s, when
a prominent civil rights group, the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE), endorsed the idea of legally favoring blacks as a way
to remedy past discrimination. 
<P>
Other civil rights groups at the time, such as the National Urban
League, stuck to the traditional view that was enshrined in the
1964 Civil Rights Act. But by the 1970s, CORE's idea had become
universally embraced by the liberal establishment. And the idea
had grown in two important respects: (1) Policies favoring blacks
could be justified in three interrelated ways: they could be remedial
as described above; they could aim at achieving &quot;proportionality,&quot;
whereby the racial breakdown in society is mirrored in the workplace
or classroom; or they could aim at achieving cultural or intellectual
&quot;diversity.&quot; And (2) these policies were extended to
other designated minorities and to women. 
<P>
To put this newer understanding of &quot;discrimination&quot;
or &quot;preferential treatment&quot; in a nutshell: race- or
gender-based policies are only preferential if they are unjustified.
In other words, what Humphrey in 1964 and the authors of Proposition
209 in 1996 call discriminatory or preferential-&quot;a distinction
in treatment given to different individuals because of their different
race&quot;-is in fact not preferential as long as it is practiced
on behalf of the right people. 
<P>
This newer view of non-preferential treatment has essential components
that are opposite those of the traditional view: color-consciousness
replaces color-blindness, and people are treated not as individuals
under the law, but according to their race, ethnicity and gender.
<BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice</B>
<P>
The latest major court case involving preferential treatment was
decided in March 1996. The particulars are as follows: Four years
ago a woman named Cheryl Hopwood was rejected by the University
of Texas Law School, despite a high grade point average and impressive
scores on her Law School Admission Tests. As it turned out, Hopwood's
qualifications exceeded those of 24 of 25 black applicants and
47 of 50 Hispanic applicants who were admitted over her. At the
root of this was an admissions policy that had one set of standards
for white, Asian, and other applicants, and a different and lower
set of standards for blacks and Hispanics. 
<P>
Hopwood filed suit in a case known as Cheryl Hopwood v. State
of Texas. She argued that the law school's admissions policy amounted
to race-based preferential treatment that violated Title VI of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act. (Title VI prohibited racial discrimination
in colleges and universities receiving federal money.) 
<P>
In response, the university argued that its policy was not preferential,
but was rather aimed at achieving &quot;diversity.&quot; Here
is a good practical example of the divergent understandings of
preferential treatment: Hopwood believed such treatment had occurred,
because she had been treated as a member of a racial group rather
than as an individual, and her color alone had been the reason
for her rejection. For the University of Texas, on the other hand,
although it had admitted students based solely on their race,
this was not preferential treatment because it was justified by
a desired goal.
<P>
The University of Texas's admissions policy was ruled to be illegal
by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision that
was widely reported to have sent &quot;shock waves&quot; through
the academic world. Why shock waves? Because the decision included
a blanket statement that state colleges and universities &quot;may
not use race as a factor&quot; in admissions. 
<P>
Those who support Proposition 209 heralded the Hopwood decision,
considering it a knockout punch to preferential treatment. Opponents
of Proposition 209 took a fallback position: They admitted that
the University of Texas was wrong to have an admissions policy
where race was in many cases the sole decisive criterion. But
citing the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Regents of the University
of California v. Bakke, they argued that race can and will remain
in effect as one of various admissions criteria. 
<P>
We will look at a more common example of race-based admissions-more
subtle than the Texas policy, but race-based nonetheless-in the
section on &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; below. For now we simply
note that what opponents of Proposition 209 consider non-preferential
(because justified) race-based policies are widely practiced in
American colleges and universities. Indeed, in 1994 the Journal
of Blacks in Higher Education reported that in universities nationwide,
the &quot;near universal&quot; pattern is white acceptance rates
running at less than half of black acceptance rates; the difference
is even greater at liberal arts colleges.<sup>2 </sup><BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
A major bone of contention between the supporters and opponents
of Proposition 209 concerns whether the policies it would prohibit
amount to &quot;preferential treatment.&quot; At the heart of
this argument are very different understandings of the term.
<P>
By &quot;preferential treatment,&quot; the pro-209 side means
policies that take race into account and thereby give preference
to any one individual over any other individual on the basis of
race. They agree with the famous dissent of Justice John Paul
Harlan in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson. The Supreme Court
majority had upheld legally-sanctioned segregated seating on Louisiana
passenger trains. Harlan disagreed, writing: &quot;Our Constitution
is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among
citizens.&quot; 
<P>
In the context of the Hopwood case or of admissions policies in
general, supporters of Proposition 209 believe the way to prevent
preferential treatment is to delete any mention of race from applications
and ensure that each applicant is judged on the basis of merit.
<P>
The anti-209 side, on the other hand, believes that &quot;preferential
treatment&quot; results from a failure of government to use race
to achieve social goals-for instance, to achieve the same racial
proportions in classrooms as in society at large. Agreeing with
Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote in the Bakke decision that &quot;to
get beyond racism, we must first take account of race,&quot; opponents
of Proposition 209 hold that deleting race from admissions applications
would itself amount to preferential treatment.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
In a speech at the Wisconsin State Fair in 1859, Abraham Lincoln
championed the system of &quot;free labor,&quot; which today we
call &quot;free enterprise.&quot; Under this system, men are not
born into classes in which they remain throughout their lives.
<P>
Rather, said Lincoln, all men are free to rise as high as their
interests and talents will take them: &quot;The prudent, penniless
beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus
with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his
own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner
to help him. This...is free labor-the just and generous, and prosperous
system, which opens the way for all-gives hope to all, and energy,
and progress, and improvement of condition to all.&quot; 
<P>
This is obviously not to say that all are born under the same
circumstances, or with the same interests and talents. Nor is
it to say that bad fortune may not knock some down temporarily.
To the latter, Lincoln advised: &quot;Let them adopt the maxim,
'Better luck next time,' and then, by renewed exertion, make that
better luck for themselves.&quot; 
<P>
The following year, of course, Lincoln was elected president,
and went on to oversee the Civil War and the abolition of slavery.
His better known speeches on the evils of slavery, and his conduct
of the war, were at one with his understanding of free enterprise:
slavery was an extreme version of the class system of the old
world, which was based on the undemocratic principle that government
should impose artificial helps and barriers to maintain a predetermined
order in society.
<P>
Lincoln's doctrine of the free enterprise system encapsulates
the understanding of equal opportunity which animates Proposition
209. It has two essential components: Each individual should be
free to advance without any artificial barriers set before him.
And no one is guaranteed an outcome.
<P>
The Fourteenth Amendment, passed after the Civil War to extend
the &quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; to all Americans,
embodied this traditional understanding. But in practice, throughout
the country and especially in the South, many legal inequities
remained to hamper the opportunity of blacks. The 1964 Civil Rights
Act was intended to put teeth in the guarantees of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Supporters of Proposition 209 understand their initiative
to be a return to those guarantees.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
One of the arguments placed on the ballot by opponents of Proposition
209 says that its &quot;real purpose is to eliminate...equal opportunity
programs for qualified women and minorities.&quot; This newer
understanding of equal opportunity found one of its earliest expressions
in a speech by President Lyndon Johnson at Howard University in
1965: &quot;You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled
by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line
of a race and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the
others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely
fair.... [I]t is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity....
We seek not just equality as a right and a theory but equality
as a fact and equality as a result.&quot; 
<P>
There is still a distinction in this passage between opportunity
and result. Johnson was proposing that it is not enough for government
to ensure the former-that it must attend to the latter as well.
But to grasp what opponents of Proposition 209 mean today by &quot;equal
opportunity,&quot; we must see that they no longer distinguish
opportunity from result. 
<P>
In a 1979 Supreme Court case which we will discuss below, Justice
William Brennan dismissed the argument that the 1964 Civil Rights
Act prohibited race-based job promotions. This argument, Brennan
wrote, reflects a &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of the law.
In other words, what opponents of Proposition 209 mean by &quot;equal
opportunity&quot; is figurative: in effect, they use &quot;opportunity&quot;
as a metaphor for result. 
<P>
The essential components of this understanding are opposite to
those of the traditional view: First, equal opportunity is measured
by results. So to ensure it, government must predetermine and
act to bring about a certain set of results. Second, in order
to acheive these results, government must erect artificial aids
for some individuals and artificial barriers for others. As Colin
Powell wrote in his autobiography, My American Journey, &quot;Discrimination
'for' one group means, inevitably, discrimination 'against' another....&quot;<sup>3</sup>
<P>
We should also note that since President Johnson's speech in 1965,
the number of groups considered to need a leg up in the name of
equal opportunity has expanded. Various other minority groups-including
new immigrants-as well as women, have joined blacks in the ranks
of those seen to need special government help. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings In Practice</B>
<P>
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination
on the basis of &quot;race, color, religion, sex, and national
origin&quot; in the area of employment, engendered the greatest
controversy at the time. How could discrimination in hiring and
promotions be enforced without setting racial quotas? Senator
Humphrey responded that if the Act sanctioned quotas, he would
&quot;start eating the pages one after the other....&quot; &quot;Nothing
contained in [Title VII],&quot; Humphrey continued, &quot;shall
be interpreted to require any employer to grant preferential treatment
to any individual or to any group because of race...on account
of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number
or percentage of persons employed...in comparison with the available
work force.&quot;<sup>4</sup> 
<P>
Employment and promotions would be open to all, regardless of
race. But as far as obtaining jobs or promotions, government would
impose no artificial aids or barriers. This was in accordance
with the traditional understanding of free enterprise and equal
opportunity. 
<P>
As Title VII came to be administered and interpreted in the courts,
however, the newer understanding of equal opportunity came to
dominate. Consider a 1979 Supreme Court decision, United Steelworkers
of America v. Weber. The case arose when Brian Weber, a white
employee of Kaiser Aluminum, was bumped from a career-enhancing
training program. Assignment to this program was based on employee
seniority. But Kaiser maintained separate seniority lists for
white and black workers, and Weber was passed over by two junior
black employees. He argued in court that this policy violated
his rights under Title VII. But as cited above, Justice Brennan
dismissed Weber's take on Title VII as &quot;literal,&quot; and
the court upheld Kaiser's race-based policy as a means to a race-proportional
result.
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 209 support the literal understanding
of equal opportunity rejected in the Weber case. Opponents of
209 support the result-oriented, race-based employment policies
upheld in Weber. And indeed, while the history of Title VII over
the last 30 years is complex, with subtle shifts regarding what
test should be used to justify race-based employment policies,
such policies remain legal and widespread. 
<P>
For instance, when a 1988 report showed Hispanics were proportionally
under-represented by roughly 9 percent on the Los Angeles County
work force-while blacks were over-represented by about 17 percent-preferences
were tilted to the advantage of the former. Groups representing
blacks objected mightily, and Hispanics went to court to protect
their &quot;equal opportunity&quot; turf.<sup>5</sup><BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
For both sides of the Proposition 209 debate, preventing preferential
treatment or discrimination is the means to the end of &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot; But as they differ on the meaning of &quot;discrimination,&quot;
as seen in the previous section, so they differ on &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;
<P>
To use President Johnson's footrace analogy, supporters of 209
believe that government may help prepare people to run the race-for
instance, by providing universal education, as well as a &quot;safety
net&quot; for those who need help to get to the starting line.
But when it comes to the order of finish, government must remain
neutral. Certainly it should not aid or hamper individuals based
on their skin color.
<P>
The anti-209 side, on the other hand, measures equal opportunity
at the finish line. If the order of finish is not what the government
desires-for instance, if the racial breakdown of employees in
a given workplace differs from the breakdown in society at large-then
government must take a hand in &quot;fixing&quot; the race. If
it does not, it is derelict in its duty.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Even among supporters of Proposition 209, there seems to be a
semantic difference over the meaning of &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
To some, it refers only to programs employing preferential or
discriminatory treatment as traditionally defined: programs that
treat individuals differently on the basis of their different
race, ethnicity or gender. This has been the prevalent conservative
understanding for some years. Thus, for instance, the title of
constitutional law scholar Terry Eastland's recent book, Ending
Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice.
<P>
But to many other supporters of 209-including the campaign's leadership-&quot;affirmative
action&quot; has a broader meaning, encompassing also some non-discriminatory
programs. Commonly called &quot;outreach programs,&quot; these
aim to expand opportunity. For instance, to ensure that all high
school seniors have a fair shake at getting into the University
of California, the state might fund college-prep tutoring in schools
where SAT scores are historically below average, or an oversight
program to ensure that UC applicants are widely recruited. 
<P>
Thus Ward Connerly, a black businessman and University of California
trustee who chairs the pro-209 campaign, has labeled &quot;the
claim that Proposition 209 will eliminate all affirmative action&quot;
as &quot;preposterous.&quot;
<P>
Semantics aside, however, supporters of 209 agree on what the
initiative would allow and prohibit. Outreach programs would clearly
be allowed, as long as they are open to people of all races and
genders. As Connerly recently wrote, referring to an actual incident
of exclusion: &quot;No longer would people like Janice Camarena,
a white, widowed mother of three, be thrown out of outreach classes
because her color or racial background does not fit the template
of the institution.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 209 took California Attorney General
Dan Lungren to court in August, objecting to his official summary
of the initiative, which will appear on the November ballot. Lungren
summarized 209 as a &quot;prohibition against discrimination or
preferential treatment.&quot; Pat Ewing, head of the anti-209
campaign, called this an attempt to &quot;intentionally mislead
the public,&quot; arguing that the summary should state simply
that the initiative prohibits &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
<P>
A County Superior Court Judge agreed with Ewing. This decision
was overturned, though, by a state appeals panel, which described
the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; as &quot;amorphous.&quot;
<P>
We have seen that it is somewhat amorphous, even among supporters
of 209. But leaving that aside, opponents of 209 are united in
insisting that the initiative would prohibit all affirmative action.
This indicates that they agree with the narrower view of affirmative
action in the pro-209 camp: &quot;affirmative action&quot; describes
precisely those programs which do treat people differently on
the basis of their different race, ethnicity or gender. The difference,
as we have seen in previous sections, is that 209 opponents do
not consider such treatment discriminatory, as long as it is practiced
on behalf of the right people. As Justice Blackmun wrote in defense
of affirmative action in the 1978 Bakke case, &quot;in order to
treat some people equally, we must treat them differently.&quot;
<P>
Related to this, the ballot arguments opposing 209 insist that
it would spell the end of &quot;outreach programs.&quot; As we
have seen, however, this could only be true insofar as access
to such programs is restricted by race, ethnicity or gender. And
indeed, opponents of 209 seem to understand &quot;outreach&quot;
to require such restrictions.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice<sup>6</sup></B> 
<P>
The following headline appeared last spring in the Los Angeles
Times: &quot;Probe Finds No Bias in Berkeley Admissions: Policies
do not discriminate against whites or cause lower academic quality.&quot;
It referred to a seven-year investigation of the admissions policy
at the University of California at Berkeley by the U.S. Department
of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR). A Berkeley sociologist
who had a hand in designing this policy called the OCR's report
&quot;an historical vindication of one of the stronger and most
scrutinized affirmative action programs in the country.&quot;
<P>
But the report only concluded that Berkeley didn't &quot;maintain
illegal [racial or ethnic] quotas&quot;-implying that legal quotas
were maintained. In effect, OCR vindicated Berkeley's policy under
the terms of Bakke, which held that race could not be the sole
criterion in admissions, but could be one of several criteria.
<P>
The facts are these: Berkeley's admissions policy was designed
to achieve the goal of &quot;proportionality&quot;-that is, to
admit freshman classes containing the same ethnic percentages
as exist among California's high school graduating class. In order
to do so, it had to set different standards for applicants of
different ethnic groups, because in reality, ethnic groups do
not qualify proportionately. 
<P>
For instance, in 1993-one of the years examined in the OCR report-Asians
made up 15 percent of the graduating class, but 32 percent of
the applicants to Berkeley who met UC's eligibility requirements;
Hispanics, on the other hand, made up 29 percent of the graduating
class, but only 11 percent of eligible applicants. 
<P>
Berkeley, then, could only hope to approximate proportionality
by using different standards for different applicants according
to race. This was legal-again under Bakke-because it was incorporated
into a complex matrix system in which other factors also played
a role. But clearly race is in many cases one of the most important
factors-and in some cases the single most important factor -in
gaining (or being denied) admission to Berkeley.<BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Education-the bureaucracy in charge of
enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibiting racial
discrimination in colleges and universities-endorsed Berkeley's
race-based admissions policy, on the grounds that schools can
&quot;take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions
which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular
race, color, or national origin.&quot; Opponents of Proposition
209 applauded. 
<P>
For 209 supporters, on the other hand, Berkeley's policy exhibits
exactly the kind of discrimination the initiative is written to
prohibit. 
<P>
The sides agree that the program amounts to affirmative action,
disagreeing only on its propriety, based on their divergent understandings
of &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
as described in preceding sections.
<P>
As for race- and gender-neutral &quot;outreach programs&quot;-programs
to increase opportunity for the disadvantaged-they would remain
legal under Proposition 209. Many 209 supporters count these also
as affirmative action programs. Thus the ballot description of
209 by the non-partisan Legislative Analyst's Office explains
that it would mean &quot;the elimination of most [which is to
say, not all] affirmative action programs...run by the state or
local government in the areas of public employment, contracting,
and education.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT ARE CIVIL RIGHTS? <BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
The understanding of &quot;civil rights&quot; held by supporters
of Proposition 209 harks back to the second &quot;self-evident
truth&quot; in the Declaration of Independence: human beings are
&quot;endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;
These rights adhere equally to all individuals, based on their
common human nature-hence the term &quot;natural rights.&quot;
They include the rights to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; as well as property rights, speech rights,
and rights of conscience or religious freedom. 
<P>
The Declaration's third &quot;self-evident truth,&quot; then,
is that &quot;to secure these rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed.&quot; The purpose of government is to protect the individual
rights-now civil rights-of its citizens.
<P>
The pro-209 campaign hearkens also to the understanding of Martin
Luther King, Jr. and the pre-1965 Civil Rights Movement. In gaining
a majority in Congress and in the nation at large to support the
1964 Civil Rights Act, King and other civil rights leaders appealed
to the natural rights principles of the Declaration, asking the
nation to live up to its founding ideals. For instance, in his
most famous speech, delivered at the Lincoln Memorial on August
23, 1963, King announced, &quot;I have a dream that one day this
nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:
'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal.'&quot;
<P>
Civil rights in this traditional sense have three essential components:
they adhere to individuals, they exist prior to and separate from
government, and they ensure equal opportunity rather than equal
results. That is, each individual has rights equal to those of
every other individual, regardless of race; civil rights are neither
the product of government, nor can they be taken away by government
(hence &quot;inalienable&quot;); and the Declaration promises
a right to pursue happiness or success, not a right to happiness
or success itself.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Almost immediately upon the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
which was in line with the traditional understanding of civil
rights, a new goal was announced: the goal, in President Johnson's
words, of &quot;equality as a fact and equality as a result.&quot;
Along with this new goal, civil rights were redefined. Rather
than being rightful claims to one's own possessions, rights in
this new view are claims to the possessions of others. This can
be seen in the character of the new rights which have been posited
in recent decades; for example, rights to publicly-subsidized
housing, education, medical care, food stamps, and day care. And
with this redefinition of rights, the role of government was changed
fundamentally: rather than protecting equal rights, government
became the redistribution center for money, jobs, promotions,
college admissions, etc., all in pursuit of equal results.
<P>
The newer understanding of rights-held by opponents of Proposition
209-hearkens less to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and
early '60s, than to the Progressive Movement of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries. 
<P>
Philosopher John Dewey articulated the view of the individual
which underlies this understanding: &quot;Social arrangements,
laws, institutions...are means of creating individuals.... Individuality
in a social and moral sense is something to be wrought out.&quot;
That is, individuals are born first and foremost, not with rights,
but with needs, and are dependent on government to fulfill them.
<P>
And again, this demands a large and intrusive government. Woodrow
Wilson-a progressive political theorist prior to becoming president-was
openly critical of the parts of the Constitution, based on the
Declaration's natural rights doctrine, which limited the government's
power to regulate private or economic life. Much of the history
of American government in this century is the history of overcoming
those limitations.
<P>
The three essential components of the newer view of civil rights
are opposite those of the founding or traditional view. First,
instead of adhering to individuals, civil rights are assigned
according to group affiliation. Second, rights are assigned: they
are not seen as existing prior to and separate from government,
but rather as government grants. And third, rights are understood
to guarantee results rather than opportunity. 
<P>
One of the clearest indications of the revolutionary character
of the new understanding of rights came in a 1987 Supreme Court
case called Johnson v. Transportation Agency-an affirmative action
case in which a man sued a government agency for awarding a job
to an admittedly less-qualified woman. Justice William Brennan,
writing for the majority, asked &quot;whether the [gender-based
affirmative action program] unnecessarily trammeled the rights
of male employees&quot;; his answer was no. 
<P>
In other words, the newly-defined right of the less-qualified
woman to a job necessitated the trammeling of the traditionally-defined
right of the man to equal legal treatment. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice</B>
<P>
In 1961, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, prohibiting
discrimination in the employment practices of government contractors.
Those enforcing this order required contractors to submit racial
breakdowns of their work forces, in order to ensure integration.
This was in accordance with previous executive orders by Presidents
Roosevelt and Truman, as well as with the traditional understanding
of civil rights. 
<P>
Four years later, however, President Johnson issued Executive
Order 11246, setting up the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
(OFCC) in the Labor Department to oversee government contractors.
OFCC immediately began requiring what amounted to racial quotas.
Bidders submitted &quot;manning tables&quot; guaranteeing the
proportions of racial minorities they would hire if their bid
was accepted. These tables became quite controversial and were
discontinued, but the general practice of requiring contractors
to hire by race continued in various forms and remains in place
today.
<P>
The state of California has 45 separate laws requiring race- and
gender-based preferences in the contracting of goods and services.
Since 1988, for instance, competition for 20 percent of state-funded
contracts have been limited, in effect, to &quot;minority business
enterprises&quot; and &quot;women business enterprises.&quot;
Much of the commentary on this has addressed the enormous cost
to taxpayers. (For instance, preference requirements in state
construction contracts have been estimated to cost California
taxpayers $43 million per year.) But more basically, these requirements
raise the issue of whether affirmative action violates or promotes
civil rights.<sup>7</sup> <BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
There are two diverse understandings of &quot;civil rights&quot;
involved in the debate over Proposition 209. Behind them are conflicting
ideas of justice. The traditional understanding was reflected
in the Supreme Court majority decision in Hirabayashi v. United
States in 1943: &quot;Distinctions between citizens solely because
of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people
whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.&quot;
By &quot;doctrine of equality,&quot; the court meant the doctrine
that individuals have equal rights by nature. 
<P>
Under this doctrine, conditions of individuals in society will
vary greatly, because they are born with different talents and
interests-not to mention luck. Also under this doctrine, government
is charged with protecting individual rights and ensuring equal
opportunity-including maintenance of a safety net-but otherwise
gives free rein to the citizens' talents and interests.
<P>
The newer understanding of civil rights-the one that leads Educators
for Justice, an anti-Proposition 209 group, to call 209 &quot;the
civil wrongs initiative&quot;-grows out of a different understanding
of equality. This is not an equality of rights, but an equality
of results. Setting equality of results as a goal, it becomes
necessary to regulate rights or opportunity. The granting of special
rights to some, while restricting the rights of others, becomes
the task of government. This in turn requires expansive bureaucratic
government, rather than limited government: as the bureaucrat
in charge of OFCC candidly admitted with regard to affirmative
action in 1967, it justifies &quot;anything that you have to do
to get results.&quot;<sup>8</sup><BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Those on opposite sides of the Proposition 209 debate are not
above calling each other liars. But our assumption in this &quot;Citizen's
Guide&quot; has been that neither side is untruthful. Rather they
are using the same terms for near-opposite things. We have outlined
their different understandings of four terms: preferential treatment
or discrimination, equal opportunity, affirmative action and civil
rights. And we have looked at the practical effects of their differences
in three areas: college and university admissions, job hiring
and promotions, and public contracting. 
<P>
Having done so, we hope that when supporters of 209 say, &quot;We
are for equal opportunity and against preferential treatment,&quot;
and opponents respond, &quot;No, we are for equal opportunity,
and you are for discrimination&quot;-or when opponents charge
that 209 prohibits outreach programs, and supporters reply that
non-preferential affirmative action will remain legal-citizens
who have read this guide will be able to cope. 
<P>
In brief, the key to the confusion surrounding the 209 debate-as
discussed most directly in our section on &quot;civil rights&quot;-is
that a new view of justice arose relatively recently in America
which is opposed to the founding or traditional view. Many important
terms-including &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;rights&quot;-were
redefined to support this new view. So far, neither the founding
view or the newer view of justice has completely won out, so dual
(and dueling) sets of definitions remain current. Voters in California
this November will begin a decision-to be completed by voters
in subsequent elections nationwide-as to which set will finally
be relegated to the &quot;dustbin of history.&quot;<BR>

<P>
IN THE LATE SPRING NOT SO VERY LONG AGO, Yang-pat Au a 17-year-old
from San Jose, California received a thin letter in the mail that
every high school senior dreads. It was a rejection from his college
of choice, the University of California at Berkeley. That someone
with Au's record-first in his class, straight As, 98th percentile
SAT scores, Junior Achievement, two varsity letters, a seat on
the Student Council, and numerous awards and scholarships-should
be rejected suggests that Berkeley's admissions standards must
be very high indeed.
<P>
And so they are. But high standards alone do not explain Au's
rejection, because many hundreds of such students with less impressive
credentials were admitted that same year.<SUP>1</SUP> 
<P>
Every year hundreds of students are admitted to every University
of California undergraduate campus and professional school, whose
qualifications fall well short of those of many other hundreds
of students who are not so lucky. Academic credentials are not
the only, or even most important, standard of admission.
<P>
Similarly puzzling things happen outside the academic world. Take,
for instance, the experience of Randy Perch. Perch, who owns a
construction firm in Colorado Springs, submitted the low bid on
a project to build the guardrails for a federal highway. But he
was not awarded the contract. 
<P>
Why not? Because unlike most clients of contractors, the U.S.
Department of Transportation does not consider a competitive bid
to be the prime consideration for awarding jobs.
<P>
Or consider Danny O'Connor. A member of the Memphis Police department
since 1975, O'Connor put his name in for promotion to sergeant
in 1988. Out of over 200 aspirants, only the top 75 would be promoted
that year. O'Connor's rank, based on his combined score from a
written exam, an interview, seniority and career performance,
was 56, yet he was not promoted. 
<P>
Why not? Because the department does not rely solely on a candidate's
performance ranking to decide who gets promotes and who does not.
<P>
What happened in all of these cases? Au, Perch and O'Connor are
were victims-just three of countless others-of a policy known
as &quot;Affirmative Action,&quot; a euphemism bold even by the
loose standards of public relations firms and politicians. 
<P>
Affirmative action is, or is supposed to be, a systematic effort
by governments and private organizations to help &quot;historically
underrepresented groups&quot; participate more fully in mainstream
society-especially in employment and education. The phrase &quot;historically
under-represented groups&quot; is a code for racial and ethnic
groups favored by affirmative action's proponents and administrators.
And it has come to include women, who though not originally part
of the affirmative action scheme, have over the years become,
as a group, one of its chief beneficiaries.
<P>
If the above definition seems vague, that is because it is, and
deliberately so. It is what the advocates of affirmative action
say when asked what exactly, or even approximately, the policy
they so cherish is. But it tells us nothing of how affirmative
action actually works, because its workings are embarrassingly
inconsistent with principles that the proponents of the policy
claim to believe in-like equality before the law and the importance
of character, and not skin-color or gender, as the decisive measure
of a human being.
<P>
How does affirmative action really work? When you or I or anyone
seeks some opportunity from the government, or an employer, or
a university-such as a job, a promotion, admission to an academic
program, a contract, you name it-we will be evaluated, as a matter
of official policy, not as individuals according to our personal
qualifications or merits, but as members of certain racial, ethnic
or gender groups. Members of preferred groups receive preferential
treatment.
<P>
It didn't start out this way. Affirmative action began life during
the height of the Civil Rights Movement as an executive order
that directed federal agencies to make an active effort to seek
out minorities for positions in the government. Mostly, this consisted
of more diverse and far-reaching advertising of federal jobs and
more active recruiting tactics. 
<P>
The thinking behind it was that despite the success of the Civil
Rights Movement in finally securing equal rights for all citizens,
citizens who had been denied their rights for generations were
in no position to participate fully in society. And there can
be little doubt that this was indeed true. But unfortunately these
well-meaning-and perfectly constitutional-forms of affirmative
action did not last long. They quickly gave way to the system
we have today, the one that has given us the cases of Yang-pat
Au, Randy Perch, Danny O'Connor and countless others.
<P>
That system separates applicants or candidates into racial or
gender categories before evaluating for college admission, a job,
a promotion, or awarding a contract. This is how Yang-pat Au,
and many others like him, were treated by the University of California's
admissions policy. Although his credentials placed him far above
a majority of those admitted to Berkeley that year, his file was
not evaluated according to a campus-wide standard of admission,
because there is no such thing.
<P>
Put simply, the University separates its applicants into nine
categories, five of which are based solely on race. The standards
of admission for applicants in those five categories are much
lower than those for the non-racial categories.<SUP>2</SUP> And
they have to be if the University is to meet its goal of enrolling
a minimum number of students from each favored racial group. 
<P>
Since Asian high school students like Au tend to outperform other
groups of students, were the admissions policy merit-based (read:
fair) Asians would make up a higher percentage of the unversity's
undergraduate population, while members of other races, particularly
blacks and Hispanics, would see their numbers fall well below
administrative &quot;diversity&quot; targets.
<P>
These targets-&quot;goals&quot; or &quot;benchmarks,&quot; as
they are called-are particularly obnoxious and thus carefully
disguised and misrepresented. There is a better word for them,
a more accurate word, but one that makes affirmative action's
defenders cringe: quotas.
<P>
For that is what they are. When a university openly proclaims,
as the University of California does, that its enrollment must
mirror the ethnic breakdown of the state or region from which
it draws applicants, that is, quite simply, a quota system. The
population of California is about eight percent black. That means
that no matter what, a minimum of eight percent of UC's enrollment
must be black. If there are not enough black applicants whose
academic records are competitive enough to assure their group
enrollment at a rate of eight percent of the student body, then
some remedy must be found. 
<P>
That remedy, it turns out, is to lower admissions standards, but
only for members of the groups that are not naturally filling
their quota. Can anyone imagine selecting the members of a professional
sports team, a symphony orchestra or a hospital surgical staff
in this manner?
<P>
And it's not just the University of California. Cheryl Hopwood,
who applied to the University of Texas Law School in 1992, confident
that her credentials were up to the school's standards. When she
was rejected, her first reaction was surprise coupled with resignation.
&quot;The only thing I could think of,&quot; she said, &quot;was
that the class the school admitted must have been very, very good.&quot;
<P>
In fact, however, that year's group of applicants was not substantially
better than those of years before. Just as in the case of Yang-pat
Au, many applicants with credentials far lower than hers were
admitted.<SUP>3</SUP>
<P>
The University of Texas Law School, like almost every law or professional
school in the country, attempts to enroll a minimum number of
students from certain prefered groups; in particular, school policy
mandates that 15 percent of the Law School class must be black
and Mexican American. 
<P>
Since enough members of those groups don't meet this quota through
open competition with applicants at large, standards must be-and
are-lowered to ensure that the 15 percent target is met. Simple
common sense tells us that when you have a finite number of any
commodity-in this case seats in an entering class-and you reserve,
or &quot;set aside,&quot; a portion of it for a favored group,
then people not lucky enough to be in that group are bound to
be squeezed out on no other basis than their group membership.
<P>
And so Cheryl Hopwood, who was not one of the lucky ones, was
denied admission to law school while 84 applicants with lower
grades and test scores, but who were members of the prefered groups,
were admitted.
<P>
It is important to understand the significance of dividing people
into groups for such purposes. It is nothing less that the denial
of the central principle upon which America was founded, and from
which all of our laws and institutions radiate, or used to radiate.
That is the principle of equality, the equality of each individual
citizen before the law. 
<P>
The Declaration of Independence states that &quot;all men are
created equal,&quot; but the proponents of quotas would rewrite
that famous phrase to say rather that all groups are created equal.
So when their material conditions vary, it is seen as a result
of racism or policy or both and as such must be remedied by policies
directed at the raising up of such afflicted groups, through the
granting of special, extra rights. It even gets to the point where
already successful or wealthy members of such groups get these
same &quot;extra rights.&quot;
<P>
But in truth it is only individual human beings that are equal,
and only in one, very specific sense: they are all equally human
beings, with equal human dignity and the equal rights to be governed
only with their consent, and to &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.&quot; 
<P>
These rights are not guaranteed to groups, because they do not-and
cannot-belong to groups. But they do belong to individuals, regardless
of race, religion or anything else, and it is the first business
of government to secure them. The most famous word ever used to
describe this understanding of government is &quot;colorblind.&quot;
It was coined by Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan in
his ringing dissent from the shameful 1897 Plessy decision, in
which the court upheld constitutionality of racial segregation.
<P>
Clearly, Yang-pat Au and Cheryl Hopwood were not treated according
to the principle of colorblindedness. Affirmative action policies
explicitly repudiate this principle as outmoded or even pernicious.
And the people who administer the policies will go to great lengths
to demonstrate their contempt for it. 
<P>
The examples can get bizarre. James Henry, owner of a Columbus,
Ohio, painting company used to do quite a lot of business with
the Ohio State University. Not anymore. His first indication that
things were changing was in 1983, when he was told that he could
not bid on a coming contract, because it was being reserved for
bidding by minority firms only. 
<P>
By 1989, Henry was shut out altogether from bidding on University
jobs, because the school had decided that to meet a general 15
percent set aside on all contracting, it would have to impose
a 100 percent set aside for painting contracts.<SUP>4</SUP>
<P>
This is indeed color-consciousness raised to new and offensive
levels. But there are even more bizarre cases. And it is true
even of such policies that do not require outright quotas, but
that nevertheless make legal distinctions along racial group lines.
We may call such policies preferences. They differ from quotas
only in degree and not in kind; both types of policy are based
on the same denial of colorblind justice. Most examples of merely
preferential policies have to do with hiring, and especially promotion,
or contracting. It is most prevalent in government agencies, particularly
police and fire departments.
<P>
Danny O'Connor learned this firsthand. He was not promoted because
his department decided, in the name of affirmative action, to
arbitrarily place a black candidate into every third spot on the
list. Seven of the original 75 top candidates were black, but
26 blacks were promoted, at least 19 of whom had a lower ranking
than O'Connor. 
<P>
And as for Randy Perch, the U.S. Department of Transportation
very vigilantly enforces a law that requires a certain portion
of federal contracting dollars be &quot;set aside&quot; (the government's
language) for minority- and women-owned firms. So the job for
which Perch submitted the low bid went to a firm that submitted
a higher bid but was owned by a member of a government-prefered
group.<SUP>5</SUP>
<P>
But perhaps the most outrageous example of preferential treatment
based solely on race is the case of Sharon Taxman, formerly a
typing teacher at Piscataway High School in New Jersey. Facing
a decline in enrollment in &quot;business education&quot; classes,
the school board decided to lay off one teacher. It came down
to two teachers, Taxman and Debra Williams, both of whom had been
hired at the same time and whose performance records were similar.
Taxman was laid off. 
<P>
Why her and not Williams? Bad luck? Perhaps, if you can ascribe
the result of a specific policy to chance: Taxman is white and
Williams is black, and the school board figured that, in the interest
of affirmative action, it would be more socially responsible to
retain the black teacher and let go of the white. 
<P>
This decision captures the essence of what affirmative action
is all about. In dismissing an employee solely on the basis of
race, the board followed, to the letter, the contemporary denial
of individual rights and equality in favor of the idea of group
rights. Goodbye, color-blindedness.
<P>
But perhaps that is too hasty. To be sure, the status of colorblindedness
in the contemporary justice system is degraded indeed, but recent
court decisions, some of them centering on the very cases described
in this paper, show rays of hope. Also, more and more people are
beginning to understand how patenly unfair quotas and prefences
are to individuals and how harmful they are to the rule of law.
<P>
This is in no small part due to the prevalence of cases just like
those outlined above, and to the increasing public scrutiny such
cases are getting. We should hope that they continue to be exposed,
lest our nation never return to the one understanding of rights
that not only promises but also can actually deliver, liberty
and justice for all.
<P>
And there is reason to think that we will. It has been said that
Americans have &quot;a passion for fairness,&quot; and that precisely
this passion made the victories of the Civil Rights Movement possible.
This is certainly true. But now that passion is being twisted
and abused. The government treats its citizens unequally, and
in the name of fairness, no less. It should not be able to do
this. The fact that it does shows that it no longer respects its
own first principles and founding premises. 
<P>
And if governement does not, there is nothing to stop it from
treating people in any respect it wishes, and a people so treated,
or even in principle subject to such treatment, are not free.
<P>
The fate of free government depends on Americans' &quot;passion
for fairness&quot; reasserting itself in the name of equality
properly understood, which means bringing about an end to quotas
and preferences and all the related double-talk. <BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;At the heart . . . of the Equal Protection
Clause lies the principle that the Government must treat citizens
as individuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic or religious
groups. It is for this reason that we must subject all racial
classifications to the strictest of scrutiny....&quot;</FONT></I>

<P>
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 represented the completion of a long
process to fulfill the promise of &quot;equal protection of the
laws&quot; that had been embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment
(1868). The Civil Rights Act was comprehensive: Title II prohibited
discrimination in public accommodations; Title VI outlawed discrimination
in universities and colleges receiving federal funds; and Title
VII ended discrimination in employment. Its commands were simple:
it was illegal to discriminate against &quot;any individual&quot;
on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national
origin. The principle that animated the Act was &quot;equal opportunity,&quot;
the idea that individual merit rather than the caste of race or
ethnicity should be the standard of distributive justice in the
nation's laws. No more powerful expression of a commitment to
equal opportunity can be found in the annals of modern legislation
anywhere in the world.
<P>
Between 1868 and 1964 considerable progress had been made in driving
race and ethnicity from the Constitution and laws. This progress
proceeded under the banner that the Constitution was color-blind
and that the laws of the nation were not entitled to inquire into
the race or ethnicity of individuals who were subject to the laws.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the culmination of a long campaign
to banish race, color, ethnicity, religion and sex from the law.
Its purpose was noble and its reach was extensive. The focus was
on the rights of individuals; its promise was the equal protection
of equal rights. With the passage of the Act, the civil rights
movement &quot;celebrated the formal achievement of its historic
objectives: a legal regime from which racial classifications had
been largely expunged, and under which the most salient forms
of private discrimination (in public accommodations and employment)
were finally prohibited.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUP>
Indeed, it can be fairly said that &quot;[l]iberals believed in
1964 that the Constitution imposed a rule of color blindness on
government; and a color-blind standard, for most civil rights
advocates, was the obvious choice to govern those areas of private
conduct addressed by the new legislation.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The congressional debate over the Civil Rights Act was the longest
in our history. Many opponents expressed the fear that Title VII
of the Act would eventually be interpreted to require racial quota
hiring to maintain racial balance. Its proponents vehemently denied
this charge. Senator Hubert Humphrey, the floor leader in the
Senate, stated that, 
<P>
[t]he truth is that this title forbids discrimination against
anyone on account of race. This is the simple and complete truth
about Title VII. Contrary to the allegations of some opponents
of this title, there is nothing in it that will give any power
to the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission or to any court
to require hiring, firing, or promotion of employees in order
to meet a racial &quot;quota&quot; or to achieve a certain racial
balance. That bugaboo has been brought up a dozen times; but it
is nonexistent. In fact, the very opposite is true. Title VII
prohibits discrimination. In effect, it says that race, religion
and national origin are not to be used as the basis for hiring
and firing. Title VII is designed to encourage hiring on the basis
of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
And in the peroration of his speech, Senator Humphrey sought once
again to assure the opponents of the Act that their fears of racial
quotas and preferences were misplaced: &quot;It is claimed that
the bill would require racial quotas for all hiring, when in fact
it provided that race shall not be a basis for making personnel
decisions.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>4</FONT></SUP> 
<P>
Senator Joseph S. Clark, floor manager for Title VII, was even
more explicit when he remarked that, 
<P>
it has been asserted that Title VII would impose a requirement
for 'racial balance.&quot;.... On the contrary, any deliberate
attempt to maintain a given balance would almost certainly run
afoul of Title VII because it would involve a failure or refusal
to hire some individual because of his race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin. What Title VII seeks to accomplish, what
the civil rights bill seeks to accomplish is equal treatment for
all.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>5<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
But once the Civil Rights Act was given over to the bureaucrats
in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to write the rules
and regulations for its enforcement, racial proportionality became
the test for &quot;non-discrimination.&quot; And, by and large,
the federal courts were complicit in approving the use of racial
quotas. Thus, an Act that was designed to prohibit racial discrimination
in a wide range of activities was transformed into one that required
racial discrimination. Equal opportunity became racial preference.
<P>
Affirmative action has a similar history. It began innocently
enough-indeed with justifiable altruism. At its inception affirmative
action was designed to ensure non-discrimination in the awarding
of government contracts. Affirmative action in this original sense
sought to enlarge the pool of applicants to ensure equal access.
In the sense that affirmative action is understood to mean casting
a wider net for applicants, it is arguably in the service of equal
opportunity. But the argument of this study is that affirmative
action in the hands of bureaucrats has come to focus on results
rather than opportunity, which has led directly to racial goals
and quotas. In other words, if the putative argument is that an
affirmative action program merely enlarges the pool of applicants,
the inevitable question that arises is &quot;how do we know when
the pool is large enough?&quot; If the results are not racially
proportional the inference is inevitable: the pool is still not
large enough. Only racially or ethnically proportional results
are evidence that &quot;genuine&quot; equal opportunity has been
achieved. Even the original affirmative action order, Executive
Order 11246, which speaks only of equal rights and of non-discrimination,
was immediately interpreted to require quotas. 
<P>
When President Clinton said that he wanted to &quot;mend&quot;
affirmative action rather than &quot;end&quot; it he was searching
for a non-existent middle ground. The Civil Rights Act of 1964
focused on individual rights; affirmative action programs, because
they aim at race proportional results, focus on racial class rights
and ignore the rights of individuals. There is no mending to be
done without rejecting this perversion of the American Creed.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>RACIAL PREFERENCES AND </B>
<P>
<B>&quot;THE AMERICAN CREED&quot;<BR>
</B>
<P>
NOTHING IN THE LAST 50 YEARS has harmed racial relations nor done
more to undermine the principle of equal protection of the laws
than racial preferences and racial quotas. Paul M. Sniderman,
a political scientist at Stanford University and Thomas Piazza,
a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley, have
documented that &quot;the new race-conscious agenda&quot; represented
by affirmative action programs &quot;has provoked broad outrage
and resentment.&quot; 
<P>
Racial preferences are so intensely disliked that they have led
some whites to dislike blacks--an ironic example of a policy
meant to put the divide of race behind us in fact further widening
it.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>6</FONT></SUP> Sniderman and Piazza
demonstrate, however, that racial animus is not the principal
cause of the anger and resentment. Rather, they have discovered
in their exhaustive analysis of racial attitudes that racial class
preferences offend the &quot;set of convictions about fairness
and fair play that make up the American Creed.&quot; And, as Sniderman
and Piazza rightly note, the principles of &quot;liberty and equality&quot;
form the basis of the Creed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>7</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Although unacknowledged by Sniderman and Piazza, the core principles
of &quot;liberty and equality&quot; derive from the founding principles
of the nation. The authors of the Declaration of Independence
enunciated the principles that would animate the new nation. For
our purposes here, it is important to note that the Declaration's
principle that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; means that
individuals are possessed of the natural rights to &quot;life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; These rights exist
by nature--they are not created by government. 
<P>
Indeed, legitimate government is derived from the &quot;consent
of the governed&quot; and instituted with the sole purpose of
protecting natural rights. Government, therefore, must be limited;
it exists only to secure the conditions that allow for the exercise
of rights. 
<P>
Thus government's function is to secure the equal protection of
equal rights by laws that operate equally on all citizens. And
the necessary foundation of the rule of law is &quot;equal protection
of the laws,&quot; a concept embodied in the principles of the
founding and articulated in the Fourteenth Amendment. No class
or caste barriers to the exercise of rights can be tolerated;
there must be equal opportunity for individuals regardless of
their race, ethnicity or religion. 
<P>
But the principle of equal opportunity does not guarantee equality
of results; indeed, the principle of equal opportunity looks forward
to inequality of results, but an inequality of results that is
not based on artificial class or caste status. Rather, the principle
of equal opportunity allows the full development of the natural
talents and abilities of individuals. The practical import of
the nation's founding principles is to enshrine equal opportunity
in the exercise of rights as the basic principle of &quot;fairness
and fair play.&quot; This principle is, of course, undermined
by a system that apportions rewards, not on the basis of individual
merit, but on the basis of race and ethnicity.
<P>
Preferential programs are premised on the notion that rights belong
to racial and ethnic groups, that an individual's rights are conditioned
by the racial or ethnic class that he inhabits. This notion comes
very close to establishing a caste system based on race and ethnicity
that is wholly alien to the principles of the American regime.
It has more in common with a system based on racial apartheid
than it does with a liberal democracy dedicated to the protection
of individual rights through the rule of law. 
<P>
As Sniderman and Piazza note, &quot;[w]hat gives the race-conscious
agenda its distinctive character, what makes the agenda open to
challenge morally, is that the principle of preferential treatment
runs against the Creed.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></SUP>
<P>
According to Sniderman and Piazza, the tremendous gains of the
civil rights movement were due to the fact that it sought equal
treatment for blacks and whites. This was &quot;consistent with
the American Creed.&quot; But on the &quot;heels of its greatest
successes, the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and [the Voting Rights
Act of] 1965, the voices of separatism began to drown out those
of integration.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT></SUP> 
<P>
Once the civil rights movement abandoned the American Creed, transforming
itself from a movement advocating and securing equal rights for
all individuals to one advocating racial preferences and quotas,
it lost much of the support that it had enjoyed in the opinion
of the majority. Opposition to racial quotas is not driven by
racial animus; rather it is driven by a desire to preserve the
principles that animate the American Creed--those principles
that protect the equal rights of every individual. Sniderman and
Piazza conclude from their comprehensive survey of racial attitudes
that &quot;[a]ffirmative action--defined to mean preferential
treatment--has become the chief item on the race-conscious
agenda. It produces resentment and disaffection not because it
assists blacks--substantial numbers of whites are prepared
to support a range of policies to see blacks better off--but
because it is judged to be unfair.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>10</FONT></SUP>
But &quot;[i]t is . . . simply wrong,&quot; Sniderman and Piazza
caution, &quot;to suppose that the primary factor driving the
contemporary arguments over the politics of race is white racism.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>11
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
<B>THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION<BR>
</B>
<P>
PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO RACIAL PREFERENCES and quotas has been constant
since the inception of affirmative action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>12</FONT></SUP>
A recent poll commissioned by the Washington Post, the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University, found that a
vast majority of whites (86 percent), and substantial majorities
among blacks (68 percent), Hispanics (78 percent) and Asians (74
percent) believe that &quot;hiring, promotion and college admissions
should be based strictly on merit and qualifications other than
race or ethnicity.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>13</FONT></SUP> Similarly,
numerous Gallup polls conducted between 1977 and 1990 consistently
showed that more than 80 percent of the nation's population reject
racial quotas and preferences &quot;to make up for past discrimination.&quot;
One analyst concludes that &quot;it is clear that, over a period
of 40 years, the widespread acceptance of segregation and racial
discrimination among white Americans has given way to massive
support for the general principles of integration and equal treatment.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>14</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Insofar as affirmative action is understood as mandating racial
preferences, racial quotas and racial set-asides, public opinion
overwhelming opposes it. Rather, there seems to be an overwhelming
attachment to the principle of merit understood in terms of equal
opportunity. In California, surveys published by the Los Angeles
Times in March and May, 1995 showed that whites (71 percent),
Asians (54 percent) and Latinos (52 percent), as well as a substantial
number of blacks (45 percent) support the California Civil Rights
Initiative, a November, 1996 ballot initiative that will end state-sponsored
racial preferences and racial quotas. What is more, the May, 1995
poll found a substantial majority of women favoring the initiative.
This led one commentator to note that different levels of support
among men and women &quot;barely attains statistical significance.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>15</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE RETURN OF </B>
<P>
<B>SEPARATE BUT EQUAL<BR>
</B>
<P>
IT WAS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT affirmative action could have served
the principle of non-discrimination without the use of racial
quotas. Had affirmative action merely meant that the government
would act to insure that only the most qualified individuals were
being hired, promoted, given contracts and admitted to universities,
the law would have remained colorblind. This could have been accomplished
through a system of rigorous audits and reviews. All qualified
minorities would have been confident that in hiring and admissions
decisions only the most qualified were selected. 
<P>
Even this would have required that individuals be regarded in
a completely color-blind manner and not viewed through the lens
of racial proportionality. Had affirmative action maintained this
high ground of principle, no constitutional objections could have
been lodged against it. But what is commonly known as affirmative
action today has nothing of this optimism, having lapsed into
a kind of cynical racial spoils system.
<P>
According to supporters of this system, the test of non-discrimination
is &quot;population parity.&quot; If blacks make up 15 percent
of the population, then they should make up 15 percent of each
university class; this is the only way to insure that discrimination
has not been a factor in the admissions process. When &quot;population
parity&quot; has not occurred, there should be &quot;remedial
action&quot; consisting of relaxed admissions standards or other
non-competitive devices to insure &quot;parity.&quot; In other
words, affirmative action is inseparable from the notion of racial
quotas whenever it assumes that lack of &quot;population parity&quot;
is proof of racial discrimination. The notion of &quot;population
parity&quot; sets the quota. And those who try to distinguish
between goals and quotas are simply obfuscating the issue. Goals
are quotas-no amount of artful dodging can obscure this fact.
<P>
It was more than 30 years ago that the proponents of racial preferences
and quotas assured a skeptical world that they would only be a
temporary measure designed to ensure genuine equality of opportunity.
Today, however, affirmative action is unabashedly looked upon
by their supporters as a means of securing racial class entitlements.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>16</FONT></SUP>
In the palmy days when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed,
everyone seemed optimistic that the final vestiges of race consciousness
had been removed from the laws of the nation. Indeed, many saw
the Act as a legislative endorsement of Justice Harlan's dissent
in the infamous Plessy case, the case that upheld the constitutionality
of the justly decried &quot;separate but equal doctrine.&quot;
In his dissent, Justice Harlan had remarked that,
<P>
Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates
classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens
are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most
powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of
his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed
by the supreme law of the land are involved. It is, therefore
to be regretted that this high tribunal, the final expositor of
the fundamental law of the land, has reached the conclusion that
it is competent for a State to regulate the enjoyment by citizens
of their civil rights solely upon the basis of race.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>17
<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Harlan's dissent had provided a kind of moral standard that steadily
worked toward the eventual demise of the &quot;separate but equal
doctrine.&quot; Indeed, the idea of a color-blind constitution
was the source of tremendous progress in subsequent years; while
that progress might have moved by fits and starts and at too slow
a pace, no one can doubt that between 1896 and the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 the Constitution had indeed become color-blind. But
as more than one observer has pointed out, racial quotas and preferences
are precisely the kind of &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine
that was condemned by Harlan's dissenting opinion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>18</FONT></SUP>
Justice Harry Blackmun, in his separate opinion in Regents of
the University of California v. Bakke, stated the connection between
affirmative action and Plessy's &quot;separate but equal doctrine&quot;
as clearly as it possibly could have been stated:
<P>
I suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an affirmative-action
program in a racially neutral way and have it successful. To ask
that this be so is to demand the impossible. In order to get beyond
racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other
way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat
them differently. We cannot-we dare not-let the Equal Protection
Clause perpetuate racial supremacy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>19<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Blackmun could have used the word &quot;separately&quot; in place
of &quot;differently&quot; without changing the meaning of the
sentence in any respect. In order to treat people equally, they
must be treated separately (&quot;differently&quot;): this is
the explicit meaning of the racial quotas and preferences that
form the core of results-oriented affirmative action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>20</FONT></SUP>
It is a new kind of segregation; this time, however, its supporters
believe that the genie of race can be released once again from
its bottle as a force for good. At almost the eleventh hour--indeed
almost contemporaneously with the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act--the civil rights movement abandoned the principles that
had served it so well. It was believed that new principles would
better serve the cause of human liberty and serve that cause more
quickly. But those new principles turned out to be nothing more
than the revival of the old system of &quot;separate but equal&quot;
and race segregation. 
<P>
The racial genie, after having finally been confined by powerful
constitutional restraints, was released once again. To say that
this was a dangerous move is a vast understatement. In the past,
the racial genie had always been a force for evil--there is
no reason to believe that it has miraculously changed its ways.
In fact, as Sniderman and Piazza have pointed out, there is much
evidence to suppose that the genie of race is the same one that
the nation struggled to put back in its bottle--it has not
changed its nature nor its evil ways. But today, its work is made
easier by the apologists of the new &quot;separate but equal&quot;
doctrine, because they portray the new racism--and the supposedly
new genie--as the best that liberal and enlightened opinion
can produce.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>DOES RACE MATTER?<BR>
</B>
<P>
IT HAS BEEN ARGUED BY SUPPORTERS of racial preferences that race
has always been a factor in the calculus of American politics
and American life and that it is naive or dishonest to believe
that the Constitution and the laws can be administered in a color-blind
manner. &quot;Race matters,&quot; we are told, and American society
will never get beyond racism. It is better to be straightforward
about the necessity of racial class consciousness and understand
it for what it is--racial classification to promote racial
class interests.
<P>
This view, of course, has never been a part of the political calculus
in America. Slavery, racial segregation, and racial discrimination
were always considered as a violation of America's deepest held
principles. Martin Luther King's dream that someday his children
would be &quot;judged on the content of their character and not
on the color of their skin&quot; was made possible by those principles
which ultimately derive from the fact that &quot;all men are created
equal.&quot; Abraham Lincoln, whose statesmanship also helped
make King's dream possible, called this principle of natural human
equality &quot;the father of all moral principle in us.&quot;
Lincoln insisted that the Declaration of Independence contained
&quot;the standard maxims of a free society.&quot; In 1857, he
said:
<P>
I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include
all men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all
respects. They did not mean to say all were equal in color, size,
intellect, moral developments, or social capacity. They defined
with tolerable distinctness, in what respects they did consider
all men created equal--equal in &quot;certain inalienable
rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;
This they said, and this they meant. 
<P>
They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were
then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were
about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact they had no
power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the
right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances
should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free
society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all;
constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though
never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby
constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting
the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.
<BR>
<P>
It was surely in this spirit that the nation adopted the Declaration
of Independence as the principled foundation of its political
life. And it was in this spirit that the nation fought a bloody
civil war over the morality and policy of slavery; ratified the
Thirteenth Amendment to abolish slavery; ratified the Fourteenth
Amendment to extend equal protection of the laws to all citizens;
passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of
1965; and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Those who argue that &quot;race
matters&quot;--that race provides the only principle of distributive
justice--simply reject the principles of the Founders, Abraham
Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.<BR>

<P>
<B>FROM EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO EQUALITY OF RESULT<BR>
</B>
<P>
IN 1954, BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION outlawed segregation in public
schools; later cases did the same for other public facilities.
Some have argued that Brown was the vindication of Harlan's Plessy
dissent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>21</FONT></SUP> In a similar vein, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 was said to have been based on the reasoning
of Brown and its progeny. In short, the Civil Rights Act represented
the national recognition of the principle of a color-blind constitution
and color-blind laws. The Act prohibited discrimination against
any individual in employment or in public accommodations on the
basis of race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex or national origin.
It had provisions to extend its reach to private companies with
more than 25 employees and to any educational institution that
received federal funds.
<P>
The important point, however, is that the plain language of the
Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination against individuals,
not racial or ethnic classes. In focusing upon the rights of individuals,
the Civil Rights Act was a perfect expression of the Fourteenth
Amendment's attempt to disallow racial considerations as the basis
for determining the rights of individuals. As the Supreme Court
once noted, the &quot;rights created by the...Fourteenth Amendment
are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established
are personal rights.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>22</FONT></SUP> Indeed,
the Civil Rights Act contained provisions disallowing the use
of racial preferences or quotas of any kind. The language could
not possibly be more explicit:
<P>
It shall be unlawful employment practice for any employer...to
discriminate against any individual because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex or national origin....Nothing contained
in this title shall be interpreted to require any employer to
grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group
because of race...on account of an imbalance which may exist with
respect to the total number or percentage of persons employed...
in comparison with the available work force.<BR>
<P>
But the ink of President Lyndon Johnson's signature had barely
dried when the movement to use racial quotas and preferences in
the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act began. Indeed, the goal
was to transform a law which prohibited discrimination against
individuals into one that required discrimination. The supposed
rationale was to use race as a means of &quot;getting beyond race,&quot;
to hasten the end of discrimination by engaging in acceptable
forms of discrimination now understood as racial class remedies
for past racial class injuries. Johnson gave the first call to
release the genie of race from the confines that had been created
by the Civil Rights Act. Speaking before an audience at Howard
University on June 4, 1965 Johnson said:
<P>
Freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of centuries
by saying now you're free to go where you want and do as you desire
and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a person who
for years has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him
up to the starting line of a race and then say, you're free to
compete with the others, and justly believe that you have been
completely fair.
<P>
Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All
our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.
<P>
This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for
civil rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek
not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as
a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a
result....
<P>
To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not
enough.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>23<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The sweep of this pronouncement was breathtaking: &quot;Freedom
is not enough.&quot; Freedom--equal opportunity--is not
enough because it may not produce &quot;equality as a result.&quot;
Restrictions on the freedom of some, therefore, will be the condition
for the advancement of others--those who came to be known
in legal jargon as belonging to &quot;specially protected classes&quot;
or &quot;preferred classes.&quot; Indeed, &quot;coercive remedies&quot;
were to become the favorite instrument of the vast bureaucracy
that was created to administer racial quotas and preferences.
Eventually, the courts, the Congress and both Democratic and Republican
Presidents became complicit in this enterprise to restructure
society based on racial class principles.
<P>
Equality of result and &quot;population parity&quot; are the concepts
that drive racial preferences and quotas. These concepts assume
that, absent discrimination, the races will freely arrange themselves
in the various aspects of political and private life in exact
racial proportionality to their numbers in society at large. When
this does not happen, the cause is presumed to be racial discrimination.
<P>
But, of course, when people are free they will never sort themselves
out in exact racial proportionality in their choice of jobs and
university attendance. Since the presumption is that lack of proportionality
is always caused by racial discrimination, the only way discrimination
can be overcome is to curtail the freedom of the decision makers.
Coercive remedies, whether imposed by administrative bureaucracies
or courts, have the purpose of forcing racial quotas upon society
at large. For the minions of the administrative state, racial
proportionality is the only proof of non-discrimination.
<P>
This policy, rather than seeking out actual discrimination and
working to redress it, instead presumes discrimination on the
part of everyone and fashions remedies based on this presumption.
This situation presents the alarming possibility of a nation that
may one day consider all civil rights to be nothing more than
racial class entitlements. 
<P>
But any nation with the slightest regard for the lessons of history
would never self-consciously allow itself to regard the rights
of individuals as nothing more than the by-product of racial class
interests. Despite assurances by proponents that the ultimate
purpose of racial preferences is to get beyond racial classifications,
it is clear that no system that requires racial classifications
for its operation can result in a decline in racialist thinking--indeed,
racial consciousness is exacerbated by racial preferences and
quotas because it promotes the dangerous idea that an individual's
interest is determined by his race. Those who advocate policies
based on racial consciousness simply have not thought out the
consequences, believing, no doubt, that a means can never become
the end itself. But that is exactly what has happened in the case
of affirmative action.
<P>
In its early years, the use of racial quotas and preferences was
based merely upon an executive order that required &quot;affirmative
action&quot; in the awarding of federal contracts. Actually, the
executive orders had begun as early as the Franklin Roosevelt
administration as a device to insure non-discrimination in the
awarding of federal contracts. Under the Johnson and Nixon administrations,
they became the vehicle for requiring racial discrimination in
the awarding of federal contracts. 
<P>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance in the Labor Department,
created in 1965 to oversee Johnson's Executive Order 11246, developed
into a huge bureaucracy to administer affirmative action--affirmative
action that was now understood to require the use of race to enforce
the belief that &quot;freedom is not enough.&quot; 
<P>
As historian Herman Belz has noted, in the hands of the administrators
at OFCC &quot;[a]ffirmative action in contract compliance was
directed at collective social and institutional discrimination,
rather than individual discriminatory acts . . . Implicitly resting
on the theory of disparate impact discrimination, the executive
order program constituted a simpler and more direct form of government
coercion than Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] enforcement
because it was not concerned with the legal question of the meaning
of unlawful discrimination.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>24</FONT></SUP>
OFCC operations were greatly expanded in the Nixon administration,
where affirmative action developed into &quot;a politically motivated
policy of racial preference.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>25</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had been charged with
writing the rules and regulations to enforce the prohibitions
against employment discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. Not surprisingly, the EEOC took a race-based remedial
approach to the problem of employment discrimination. 
<P>
Belz says that the EEOC was &quot;more ideologically militant&quot;
than OFCC, and that &quot;despite the very limited nature of its
authority&quot; it &quot;revised the basic principles of employment
discrimination law and began the transformation of equality of
opportunity into equality of result.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>26</FONT></SUP>
The courts also accepted the EEOC's reinterpretation of the Civil
Rights Act to require racial proportionality--called &quot;disparate
impact&quot;--as a test of non-discrimination. The courts
developed the view that the Civil Rights Act was only designed
to protect members of &quot;discrete and insular&quot; minorities
who could not successfully press their racial class interests
through the majoritarian political process. 
<P>
Congress was disinclined to challenge OFCC and EEOC policies that
were explicitly designed to promote racial class quotas and preferences.
To do so would risk the ire of politically powerful special interest
groups devoted to the promotion of racial interests. Eventually
the Congress joined the racial class approach to distributive
justice when it passed the Minority Business Enterprise provisions
of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE SUPREME COURT AND </B>
<P>
<B>RACIAL PREFERENCES<BR>
</B>
<P>
THE MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE provisions mandated a 10 percent
set-aside for minority businesses in local public works projects.
The set-asides applied to blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Indians,
and Aleuts. Challenges to the constitutionality of the program
came before the Supreme Court in 1980 in Fullilove v. Klutznick.
Writing for a plurality of the Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger,
a Nixon appointee, wrote:
<P>
It is not a constitutional defect in this program that it may
disappoint the expectations of nonminority firms. When effectuating
a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of
prior discrimination, such &quot;a sharing of the burden&quot;
by innocent parties is not impermissible. The actual &quot;burden&quot;
shouldered by nonminority firms is relatively light.... Moreover,
although we may assume that the complaining parties are innocent
of any discriminatory conduct, it was within congressional power
to act on the assumption that in the past some nonminority businesses
may have reaped competitive benefit over the years from the virtual
exclusion of minority firms from these contracting opportunities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>27</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Incredibly, Burger maintained that injury to &quot;innocent parties&quot;
is permissible when the injury is &quot;relatively light.&quot;
In more heady and perhaps less cynical days, the Supreme Court
always maintained that &quot;[t]he degree of the discrimination
is irrelevant.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>28</FONT></SUP> In other
words, the Court once believed that any violation of constitutional
rights, however slight or &quot;bearable,&quot; offended the Constitution.
Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how there can be &quot;slight&quot;
violations of constitutional rights. 
<P>
Although it may be true that the burden imposed by the MBE provisions
are in some sense &quot;bearable,&quot; it still militates against
the principle of equal protection of the laws--that rights
belong to individuals and not to racial classes. In constitutional
government, principle is everything, for it is precisely adherence
to principle that distinguishes constitutional government from
other kinds of government, and any violation of those principles--however
&quot;slight&quot; or &quot;bearable&quot;--should provoke
alarm among citizens.
<P>
Fullilove provoked a bitter dissent from Justice Stewart, who
wrote that &quot;in the exercise of its powers, Congress must
obey the Constitution....The statute, on its face and in effect...bars
the members of [a] class solely on the basis of their race or
ethnic background. This is precisely the kind of law that the
guarantee of equal protection forbids.&quot; Stewart ended his
dissent with the remark that &quot;[t]here are those who think
that we need a new Constitution, and their views may someday prevail.
But under the Constitution we have, one practice in which government
may never engage is the practice of racism-not even 'temporarily'
and not even as an 'experiment.'&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>29</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In the years after Fullilove, a badly divided Court exhibited
considerable confusion in racial set-aside cases, particularly
with respect to the question of whether rights adhere to individuals
or racial and ethnic groups. In City of Richmond v. Croson (1989),
the Court declared a minority set-aside program to be in violation
of the Equal Protection Clause. The city of Richmond, which has
a 50 percent black population, passed an ordinance that required
non-minority-owned prime contractors who were awarded city construction
contracts to set aside <SUP><FONT SIZE=2>30</FONT></SUP> percent
of the dollar amount of the contract for one or more minority-owned
business enterprises.
<P>
The city alleged no prior discrimination in the award of contracts,
but justified its action as a means of ameliorating society-wide
discriminatory practices. Writing for the Court, Justice O'Connor
concluded that, &quot;[t]o accept Richmond's claim that past societal
discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences
would be to open the door to competing claims for 'remedial relief'
for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal
citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity
and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences
based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs...We think
such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit
of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality.&quot;30
<P>
Indeed, it is manifestly clear that there is simply no principled
way to resolve such competing racial and ethnic class claims in
a manner consistent with the rule of law. Justice Kennedy accurately
expressed the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment when
he remarked in his concurring opinion that &quot;the moral imperative
of racial neutrality is the driving force of the Equal Protection
Clause.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>31</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C. (1990), decided scarcely a
year after Croson, raised the issue of racial quotas and racial
preferences in the starkest possible light. (Incidentally, this
was the last major opinion written by Justice William Brennan,
the most liberal member of the Court.) At issue in Metro was the
Federal Communications Commission's policy of giving racial and
ethnic group preferences in the issuance of broadcast licenses.
The purported goal of this policy was not to compensate for past
racial and ethnic discrimination, but simply to foster &quot;broadcast
diversity.&quot; 
<P>
Brennan indicated that the Court would accord extraordinary deference
to the Congress: &quot;It is of overriding significance in these
cases that the FCC's minority ownership programs have been specifically
approved--indeed mandated--by Congress.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>32</FONT></SUP>
A majority of the Court decided to make a radical break with precedent
in holding that the appropriate test for &quot;racial classifications&quot;
was not &quot;strict scrutiny,&quot; but the less demanding &quot;important
governmental interests test.&quot; As Justice Brennan remarked,
<P>
[w]e hold that benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress--even
if those measures are not &quot;remedial&quot; in the sense of
being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal
discrimination-- are constitutionally permissible to the extent
that they serve important governmental objectives within the power
of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those
objectives.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>33<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The novelty of the decision in Metro is breathtaking. Racial classifications
will no longer automatically trigger the most searching judicial
examination if they are purported to benefit members of preferred
racial and ethnic groups. What is more, there is no necessity
of justifying the classifications in terms of providing remedies
for victims of discrimination; nor was there any necessity of
demonstrating that preferential policies to encourage minority
ownership would in fact lead to programming &quot;diversity.&quot;
It is enough, Brennan wrote, that &quot;both Congress and the
FCC maintain simply that expanded minority ownership of broadcast
outlets will, in the aggregate, result in broadcast diversity.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>34</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Assuming, arguendo, that &quot;broadcast diversity&quot; serves
important governmental interests, there seems to be some doubt
even in Brennan's mind that the means chosen by the FCC to promote
&quot;diversity&quot; are substantially related to that interest.
&quot;While we are under no illusion,&quot; Brennan admitted,
&quot;that members of a particular minority group share some cohesive,
collective viewpoint, we believe it a legitimate inference for
Congress and the Commission to draw that as more minorities gain
ownership and policymaking roles in the media, varying perspectives
will be more fairly represented on the airwaves.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>35</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Assuming that members of racial or ethnic groups share the same
opinions and viewpoints would, of course, partake of the kind
of &quot;impermissible stereotyping&quot; that the Court had previously
ruled was disallowed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. But as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her dissenting
opinion, when the FCC wanted to undertake a study to determine
whether the nexus between minority ownership and broadcast diversity
existed to any significant degree, &quot;Congress barred the FCC's
attempt to initiate that examination&quot; through its control
over &quot;appropriations measures.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>36</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Without a clear demonstration of the nexus, however, the race-conscious
policy cannot be said to serve an important government interest.
The racial classifications in the FCC policy were thus merely
based on assumptions and inferences. One does not have to be well
steeped in the lessons of history to see the danger of using racial
classifications in such an open and exploitive manner.
<P>
Brennan concluded his majority opinion in Metro by repeating the
arguments in Fullilove that the racial policies involved in the
FCC programs do not &quot;impose impermissible burdens on nonminorities.&quot;
Of course, &quot;innocent persons may be called upon&quot; to
bear the burden of eradicating the present effects of past discrimination,
a discrimination in which they played no role. This is all acceptable
within the universe of the new &quot;separate but equal&quot;
doctrine because policies such as those of the FCC do &quot;not
impose an undue burden on non-minorities.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>37</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In practice, however, the FCC policy of allowing &quot;minority-led
investor groups&quot; to bid on licenses had led, not indeed to
broadcast diversity, but to buying and selling of licenses at
extraordinary profits for investors from preferred racial and
ethnic groups. Many wealthy minorities have reaped tidy profits
from this policy, including Julius Erving, O.J. Simpson and Colin
Powell. 
<P>
Following revelations that the FCC policy would lead to obscene
profits and tax breaks for a former general counsel to the FCC
who was heading a &quot;minority led investor group,&quot; Congress,
in February, 1995, passed a bill--signed with the greatest
reluctance by President Clinton--repealing the FCC program.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>38</FONT></SUP>
Although the Republican-led Congress has recently given up its
attempt to pass legislation sponsored by Senator Bob Dole and
Representative Charles Canady to repeal all federal programs--more
than 160!--involving racial preferences, the repeal of the
FCC program could well signal the beginning of a long term project
to eliminate all racial preferences and set-asides from the law.
Both justice and policy demand such a result.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE BEGINNING OF THE END </B>
<P>
<B>OF RACIAL PREFERENCES<BR>
</B>
<P>
IN 1995, IT APPEARED THAT THE JUDICIAL TIDE was beginning to turn
against the kind of reckless use of racial classifications that
the Metro Court approved. The Supreme Court has, in recent cases,
squarely faced the issue of whether rights belong to racial and
ethnic groups or to individuals, and it has emphatically decided
in favor of the latter. 
<P>
The Supreme Court, after much confusion and not a little sleight
of hand, has finally decided to honor the original intent of the
Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pena (1995) was the first case. At issue was a Department
of Transportation racial and ethnic set-aside program that provided
financial incentives to general contractors to give sub-contracts
to minorities. Adarand had lost a bid to a minority controlled
subcontractor even though he had submitted the lowest bid for
the project. Minority controlled construction firms have to be
certified by the Small Business Administration as either &quot;socially
disadvantaged&quot; or &quot;economically disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
SBA regulations, however, presume that members of designated minority
groups--black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian,
Native American and &quot;members of other groups designated from
time to time by SBA&quot;--are &quot;entitled to a race-based
presumption of social and economic disadvantage.&quot; In practice,
many of the minority-controlled construction firms are headed
by wealthy minorities who play the game of racial and ethnic preferences
with consummate skill. Justice O'Connor, writing for a majority
of the Court in Adarand, overruled the Metro Broadcasting decision,
insofar as Metro had established relaxed standards for allowing
the government to classify on the basis of race. The principal
defect of the majority opinion in Metro, according to O'Connor,
was that it failed to recognize
<P>
the basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution protect persons, not groups. It follows from
that principle that all governmental action based on race--a
group classification long recognized as &quot;in most circumstances
irrelevant and therefore prohibited&quot;--should be subjected
to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right
to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. These
ideas have long been central to this Court's understanding of
equal protection, and holding &quot;benign&quot; state and federal
racial classifications to different standards does not square
with them. &quot;[A] free people whose institutions are founded
upon the doctrine of equality&quot;. . . should tolerate no retreat
from the principle that government may treat people differently
because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>39</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Thus Justice O'Connor reaffirms the principle that was well-known
to both the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and the drafters
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: what offends the Constitution
is classification and segregation by race, and the level of judicial
scrutiny should not be determined by whose racial class interests
are served. 
<P>
Justice Thomas made precisely this point when he remarked in his
concurring opinion that, &quot;I believe that there is a 'moral
[and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate
a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race
in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government
cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect
us as equal before the law.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>40</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In Miller v. Johnson, a redistricting case decided the same term,
the Court came to a similar conclusion: all individuals, regardless
of race, have a constitutional right, stemming from the Equal
Protection Clause, to be free from government actions which segregate
on the basis of race or ethnicity.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>41</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The Adarand and Miller decisions may be the beginning of the dismantling
of the new &quot;seperate but equal&quot; regime. Although not
entirely unambiguous and unequivocal, these decisions give the
country some hope that it may one day look forward to the end
of an egregiously mistaken doctrine that the Constitution allows
so-called &quot;benign&quot; discrimination. 
<P>
The idea that government can engage in &quot;benign discrimination&quot;
to benefit members of &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot;
has dominated equal protection jurisprudence for a generation.
Courts simply assumed that legislation intended to benefit, rather
than harm, preferred races or ethnic groups provided no grounds
for complaint by injured individuals in the majority racial group.
After all, we were assured, the majority cannot injure itself
as a class. If it can be determined that legislative intent was
remedial in a racial context, then individual members of the majority
cannot claim injury because it is a kind of self-imposed injury,
or at least not an injury suffered at the hands of another racial
class. For those individuals within the majority racial class
who are injured by the operation of &quot;benign discrimination,&quot;
their injury is surely &quot;bearable&quot; or &quot;only slight.&quot;
<P>
This analysis assumes that all members of &quot;discrete and insular&quot;
minorities have suffered racial class injuries and that all members
of the &quot;monolithic&quot; white majority have perpetrated
racial class injuries. As Justice Marshall remarked in his separate
opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, &quot;It
is unnecessary in 20th-century America to have individual Negroes
demonstrate that they have been victims of racial discrimination;
the racism of our society has been so pervasive that none, regardless
of wealth or position, has managed to escape its impact.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>42</FONT></SUP>
<P>
But this class analysis necessarily ignores individuals and the
rights that are intrinsic to individual, rather than class, autonomy.
Class analysis paints with a broad brush that necessarily covers
over the differing situations of the individuals who make up the
class.
<P>
The intrusion of class analysis into equal protection jurisprudence
is a dangerous proposition, one that is clearly at odds with the
principles of the American regime--principles that are ultimately
derived from the proposition that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;
Class considerations explicitly deny this equality because they
necessarily abstract from the individual and ascribe to him class
characteristics that are different--and necessarily unequal--from
those of individuals inhabiting other classes. If there were no
inequalities implicit in class distinctions, such distinctions
would simply be superfluous. In the class analysis of rights,
it is not necessary to show individual injury because in a presumed
racist society all members of so-called &quot;discrete and insular
minorities&quot; are said to have been injured as a class and
all members of the majority are said to have perpetrated racial
class injuries. But, of course, this is a very thin fiction. Black
or Hispanic immigrants who recently arrived in the United States
do not suffer the &quot;present effects of past discrimination,&quot;
any more than the sons or daughters of a wealthy blacks or Hispanics
who have attended elite preparatory schools. To say that these
people--merely because of their membership in a class--must
be deemed to have been injured by the operation of a &quot;monolithic
white majority&quot; is to pile fiction upon fiction. Preferential
admissions programs for the children of wealthy minorities that
are based on the presumption that the children of poor white families
have reaped the benefits of prior discrimination transforms the
rule of law into a farcical comedy. 
<P>
Whenever the government engages in &quot;benign discrimination&quot;
to benefit preferred races or ethnic classes, it imposes injuries
on individuals who are not members of those preferred classes.
It does not alleviate--or excuse--the injury to say that
it is &quot;bearable&quot; or &quot;relatively slight.&quot; Any
injury that must be borne because of membership in a racial or
ethnic class must be forbidden by any reasonable interpretation
of the Equal Protection Clause.
<P>
Justice Powell in his Bakke opinion pointed out the defect of
the class-based analysis of equal protection rights: &quot;There
is a measure of inequity in forcing innocent persons...to bear
the burdens of redressing grievances not of their own making.&quot;
Indeed, using class considerations as a means of fashioning equitable
remedies for such injuries as &quot;historic&quot; discrimination
or &quot;the present effects of past discrimination&quot; will
inevitably destroy the possibility of a jurisprudence based on
constitutional principles. It is only by viewing the Equal Protection
Clause as the guarantor of individual rights, Powell argued, that
the Constitution can ultimately be applied in a non-arbitrary
manner.
<P>
If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection
against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background
because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather
than the individual only because of his membership in a particular
group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.
Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular
classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance .
. .but the standard of justification will remain constant. 
<P>
This is as it should be, since those political judgments are the
product of rough compromise struck by contending groups within
the democratic process. When they touch upon an individual's race
or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination
that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely
tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The Constitution
guarantees that right to every person regardless of his background.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>43</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
As Powell pointed out, an adherence to a conception of equal protection
that disallows class considerations is the only one possible that
is consistent with the dictates of principled constitutional government.
Anything else simply makes protection of constitutional rights
&quot;vary with the ebb and flow of political forces.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>44</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Whenever government acts to distribute scarce resources such as
admission to state universities, preference in awarding of contracts,
awarding of financial incentives, or tax incentives, its principle
of distribution must be reasonable. In apportioning places in
the university, for example, it cannot assign those places in
an arbitrary manner; there must be a rational relationship between
the kinds of persons admitted and the end or purpose of the university.
<P>
It is true that no one has a right to attend the university, but
every individual has a right to be treated equally with respect
to the criteria for admission. The proponents of racial preferences
in California argue that current affirmative action admissions
programs do not admit any minority members to the university system
who are not qualified. It is a well known fact, however, that
the SAT scores of minority admittees at the University of California
are on average nearly 200 points lower than non-minority admittees.
This, of course, is a significant difference in light of the fact
that there is virtual unanimity among experts that SAT scores
are an accurate predictor of success. 
<P>
If the minimum standard of competence is set low enough, then,
of course, everyone is qualified. But the relevant point is that
the most qualified are not admitted under a system of racial preferences.
What could be more irrational and arbitrary in determining admission
to a university? What equal protection of the laws demands is
that individuals have a right to be free from arbitrary and capricious
governmental action. Certainly decisions based on the accidental
characteristic of race and ethnicity are inherently arbitrary.
<P>
A recent Federal court of appeals case has found the racial and
ethnic preferential admission program employed at the University
of Texas Law School to be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's
Equal Protection Clause. The University had employed a segregated
system of evaluation, putting black and Hispanic candidates in
separate pools in which they competed only with members within
their own racial or ethnic pool. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,
relying on the Adarand decision, noted that:
<P>
Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the
use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts,
rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity
fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities
as a group, rather than as individuals.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>45<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
And in a stinging critique of the separate but equal admissions
process employed by the University of Texas Law School, the court
concluded that &quot;an inference is raised that the program was
the result of racial social engineering rather than a desire to
implement a remedy.&quot;<SUP>46</SUP> In July, 1996, the Supreme
Court refused to grant certiorari to review the decision. This
has sparked much speculation as to the Supreme Court's motive
for the refusal. It requires only four members of the Supreme
Court to grant the petition for review. 
<P>
Surely the four dissenters in the Adarand case who wholeheartedly
support racial goals and preferences would want to try to overturn
the lower court's decision. But it is possible that they believed
that this was the wrong case to review given the current make-up
of the Supreme Court. Another strong decision striking down the
use of racial and ethnic quotas would make it more difficult to
restore them in the future. Perhaps the four Adarand dissenters
hope that a second Clinton administration will have the opportunity
to appoint pro-preference, pro-quota justices to the Court-thus
the delaying tactics.<BR>

<B>THE FUTURE OF RACIAL </B>
<P>
<B>PREFERENCES IN CALIFORNIA<BR>
</B>
<P>
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER among the States in restoring equal
protection rights to all its citizens. The Regents of the University
of California last year took the bold step of outlawing racial
preferences in admissions and hiring. The firestorm of protest
that was occasioned by this decision indicates the degree to which
entrenched interests have become attached to the regime of racial
preferences and quotas. Governor Pete Wilson also took a courageous
step in rescinding all executive orders that mandated quota hiring,
racial set-asides in contracting, and other race-based programs.
Most importantly, however, the people of the State of California
will, for the first time, be asked to vote on the issue of racial
preferences in a November, 1996 constitutional amendment initiative,
the California Civil Rights Initiative. CCRI attempts to do one
simple thing: restore to the California Constitution the understanding
of equal protection rights that animated the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. That act made it unlawful to discriminate
against any individual on the basis of race, color, ethnicity,
religion, sex or national origin. CCRI follows the trend already
taken by United States Supreme Court and supported overwhelmingly
by public opinion. Since California is such a trend-setting State,
the fate of CCRI in November may well determine the future of
equal protection rights in the nation as a whole. 
<P>
Those principles that animated the passage of the Civil Rights
Act are the principles that animated the American regime from
its very inception--in a very real sense, the Civil Rights
Act was a culmination of those principles. CCRI may well determine
whether those principles are to be perpetuated or whether the
country will continue to embrace the regime of racial quotas and
preferences that stands in opposition to the principle that &quot;all
men are created equal.&quot;<BR>

<SUP>16</SUP> An interesting debate has arisen recently in regard
to the uses of racial and ethnic categories by the Census Bureau.
One very hopeful sign for the future of race relations in this
country is the fact that the number of interracial and interethnic
marriages has been steadily increasing. This, of course, provokes
the question of how the children of mixed-race marriages are to
be categorized. Are children who are half black and half white
to be counted as black or white? Proponents of racial class entitlements
do not want to allow the Census Bureau to create &quot;mixed-race&quot;
categories because racial classes--and hence the racial demands
based on those classes--will be &quot;diluted.&quot; A recent
article in the New York Times (July 5, 1996) indicated that the
creation of multiracial categories was opposed by the National
Urban League, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza and the
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. As reported by Linda
Mathews, the objection of these groups &quot;is that the availability
of a multiracial category would reduce the number of Americans
claiming to belong to long-recognized racial minority groups,
dilute the electoral power of these groups and make it more difficult
to enforce the nation's civil rights laws. Dozens of federal programs
. . . depend on racial data from the census.&quot;

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in<BR> California Government Contracting</B></FONT></P>

<B>Introduction</B><P>

Government contracting is big business.  Federal, state, and local governments award contracts to businesses for everything from constructing buildings to purchasing paper clips.  The government says that a certain percentage of those contracts must go to businesses owned by minorites and women.  But when governments award contracts on the basis of arbitrary distinctions such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred.  Sometimes they are direct costs of preferential programs.  More often, they are indirect costs, caused by the arbitrary exclusion of bidders.  It is the purpose of this paper to examine the financial costs associated with these preferential policies as they specifically impact California government. <P>  

The estimates in this paper are very conservative for several reasons.  First, there are a number of bureaucracies and businesses (e.g., publicly-regulated private utilities) for which information on administrative costs is not readily available, and no attempt is made here to estimate these figures.  Second, qualitative and opportunity costs are incalculable, and no attempt is made to offer estimates in either of these categories. Third, the paper is confined solely to California state government expenditures, and does not account for similar costs incurred through cities, counties and special districts, or through expenditures affected by federal preference programs.  Nor does it discuss the private sector costs due to federal regulation of business practices.  The estimates are for Fiscal Year 1993-94, the most recent year for which complete numbers are available.
<P>

<B>Racial and Gender Preferences in California Government</B><P>

Racial and gender considerations now permeate virtually every aspect of California government, including the awarding of state contracts, the hiring and promotion of state employees, the admission of students to the state's universities, and the funds appropriated for school children.  Just for state acquisition of goods and services, there are at least 45 specific laws for race or gender based preferences, including provisions in the Education, Government, Public Contract, Public Utilities, Streets and Highways, Unemployment Insurance, and Vehicle codes.<P>

For example, under the provisions of Government Code sections 19790-19799, adopted in 1977, all state agencies are required to "overcome any underutilization of minorities and women in their respective organizations," and are required to employ affirmative action officers and to submit annual reports toward compliance with these mandates.<P>

In 1988, the Legislature adopted and Governor Deukmejian signed the most far-reaching legislation affecting the awarding of state contracts (Chapter 61/1988).  In a paradoxical construction, the Legislature first declared that "The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition," and that "Only through full and free competition can free markets, reasonable and just prices, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured."  As if to mock its premise, the act then proceeded to declare in essence that competition for 23 percent of the dollar amount of all state funded contracts should be limited to three arbitrary classes: 15 percent to "minority business enterprises" (MBE's), 5 percent to "women business enterprises" (WBE's), and 3 percent to "disabled veteran business enterprises" (DVBE's).  Although these standards are described as "goals," the act specifically disqualifies from bidding any business which has not gone to extraordinary lengths to attain the requisite race and gender participation percentages, regardless of cost.<SUP>1 </SUP>  Parallel provisions govern regulated utilities administered through the California Public Utilities Commission.  Even state bond counsels are subject to racial and gender preferences.<P>Nowhere are race and gender-based preferences as widespread as they are in the field of education.  For example, the Education Code (sections 87100-87107) requires college districts to hire faculty and staff that "reflect proportionately the adult population of the state," and establishes a "Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund" which in FY 1995-96 spent $2.745 million.<SUP>2 </SUP>  Extraordinary racial and gender based "outreach" programs are pursued by the universities, including separate "racial lists" for admission of college students.<SUP>3 </SUP><P>  Finally, one of the most expensive items in the state's race-based policies is the voluntary desegregation program, in which 45 school districts currently participate.  Although this is not a preference program <I>per se</I>, clearly it is entirely race-based in its application and is neither required by any court order nor justified by any finding of past patterns of racial discrimination.  According to the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), the program would be prohibited by the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would forbid the use of race and gender in the application of the law, and therefore is included within the scope of this paper.<P>

Overlaying all state requirements and programs is a similar web of federal requirements, affecting about 160 federal programs and nationally consuming an estimated $20 billion in direct costs and $96 billion in indirect costs from private and public sectors.<SUP>4 </SUP><P>
<B>The Costs of Race and Gender Preferences</B><P>
The costs of affirmative action can be divided into six general categories: 1) costs to government for administration, enforcement and implementation of race and gender preferences; 2) costs to government from above-market prices caused by reduced competition; 3) costs to government and private sectors for contract delays caused by challenges based on affirmative action requirements; 4) costs to government and private sectors for repairs and replacement due to reduced competition; 5) costs to government and private sectors for compliance with race and gender based requirements; 6) opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. <P>


<B>1. Direct Costs to Government for Administration and Enforcement</B><P>

In order to comply with the myriad of requirements for affirmative action, "a bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been established in virtually every department of California's state government."<SUP>5 </SUP>  The direct costs to the government for administration and enforcement of these regulations is considerable.<P>

In response to a recent inquiry from Governor Pete Wilson to his cabinet secretaries, state agencies estimated their administrative costs for MBE/WBE programs to be $12.763 million for FY 1993-94.<SUP>6 </SUP>  It should be noted that this survey included only those departments under the direct supervision of the governor's office, and did not include the entire education system, which alone accounts for more than half of the state's budget.  Furthermore, there is reason to believe the numbers have been very conservatively estimated.  For example, the State and Consumer Services Agency (SCS) reported to the governor administrative costs of just $2.008 million, yet just one office within SCS, which administers both small business set-asides and racial and gender preferences (the Office of Small and Minority Businesses, within the Department of General Services), spent $2.209 million that year.<SUP>7 </SUP>  Although the entire cost to the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency is estimated at $6.263 million for FY 1993-94, the Department of Transportation alone reported $6.884 million in affirmative action costs the following year.<SUP>8 </SUP><P>The "Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund" of the Community Colleges spent $2.924 million in FY 1993-94 for faculty and staff recruitment.  All race-based programs in the UC and California State University (CSU) systems were $47,174,000 in 1994/95, according to the LAO.<SUP>9 </SUP>  These figures may also be understated.  According to a study by John Attarian, an economist cited in <I>Forbes</I> magazine in 1993, 2.5 percent of the entire general budget of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor is devoted to recruitment and retention of "protected classes."<SUP>10 </SUP>  Applied to the UC, CSU and California Community Colleges, this would amount to $274 million out of the combined $10 billion spent annually in these systems. <P>In 1993-94, California public schools spent $82 million on voluntary desegregation programs,<SUP>11 </SUP> and according to the LAO, public schools and community colleges spend an additional $10 million annually on categorical programs based on race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.<SUP>12 </SUP><P>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) spends $2.8 million annually to administer Public Utilities Code sections 8281-8286.<SUP>13 </SUP> Although this is not an exhaustive list, it is clear from immediately available state documents that the direct governmental costs of these programs amount to at least $155 million annually for the state of California:<P>

<B>2. Costs to Government Due to Above Market Prices</B><P>

State law requires all agencies awarding state-funded contracts to report the amount of those contracts to the Office of Small and Minority Business of the Department of General Services, and to report the amount which was awarded to minority business enterprises (MBE) and women business enterprises (WBE).  Of $2.9 billion in contracts reported in FY 1993-94, $463.171 million was awarded to MBE/WBE contractors, including $279.882 million to minority businesses (9.4 percent) and $183.289 million to women businesses (6.2 percent).  An additional $36.671 million (1.2 percent) was awarded to disabled veterans business enterprise (DVBE) businesses.<SUP>14 </SUP><P>  

A 1979 report for the National Construction Industry Council (NCIC) noted:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any law that assigns a portion of a market to a particular group, in essence, legalizes monopoly.  Setting aside 10 percent of a construction market for minority firms creates a monopoly for minorities.  It is a well-established law of economics that monopoly power leads to higher prices.<SUP>15 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Quoting from a General Accounting Office report of January 16, 1979, the NCIC observed that "The price quotes of minority firms averaged about 9 percent higher than normal prices."  If this formula is applied to California contracts under the MBE/WBE set-asides, it would account for $41.7 million in inflated contract costs.<SUP>16 </SUP><P> 

This figure is consistent with the experience of the Department of General Services (DGS).  According to figures provided by the Procurement Division of DGS, the difference "between the bid that met all other technical and administrative requirements (however, did not meet the M/WBE requirements) and the bid that met all requirements (including the M/WBE requirements)" amounted to $9.725 million in 1994.<SUP>17 </SUP>  The Procurement Division is responsible for about 20 percent of all state business.  Thus, the annual cost cited by DGS would amount to $48.625 million if the experience was consistent with the 80 percent of state contracting not awarded through DGS.<P>

The figures obtained from applying the NCIC findings to state construction work and from applying the DGS experience to all state contracts are also remarkably consistent with a study of costs prepared by the Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB) in June 1986.  This study was based on a survey of 472 prime contractors, majority subcontractors and MBE/WBE firms which responded to a total of 2,133 questionnaires, representing $1.95 billion of the $4.3 billion in public works construction in California in 1985.  Based upon the information compiled in this survey, the CIRB estimated $43 million in inflated costs due to special preference programs.  The sampling of inflated costs ranged up to 165 percent.<SUP>18 </SUP><P>

An example cited by DGS illustrates the lengths to which these provisions must be taken:<P> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>A solicitation for rolling ball pens was issued by the State without the M/WBE participation requirements.  In response to a request by a local supplier, the State amended the solicitation to include M/WBE requirements.  As in the past, numerous bids were received.  However, the eight lowest bids were all rejected.  Although all bidders had met the technical specifications (in fact, all bidders offered the same pen), the eight lowest bidders had not met M/WBE requirements.  Award was made to the ninth bidder, and cost the taxpayers about $50,000 more on a $200,000 contract.<SUP>19 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>  

It should be noted that all three of these surveys tend to underestimate the increased prices inherent in preference programs, because they all survey only the cost differential among bids which were actually made.  An important consideration which is far more difficult to quantify is the effect that preferences have on discouraging additional bids, which may be considerably lower than those submitted.  According to the CIRB study:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Nearly 61 percent of prime contractors reported that they avoided bidding an average of 6.8 contracts in 1985 because of SPP (special preference program) requirements.  If those contracts had been bid, the number of bids received by government agencies would have been 12.9 percent higher.… Additionally, nearly 46 percent of majority subcontractors reported that they avoided bidding SPP work an average of 26.4 times each in the prior year.  And nearly half of all majority subcontractors also reported that over the past three years they reduced the amount of public works construction that they choose to bid.  Nearly 43 percent, who have reduced their public works bidding, say that the reduction is substantial.  And 88 percent state they are doing more private work than they did before SPP.<SUP>20 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE> 


<B>3. The Cost of Delays</B><P>

Another component of the cost of the state's racial and gender preferences involves the MBE/WBE induced delays in awarding contracts.  An example cited by the DGS illustrates the problem:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>On the second rebid of a difficult and complex solicitation for aircraft, the state received three responsive bids.  The low bidder was selected for award. The highest cost bidder protested the award, claiming that neither of the lower bidders had made a good faith effort to meet M/W/DVBE goals.  Ultimately, the protest was denied.  However, by that time, the lowest bidder could no longer honor their price.  The State was finally able to award the contract to the second lowest bidder.<SUP>21 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

The CIRB study reported that 78 percent of the respondents to its survey "reported delays in contract awards for projects that have SPP percentage goals.  Those delays averaged 4.6 weeks."<SUP>22 </SUP>  Applying this figure to all MBE/WBE contacts would produce an average delay of 3.6 weeks for the $463 million of MBE/WBE contracts in 1993-94.  Based on 6 percent annual interest, the cost of these delays would be about $1.9 million.<P>	

DGS notes that before the adoption of the MBE/WBE requirements, "departments typically gave suppliers a two to four week period" for submitting bids.  The adoption of the MBE/WBE requirements more than doubled the period for bid preparation to between six and eight weeks.<SUP>23 </SUP>  This factor is by far more significant.  A four week delay over the preparation of all contracts would produce annual costs of $13.7 million.<P>


<B>4. Qualitative Costs</B><P>

A fourth cost component of racial and gender preferences is difficult to quantify: the cost of qualitative differences in the execution of state contracts due to the arbitrary exclusion of qualified bidders.<P>

In some cases, there would be no qualitative difference.  For example, in the case of the $200,000 pen acquisition, the pens were the same, only the cost was different.  Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith cited a 1994 letter from a constituent.  Says Goldsmith:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We have seen the creation of so-called pass through companies, i.e., a minority- or woman-owned firm that advertises as being a supplier for various items but doesn't actually stock the items.  Shelly Holland, owner of the Holland Company, a general engineering firm, writes: "We purchase steel from PDM Steel, but must offer the opportunity to bid to any MBE/WBE supplier.  In doing so, these firms will get a price from PDM Steel, add a percentage to the price, then give us the quote.  If we accept the price from PDM Steel, then we are not giving enough work to [MBEs/WBEs].  If we accept the inflated price from the MBEs/WBEs we may no longer be competitive."<SUP>24 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

According to the CIRB study, MBE/WBE subcontractors failed to perform in 11.5 percent of the contracts reported, compared to 1.8 percent of non-MBE/WBE subcontractors, a failure rate 6.4 times greater.  "When subcontractors fail to perform the work subcontracted for, the prime contractor may incur significant costs to complete the work.  One example of this was offered by a prime contractor who employs eight workers and who stated that his firm lost $30,000 to $40,000 in each of two prior years because '...MBE's went bankrupt, or we had to complete their jobs.'"<SUP>25 </SUP><P>


<B>5. Indirect Costs for Businesses</B><P>

The law is quite specific on the actions which a business must undertake in order to qualify to bid on state contracts.  First, the business must make contact with the "awarding department to identify minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises."  According to testimony to the Little Hoover Commission, this is more difficult than it sounds.  The Department of General Services noted, "Different agencies have different requirements and do make different interpretations...it would be unrealistic to expect that the same answer would be given to identical callers in identical circumstances in every instance."<SUP>26 </SUP><P>  

Second, the business must make contact "with other state and federal agencies, and with local minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprise organizations to identify minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises."  All of these actions must be documented.  Third, the business must publish advertising "in trade papers and papers focusing on minority, women, and disabled, veteran business enterprises."  These costs are, of course, entirely shouldered by the business, and passed on as higher prices.  Fourth, invitations to bid must be submitted to these preferred contractors, and, fifth, subcontracting must be done even when the contractor can perform the same services more cheaply in-house.<P>

For example, Pacific Gas and Electric reported that it spent $2.2 million in 1991 to comply with California Public Utilities Commission MBE/WBE requirements.<SUP>27 </SUP>  According to the Little Hoover Commission:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is difficult to pin down the added private industry costs.  If one vendor's estimate of $1,000 were used and three bidders were presumed to compete on each of 80,000 state procurements, the cost would be $240 million.  But MBE/WBE/ DVBE requirements are not included on all contracts, and a substantial number of contracts have only a single bidder while others have far more than three.<SUP>28 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

In 1986, CIRB estimated total costs to business for construction contracts to be $13.1 million.  Its estimate was based on average bidding costs 13.1 percent higher on MBE/WBE construction contracts with total billing amounting to 0.8 percent of the contract cost, and an average of 5.7 bidders per contract.<SUP>29 </SUP>  CIRB estimates this accounts for about ten percent of all contracts.  If the experience were consistent across all state contracts, this would amount to $130 million in compliance costs for firms doing business with the state.<P>


<B>6. Opportunity Costs</B><P>

Finally, there is an incalculable opportunity cost to society which we cannot begin to fathom in the confines of this paper, but simply must note in passing.  For example, racially discriminatory admissions practices within the University of California have been extensively documented.<SUP>30 </SUP>  When a more qualified applicant is arbitrarily denied admission to a university in favor of a less qualified one, how much economic damage is done to society?  Arbitrary preferences in all fields clearly inhibit the application of resources for their highest and best potential use.  It is impossible to begin to quantify this effect, but it conceivably dwarfs the other costs of preferential policies discussed in this paper.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

The costs to support the race and gender preferences in current law are impossible to fully assess, and it should be stressed that figures presented in this paper offer only a partial glimpse.  However, combining the estimates which have been made by the Department of General Services, the Legislative Analyst's Office, the Little Hoover Commission, industry studies and the Administration, it is clear that these programs easily exceed $343 million annually in administrative costs to government, compliance costs to business, and inflated prices paid by taxpayers because of the constriction of competition for the provision of governmental goods and services. Specifically, the state spends at least $156 million on direct costs for these programs, between $42 million and $49 million for inflated prices in contracting, $15 million in project delays, and anywhere from $130 million to possibly as much at $240 million in compliance costs to businesses.<P>

<P ALIGN=center><B>By Michael Lynch*</B></P>


<B>Background</B><P>

The last year has been tumultuous for the University of California.  In July 1995, after a nearly year-long review and much public debate, the University of California Board of Regents adopted a resolution designed to end race as a factor in admissions, hiring, and contracting decisions.  The Regents' intention is clear: administrators are to design and implement a completely colorblind admission process for the entering class of Fall 1997.<SUP>1</SUP>  To the casual observer, this appears to be no major task.  Simply removing the ethnic-check boxes from admission applications--a section which, according to wording on the application itself, is for "statistical purposes only"--would go a long way to ensuring a colorblind admission process.  If the schools still wanted to know their racial and ethnic composition, they could avail themselves of modern statistical sampling techniques to determine the ethnic and racial composition <I>after</I> the admission decisions had been made. <P>

This reform, however, is too simple, too honest, and too effective for the system's administrators, all of whom opposed the Regents' decision.  Footdragging and controversy quickly ensued.  Newly-appointed UC President Richard Atkinson maintained that the Regents' decision didn't affect the entering class of Fall 1997, but rather the entering class of Fall 1998. After much handwringing and a reassertion of authority by the Regents, a compromise was struck.  Race supposedly will not be a factor in admission to UC by Spring 1998, well after the Regents' original date but earlier than Atkinson's initial interpretation of the policy.  At the same time this controversy was bubbling, a group of activist professors asserted that the Regents' decision upset the proper balance of power in the university system and that the faculty were united in opposition to the ban on preferences.  Major state news outlets reported both of these stories, rarely questioning their veracity.  But a scientific poll of the UC faculty, conducted by the independent Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, found the faculty split on, if not in favor of, the Regents' policy.<SUP>2</SUP>  As for the usurpation of the faculty's power, setting policy is the purview of the Regents, the UC's governing board.  After all, when the University of California is sued for discrimination, the suit names the Regents, not professors. <P>

As the dust settles, school administrators have until Spring 1998 to come up with an admission system that neither grants privileges nor discriminates on the basis of race and ethnicity.<SUP>3</SUP>  If the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), which would amend the state constitution to prohibit race-based preferences in the public sector, passes in November 1996, the UC will not only be prohibited from discriminating by the Regents but also by the state constitution. <P>

The current climate, then, has Californians paying close attention to a recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision, <I>Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas</I>, in which the court ruled that race could not be a factor in admissions,<SUP>4</SUP> and to the findings of a report by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the University of California at Berkeley's (UCB) admission process.  On the one hand, the <I>Hopwood</I> decision is a legal affirmation of the Regents' decision.  On the other, the OCR's  report asserts that the existing admission policy at UCB in 1993, a close version of which is still used, did not lower academic standards or discriminate against whites or Asians. This confusion raises the question: What is really going on and what lies ahead for the University of California? <P>


<B>Conflicting Decisions or Differing Premises?</B><P>

On March 18, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rocked the country's higher educational establishment.  In its <I>Hopwood</I> decision, the court ruled that the University of Texas law school was guilty of discrimination for maintaining different admission standards for applicants of different races and ethnicities.  More important, the court called into question the justification for such discrimination set forth in the famous decision in <I>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</I> (438 U.S. 1978), which has been the governing doctrine of race-based preferences in admission to higher education since 1978.  Justice Powell's opinion in <I>Bakke</I>, in which the court struck down explicit set-asides for minority students at the University of California at Davis Medical School, allowed for schools to use race as a factor in admissions in order for schools to ensure ideological and intellectual diversity as long as it was just one of many factors considered. <P>

Although the <I>Hopwood</I> decision has been decried by proponents of racial preferences as "profoundly radical in its contempt for the precedent set by the historic <I>Bakke</I> decision,"<SUP>5</SUP> it is far more evolutionary than revolutionary.  In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <I>Adarand Constructors v. Pena</I><SUP>6</SUP> that programs that take race into account must pass the "strict scrutiny" test.  Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, emphasized that the Constitution protects "persons, not groups" and that government classification based on race is a "group classification."<SUP>7</SUP>  Quoting from the 1943 <I>Hirabayashi</I><SUP>8</SUP> decision four times, "Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality," O'Connor emphasized that all racial classifications by government must be scrutinized to ensure that personal rights, which the Constitution does protect, are not violated.<SUP>9</SUP>  In addition to <I>Adarand</I>, a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit invalidated a scholarship program reserved only for African Americans at the University of Maryland.<SUP>10</SUP>  Far from revolutionary, the <I>Hopwood</I> decision fits squarely in the vein of these two recent decisions. <P>

In <I>Hopwood</I>, the court ruled: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Justice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on this issue.  While he announced the judgment, no other Justice joined in that part of the opinion discussing the diversity rationale.  In Bakke, the word "diversity" is mentioned nowhere except in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion.<SUP>11</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Stating that recent Supreme Court opinions "show that the diversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny," the Court went on to declare that "within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection."<SUP>12</SUP>  Two out of the three judges ruled that race can never be used as a factor in admissions because race is not a reliable proxy for either intellectual or ideological diversity.  In this ruling, the court laid bare a festering problem in Justice Powell's opinion.  Although Powell declared that race could be used to ensure ideological and intellectual diversity, he never explained why race was, in and of itself, a useful proxy for these types of diversity.<SUP>13</SUP>  Powell's opinion seems to embrace the very thinking on race--that certain traits can be ascribed to individuals based on their group membership--that the original civil rights movement sought to dispel.  After all, the argument that individuals should be judged based "on the content of their character," is not a plea for racial categorization.<SUP>14</SUP><P>

Three days following the <I>Hopwood</I> decision, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights released the suspiciously well-timed findings of its seven-year investigation into the admission practices at UC Berkeley (UCB).  Just as the University was preparing to send out acceptance and rejection letters to anxious applicants, the OCR reported in a fifteen page letter that "1) UCB does not maintain illegal quotas for Black, Hispanic, and Filipino applicants to the freshman class in the College of L&S [Letters and Sciences], and 2) neither the University of California (UC) system nor UCB illegally discriminates against minority students by segregating them away from other UC campuses to UCB."<SUP>15</SUP><P>

If California's education establishment was driven to cold sweats by the <I>Hopwood</I> decision, they were ecstatic about the long-awaited OCR decision.  <I>The Los Angeles Times'</I> front page headline declared, "Probe Finds No Bias in Berkeley Admissions: Policies do not discriminate against whites or cause lower academic quality, U.S. agency says."  UC Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel, a chief architect of the school's admission system, told <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> that the OCR's finding was "an historical vindication of one of the strongest and most scrutinized affirmative action programs in the country."<SUP>16</SUP>  This investigation's findings were also declared to be "a striking counterpoint to a federal appeals court ruling Tuesday in a Texas case [<I>Hopwood</I>], knocking down the use of affirmative action in a state college or university."<SUP>17</SUP><P>

The OCR's findings were not, however, a rebuke to the <I>Hopwood</I> decision.  Two points must be made clear.  First, the <I>Hopwood</I> case was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and thus is not binding on California's universities, which are governed by the Ninth Circuit.  Second, the OCR's findings in no way contradict the <I>Hopwood</I> decision because the report is premised on Justice Lewis Powell's <I>Bakke</I> opinion, which the <I>Hopwood</I> decision rejects.  If the OCR had investigated under the <I>Hopwood</I> standard, it would have been forced to find the University guilty of discrimination. <P>

Californians should thus not conclude from the media reports on the OCR's investigation that race is not a critically important factor in undergraduate admission to UCB.  Nor should they conclude that members of all ethnicities are held to the same undergraduate admission standards.  The OCR's own Letter of Finding (LOF)<SUP>18</SUP> debunks this notion.  What the OCR did find is that "the undergraduate admissions process, in place for students admitted in 1993, is lawful under Title VI."<SUP>19</SUP><P>

Although the OCR took nearly seven years to reach its decision and, according to <I>The Los Angeles Times</I>, based its decision "on reams of documents provided by university officials,"<SUP>20</SUP> the LOF contains surprisingly little data.  The author has put in a federal Freedom of Information Act request with the OCR for the data on which it based its decision, and has also put in a California Public Records Act request at UCB for further admission data.  When these data become available, a fuller analysis of the admission system and its consequences will follow.  This analysis is based on the information contained in the OCR's LOF, the original complaint that prompted the investigation, and other information, cited when used, already in the public domain. <P>


<B>The University of California's Dilemma</B><P>

The University of California has a problem.  Its mission, as outlined in the University of California's Master Plan, is to educate those students performing academically in the top 12.5 percent of California's graduating high school class.  It has also been charged with ensuring diversity by two Assembly Concurrent Resolutions (ACR 151 in 1974 and ACR 83 in 1984).<SUP>21</SUP>  In 1988, the UC Regents further adopted a policy on undergraduate admissions which stated, in part, that beyond its more narrow mission, the university "seeks to enroll, on each of its campuses, a student body that, beyond meeting the University's eligibility requirements, demonstrates high academic achievement or exceptional personal talent, and that encompasses the broad diversity of cultural, racial, geographic, and socio-economic background characteristic of California."<SUP>22</SUP>  Administrators interpreted this policy to mean that entering classes should approximately reflect the ethnic proportions of the graduating high school class.<SUP>23</SUP><P>

As reported in an earlier study,<SUP>24</SUP> all of UC's affirmative action headaches stem from the same source: high school graduates from various ethnic groups do not qualify for the system in equal proportions.  The University's primary mandate is to provide an education for the top 12.5 percent, or one in eight, of California's graduating high-school seniors.  This means that any ethnic group whose members qualify for UC at a rate of less than 12.5 percent will be underrepresented in the system as a whole if standards are not lowered for that group.  Likewise, any ethnic group whose members qualify for UC at a rate exceeding 12.5 percent will be over-represented3/4unless members of that group are discriminated <I>against</I> in the admission process or a great number choose, for some reason, not to attend the University of California. <P>

Table I shows the ethnic breakdown of 1990, 1993 and 1994 high school graduates and the UC eligibility rates for 1990, the last year for which published data are available.  There are huge disparities in eligibility rates across ethnic groups.  While four in 10 Asian graduates from California's high schools were UC eligible, this proportion was one in five for whites, and less than one in ten for African Americans and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino). <P>

As illustrated in Figures I through IV, these varying rates produce a qualified applicant pool with an ethnic composition that differs radically from that of the graduating high-school seniors.  While Asians constituted only 14 percent of the graduating high-school seniors in 1990, they accounted for 30 percent of those eligible for the University of California.  Whites accounted for 55 percent of high school graduates and 59 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  African Americans and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino), however, while constituting approximately 7 and 23 percent of the high school graduates respectively, accounted for only 3 and 8 percent of those eligible for the University of California.<P>

<IMG SRC="gsp5212a.jpg" ALIGN=left ALT="Figures I and II" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=441 WIDTH=385>
By 1993, the year for which the OCR investigated, things had not changed much.  As illustrated in Figures II and IV, Asians, which constituted just 15 percent of California's high school graduates accounted for 32 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  Whites were 48 percent of high school graduates and 54 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  Hispanics (Chicano/Latino), while 29 percent of high school graduates made up only 11 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  The respective percentages for African Americans were 7 percent and 3 percent.  It must be noted that these figures only provide an approximation because the eligibility rates are calculated based on 1990 data, the last year for which they are available.  Also, the pool doesn't include American Indians due to a small sample size which precluded a statistically significant result.<P>


What is true for the system as a whole is also true for each institution.  The most competitive schools, UCB and UCLA, can approximate proportionality for targeted minorities who, like Asians and whites, prefer these schools over other UC campuses.  But they can only do so by applying different academic standards to applicants based on their race. <P>

This has the twin effects of producing radically varying GPA and SAT averages in the entering class among the different ethnic groups<SUP>25</SUP> and concentrating targeted minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Chicanos and Latinos) at UCLA and UCB.  Indeed, the original complaint that prompted the OCR investigation noted that in 1988 UCB and UCLA "accounted for 35 percent of all students in the UC system, but they also enroll a much larger 51 percent of minorities."<SUP>26</SUP><P>

<IMG SRC="gsp5234a.jpg" ALIGN=left ALT="Figures III and IIII" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=365 WIDTH=361>

By 1994 these disparities had lessened, but nevertheless remained.  Thirty-six percent of all undergraduates but 43 percent of targeted minorities enrolled in the UC system attended these two schools in that same year.  By contrast, 33 percent of all UC undergraduates admitted in 1994 attended these two schools, but only 21 percent of white students.<SUP>27</SUP>  As illustrated in Figures IV and V, the only group significantly underrepresented in UCB 1993 admissions in comparison to the potentially eligible applicant pool is whites, who account for 54 percent of the eligibility pool but only 32 percent of the students accepted.  Similarly, the only two groups underrepresented in UCB 1993 acceptances in comparison to the California graduating high school seniors (Figures II & V) are whites and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino).  While Hispanic under-representation is due to this group's low eligibility rate, this explanation is not available for whites. <P>




As discussed in detail in an earlier paper,<SUP>28</SUP> California taxpayers generously support a comprehensive system of higher education.  From the broad base of the open enrollment community colleges to the California State University system to the top tier of the University of California system, no Californian is denied a highly subsidized education.  Although advocates of racial preferences in admission would have the public believe that if UCB and UCLA did not admit a high proportion of minority applicants these applicants would be denied an education, this is false. <P>

<B>The Complaint that Started it All</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"There is wide agreement that if whites have higher admission rates and lower test scores than Asians, it is evidence of discrimination against Asians.  But if this applies to black students relative to white students, it is called affirmative action, even though it is exactly the same procedure."</I>
					<P ALIGN=right>--Arthur Hu, <I>Original Complaint</I><SUP>29</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

In 1989, Arthur Hu, a software programmer in Seattle, columnist for <I>Asian Week</I>, and inveterate data collector, filed an official complaint with the U.S. Department of Education charging discrimination against Asians in admissions to Harvard University.  He claimed also that UCB and UCLA maintained quotas and differential admissions standards at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles which discriminate not only against Asians, but against all racial groups."<SUP>30</SUP><P> 

In brief, Hu's complaint accused the UC system, primarily through UCLA and UCB, of maintaining quotas for minority group admissions based on representation among the state's high-school graduates. In the wake of the ACR No. 83 in 1984, which the UC interpreted to mean that it must strive for racial proportionality, the number of minority admits increased dramatically while that of whites fell, especially at the more competitive schools.  Hu based his complaint on this evidence.  Hu wrote: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>UC claims that it uses goals, but not quotas to admit minorities according to state proportions.  In 1988, UC has actually admitted all minorities in equal to, or even greater than graduate proportions.  Since this is caused by affirmative action, and is not based on qualifications, but on numerical goals, this policy is a fourth illegal quota in fact, if not in name.<SUP>31</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Hu pointed out that by concentrating minority students at UCB and UCLA, the UC system "discriminates against whites and Asians who apply to these campuses."<SUP>32</SUP>  He claimed that the policy "also discriminates against minorities in other campuses such as UC Santa Cruz because it makes them [the campuses] primarily white and Asian."<SUP>33</SUP>  This is a direct consequence of the high acceptance rates at UCB and UCLA.  An attendant claim by Hu was that the UC was "mismatching abilities by putting the weakest students in the toughest schools" and thereby reducing these groups respective graduation rates by admitting African American and Filipino students with considerably lower grades and SAT scores than other students. <P>


<B>Enter the Feds: The OCR's Findings</B><P>

The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is charged with ensuring that colleges and universities that take federal money do not discriminate.  It carries out this mission primarily by enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  It determined, in this investigation, that the relevant implementing regulations reside at 34 C.F.R. &#167 &#167 100.3(a), (b)(1)(v), and (b)(6)(ii).  The first section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states "that no person in the United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies."<SUP>34</SUP>  The second section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states, "a recipient [of federal money] may not directly or through contractual arrangements on the ground of race, color, or national origin treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program."<SUP>35</SUP>  Complicating, if not contradicting, these first two seeming prohibitions against classification and differential treatment based on race, the third section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states, "that even in the absence of a prior finding that a recipient has discriminated in the past, a recipient, in administering a program, may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin."<SUP>36</SUP><P>

These were the standards against which the legality of UCB's admission policy was judged. The first two prohibit treating people differently depending on their race and ethnicity while the third states that a university "may take affirmative action."  If these sections are to be internally consistent, then racial preferences, such as those we shall see are used by UCB, cannot be considered "affirmative action." That is, affirmative action programs are proscribed from using racial preferences.  They can, however, concentrate on recruitment.  The OCR didn't interpret these regulations in this manner.  For the OCR, even though its report didn't explicitly recognize this fact, there is a contradiction between the first two prohibitions against discriminating based on race and the third which states, in OCR's interpretation, that preferences can be granted on the basis of race.  In this light, the OCR sacrifices the first two standards on the altar of the third.

In a letter dated March 1, 1996, nearly seven years after the original complaint was filed, the OCR released it findings.  Among other things mentioned, the OCR found "The program employed not quotas or set-asides, and all students, regardless of race or national origin, competed with all other students."<SUP>37</SUP>  Furthermore, any problem associated with not being admitted to UCB was mitigated by the fact that applicants were free to apply again, were offered admission at a later date, or, if UC eligible, guaranteed a spot at a less competitive UC school. The LOF found: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any impact of the affirmative action component on students who were not admitted to UCB was substantially diminished by the fact that all UC-eligible students must be admitted by the System to one of the UC campuses, and many students achieved admission to UCB subsequent to an initial denial of admission.<SUP>38</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

To arrive at its conclusion of non-discrimination, the OCR's investigation focused on the 1993 admissions process.  In 1992, UCB switched to a matrix admission process that it states was "quite different" from the old system.  We shall examine the matrix process, but it should be noted that the OCR did not release a Letter of Finding directly related to Hu's charges, which were obviously filed under an older admission process.  In a similarly misleading vein, if the OCR investigated and found a discriminatory process but UCB was willing to alter its policies to mitigate this discrimination, the OCR wouldn't necessarily disclose that it had deemed the former policy discriminatory.<SUP>39</SUP>  As a result, one should be suspicious of the OCR's complete neglect of UCB's admissions policies prior to 1993, which were, after all, the policies that prompted the complaint.  As Arthur Hu recently wrote in <I>Asian Week</I>, it is as if the police investigated "O.J. Simpson by checking on whether he killed anybody in the next year."<SUP>40</SUP>  Even so, there is plenty in the 1993 matrix standards to make one wonder how the OCR concluded that UCB does not "on the ground of race, color, or national origin treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfied any admission, enrollment, . . . requirement."<SUP>41</SUP><P>

<B>Brief Overview of Admissions Policy</B><P>

In 1993, UC policy mandated that no less than 40 percent and no more than 60 percent of the first year entering class be selected on academic criteria alone, which include required course-work, GPA, and SAT scores.<SUP>42</SUP>  The remaining students were to be selected on the basis of supplemental factors.  According to the OCR, these factors included: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>1) special talents, interests or experiences beyond the academic criteria that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, achievement, and service in a particular field such as civic life or the arts; 2) special circumstances adversely affecting applicant's life experiences, including personal difficulties, low family income, refugee status, or veteran status; and 3) ethnic identity, gender, and location or residence.<SUP>43</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Notice that, as is nearly almost always the case when supplemental, non-academic factors are delineated, race and ethnicity are placed at the end of the list.  As we shall soon see, this is a deliberate inversion of the order of importance. <P>

In addition to those who meet the UC Eligibility criteria, the UC maintains the right to admit up to 6 percent of the entering class by "exception."  According to the LOF, "This policy is designed for the purpose of admitting students who have not met the eligibility requirements who are either athletes, have special talents, are disadvantaged (i.e. from minority and/or low income or low education backgrounds), have demonstrated exceptional ability in certain areas, or have shown marked improvement in academic performance."<SUP>44</SUP>  Notice that middle class and wealthy minorities can be considered disadvantaged simply on the basis of their ethnicity and race. <P>

Through this admissions process, UCB seeks to ensure diversity in its incoming class.  In 1988, the Academic Senate and the Admissions and Enrollment (A&E) Committee adopted the recommendations from a report entitled "Freshman Admissions at Berkeley: A Policy for the 1990s and Beyond" which is known as the Karabel report, after the aforementioned sociologist Jerome Karabel.  The Karabel report recommended flexible targets for admissions based on the following characteristics (notice the order): "low socio-economic status (SES), athletic ability, age, disability, re-entry students, students from rural and non-traditional high schools, and ethnicity and underrepresented minority status."<SUP>45</SUP>  These targets were soon adopted.  Here's how these goals manifested themselves in the admission process. <P>

<B>1993 Matrix</B><BR>
Below is the 1993 admissions matrix for UC Berkeley. <P>

<P><IMG SRC="/gsp/gsp526a.jpg" ALT="Figure VI" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=272 WIDTH=593></P>

The Social Diversity Score (SDS) categories are as follows: <B>SDS A:</B> 1)  California residents who are American Indian, African American or Chicano AND low socio-economic status (SES)<SUP>46</SUP> or disabled; 2) California residents who are low SES and disabled; 3) California residents who are re-entry applicants (over 24 years of age). <B>SDS B:</B> 1) California residents who are American Indian, African American or Chicano; 2) California residents who are Latino and SES or disabled. <B>SDS C:</B> 1) California residents who are Latino; 2) Non-resident American Indian, African American or Chicano applicants.<SUP>47</SUP> <B>SDS D:</B> Very low SES.<SUP>48</SUP> <B>SDS E:</B> Rural and Other High School <B>SDS F:</B> Non-resident Latinos;<SUP>49</SUP> 2) Other Low SES. <B>SDS G:</B> California Residents <B>SDS H:</B> Domestic Non-residents. <B>SDS I:</B> Foreign Applicants. <P>

Under this matrix, an applicant is placed in a box depending on two variables: 1) an Academic Index Score (AIS) and 2) his or her social diversity category.  The AIS is determined by multiplying an applicant's GPA, capped at 4.0, by 1,000, and adding to this the combined total of the SAT scores and three required Achievement Test scores.<SUP>50</SUP> The socio-economic categories, which are on the vertical axis, are determined by an applicant's birth.  The LOF states that the AIS scores for the first box are 7160 to 8000 (8000 is a perfect score), but didn't disclose the other cut-off scores. The Social Diversity Scores, which are under the matrix, are quoted directly from the LOF<SUP>51</SUP><P>

In 1993, applicants placed in this matrix were admitted in the following manner.  All those in AIS 1, regardless of SDS, were admitted.  This accounted for roughly 50 percent of the acceptances.  This groups satisfies the requirement that 40 percent to 60 percent of the students be admitted on academic qualifications alone. <P>

A second group comprising SDS A through SDS F and AIS cells 2 through 5 were also automatically admitted.  Those admitted in this group, in which race and ethnicity play a major role, accounted for 17 percent of the total acceptances.  Explaining these acceptances, for which race was an important factor, the "OCR determined that while race/ethnicity was one factor in defining this group, placement in this group was not based exclusively on race or ethnicity."<SUP>52</SUP><P>

A third group in cell SDS G and AIS 2 was also automatically accepted, accounting for 9 percent of total acceptances.  Another 21 percent of the acceptances came from cells SDS A through SDS F and AIS 3 through AIS 7.  These acceptances were granted after each file was reviewed and the essays read by two review teams.  The Karabel diversity goals were taken into consideration in accepting this group.<SUP>53</SUP>  In addition, three percent of total acceptances were granted on the basis of "special admission."  The LOF didn't disclose the racial composition of this or any other admission group. <P>

There are many things about this process that indicate that while race may be a factor among many, it is the most important factor.  While all applicants are put through the same process, they are not all judged by the same standards while in that process.  First, note that to be simply a California taxpayer who is white or Asian is to be in the seventh-lowest SDS ranking, above only out-of-state whites and Asians and non-minority foreign applicants.  In fact, any African American, Chicano, or Latino from anywhere in the United States will be automatically admitted with lower academic qualifications.  For example, non-resident American Indians, African Americans or Chicano applicants, regardless of whether they are wealthy, middle class or poor, were automatically admitted in two AIS categories (C2-C4) in which non-poor whites were automatically rejected, without even having their file reviewed.  Out-of-state minorities, regardless of socioeconomic status, were also automatically admitted in one AIS category (C4) in which "Very Low SES"<SUP>54</SUP> in-state whites and Asians merely get their application read.  It is surely strange for a state university which draws more than $8,000 from the General Fund per student<SUP>55</SUP> to grant a privilege to wealthy out-of-state applicants over poor and middle class California taxpayers solely on the basis of race. <P>

Take a close look at SDS A and SDS B.  Why are they separate categories?  Automatic admissions for both categories extends to AIS 5 and applicants in both categories have their applications closely examined in as low an AIS category as 7.  There is no difference between these two categories except, perhaps, their public relations utility.  If these two categories were properly combined (as in practice they are simply one category for the purpose of the matrix), it would be obvious that all California residents who are American Indians, African Americans, and Chicanos are automatically granted admission--again, regardless of socioeconomic status--without even a review of their file, at radically lower academic standards than whites and Asians.  The proper SDS A category would then read, "1 ) California residents who are American Indian, African American, or Chicano; 2) California residents who are Latino and SES or disabled; 3) California residents who are low SES and disabled; and California residents who are re-entry applicants (over 24 years of age.)  SDS B would disappear and each other category would simply move up the matrix while retaining the same structure.  This would dispel the carefully crafted notion that in order to be considered in highest disadvantaged status, American Indians, African Americans, and Chicanos must not only be California residents, but must also be poor or disabled. <P>

This would also complicate the OCR's statement, in support of its finding of non-discrimination that "the criteria for placement on the matrix grid were not based exclusively on race or ethnicity nor was race or ethnicity the exclusive criterion for any group in the selection process."<SUP>56</SUP>  While this statement would still be true, since a second factor, California residency, is still needed, it would be apparent that all minorities are afforded great preferences in admissions.  Two factors place applicants in the most privileged group: race and residency status.  But as we have seen, even residency status is not necessary for applicants of favored groups to receive preferences over poor California residents who belong to the wrong ethnic and racial group. <P>

Two other points.  First, notice that based on the matrix, a computer automatically admitted in 1993 nearly three in four admittees.  For all the talk of personal reviews of files, only one in four addmittees was admitted after having his file reviewed.  Unless an applicant is somehow considered disadvantaged, the chance of him even having his file read appears remote.  For a white or Asian student who excels in the supposed subjective criteria--"special talents, interests or experiences beyond the academic criteria that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, achievement, and service in a particular field such as civic life or the arts"--it is not clear how the University avails itself of this information.  Non-poor whites and Asians are automatically rejected if not in AIS 1 or 2.  Thus, their chances of being accepted based on non-academic qualifications appear remote.  This failure to review the files of non-minority applicants helps explain the recently exposed "back-door admissions policy" for the wealthy and well connected.  It appears that a non-minority applicant who was a class president, volunteered at a homeless shelter, spent her spring break in Mexico building houses for poor peasants, and was fluent in three languages but was just shy of the GPA and SAT score needed for the first two AIS categories, would be automatically rejected without a file review.  It is reasonable for parents to wonder why some of their childrens' peers with both lower academic credentials and fewer extra-curricular activities were granted admission and to inquire through whatever channels available.  In many cases, such a review would not be a further review, but rather the first review--a review, one might add, that each minority applicant is entitled to simply on the basis of his race.  While this helps explains the backdoor policy, it does not condone it.  After all, such a policy does little to help the majority of taxpaying Californians who are bereft of connections but support UCB with their taxes nevertheless. <P>

Second, without hard data on the academic parameters for the various categories, (automatic admission on AIS alone, automatic admission on AIS and SDS, admission based on extensive review of file, and special admissions), the exact magnitude of the differing standards cannot be evaluated.  Similarly, although the two-step intensive review process as described in the LOF seems race and ethnic neutral, there are points in this selection process in which race bias could play a significant role.  Until hard data on the composition of the pool and the composition of the acceptances from this pool are provided from the OCR, the reader should not conclude that race and ethnicity do not play a major role in an applicant's chances for admission in this category.  As always, the devil is in the details.  In this case, the details are the data, which have yet to be released by the OCR. <P>


<B>OCR's Incredible Conclusion</B><P>

After review of the process and still undisclosed data, the OCR concluded that UCB does not discriminate based on race.<SUP>57</SUP>  It stopped short, however, of saying that all applicants were judged by the same standards regardless of race, which would, of course, be untrue. <P>

This is the central issue in which most Californians are interested.  The OCR concluded that "the process ensured that no applicant was considered or excluded from consideration for selection solely on the basis of race or national origin."  This simply means that UCB put all of the applicants on the same grid before it gave enormous preferences depending on racial and ethnic classification.  The OCR dismissed Hu's complaint that by concentrating minorities at two schools it was denying diversity to other schools by pointing out that it is the individual schools and applicants who make the decisions. <P>

Hu's complaint of "academic mismatching" causing low graduation rates for targeted minorities admitted by lower standards was also dismissed by the OCR, which stated "UCB provided additional data which showed the current six-year graduation rates for African American students at UCB is 62 percent compared to a national average [for African American students] of 37 percent."<SUP>58</SUP>  This, of course, neglected the fact that the proper base for comparison is not against an amorphous national average, over which the University has no control, but against the ethnic groups it holds to higher admission standards.  The six year graduation rates for the entering class of 1988 showed very different rates depending on race, with Whites and Asians graduating at rates over 80 percent and Chicano/Latinos, American Indians, and African Americans, who we have seen are admitted by lower standards, all in the neighborhood of 60 percent.<SUP>59</SUP>  UCB's six-year graduation rate, independent of race, for all regularly admitted students in Fall 1987 was 81 percent.  For those admitted by exception, the graduation rate was 48 percent.<SUP>60</SUP>  In fact, the differing graduation rates for different groups probably do not reflect racism or differences in academic abilities inherent in race, but simply the different standards at which students are admitted.  This hypothesis, which asserts that if Asians were admitted to UCB with the same academic qualifications as other targeted minorities, they would fail to graduate at similar rates, can only be tested with further data.  At any rate, the OCR didn't investigate this issue in its LOF. <P>

Finally the OCR determined that UCB's racially determined admission matrix "did not impose an undue burden on non-beneficiaries."  It came to this conclusion because "by state law, all UC-eligible students must receive admission to a UC campus."  It continued, "Thus, no student would experience exclusion from the opportunity to receive a University of California education."<SUP>61</SUP>  This "UC Riverside is just as good as UCB" logic should apply to targeted minorities as well.  As it stands, though, UC eligible targeted minorities seem to have a presumptive right to attend the system's most prestigious schools to ensure that these schools exhibit the right color scheme.  At the same time, it is acceptable for the system's other schools to be filled with Asians and whites.  It is never explained why UC Santa Cruz equals UCB for whites and Asians, but not for preferred minorities.  Or why, for example, deferred admission to UCB is considered the equivalent of a direct admission for California's taxpayers who are white and Asian, when this same standard apparently isn't applied to targeted minorities, some of whom are no doubt wealthy and from out-of-state. <P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

The OCR's finding of non-discrimination was welcomed by proponents of racial preferences in university admissions as both a counterpoint to the <I>Hopwood</I> decision and conclusive proof that UCB's admission process does not discriminate based on race.  In reality, it was neither.  The <I>Hopwood</I> criteria, if applied to UCB, would no doubt find the school's admission process unconstitutional.  It was the OCR, an administrative bureaucracy of the federal government's Department of Education, which declared under its interpretation of both Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Justice Powell's opinion in the Supreme Court's 1978 <I>Bakke</I> decision, that UCB's admission process was "lawful."  Indeed, as shown above, this means neither that the process was race neutral nor that race did not play a major role in an applicant's chances for admission.  It merely meant that, <I>in the interpretation of the OCR</I>, race was only one factor.  Just how large a factor race is, as determined by the objective results the process produces, cannot be determined until the OCR discloses the data it used to form its conclusion.  Until that time, California residents can be assured that race-based admissions are alive and well at UCB. <P>

<SUP>14</SUP>	This leap in logic, that race equals ideological diversity, has led university administrators to strain their muscles patting themselves on the back for their success in ensuring diversity at the same time America's universities have become, ideologically speaking, some of the most homogeneous institutions in society under the scourge of political correctness.  The problem is that neither Powell, nor anyone else, has ever properly defined diversity or its relationship to certain "preferred" races and ethnicities.  That this is the case, one only need consider the fact that a Hispanic or African American who may never have left the 90210 zip code in his life is automatically considered "diverse" at the University of California while neither a person fleeing impending communism in Hong Kong nor a Russian Jew are seen as contributing to diversity.  Diversity has always been and continues to remain an ill-defined, amorphous concept. <BR>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>

Over the past year, California's public policy makers have expressed increasing optimism over the health of California's economy, the solvency of her finances, and the prospects for continued expansion.  Certainly there is cause for such optimism.  Tax reductions and workers compensation reform have begun to repair the damage done by the record-breaking tax increases of 1991; the job losses of the recession have been regained, personal income is rising, state revenues are building, the state's deficit spending is easing, and a volume of pro-growth measures have been proposed by the Wilson administration, including a 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income taxes. <P> 

A broad range of policy initiatives are now being predicated on these projections, including $5 billion of new general obligation bonds approved by voters on March 26, and the proposed 1996-97 state budget.  These initiatives are based not only upon ebullient optimism over the state's economic prospects, but also upon the conventional wisdom that the state government's services have deteriorated over the past decade because spending limitations and tax reductions have constricted revenues.  The ultimate conclusion is that California's brightening fiscal condition enables higher spending, while her need for infrastructure improvement demands it. <P>

Two cautionary notes should be sounded in discussions of the state's economy.  First, California's economy, though greatly improved from the early 90's, still shows several weaknesses which ought to be considered by policy makers.  Second, California's fiscal condition, though meliorating, is still precarious.  Furthermore, California's past experience challenges the assumption that her infrastructure crisis is due to inadequate revenues.  The optimism exuded by the state's policy makers should be tempered by the fact that Californians' behavior is contrary to what one would expect in an economy which is rapidly improving.  Real estate prices are again falling, retail sales are still sluggish, and the net outmigration which accompanied the 1990-94 recession is continuing, as suggested by outbound, one-way household relocations reported by major van lines and rental truck companies. <P>

The budget deficits which reached historic proportions in the early 1990's, and which have caused California's bond ratings to plunge, are still a serious threat to the state's long-term[B1] solvency.  Book keeping gimmicks have distorted the true picture of the state's finances, and both short-term and long-term debt is dramatic.  General Obligation bonded indebtedness has doubled between 1990 and 1994, while lease-purchase debt has tripled in the same period.  The percentage of general fund spending required to service this debt doubled between 1990 and 1994, and tripled between 1990 and 1996. <P>

Finally, although significant policy changes have been adopted in the form of both tax reductions and workers compensation reform, the tax, regulatory and litigatory policies of the state are generally unchanged from the conditions which undermined the state's economic condition in the early 1990's.  Although defense cutbacks are generally cited as the predominant factor in the state's deterioration, other states whose economies were much more dependent on defense spending performed significantly better than did California. <P>

Whether the deterioration of state services is due to revenue constraints is also questionable.  Inflation-adjusted per capita general fund spending is 65 percent more than it was in 1966, while infrastructure has declined conspicuously.  This suggests that California's inability to finance needed services and infrastructure is not revenue-based, but rather expenditure-based, and should be addressed through policies to change the way existing revenues are being spent.   Three broad policy options are offered to address the expenditure-based obstacles to service delivery and infrastructure expansion, and three policy options are offered to restore fiscal discipline to the state's appropriation and budgeting process. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTIONARY NOTES ON THE ECONOMY</FONT></B><P>

In 1991, the largest single tax increase in American history was imposed on California's economy--$8.3 billion of new taxes and fees,  or about $1,081 annually from the income of an average family of four.<SUP>1</SUP>  This fueled a nine percent increase in spending in one year, from $51.4 billion to $56.3 billion, including an eight percent increase in general fund expenditures, from $40.3 billion to $43.3 billion.<SUP>2</SUP> <P>

This tax package included a 20 percent increase in the retail sales tax.  In the following quarter, retail sales plunged faster than they had at any time in the prior 30 years.  When the sales tax was applied to bunker fuels, sales at California ports dropped precipitously, and the tax was repealed the following year because it was not generating revenue.  The economic impact was so great that projected general fund revenues fell short by $5.9 billion. <P>

Since then, a revisionism has taken shape which argues that the recession was caused by forces beyond Sacramento's control, and that the economic implosion following the tax increases was merely coincidental.  It is said that California's economic recession was the result of the national recession magnified by disproportionate cuts in defense-related industries and an over-built real estate market. <P>

This revisionism ignores several important facts. <P>

The first is that California, which does not even rank in the top ten states in the percentage of defense-related spending, performed significantly worse than states which did. As economist Arthur Laffer noted: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Defense prime contracts in California peaked in FY 1984 at $30.1 billion and declined steadily to $20.1 billion in FY 1989.  Throughout these years the California economy was more healthy than the rest of the nation.  From 1986 through 1989 the unemployment rate in California was less than the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices in California were appreciating relative to the rest of the nation. <P>

1991 was the first clear decline in the California economy relative to the U.S. economy.  Defense prime contracts to California, however, actually increased over the 1990-91 period from $20.1 billion to $21.2 billion.  The drop in prime contracts awarded to California companies does not correspond well to the drop in the state's economy.  Prime contracts declined in real terms 28 percent from FY 1984 to FY 1989, while the state's economy was doing well.  The decline in prime contracts from FY 1989 to FY 1992, the years of poor economic performance, was 8 percent.<SUP>3</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Laffer's analysis of state dependency on percentage of defense prime contracts per percentage of personal income ranked California 11th in the nation between 1990 and 1992.  Yet all but one of the states more reliant on defense spending saw greater growth in per capita personal income than California, including Arizona, Mississippi, Colorado, Alaska, and Missouri.<SUP>4</SUP><P>  

The second fact ignored by this strain of revisionism is that many California companies with major defense contracts where choosing to fulfill those contracts out of California.  For example, in 1993, Hughes Aircraft announced its decision to transfer 1,900 engineering jobs from Canoga Park to Tucson, culminating in the loss of  7,000 jobs with the closure of satellite complexes in other parts of southern California.  Hughes executives said that they had run out of patience with California's anti-business climate and when the opportunity to move came, they took it.  The entire cost of the move was expected to be recouped in three years from the savings of doing business in Arizona-estimated in the tens of millions of dollars.  Said Hughes CEO C. Michael Armstrong: "California is no longer a competitive place to do business."  The company's division chairman said company representatives had appealed to the state for regulatory relief, but to no avail.<SUP>5</SUP><P>

A third fact ignored by this revisionism is that California's net domestic migration over the last five years has been decidedly outbound.  The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 1995 that 1.5 million more Americans moved out of California than moved in during the first five years of the decade.  The state's population increase is entirely a combination of foreign immigration (much of it illegal), and high birth rates. <P>

The conventional wisdom continues that with the most painful of the defense cuts behind us and with real estate prices bottoming out, California is through the worst and is now poised for explosive economic growth based on the strength of its small businesses, its motion picture and high tech industries and returning aerospace contracts, notably McDonnell-Douglas's C-17. <P>

Actually, there is better news than this.  <I>More than three fourths of the tax increases enacted in 1991 have been repealed, have expired, or have been offset by regulatory relief</I>.<P>  

In 1992, voters ordered the repeal of sales taxes on candy and snack foods and legislators repealed the bunker and jet fuel sales tax, for combined relief of over $500 million.  On December 31, 1995, the upper income tax brackets automatically reverted from their 1991 levels of 11 percent and 10 percent to a maximum of 9.3 percent, for a savings to taxpayers of $1.3 billion.  Business tax credits for new equipment purchases, and targeted business tax cuts were adopted in 1993, providing an additional savings of $600 million.  De facto abolition of the unitary method of corporate tax assessments has provided additional tax relief.  These tax reductions alone have offset more than one-fourth of the 1991 tax increases.  Even more significant were the workers compensation regulation reforms adopted in 1993, which have resulted in cost reductions to California business of as much as $4 billion annually. <P>

It may not be mere coincidence that California's economy performed well below national figures in the aftermath of the 1989, 1990, and 1991 tax increases, nor that it began to recover following the salubrious tax and regulatory reductions which have been adopted in the last three years.  The lessons drawn from these experiences are important in discussing the Administration's proposed 15 percent across-the-board tax cuts in 1996. <P>

The new economic forecasts from Sacramento reflect robust optimism.  The Department of Finance bases its revenue assumptions on a 5.7 percent rate of growth in personal income in 1996 to 5.9 percent in 1997.<SUP>6</SUP>  The Controller is even more bullish, at 5.9 percent income growth for FY 1995.<SUP>7</SUP>  Not to be outdone, the Legislative Analyst predicts that state revenues will exceed the D.O.F. forecast by $1 billion. <P>

Such optimism was reflected in state spending plans, and in the Governor's January State of the State Address, when he announced to legislators that "The U-Hauls have reversed course" and are coming back to California. <P>

Not according to U-Haul.  From January 1 to November 15, U-Haul moved 4 percent more families out of California than into the state, the worst numbers since 1992. <P>

A 20-foot Ryder Rental truck cost $528 to rent one way from Los Angeles to Tucson on January 17, 1996.  To bring the same van one-way back to Los Angeles on the same day, Ryder offered the truck for $128.  The same van from Sacramento to Seattle cost $712 on February 12.  The return trip to California cost only $185. <P>

In its January 1996 report of one-way moving orders, Allied Van Lines painted a similar picture.  Allied reported that in 1995, California had the third highest percentage of outbound one-way moves in the country, behind New York and North Dakota.  Sixty-one percent of Allied's household relocations were outbound from California; only 39 percent were inbound.  Although this was a slight improvement over the previous year when the state ranked second behind New York with 64 percent outbound moves, it falls short of the reversal of the state's disturbing outmigration pattern. <P>

Clearly, if families are flocking back to California, they are doing so without the services of van lines or rental trucks. <P>

Real estate prices also are showing continued erosion.  The median home sales price reported by the California Association of Realtors in February 1996 was $170,920, the lowest monthly price since the recession began and the 6th straight month of decline. <P>

California families are buying more than they did during the recession, although anecdotal information on California retail sales suggests a disappointing Christmas season.  The growth in first quarter taxable transactions cooled in California between 1994 and 1995 showing a modest decline from 4.3 percent growth to 3.3 percent, but improved dramatically in the second quarter from 3.7 percent to 7.0 percent.  Third quarter growth has also improved from 4.8 percent to 5.6 percent.  These numbers are not quite as encouraging when broken down by merchandise type.  Goods with the most elastic demand are consistently underperforming general retail sales, indicating that households are avoiding frills.  Growth in recreational vehicle purchases, gifts and novelties, and sporting goods, for example, has consistently lagged behind.<SUP>8</SUP><P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTIONARY NOTES ON CALIFORNIA'S FISCAL CONDITION</FONT></B><P>

The second cautionary note is that while the state government's fiscal condition is also improving, it is still far from sound.  The Department of Finance begins its current budget summary by boasting: "For the fifth consecutive year, the Governor's Budget continues the fiscal discipline necessary for California to live within its means, where spending from the State's General fund is being held below the amount of General Fund revenues."<SUP>9</SUP>   In support, the D.O.F. offers the following figures: <P>

Although it can be argued that fiscal discipline has been better than it was in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 fiscal years, the state's progress back from the brink of bankruptcy has been slower than the D.O.F. numbers first imply.  These numbers are distorted by their treatment of loans and transfers, off budget "loans" to schools, and deferred pension obligations, to name but three bookkeeping anomalies. <P>


<B>1. Adjustments for Transfers and Loans</B><P>

During each of the budget years 1990-91 to 1994-95, the state has engaged in billions of dollars of short-term borrowing.  The "balanced" numbers reported by the Department of Finance are attained, in part, by including loans and transfers of funds within the state budget, which distorts the actual balance of revenues and expenditures.  A more accurate picture of the state's general fund condition can be found in the D.O.F.'s reports of actual revenues and expenditures, undistorted by loans and transfers: <P>

<B>2. Off-Budget Loans to Schools</B><P>	

The "Off-Budget" loans are loans only in a fictional sense.  Proposition 98 established a minimum level of school funding, based in part on a percentage of state revenues.  The problem in appropriating funds under Proposition 98 is that the appropriations must be made at the beginning of the fiscal year, and the precise condition of the general fund is not known until the end.  This imprecision is compounded by inflated revenue projections the Department has until recently made at the beginning of the fiscal year.  The result is that the Proposition 98 appropriations at the outset of the fiscal year are usually higher than the condition of the general fund would require.  In 1992-93 and again in 1993-94, the legislature attempted to recapture this overappropriation by retroactively reducing school appropriations. <P>

Of course, the funds had already been expended during the past year by the schools, and those districts were in no condition to retroactively cut budgets which had already been spent.  Thus, the fictional "Off-Budget" loan was created.  The district budgets were retroactively cut on paper, and the difference was then "loaned back" to them from future entitlements.  The funds which had been fictionally cut were then spent a second time.  $1.5 billion was moved off budget in this manner in FY 1992/93 and an additional $700 million in 1993-94: <P>

This practice was ruled unconstitutional by the courts in 1994, but not until off budget loans added $2.2 billion to the state's red ink.  In CTA v. Gould, the court has ruled that the state is constitutionally required to add $4 billion to annual school appropriations as a result of this device. <P>


<B>3. Deferral of Pension Obligations</B><P>

Another device used by state budget writers during this period was a decision simply not to make the scheduled half-billion dollar pension payment to the Public Employees Retirement Fund for FY 1993-94.  Legislation was adopted as part of the trailer bills to the budget that year which accomplished this feat by pushing back the payment dates by one year.  The problem with this practice is that the state cannot simply "skip" a year of pensions to retirees.  Thus, the state has incurred $480 million of obligations which, though not actually expended, are obligated to be expended in the future.  This adjustment runs up additional red ink: <P>

This discussion is not exhaustive of all the various devices which have been employed in the state budget process during the first half of the decade.  Absent from this discussion, for example, is the use of fee increases to offset general fund expenditures, which gives the illusion of a decrease in general fund spending but which in effect is merely an increase in revenues.  Spiraling university fees and suspension of the renters' tax credit are among the most egregious examples of this.  Also unmentioned is the transfer of local property tax revenues to meet the state's obligations, which also gives the illusion of general fund cuts where none are actually made.  But once the major accounting anomalies are factored into the budget numbers, it is clear that the state has been in a condition of chronic deficit finance, from which it is only now emerging.  This condition has been responsible for the record levels of short-term borrowing which the state has had to employ. <P>


<B>4. Growing State Debt</B><P>

In order to meet the actual operating deficits in the general fund, the state has resorted to record amounts of short-term borrowing to meet the very real gap between expenditures and revenues. <P>

State borrowing can be divided into two broad categories: short term debt, which is incurred to bridge the gap between ongoing spending and revenues, and long term debt, which is used mainly to finance capital outlay.  Short term debt can be further divided into internal and external borrowing. <P>

Although the state's expenditures are fairly uniform throughout the year, state revenues fluctuate dramatically.  Because much of the revenue is received in the last half of the year, the state often experiences a negative cash-flow in the first months of the year.  This temporary cash gap can be addressed either through internal borrowing from special funds, or through entry into the capital market.  With a genuinely balanced budget, these temporary loans are retired at the end of the fiscal year. <P>

However, this benign cash management practice has been used increasingly to borrow funds without voter approval to plug the general fund's operating deficits. It is precisely this form of non-voter approved borrowing that Article XVI of the state constitution specifically prohibits beyond an aggregate of $300,000. <P>

In a real sense, the short-term borrowing by the state provides a rough gauge of the operating deficit in the state's general fund.  The debt at the end of each fiscal year has been substantial: <P>

A secondary concern is the long term debt, which is generally used to finance capital outlay.  Although this debt is not a function of the state's general fund deficits, its repayment increases pressure on the general fund (and many special funds as well). <P>

There are three kinds of long term bonds.  The first is voter-approved general obligation bonds, repaid over a period of 20 to 30 years from the state general fund.  The second is revenue bonds, which are repaid from revenues generated from the projects financed with those bonds.  A water district or a toll-bridge are examples of this kind of instrument.  Revenue bonds are not approved by voters, since they are guaranteed and redeemed not by general taxes, but by fees paid by the users of the facilities. <P>

The third kind of long term debt instrument is the so-called "Lease Purchase" bond.  Beginning in the mid 1980's, the state bypassed voters and began financing billions of dollars of capital construction through the use of these bonds based on the fiction that the lease purchase arrangement made these a form of revenue bonds, financed not from the general fund, but from the enterprise, primarily, prisons.  Since prisoners are not renting out rooms, the question arises, what is the stream of revenue the prisons are generating?  The answer is the annual prison budget which comes directly out of the state general fund.  Once again, the debt trend is dramatic: <P>

California's budget problem is that actual expenditures have significantly outpaced revenues over the past five years, with the accumulated gap filled with unprecedented levels of government borrowing.  This borrowing not only increases the obligations which future budgets must address, but the growing interest costs of short and long term debt are placing additional upward pressure on expenditures. <P>

For the first time in at least six years, the Department of Finance revenue projections for the current fiscal year are actually tracking significantly ahead of their initial projections.  Through February, 1996, $1.3 billion more has been collected than projected.  This is a dramatic change from the previous five years, when the D.O.F. consistently overestimated revenues: <P>

After general fund spending growth of 5.4 percent from FY 1994-95 to 1995-96, the Governor's budget anticipates a reduction in the growth rate to 2.3 percent for 1996-97.  The reduction in expenditure growth is due in part to major policy initiatives in health and welfare spending.  Revenue is projected to grow 1.3 percent after the first phase of a 15 percent across the board reduction in personal and corporate income taxes. <P>

These levels are based on projected rates of personal income growth of 5.7 percent in 1996-97 and 5.9 percent in 1997-98.  Taxable sales are estimated to grow 5.4 percent in 1996-97 and 4.9 percent in 1997-98, up substantially from the 3.3 percent gains posted in actual sales between the first quarters of 1994 and 1995. <P>

Surprisingly, the most controversial aspect of the proposed state budget is the Governor's intention to reduce personal and corporate income taxes by 15 percent over the next three years.  California's recent experience with tax increases and tax cuts suggests a strong correlation between economic performance and tax reductions.  The state's slowly improving economic condition and the concomitant growth in tax revenues is clearly consistent with what free-market economists have promised.  This, however, has not been enough to silence critics. <P>

Two additional observations, then, ought to be made. <P>

First, the debate over reducing the state income tax in California by 15 percent takes place at a time when Arizona Governor Fife Symington is pushing for the abolition of the Arizona state income tax.  Nevada has no income tax; Oregon has no sales tax; while California ranks 11th in per capita income taxes and 11th in per capita sales taxes among all states.<SUP>10</SUP>  Indeed, California's top marginal personal income tax rate of 9.3 percent is the highest in the nation. <P>

Second, the revenue effect of the first year of phased-in personal income tax reductions is almost entirely offset by the effective tax increase proposed in the budget through the abolition of the renter's tax credit.  The renter's tax credit was suspended in 1993, has since remained in abeyance, and is due to be restored automatically this year delivering a half-billion tax cut to California renters.  The proposed budget would abolish the credit, effectively increasing renters' income tax obligations beyond current law.  Although income tax collections would be decreased by $572 million in the first year of the proposed tax cut,<SUP>11</SUP> these revenues are offset by a $520 million in income taxes paid by renters, which would otherwise automatically be repealed.<SUP>12</SUP>  <I>Thus, the net revenue effect of the combined package is virtually neutral in the first year of operation</I>.  Static losses of revenue do not occur until January of 1998, by which time the dynamic economic impact of the cuts can be expected to boost revenues. <P>


<B>2. Notes on Expenditure Assumptions</B><P>

$2.6 billion of expenditure reductions in health and welfare are based on changes in, or waivers of, federal law.  Similar assumptions were made in last year's budget, which are now causing approximately $1.5 million in daily expenditure overruns. <P>

Last year, we warned: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social welfare spending, but there's a hitch.  The cuts can't take effect until waivers are granted from the federal government, or federal laws are changed. <P>

Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  That's a very likely scenario, considering the state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made in 1994.   The same imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit which California's taxpayers now owe.<SUP>13</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

It should be noted that these developments have indeed occurred, although the expenditure overruns are more than compensated by unanticipated increases in revenues.  Caution should be exercised in making similar assumptions of federal action in expenditure reductions which account for six percent of the state's general fund spending proposal for 1996. <P>



<B><FONT SIZE=+1>A (FOND) RETROSPECTIVE ON THE (PAT) BROWN ADMINISTRATION</B></FONT><P>

During the administration of Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown from 1959 to 1967, California government provided a cornucopia of services.  During this period, California embarked upon a historic expansion of her highway and university systems.  The state water project was constructed to provide for the needs of a growing and thirsty population.   A college education was guaranteed free to every Californian who wanted one. <P> 

Surprisingly, California's golden age of government was financed with less than two-thirds of the funds that the state is now consuming, after adjusting for both inflation and population growth.  In FY 1965-1966, the last full year of the Brown Administration, the state spent $1,070 per person (in 1995 inflation-adjusted dollars).  Today, it spends $1,775 per capita, <I>an absolute increase of more than 65 percent beyond the combined growth of population and inflation</I>.<P>

Neither the aftermath of Proposition 13, which shifted some local financing to Sacramento, nor the <I>Serrano</I> decision, which required the state to equalize education expenditures, excuse or explain such a run-up.  Total per capita inflation-adjusted spending is 31 percent more than 1972-73, the first year after <I>Serrano</I>.  It is almost exactly the same as it was in 1978-79, the first full year after Proposition 13 (adjusting for the 1992 and 1993 property tax shifts). <P>

As the population nearly doubled from 18 million to 33 million, simple economies of scale should have significantly reduced the per capita cost of providing a host of state services.  Ironically, per capita costs have increased while the quality of those basic services has declined dramatically. <P>

Why is it that a state with one of the highest marginal tax rates in the country, a state which is spending 65 percent more per person after inflation than it did in 1966, is so utterly unable to provide basic services to its people? <P>

<UL>
<LI>The cost of the University of California in this year's budget is more than $40,000 per student, not including extra-curricular expenditures.  Just three years ago, it was less than $36,000.  
 
<LI>The average cost of locking up a single prisoner in the state's prisons is $24,000.  Three years ago, it was $21,000.  Since 1980, prison costs have grown at twice the rate as prison population.
 
<LI>California taxpayers pay a flagman on a state-contracted road job $25.12 per hour in wages and benefits in most parts of the state to hold a stop-and-go sign.

<LI>Taxpayers support every classroom of 30 students in this state with nearly $168,000 of public resources, or $5,600 per pupil.  According to a recent study by the Rand Corporation, half this money never reaches the classroom.
</UL>

This experience suggests that California's failure stems not from how much revenue it is receiving, but rather how that revenue is spent.  If a golden age of California government is to return, it will come not because of increased revenues, but because of fundamental changes in the way policy makers spend those resources.  In order to make those changes, two fundamental reforms are essential.  First, the proclivities of policy makers to avoid painful policy reforms by spending more money must be disciplined.  Second, the perverse incentives under which the state's bureaucracies function must be reversed. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS</B></FONT><P>

California's fiscal affairs are a shambles in part because the constraints which the constitution placed on uncontrolled increases in spending have been eroded over the past decade.  Had these constitutional safeguards remained intact, even the most profligate class of policy makers could have done little harm.  If fiscal discipline is to be restored, constitutional provisions which were originally intended to require a balanced budget, prohibit borrowing without voter approval, and limit the growth of state spending must be restored to their original condition. <P>

First, California's constitution has always required that the budget sent to the legislature each January must be balanced, and for generations it naturally followed that the same requirement applies to the final product.  This constitutional requirement for a balanced budget has been circumvented through two devices. <P>

As discussed above, inflated revenue projections have often given the illusion of balance while annual expenditures clearly exceeded revenues.  But by 1993, even the polite pretense of a balanced budget was dropped, and the 1993 and 1994 budgets have included programmed "roll-overs" of debt from one year to the next.  Thus, budgets which would have been clearly unconstitutional if introduced in January are legally adopted in June, transforming California's balanced budget requirement from a revered practice to a quaint myth. <P>

A second vital mechanism which disciplined the state's expenditures had been Article XVI of the state constitution, which prohibits the state from borrowing more than $300,000 without a vote of the people.  A variety of court rulings and the ever-expanding interpretation of these rulings by budget writers has completely undermined this protection. <P>

During the depression of the 1930's, the state issued IOUs to meet temporary cash shortages, which the courts ruled was merely an emergency response to unanticipated events and therefore not a deliberate circumvention of the constitution.  Short term notes within the fiscal year were further sanctioned as a means to smooth out the monthly fluctuations in state revenues. <P>

This precedent has been used in recent years to justify financing a substantial portion of the state's operating deficit with billions of dollars in notes of less than one year.  During the budget deliberations of 1994, the Attorney General opined that court rulings which allowed the state to issue temporary IOU's for a few weeks between fiscal years to cover unexpected shortfalls now empowered the Legislature to enter into a multi-year $4 billion debt--tying the hands of legislators not yet elected. <P>

To add a final blow to Article XVI, the state introduced the fiction of lease-purchase bonds, which are discussed above. <P>

A third element in the taxpayer's triad of defense was a constitutional provision of more recent origin. In 1979, voters approved Proposition 4, better known as the Gann Spending Limit, which placed a flexible restraint on the total amount of funds the government could spend without voter approval.  The limit was hardly draconian (it expanded with population and inflation), and from 1979 to 1990 allowed state general fund spending to increase from $12.6 billion to $31.2 billion in current dollars. <P>

In 1988 and 1990, Propositions 98 and 111 changed the formula for calculating Gann, sending the spending limit into the upper stratosphere of government finance, where it still orbits unobtrusively today.  For example, Proposition 111, which the Legislature titled a "Transportation Improvement and Spending Limitation Act," increased the spending ceiling by $53.3 billion over a decade for purposes unrelated to transportation. <P>

The requirements that policy makers balance the budget, that they seek voter permission for borrowing and that they obtain public approval for expenditures above a certain limit, which operated effectively throughout the 1980's, have been knocked down one by one.  But in addition, perverse provisions have been adopted to encourage fiscal folly. <P>

The strangest provision virtually guarantees a future of deficit finance.  To his credit, Governor George Deukmejian insisted on a three percent prudent reserve for economic uncertainties, providing the budget with a cushion to accommodate unexpected revenue shortfalls or cost overruns. It was this reserve that protected California against deficits in the mid-1980's, and won the state a triple-A bond rating. <P>

Ironically, just when a reserve was most needed to cushion the erratic revenue and expenditure projections of the Department of Finance, the state's stewards eliminated the reserve, translating every miscalculation into red ink. <P>

To make matters worse, the 1991 budget included a statute which guarantees that a budget reserve will never be restored.  As part of the $8.1 billion tax and fee package that year, a quarter cent sales tax hike was instituted with a perverse trigger.  The $750 million annual tax is set to expire automatically when a three percent budget reserve is restored.  In effect, this measure provides budget writers with a $750 million disincentive ever to restore a prudent reserve, guaranteeing that every future calamity or shortfall will ratchet the state progressively deeper into debt. <P>

To restore fiscal discipline to the budget making process, it is an essential prerequisite that a true balanced budget provision be enacted into the state constitution; that a three percent reserve requirement govern all future budgets, and that the full intent of Article XVI be restored to prohibit non-voter approved borrowing.  If these provisions sound extreme, it is a measure of how dramatically the state's fiscal management has changed. These are precisely the constraints under which the state budget operated until the late 1980's, when California maintained a triple-A bond rating even while general fund expenditures more than doubled. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO THE BUREAUCRACY</B></FONT><P>

In addition to restoring fiscal discipline to the budget process, three dramatic alterations must be made to the bureaucracy itself.   First, brisk, healthy competition must be restored for the provision of governmental goods and services.  Second, superfluous or superannuated bureaucracies must be eliminated.  Third, the civil service system must be placed under the discipline of a free market. <P>

In their <I>History of Civilization</I>, Will and Ariel Durant ask the question, "What makes Ford a good car?"  Their answer, "Chevrolet." <P>

No human enterprise could be reasonably expected to perform optimally if the best and brightest producers were paid the same as the dullest and laziest sluggards.  Incentives matter: excellence must be rewarded if the sacrifices required to attain it are to be endured.  Over time, few people could be expected to continue to strive, to innovate, or to improve if guaranteed the same number of customers, an unbroken chain of pay increases, and a constantly expanding budget.  Yet this is precisely the way we manage the institutions responsible for educating our children, protecting our families and supporting our communities. <P>

Over the past twenty years, insurmountable obstacles have been deliberately erected to prevent California's government from doing what every family and business in the state does routinely: shop around for the best service at the lowest price. <P>

A constitutional amendment repealing anti-competitive provisions in current law would prompt an explosion in privatizing, offering California's beleaguered taxpayers a veritable cornucopia of better services at lower costs--a concept universal in the market but unknown in the government.  More importantly, it would introduce competitive incentives for bureaucrats to contain costs, to innovate, to improve efficiency, and even to be nice to their customers. <P>

Secondly, California government is riddled with overlapping bureaucracies and duplicative jurisdictions, both within the state government and among local, state and federal levels.  In 1992, the Commission on California Competitiveness warned: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Overlapping jurisdictions occur not only at all levels of government--state, regional and local--but within single-purpose agencies as well.  The result is a labyrinth of policies and regulations which, instead of fostering a thriving business community, confound and stymie small and large business alike.</BLOCKQUOTE> 

In addition, a wide range of state agencies simply provide no vital services at all.  In fact, when California's drought was officially declared at an end during the floods of 1993, instead of disbanding the superfluous "Drought Information Center," the bureaucracy was re-named the "Water Conservation Center" and will presumably continue through the next biblical flood. <P>

The obstacle to eliminating such agencies is that each has an established constituency, with a huge financial incentive to lobby for its expansion.  Congress faced this resistance when reformers tried to close out-dated military bases.  The result was the "Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission," an independent panel responsible for drafting a base closure list insulated from parochial congressional concerns.  The list of unnecessary bases cannot be amended by congress or the president, but must be accepted or rejected in total.  This mechanism protects members of congress from special interest pressures while proceeding with the long overdue closure of obsolete facilities.  A "Bureaucracy Closure Commission" could insulate legislators and the governor from the same pressures while taking the historic action of actually eliminating unnecessary state agencies. <P>
	
Third, the state's civil service system must be overhauled, as has been repeatedly advocated by officials as diverse as the governor and the legislative analyst.  California state employees are potentially just as productive and efficient and innovative and courteous as their private sector counterparts.  However, they are denied the incentives, inducements and rewards for excellence which are provided in every other field of human endeavor outside of government.  The state's civil service system fails to encourage the best and the brightest to rise to the top, and it provides a range of perverse financial and procedural incentives that destroy the impetus toward excellence which act on private sector workers in a competitive environment. <P>

Civil service examinations, which were originally intended to identify and promote proficiency, are now weighted with so many non-merit considerations (such as whether the applicant is a veteran or an incumbent state employee), that non-favored applicants with much higher performance are arbitrarily excluded.  The state's de facto racial and gender quotas further skew what was originally conceived as a system built exclusively on merit.  Ninety nine percent of eligible state employees received the maximum allowable "merit salary" increase last year, making a mockery of rewarding excellence over mediocrity.  Complicated personnel procedures make disciplinary action against state employees prohibitively expensive.   Incestuous promotions within agencies freeze out superior applicants and seniority protections reward longevity above all other considerations. <P>

The provisions in current law which capriciously confer unearned advantages in civil service examinations to veterans, state employees and other privileged classes ought to be removed.  The preference of seniority over merit ought to be discontinued.  The Public Employment Relations Board should be abolished, disciplinary proceedings should be streamlined, and dismissal standards conformed to those already well practiced in the private sector.  Outcome-based criteria for evaluating and rewarding job performance should be re-introduced. <P>

The reason that common-sense reforms are often ignored brings us to the second malfunction of the civil service: the enormous influence of public employee unions over the selection of management.  Public employee unions have significant advantages which are not shared by private sector unions, including the collection of union dues and political contributions at public expense, the ability to directly influence the selection of management  through the election process, and the ability to hold the public hostage in prolonged strikes. <P>  

If this unfair influence is to be contained, California's long-standing prohibition against public employee strikes, which was struck down by the Rose Bird Supreme Court, must be restored.  Public funds should not be used to assist the exaction of political contributions and union dues from state employees.  A state Hatch Act, modeled after the federal law which until recently maintained the political neutrality of federal bureaucrats, must be enacted to restrict the extent to which state public employees may make political demands on state elected officials. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CONCLUSION</B></FONT><P>

	Californians live in a state which has been blessed by the most equitable climate in the North American continent.  Geographically, it is poised on the Pacific rim, in a position to dominate trade in the next century.  It has the most bountiful resources of any of the contiguous states.  And yet for five years, it has suffered a continuing exodus of domestic population.  An unprecedented number of California's sons and daughters have found a better place to live and work and raise their families in the middle of the Nevada or Arizona deserts than they found in California.  This exodus has not been the result of acts of God, but rather of government.  Given the right policies, there is every reason to expect California to resume the prosperity, optimism and growth which has characterized her history as recently as the Pat Brown administration, when inflation-adjusted per capita spending was 38 percent less than it is today. <P>

California's recent experience affirms the wisdom of additional phased in tax cuts and suggests that the disastrous impact of the 1991 tax increases is being slowly repaired through the gradual repeal, expiration or offset of taxpayers' overall tax and regulatory burdens. <P>

Caution must still be exercised in planning the state's fiscal affairs, however, in the absence of significant changes in expenditure policy.  California's crumbling infrastructure, her failed public schools, her ubiquitous and overbearing regulators, her chronic budget deficits, her expanding bureaucracies, are all lessons unheeded from ancient Rome to modern Russia.  California's institutions are reaching the terminal phase of bureaucratic evolution, when they begin to fail to provide the most basic of services even while they consume ever increasing portions of the society's productivity. <P>

The brisk competition of a market place, the clear-headed elimination of unnecessary programs and agencies, and the restoration of merit as the guiding force of governmental administration are essential antidotes to the California's chronic fiscal anemia. <P>

A return to California's golden age requires a return to the fiscal discipline and the wholesome incentives which guided past generations. Ultimately, this is a question of political willpower.  It will happen on the day that the political will of the voters to demand reform exceeds the political will of the bureaucracy to resist it. <P>

<ALIGN=right>March 8, 1996</FONT></P>


<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Rocky Road to Electricity Deregulation</FONT></B><P>

In the last 15 years deregulation of major industries has led, in most cases, to better service and lower costs--witness the airline and telephone industries.  Likewise in the case of electricity, economists are happy to report that costs--and rates--will be going down.  The reason?  Good old-fashioned American competition.<P> 

Currently California consumers buy their electricity from individual power companies that have monopolies in their local markets, courtesy of the government, which both regulates them and sets their rates through the Public Utilities Commission.  Now, because of a 1992 federal law we are entering a new era in which power companies from all over the country will be able to compete to sell consumers electricity in much the same way people now buy phone service.  Although this new and better system promises lower costs and better service, there is a growing and heated debate here in California over the transition from monopoly to full blown free-market competition. <P>

The transition will not be easy.  The difficulties demonstrate the inefficiencies of the system of regulated monopolies that is common in our country.  This system has many of the same inequities of pure socialized production.  It carries negatives for customers and for the economy at large.  In the case of electricity, the problem has two parts.  The first is that rates have been set by a government body, and the ratepayers have no choice but to pay the rate that is set.  Power companies build into their rates all kinds of costs that would not be there in the face of competition. For many companies, competition could mean massive downsizing--loss of jobs and benefits on a large scale. <P>

The second problem is the potential, often realized, for an oversupply of electrical production.  The laws that set up the electricity monopoly here in California compel the power companies to provide electricity to any customer who seeks it.  Because electricity cannot be stored, it must be produced on demand.  This means that facilities must be able to meet all demands that are put on it.  This requires a significant investment in facilities and coordination.  To compound this challenge the Public Utilities Commission, in the interest of using renewable resources, mandated that power companies purchase electricity from co-generation plants--industrial facilities who create electricity using a by-product such as steam--at a cost significantly higher than their existing power plants.  In effect they are mandated not to be as efficient as they know they can be. <P>

Compare this to a company subjected to normal competition.  Like the power companies, they must predict how much their customers will demand.  To meet demand, they must make investments--in advance--in machines, materials and labor.  If they produce too much, they will have goods on hand that they cannot sell.  If they produce too little, they will miss opportunities to sell at a profit, opportunities likely to be seized by their competitors. <P>

The market rewards competitors that anticipate customers demands accurately.  In other words, companies make money if they make the correct advance decisions about what consumers will want and in what quantities they will want it.  Power companies are relieved of this pressure.  Moreover, the very laws that tell them to make sure they do not underestimate consumer demand encourage them to build power plants that are very expensive to operate and that are not necessary to meet market demand.  For example, several nuclear reactors in both Northern and Southern California cannot compete with the latest modern plants using non-nuclear technology.  We now know that they should not have been built.  Would a private company have made such a mistake?  Sometimes they do, but when they do, they suffer the consequences.  That makes them more careful. <P>  

To worsen an already bad situation, the government has intervened even more directly in the capital decisions of the regulated monopolies.  The windmills that stand in vast flocks in the low desert of Southern California and East Bay valleys in the North were built under the pressure of regulatory requirements, not market demand.  They are not an efficient way to produce electricity, but they please people who have an ideological commitment to the environment--or an investment in windmills.  The extra cost imposed on the electricity ratepayers is a hidden tax. <P>
  
Who should pay to get out of this situation?  It is true that the power companies have enjoyed a cozy situation for many years.  One argument is they--meaning their shareholders and possibly also their bondholders--should now pay the cost for the power plants that are not needed.  These power plants constitute what is called a "stranded investment," meaning that the investment has been made, but there may be no revenue stream to pay the investors back.  Why not leave the investors, the shareholders and bondholders of the regulated monopolies, high and dry? <P>

The answer against this route is that the public made commitments, which amount to a contract, in two different ways.  Through their political institutions the people passed laws that require the regulated monopolies to meet customer demand, and to meet all of it.  And they have required that power be produced in certain ways, whether the power companies liked it or not.  It would be one-sided to ask the shareholders of the regulated monopolies to bear the full cost.  These investment decisions were mandated by public authorities, so the public should bear the cost along with shareholders. <P>

The issue of principle raised by this point is profound.  An old tradition in America says that contracts are sacred, and they must be kept by all parties, even when one of those parties is the people acting through the government.  That tradition stems directly from the principles stated in the founding documents of our nation. <P>
  
We need then to accomplish two things.  The first is to put a stop to government sponsored monopoly in any function that can be performed by an ordinary business in a competitive environment.  In particular we must subject the electricity industry to the full rigor of competition.  This will impose upon that industry profound change, and likely some of its leading companies will lose their competitive advantage.  Some may even disappear. That is how markets work.  They are not kind to the inefficient or the slow. <P>  

As we make the transition, we must pay scrupulous attention to the commitments we have made and the costs we have imposed on others. This means, in practical terms, that the "stranded investments" of the electricity companies must be recaptured by them, and at the expense of the ratepayers over some reasonable period of time.  Especially is this true in cases-such as the windmills out in the desert-where the power companies had no control over these costs.  Electricity prices will fall more slowly because of this.  Let it be a lesson to us to keep the government out of such matters wherever possible. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>INTRODUCTION</B></FONT><P>

American parents, politicians, and business leaders are concerned about the quality of American education.  Everyone agrees that the system is broken.  And although there are dozens of ideas for reforming the schools, no idea is more widely accepted than the need for higher standards.  Other reform ideas--such as voucher programs, charter schools, or increasing per pupil expenditures--have vociferous advocates but lack the widespread support needed to change public education on a systemic basis. <P>

Almost all Americans agree that the schools do not set their sights high enough.  Raising standards is considered one of the best ways to improve the schools and students without radical restructuring.  It is thus useful to look at recent reform efforts which have focused on standards.  By doing so, we can evaluate the potential of current efforts and better understand what is at stake.  The essential question that must be addressed is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is more fundamental overhaul needed?  No state offers a better example of both the promise and pitfalls of standards reform than California. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Honig Years</B></FONT><P>  

California in the early 1980s was widely regarded as a trailblazer on the path to education reform.  It had a massive publicity campaign detailing the ideas to be implemented.  It had a highly regarded leader in Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, first elected in 1982.  It had one of the nation's largest teachers' unions and a state school system attentive to the latest ideas of reform. <P>

Honig ran and was first elected on a "back to basics" platform, which the public saw as the needed corrective after the explosive growth of school spending under Wilson Riles.  During the first years of his watch, schools refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, and it paid off.  From 1983 to 1987, elementary school pupils showed slow but steady improvement on the California Assessment Program (CAP) exam, though the increases were not consistent across the board and students continued to score well below the national average on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) and the Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT).  In all, however, there was reason for guarded optimism. <P>

What happened?  Like the Greek tragedies studied in the early days of American education, the mighty Golden State's small successes soon gave way to a punishing hubris.  State education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and began to put more emphasis on ideas popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists.  So from a primary focus on tried-and-true methods of basic education, the system lurched toward a more radical agenda.  There were numerous reasons for the change. <P>

Honig and the State Department of Education decided in 1987 that California's standards were not being applied "equitably."  Some students, mostly in middle to upper middle class areas, were performing better than students in poorer areas.  In such areas, active parents began to challenge school districts to deliver on the new basics education and the result was a system where students in some districts saw accelerated learning.  But in areas where parents were less involved and districts less challenged, scores continued to slide. <P>

Honig and others also became concerned that higher standards and greater discipline would frustrate and hurt the self esteem of many students.  He claimed that kindergartners were being pushed too hard to learn how to read, write, add, and subtract.  Instead of learning to read, Honig said, children ages four, five, and six should be spending their days listening to stories, acting out plays, counting with beans, growing plants in the windows and building with blocks. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Enter Stage Right: "Outcome-Based Education"</B></FONT><P>

Thus in 1987, the four years of California's modest attempts at reform ended and a new, more ambitious endeavor was launched.  New frameworks began to focus on "higher-order thinking skills," so-called "learning to learn" skills, and other abstract education theories.  Skills-based learning was pushed aside for a performance, or "outcome-based" curriculum. <P>

Hailed at the time as cutting edge and widely endorsed by business leaders, the new state standards led to a swift reversal in the gains of the previous four years.  From 1988 to 1994, statewide SAT scores stagnated.  Some districts did worse than others.  From 1990 to 1994, for example, the Los Angeles Unified School District's verbal average fell 13 points, and its math average declined by 16 points.  To take one year, the district's average in 1992 was 789--more than 100 points below the national average of 899 and the statewide average of 900.  That was down from 797 in 1991; 806 in 1990; and 817 in 1989.  On the verbal portion of the test, Los Angeles students averaged 357 points-down from 361 in 1991; 366 in 1990; and 372 in 1989.  On the math portion, students averaged 432 points--down from 436 in 1991; 440 in 1990; and 445 in 1989. <P>

These numbers were not lost on the business world that would be hiring the next generation of Golden State graduates.  According to a 1992 survey by the Council on California Competitiveness, 63 percent of California employers said recent high school graduates applying for entry level jobs "lack a satisfactory education." <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The CLAS Is Out</B></FONT><P>

By spring 1995, after eight years of experimenting with these progressive education techniques, California's education officials could no longer make excuses for students' poor performance.  Tests at both the national and state levels indicated a tragic debacle.  In March, the results of the defunct California Learning Assessment System test showed that a majority of the state's fourth, eighth, and tenth graders were below acceptable levels in reading, writing and math.  When the National Assessment of Education Progress reported a month later that California's fourth graders tied for last with 
Louisiana in reading proficiency, it was clear that the reforms of the last decade had failed. Newly elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin called the results "depressing" and pointed out what many California parents had known, or at least suspected, for a long time: "Our students are not learning to read well enough."<SUP>1</SUP><P>

The fact that she had presided over these years of failed experimentation from post as chairman of the Assembly Education Committee makes her admission all the more dramatic.  "We are not here to make excuses," Eastin said.  "The bottom line is something is wrong.  The kids' basic skills are not what they should be."<SUP>2</SUP>  It was a stunning admission that shocked the national education establishment.  It came from a woman who had either written or supported much of the legislation that compelled the schools to turn their back on skills instruction in the first place. <P>

The state went on red alert--again.  In the wake of the bad news, Eastin formed the California Reading Task Force, a 24 member panel of education experts, teachers, parents, and community members, to assess the present methods of reading instruction and suggest improvements. <P>

The task force issued its recommendations in September.  Entitled, "Every Child A Reader," the task force's report was in large measure a repudiation of the state's eight year experiment with "Whole Language," one of the major reforms implemented as part of the revised 1987 frameworks.  Considered one of the most dynamic ideas in education, whole language teaches reading by teaching students to identify words by sight, rather than sounding out words using the traditional phonics method. <P>

Though the task force did not recommend abolishing whole language entirely, its report made important concessions to traditionalists.  Among other things, "Every Child A Reader" called for a "balanced approach" in reading instruction, combining the "literature based" technique of whole language with skills development and tried-and-true, intensive systematic phonics. <P>

Even Bill Honig, the fallen champion of school reform, admitted to the news media that maybe he had pushed too far--that maybe the state shouldn't have eliminated skills instruction after all.<SUP>3</SUP><P>

The revelations from CLAS and NAEP are only the latest numbers indicating that California's students are wallowing in the education mire, if not sinking.  They are even more significant in light of what was already known when the Golden State began to reform itself.  Twelve years earlier, the National Commission on Excellence in Education's landmark report, "A Nation At Risk," identified a "rising tide of mediocrity" in the schools and launched a series of reforms supposed to put public education right back on track.  There was no longer any question that the establishment didn't know that something was wrong. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rediscovering Standards, Again</B></FONT><P>

In the wake of these revelations, new ideas took shape.  "Standards" became the battle cry of the eighties, as education officials, legislators, administrators, and teachers labored over how to make kids learn better.  Conservative political reformers' call to raise expectations and accountability was heard.  The education establishment agreed.  For the first time in nearly 40 years there was a consensus about what needed to be done.  Standards, however, have proved to be more problematic than once believed.  The movement to raise standards gave rise to a fundamental conflict of visions that has split efforts to reform the education system.  The questions became whose standards and how to implement them.  Even the methods needed to measure them differed radically. <P>

While almost everyone agrees on the end--that students should graduate from school having, among other things, mastered certain basic skills--there is fierce disagreement about the means.  Much of the debate centers on "content" versus "performance" standards.  Content standards refer to the skills and knowledge to be taught, while performance standards focus on the depth of mastery, often through essays, science experiments, mathematical evidence, or a combination of these activities, in each skill area. <P>

Performance standards have garnered the most recent national attention, mainly due to their association with Outcome Based Education (OBE) curriculum and testing.  The problem with OBE is that nobody fails.  Getting the correct answer, students are told, is not nearly so important as how they solve the problem.  And so the push for standards was ultimately hijacked in the mid 1980s by the abandonment of basic skills in favor of immeasurable, obscure "skills" such as "critical thinking" and "problem solving." Performance either remained static, with occasional upticks, or declined. <P>

A 1993 federally-funded study showed U.S. high school students spend an average of only three hours every school day on core academic subjects.  Classwork in English, math, science, history, geography, foreign languages, civics, and fine arts lags by 50 percent behind that of competitor nations.  Total academic hours in a four year period in the U.S. is 1,460, compared to 3,268 in Germany and 3,170 in Japan.<SUP>4</SUP><P>

Thus, the last fifteen years have been a story of failed reform.  After all the "back to basics" rhetoric, the revised curriculum, the new assessments, and  higher expenditures, California schools were in worse shape than ever.  Understanding why these efforts failed will help us map a more intelligent course to achieve the goal of higher standards and improved education for all students. <P>

Thirty years ago, California's schools weren't that bad.  There was no state-mandated curriculum or graduation requirements a generation ago, and yet California's students were at or near the top of their game.  Priorities began to shift in the 1960s, as progressive ideas in education gained new currency in the education department and teachers' colleges and began filtering into schools and enshrined in law.  The 1970s saw a downward slide in standardized test scores.  From 1970 to 1980, California's average SAT score fell 58 points, from 957 to 899.  The average verbal score fell from 464 to 425, and the average math score falling from 493 to 474.<SUP>5</SUP><P>

In 1982, the only requirement to graduate from high school in the state was two years of physical education.<SUP>6</SUP>  School districts had their own graduation requirements, but nearly half were non-academic courses, a lingering and persistent symptom of the "life education" model popular in the 1950s.  Also, schools regularly assigned their students into tracks, depending on their grades and how well they performed on standardized tests.  Former U.S.  Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch explains that tracking tended to shortchange students, especially those students who were neither exemplary nor in need of remedial help: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"A Stanford University study released in 1984 found that high school students were assigned to four different tracks.  About 10 percent were in an honors track, about 35 percent were in the college preparatory track, 10-15 percent were in a remedial track, and nearly 45 percent were in the general track.  The general track students had the weakest, most incoherent curriculum, with the most non-academic electives.  A sample transcript of a general track student included courses in typing, cultural awareness, homemaking, beginning restaurant management, food for singles, exploring childhood, and clothing."<SUP>7</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Thus the stage was set for more than ten years of trial and error in education reform. <P>

<P ALIGN=right>-State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, April 1986</P>

In 1983, Californians looked upon their schools and despaired.  That year, "A Nation At Risk" sent shockwaves through the American education establishment.  California's education officials faced climbing dropout and illiteracy rates, and plummeting standardized test scores.  When Bill Honig took office in January 1983, the average combined SAT score was 895.  (By comparison, the national average that year was 893.<SUP>8</SUP>)<P>

A self-described former progressive turned traditionalist, Honig campaigned throughout the 1980s on the need for schools to "get back to basics."  His message was the same wherever he went:  Kids need more homework, better-trained teachers, more challenging textbooks, stricter discipline, and a traditional education firmly rooted in the basics.  Math, science, history, and literature were not just for the college-bound.<SUP>9</SUP>  He criticized the non-academic courses which dominated the various curriculums offered in over 1,000 school districts across the state, and vowed to do away with tracking.  He won the 1982 election with 56 percent of the vote. <P>

Upon his election, Honig immediately set out to centralize the curriculums.  Students would no longer be able to graduate from high school with courses in home economics and food.  In 1983, Honig pushed (and the legislature passed) SB 813, the California Education Reform Act, an $800 million reform package that set strict graduation requirements, and created a state-mandated curriculum that included English, history, math, science, fine arts, foreign language, health, and physical education.<SUP>10</SUP>  Honig retooled the CAP test, setting the average score at 250 and challenging all schools to meet or exceed that number. <P>

Honig took a strong stand on textbooks, arguing that most had been watered down over the last decade.  With 11 percent of the total U.S. student population, California is the largest textbook buyer in the nation (with Texas a close second).  When California wants a change, the textbook publishers listen.  In 1985, the state rejected most junior high school science books up for consideration.  In 1986, it rejected all of the math books.<SUP>11</SUP>  And in 1988, the state threatened to do the same with about half of the reading, spelling, and English texts unless publishers revised them to place greater emphasis on writing and making stories more interesting. <P>

Honig also began issuing annual report cards to chart the progress of reform.  In June 1986, Honig's state report card found that after three years of the reform effort, only 47 percent of the state's 739 high schools were able to raise the reading and math scores on the CAP test high enough to meet the goals set in 1983.  CAP averages rose less than one percent overall, and when compared with similar tests, California students ranked 41st percentile nationally in reading, 48th percentile in math.<SUP>12</SUP>  Nationally, they have remained at or near the bottom ever since. <P>

But Honig assured the public that reform was right on track.  After three years, he could boast that for the first time since 1979, California's sixth grade students showed as much progress in the basic skills as third graders.  The 1985-86 scores for third, sixth and eighth graders showed improvement in all subject areas but eighth grade history.  Both third and sixth graders raised their average scores by 17 points.  "There is momentum, there is direction, there is a common vision," Honig said.<SUP>13</SUP><P>

Also, SAT scores went up 11 points from 1982-83 to 1986-87, when California's average combined score was 906.  The national average for 1986-87 was also 906.  (California's 12th graders tended to score better on the math portion of the test--482 compared to 476 nationally--and lower on the verbal portion--424 compared to 430 nationally.)  That year, 46.4 percent of California's high school seniors took the college entrance exam.<SUP>14</SUP>

There was good reason then to believe that the reforms were working.  As columnist Peter Schrag wrote after Honig released his data, <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The report recognizes the progress that's been made under the state's school reform law of 1983 and the increased funding of the past three years.  But it also documents how far California--now mediocre at best by most national standards--still has to go, and how much more difficult the problems of California education are likely to become in the next few years.  Student performance on academic test scores--assuming they're indicative--shows similarly mixed numbers.  Scores of elementary school students are up from their lows of the 1970s.  They started to rise before the reform law was passed, both in California and nationally, and before George Deukmejian and Bill Honig were elected, while high school scores, both on California's own tests and on such measures as the SAT are still lagging.  In 1984-85, for example, 12th graders scored considerably higher in mathematics on the CAP test than they had five years earlier, but slightly lower in reading."<SUP>15</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The conventions of spelling, handwriting, grammar, and punctuation should be taught as subskills. . . .</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=right>-California State Language Arts Frameworks</P>

At Superintendent Honig's behest, the course of reform shifted in 1987.  New curriculum "frameworks" were introduced that departed radically from the "back to basics" approach he advocated over the previous four years.  Four factors contributed to the change. <P>

First, higher standards were a victim of their own success.  Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) surveyed 17 unidentified high schools across the state and found that all exceeded the standards imposed by SB 813.  As the basics appeared to improve, however, schools began tinkering with other areas of instruction which had nothing whatsoever to do with reading, writing, or math.  "We found people talking about an even more complex and deeper curriculum: thinking skills, learning-to-learn skills, problem-solving skills," said USC education professor Allan Odden, a member of the PACE research team.<SUP>16</SUP>  But as priorities changed, so did the definition of "basic skills."  Simply teaching verb conjugation and multiplication was not enough.  Schools had to teach kids how to think. <P>

Second, even though reform was working, the improvements were not evident across the board.  Honig and other educationists began to worry that reform was not progressing as well in certain areas, particularly inner cities.  Honig estimated that a little more than a quarter of the state's 1,780 middle and high schools had made real progress with the 1983 reforms.  About 40 percent had made some progress, but "there's another 25 percent where nothing has happened."<SUP>17</SUP>  Lingering problems, Honig and other education analysts throughout the state reasoned, had to do foremost with inequities in funding and changing demographics. <P>

Also, Honig was concerned that younger children were being overwhelmed by performance goals too early.  Advocating they be read to instead, he urged schools to hold off teaching kindergarten students to read.  He feared that too much attention on academics early on would alienate and possibly drive away students later and cited a study indicating that future drop-outs could be identified as early as third grade. <P>

Finally, an increasingly performance-based curriculum generated the need for performance-based assessment.  The trouble was, nobody could agree on what exactly "performance-based" meant.  As priorities changed to favor "learning-to-learn" skills and the like, assessment systems had to change as well. <P>

So, skills instruction was out, and outcome-based instruction was in.  Though differing in subject, each new curriculum framework was built around four central ideas: <P>

<UL>
<LI>An emphasis on thinking, application, and problem solving;
 
<LI>High expectations for all students, instead of the tracking that had been prevalent;
 
<LI>A focus on the body of knowledge and the ways of knowing in each discipline, enabling every student to build a foundation for future learning;
 
<LI>A shift from coverage of minute details to emphasis on understanding the major ideas in each field.<SUP>18</SUP>
</UL>

An instructional shift from minutia to the bigger picture sounded like a good idea at the time, but before long it was clear that the change in focus robbed students of the very foundation for learning that the frameworks were supposed to provide.  As priorities changed, non-academic subject matter began to leak back into the curriculum.  Thus, the definition of "skills" was expanded to include "critical thinking," "life skills," "conflict resolution," and a whole gaggle of special interest-mandated studies which came at the expense of the true basics. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Language Arts</B></FONT><P>

Under the new frameworks, California stopped teaching English and began teaching "language arts." The new language arts framework all but abandoned basic skills instruction.  Elementary grammar, punctuation, spelling, and vocabulary went by the boards: no more drills, no more workbooks, no more vocabulary tests. <P>

But the most radical change was the way in which reading was taught.  For more than thirty years, with the exception of a short period in the early seventies, California students learned to read using the "Look-Say" method, best known for the "Dick and Jane" series of readers.  Look-Say was the among the first in a long line of progressive education reforms designed to make learning more interesting.  The theory behind it was that kids could learn to read better by identifying words with pictures--See Dick, see Dick run, see Dick run to the Tree, and so forth.  Look-Say largely replaced phonics, which teaches kids to read by sounding out words through drill and repetition.  Educationists dismissed phonics as too boring.  But research has indicated time and again that intensive systematic phonics is the most effective method of reading instruction, boring or not.  California retained some aspects of phonetic instruction in the Look-Say curriculum. <P>

The new language arts framework jettisoned Dick and Jane--along with what little phonetic instruction that remained-for the "literature-based" approach known as "whole language."  Like its predecessor Look-Say, whole language teaches students to identify whole words rather than sound them out.  The technique is based on the belief that if kids can learn to speak by being exposed to spoken words, then they can become literate by being exposed to literature. <P>

But whole language is more than just a method of teaching kids to read.  It's a philosophy of learning.  As one proponent described it, whole language is "child-centered, experiential, reflective, authentic, holistic, social, collaborative, democratic, cognitive, developmental, constructivist, and challenging."<SUP>19</SUP>  Phonics, whole language enthusiasts say, is "generally boring and lead[s] to a dislike of reading," "misrepresent[s] what reading is," "detract[s] from time that would be better spent in reading aloud together," and "lead[s] to unrealistic expectations for children."<SUP>20</SUP>  Eighty-seven percent of reading teachers embraced whole language, according to a survey, and fewer than one in ten employed phonics.<SUP>21</SUP><P>

Honig and the state education department made it clear that there was not enough attention to writing under the old frameworks, largely because writing wasn't tested.  As with reading, the whole language approach to writing is based on the faith that students will learn to write by immersion in writing.  This method has some rather disturbing byproducts.  One byproduct of whole language is "invented spelling," which is the educationist's euphemism for uncorrected misspelling.  The idea is to shift "from a focus on error to a focus on creation" and to encourage students to become "natural writers." Just as reading is supposed to come naturally, through exposure to literature, "learning to spell should ultimately be as natural, unconscious, effortless, and pleasant as learning to speak."<SUP>22</SUP><P>

Even though Honig has since switched his position on whole language, he still finds merit in invented spelling.  In fact, he believes the method can even be used effectively in phonics instruction: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"'Invented' or 'temporary' spelling is a technique that allows students to approximate the letters and patterns of letters which represent a given sound and so permits the construction of more advanced writing connected to student interests.  It is a helpful technique to encourage students to write and pays off in increased writing volume and more elaborate stories, which in turn encourage children to think about what they are writing more than traditional techniques."<SUP>23</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Couched in such technical terms, invented spelling almost sounds reasonable.  Here it is in practice, as employed by a six-year old student in San Francisco: "If i wd hf mg ics I wd save the bses and one I sav the bes then I wi g thm way the end."  Translation: "If I would have magic beans, I would save the beans.  And when I save the beans, then I will give them away.  The End."  The child was writing a book report about "Jack and the Beanstalk" for his first grade class.  His teacher, Michelle Chabra, told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> that he was permitted, even encouraged, to write that way because it will help him become a writer in "the truest sense."  "The issue is confidence," she said.<SUP>24</SUP><P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Education As Therapy: The Self Esteem Task Force</B></FONT><P>

Building confidence was and remains a crucial element of California's curriculum.  By reinforcing the self-esteem of students, the theory goes, all other things would fall into place; students would be more interested in learning, thereby improving their performance.  California, always on the forefront of education change, reacted to this new thinking with its <I>modus operandi</I>--it formed a task force.<P>

The California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem first convened in 1988.  Three years and $735,000 later, the task force concluded that a positive sense of self was the cure for what ails many students, especially in the crime-ridden inner cities.<P>

A good self-conception, the task force reported, "inoculates us against the lures of crime, violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, child abuse, chronic welfare dependency, and educational failure."<SUP>25</SUP><P>

This thinking about feelings profoundly affected the course of California education.  While the public called for higher standards, standards within the education universe were corrupted by the new psychological imperative that failure was not an option because of its alienating effect on students.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Mathematics</B></FONT><P>

California introduced its new mathematics frameworks in 1985.  They would become a model for the national math standards introduced four years later.  Similar to the language-arts model, the new curriculum was designed to teach math in a "new, dynamic way," again by moving away from basics and refocusing on "problem-solving skills."<P>

For example, writes Charles Sykes, "a typical eighth grade student might be asked to 'Write a set of directions for a younger student, explaining how to add 2/3 and 1/3.  Then use a picture and write an explanation as to why you add fractions the way you do.'  The idea was to encourage children to think and communicate mathematically, a skill that was encouraged by having students write in journals and creating mathematical artwork."<SUP>26</SUP> Flash cards and multiplication tables were out.  For the first time, students were permitted to use calculators.<P>

And teachers stopped teaching.  A teachers' guide for one fourth grade math text admonished instructors to step back and let students lead discussions.  "Your job is . . . not to judge the rightness or wrongness of each student's answer.  Let those determinations come from the class. . . .  Avoid showing any verbal or nonverbal signs of approval and ask, 'Does everybody agree?'"<SUP>27</SUP><P>

According to Wayne Bishop, professor of mathematics at California State University, Los Angeles and a member of the State Superintendent's Math Task Force, this "new, new math" departed too far from the rudiments of math in favor of this "dynamic" approach.  "There has been far too much support for curricula and instructional techniques that are perceived as being in harmony with the California Framework . . . and the NCTM [National Council of Teachers of Mathematics] Standards, given that there is almost no statistical data that has been confirmed as valid and reliable in support.  In fact, considerable contrary data, such as the Oklahoma City study or the Japanese avoidance of calculator use in elementary school, is simply ignored because the results do not agree with the philosophical underpinnings of the current [math] reform movement."<SUP>28</SUP><P>

On the whole, impact of the frameworks has been mixed.  Younger students have clearly fared worse than older students who had a chance to learn basic skills under the pre-1987 frameworks.  The 1991 NAEP found that California's students ranked in the bottom third of participating states in mathematics.  And, Sykes notes, "only one in 12 eighth graders was capable of working the problem" asking them to explain how to add two fractions.<SUP>29</SUP><P>

In 1992, NAEP reported similarly bad news in reading: their report found California's eighth graders tied for last with their classmates in Louisiana--a result that was repeated two years later, which made big news in the spring of 1995.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CLAS Dismissed</B></FONT><P>

California's own assessments were a mixed bag.  In 1990, the education department reported that CAP scores in reading and writing dropped for the third consecutive year for third graders, who were the first group exposed to the new language-arts frameworks.  Sixth grade scores also fell.  Math scores for those grades did improve, however, and eighth grade scores improved slightly across the board.<SUP>30</SUP>  Yet from 1986 to 1991, the average eighth grade reading score increased 14 points to 257; math scores increased 18 points to 271; history/social science scores increased 17 points to 260; and science scores increased 19 points to 269.<P>

Overall, the CAP scores were a mess.  They were difficult to gauge due to wide disparities among the grades, and on the decline among younger students.  The modest gains of 1986-87 were overshadowed by the beginning of the new decade, as more reports were released showing students' performance was slipping.  So in 1991, education leaders decided that the old test was not authentic.<P>

"Authentic" (or "performance-based") assessment is the kissing cousin of outcome-based education and a typical phrase educators use in conjunction with standards.  According to conventional wisdom, multiple choice tests do not give an accurate portrait of what a student can and cannot do in a particular subject.  Authentic assessment purports to do away with the pitfalls of the old multiple choice tests by making students demonstrate what they know.  The technique "directly measures actual performance in a subject area," according to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing.  "Standardized multiple choice tests, on the other hand, measure test-taking skills directly and everything else either indirectly or not at all."  There is some truth to this, although many education experts still maintain that multiple choice tests can be "authentic" if the questions are detailed enough, and require students to perform several complex tasks.<SUP>31</SUP>  Like OBE, "performance-based" assessment was decorated in conservative garb and sold as a way to hold schools and teachers accountable.<P>

Specific authentic assessment techniques include: "written products, solutions to problems, experiments, exhibitions, performances, portfolios of work and teacher observations, checklists and inventories, and cooperative group projects.  These assessments may evaluate regular classroom activity or take the form of tests or special projects."<SUP>32</SUP><P>

A new, performance-based test--the California Learning Assessment System, or CLAS--was developed in cooperation with Governor Wilson, Honig, and State Senator Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara).  According to Honig, the goal was to develop techniques to teach students to analyze, evaluate, understand and explain what they were learning.  The new test, he said, would test "what students know, not how well they can guess."  Wilson wanted numbers: "individual student scores so parents can track how their children stack up, and so teachers can be evaluated by how well their charges do."<SUP>33</SUP>  The State Legislature in 1991 passed a bill sponsored by State Senator Gary Hart authorizing the creation of the new tests.  CLAS was first administered in Fall 1992.<P>

What eventually happened with the CLAS test is fairly well known, although the finer details may have been lost in the media circus that surrounded it.  The 1994 controversy surrounding the CLAS test was, at bottom, a challenge to the legitimacy of outcome or performance-based assessment.  What had originally been an attempt by conservative reformers to turn the focus in education from the historical measurement of inputs (i.e., spending, class time, etc.), to an objective measure of accountability (e.g., can the student find the square root of 81 or diagram a sentence?) was contorted by the educationists into a mainly political and social agenda.<P>

CLAS, described as "manifestly unworthy" by no less than the State Auditor General, was an "outcomes-based" debacle of the highest order.  Students were graded 85 percent on what they expressed, and 15 percent on how they expressed it.  And it was anything but standardized.  In 1994, there were about 97 versions of the test in circulation.  Much of CLAS spurned traditional literature in favor of contemporary, politically-correct writing.<P>

The press heralded CLAS as a way of making students really show what they know.  Writing in the <I>Sacramento Bee</I> shortly before Governor Wilson signed the CLAS legislation in 1991, Peter Schrag gushed:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"[CLAS] would ask them to solve real problems, giving elementary school students, for example, some simple equipment--a battery, a couple of wires, a light bulb--and ask them to create a circuit that lights the bulb, then draw a diagram to show what they did.  It would demand more writing.  It would ask them to construct models.  It would require oral solutions to certain problems.  And it would lead to the creation of a 'portfolio' on each student that includes art and science projects and essays, as well as more conventional work on which each student would be evaluated."<SUP>34</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

CLAS found support early on from the California Business Roundtable and other business groups as an ideal way of measuring those oft-mentioned "critical thinking" and "higher-order" skills.  The Roundtable, unable to ignore the siren song of performance-based testing, did not back off its support of the "cleanup" legislation, even after being advised in mid-1994 that the CLAS test did not grade for punctuation, grammar, and spelling.  Nor did the union-backed legislators (including then-Assemblyman Delaine Eastin) on the education policy committees blink during hour after hour of testimony by parents, educators, and legislators questioning the details of the test.  They simply circled their wagons and voted to reauthorize the test, which was eventually vetoed by the Governor.<P>

Just what was wrong with the CLAS test?  It evaluated students more on their feeling than their analysis of a subject.  It permitted students to take certain sections of the test in groups.  It didn't require students to write complete sentences, much less complete paragraphs.  In some cases, students could draw pictures instead of write their answers.  In short, it furthered the state's policy of eschewing basic skills for so-called "problem solving" skills.  Some portions of the test bore little relationship to the subjects they were supposed to be testing, or were used to push particular agendas.  For example, a fourth grade science question asked: "When trash leaves your home, where do you think it goes?"<SUP>35</SUP>

The literature portion of the test provoked the most controversy.  It was there that the state, asking students questions relating to their personal beliefs about religion, politics, and family, stepped over the line.  Examples abound:<P>

<UL>
<LI>A fourth grade literature question presented a short biography of Civil Rights-era icon Rosa Parks and asked students to "discuss your thoughts," draw posters, and explain how the story related to their lives.<SUP>36</SUP>
 
<LI>A prototype fourth grade literature section included a story about discrimination against Chinese immigrant laborers in California during the 19th century.  Students were again asked to write their thoughts and feelings about the story, and to discuss their own experiences with discrimination.  Another question asked what kind of problems teenagers have with their parents.<SUP>37</SUP> That particular question was fiercely denounced by parents and some civil libertarians as invasive and psychological in nature, and therefore in violation of state laws prohibiting schools from administering psychological tests without permission.
 
<LI>Tenth graders were asked to read an excerpt from "Roselily," a short story by <I>Color Purple</I> author Alice Walker about a black unmarried mother who is about to wed a Muslim man.  Parents objected to a number of passages, including: ". . . She cannot always be a bride and a virgin, wearing robes and veil.  Even now her body itches to be free of satin and voile. . . .  She wonders what it will be like.  Not to have to go to a job.  Not to work in a sewing plant.  Her place will be in the home, he has said, repeatedly, promising her rest she has prayed for.  But now she wonders.  When she has rested, what will she do?  They will make babies--she thinks practically about her fine brown body, his strong black one.  They will be inevitable.  Her hands will be full.  Full of what?  Babies.  She is not comforted."  At one point, the groom declares that Christians believe in "the wrong God."  Parents criticized the story and the accompanying questions because they "emphasized emotion, not intellect."  Some parents and education critics said the story was anti-Christian and anti-clergy.  In response to the public outcry, the education department removed the passage from the 1994 test.<SUP>38</SUP>
 
<LI>One of the more controversial passages students were asked to analyze appeared in a story entitled, "Just Lather, That's All" on the tenth grade test.  The narrator of the story is a barber with homicidal thoughts.  "I could cut this throat just so--zip, zip.  I wouldn't give him the time to resist, and since he has his eyes closed he wouldn't see the glistening blade or my glistening eyes.  But I'm trembling like a real murderer.  Out of his neck a gush of blood would spout onto the sheet, on the chair, on my hands, on the floor."<SUP>39</SUP>
</UL>

For all the trendiness, the group work, the sketch drawing, the stream of consciousness writing, the pseudo-psychoanalysis--in short, the distinct lack of objective standards--students still performed poorly on the CLAS test in 1994.  Statewide, 70 percent of students tested below proficiency in reading; 60 percent were below proficiency in writing; and 80 percent were below proficiency in math.  Tenth graders fared among the worst:  86 percent of high school sophomores tested below proficiency in math.<P>

The two-year experiment cost California taxpayers $28 million.  Governor Wilson vetoed continued funding for CLAS in September 1994.<P>

Barely mentioned was the quiet release in June 1995 of the final set of scores for two pilot exams in history and science given to the state's fifth graders in May 1994.  The results demonstrated that students were not just poor readers and mathematicians, but substandard in science and ignorant of U.S. and California history, too.  Only 34 percent of fifth graders scored three or better (out of a possible six) on the CLAS history test, and 37 percent scored three or higher on the science test.<SUP>40</SUP><P>

Academic standards remain, for now, in the hands of the state school superintendent, the legislature, and gubernatorial appointees.  State officials cannot shake their belief that the best answers to the problems plaguing California's schools come from the top.  But if the last decade of experimenting with state-mandated standards have proven anything, it is that top-down mandates and one-size-fits-all standards rarely work. Invariably, standards become debased by politics or infected with educationist cant. And results, in the form of standardized tests, have been mixed at best. In big city school districts like Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, they've been downright disastrous.<P>

Nineteen ninty-five may one day be seen as a watershed year for the standards movement.  It was the year that state officials began to doubt the effectiveness of the state standards project, and began talking at least about making amends.  The question remains whether the public policy that follows will be consistent with the rhetoric.<P>

State education officials have been more critical of the drift away from skills instruction, indicating a possible turn of the tide.  "It's a terrible thing to do to children," Wilson education advisor Maureen DiMarco said last year of the new "new math."  "This should be common sense.  Every time we throw out the fundamental skills we get into trouble."<SUP>41</SUP><P>

"Where we went wrong," former school superintendent Bill Honig confessed to the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>, "is that we weren't strong enough on the basic skills.  We thought teachers would continue teaching the skills, but they didn't."<SUP>42</SUP><P>

And in the wake of the double blow from CLAS and NAEP, Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin asked, "do we have the courage to face these results honestly and do something?"<SUP>43</SUP>  But Eastin continues to tour schools across the state touting the virtues of state-mandated standards as "something we've never tried before."<P>

Since the death of CLAS, the state Department of Education has been scrambling to find a suitable replacement.  A new standardized testing bill (AB 265) passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Wilson in October.  The new law basically creates two tests.  Students in grades two through ten will take basic skills tests that will assess their ability to read, write, and perform basic mathematical calculations.  Unlike the old CLAS test, the new skills test will grade students individually so parents can have some idea how their children are progressing.<P>

In addition, fourth, fifth, eighth, and tenth graders will take a statewide exam that includes more in-depth questions that assess basic skills as well as students' ability to apply those skills in reading, writing, math, science and history--presumably what the CLAS test was supposed to do.<P>

Legislators attempted to address many of the objections to the CLAS test in the new legislation.  On the new exam, questions that probe into a student's personal beliefs or practices in sex, family life, morality or religion are strictly prohibited.  Legislators also included an opt-out clause, so parents may choose whether or not their children take the test.<SUP>44</SUP><P>

The problem with the new law is that, like CLAS, it establishes a statewide assessment but fails to create standards prior to the development of the tests. Unless there is supplemental legislation which clearly removes the cart from in front of the horse, the adage "testing drives curriculum" will continue to dominate schools in the state.<P>

Similarly, the state will continue to reform its curriculum frameworks, but the impact will not be seen most likely for several years until new teachers are trained and new textbooks are issued that reflect the changes.  The California Reading Task Force's report called for sweeping changes, particularly a more "balanced" approach to reading instruction that gives intensive systematic phonics its due.  The task force also recommended ongoing assessment of students' reading skills, early intervention programs, more books for school libraries, limiting class sizes, new training, and new books.  That raises serious questions about how this can be done and where the state will find the money to pay for it all.<P>

But there also appears to be resistance within elements of the bureaucracy itself.  A week after the task force issued its findings, the English Language Arts and English as a Second Language Textbook Adoption Committee held its "Invitation to Submit" meeting, at which it was made clear that until the legislature says otherwise, the task force's recommendations were just that.  "The Reading Task Force has no impact on the evaluation of adoption," said committee member Glen Thomas.  "The [old] K-8 Instructional Resources Evaluation Form is what publishers need to be concerned with." Another committee member, Dennis Parker, was more blunt: "Balance does not mean 50-50."<P>

National standards will continue to overshadow California.  The prospect of  California having to comply with top-down standards set at the federal level is very real as long as the state receives Goals 2000 grants.  Although U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley insists that the program contains "zero regulations," there are a number of thinly-disguised federal mandates.  In addition to mandating "voluntary" standards, the law imposes onerous spending requirements, issues federal "skills" certificates, and ultimately shifts the educational agenda from the states to the federal government.<P>

Goals 2000 will drive national standards, not only because of its mandates regarding curriculum and assessments but also because of the revolving door that exists between various elements of government bureaucracy and vested interest groups, as well as individual education "experts."  Even the <I>de facto</I> standards in textbooks and standard assessments seem preferable to allowing the long arm of contemporary government such an "up close and personal" entry into the lives of youth.<P>

School-To-Work is among the latest Goals 2000-related federal programs to usurp state autonomy and again divert the standards question away from academics and on to more vocational skills.  Congress debated and passed the School-To-Work Opportunity Act in conjunction with Goals 2000 in 1994. The law was reauthorized in 1995. Designed ostensibly to create an internationally competitive workforce, federal School-To-Work legislation creates a National Skills Standards Board to evaluate and certify the skills of potential employees.  School-To-Work enjoys widespread support among business leaders, who spend millions each year retraining poorly educated graduates. But two objections emerge: first, students who do not receive skills certificates, for whatever reason (including non-participation in the program) will be put at a competitive disadvantage; and second, the reemphasize on work skills could represent a return to the non-academic standards which dominated the curriculum in the early 1980s, when students graduated high school with courses in shop, home economics, and food.<P>

Also, California is one of 17 states involved in the New Standards Project which has continued to forge ahead in spite of the intense criticism surrounding the development of national standards.  In drafting content and performance standards, the project reviews the national standards as they emerge from federally and privately financed panels as well as those being developed in partner states.  The State Legislature budgeted $500,000 in membership dues for California's continued participation in the project.  It is not clear how, or if, this effort will mesh with the work of the new 21-member state Standards Commission, whose members are to be appointed by the Governor and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, under AB 265. The State Senate is at work on follow-up legislation, SB 430, which will clarify who will appoint the commission, and how the commission will operate. The new legislation also includes an amendment requiring any new assessment system be based explicitly on the standards that come out of the commission. <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>There will be no renaissance without revolution. . . .  We must transform America's schools.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=right>-President George Bush, America 2000</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>A culture that glamorizes glad-handing and mediocre levels of learning is hardly compatible with global forces that daily put a higher premium on knowledge.  If the notion is allowed to stand, it will do our children a terrible disservice.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=right>-Public Agenda Foundation, 1995</P>

Knowing the penchant of education officials to hijack valid concepts and reshape them into self-serving mandates and regulations, initiating reform aimed at higher academic standards is like walking the razor's edge.  Even so, it is a journey that must be attempted.<P>

Americans across the political spectrum strongly and consistently support higher standards, even when they know the possible negative consequences for students' "self-esteem."  A recent report by the liberal Public Agenda Foundation, "Assignment Incomplete: The Unfinished Business of School Reform," indicates that testing, withholding diplomas, toughening grading, and establishing clear guidelines for what students should learn were viewed as positive actions among the general public.<SUP>45</SUP><P>

To succeed, the journey must achieve greater participation by local communities and parents.  California's schools cannot afford to continue along their present course of state-mandated standards, steeped in non-academic subject matter and untried educationist theories about critical thinking and self esteem.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RECOMMENDATIONS</B></FONT><P>

<B>For Parents:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>Inquire whether schools and districts have a "basics first" philosophy.  Don't just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Demand academic excellence. 
 
<LI>Determine whether schools implement a systematic phonics approach to reading. Obtain the State Reading Taskforce's report, <I>Every Child A Reader</I>, available 
from State Superintendent Delaine Eastin's office. Bill Honig's criticism of whole language and his conversion to the merits of skills instruction is detailed in <I>How Should We Teach Our Children To Read? The Role of Skills in a Comprehensive Reading Program: A Balanced Approach </I>(Far West Laboratory for Education Research and Development, San Francisco).  Though Honig tries to please everyone, he offers a devastating critique of the "two myths of whole language," and demonstrates why phonics is essential to a good reading curriculum.  The Virginia-based National Right to Read Foundation is a clearinghouse of information on phonics and whole language.<SUP>46</SUP>
 
<LI>Monitor homework and/or classroom assignments, particularly essays, for an academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus.
 
<LI>Consider home use of E. D. Hirsch, Jr.'s <I>Core Knowledge Series: What Your First-Sixth Grader Needs to Know</I>, published by Core Publications, Inc.  The content builds on prior foundations of information through a grade by grade sequence of specific guidelines in history, geography, mathematics, science, language arts, and the fine arts. Also excellent are William J. Bennett's <I>The Book of Virtues</I> and <I>The Moral Compass</I>, both published by Simon and Schuster.
</UL>

<B>For Districts:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>Review current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence, and measurability. Get back to basics by writing new standards which eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. 
 
<LI>Re-examine collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions which may interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 
 
<LI>Require principals and curriculum planners to read the book, <I>World Class Schools: New Standards for Education</I>, by Donald M. Chalker and Richard M. Haynes, based on 10 international school systems.
 
<LI>Read and apply former Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch's book, <I>National Standards in American Education: A Citizen's Guide</I> (Brookings Institution, 1995). This is a good primer on the standards movement and the importance of skills.  The American Federation of Teachers recently published "Making Standards Matter: A 50 State Report on Efforts to Raise Academic Standards," which argues that high standards offer an opportunity for the public schools to turn themselves around and regain public confidence.  Also, see the recently released report, "What Secondary Students are Expected to Know: Gateway Exam Taken by Average-Achieving Students in France, Germany, and Scotland."  The U.S. Department of Education published in the 1980s an acclaimed series of pamphlets entitled <I>What Works</I>, focusing on all elements of curriculum and schooling. Though the series is long out of print, it may still be found through ERIC.
</UL>

<B>For California's State Government:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>A new statewide assessment model is a <I>fait accompli</I>. In the past, assessment drove curriculum and quality suffered. With that in mind, the Legislature should eliminate the current curriculum frameworks and mandate the development of a basic statewide model for standards prior to the development of the new assessment system, which will not be completed until at least 1998.
 
<LI>The Legislature should enact legislation adding 30 public members to the Governor's Standards Commission to ensure a cross section of community and parental participation in the development of standards.  Specified appointments from both houses should be required to guarantee extensive parental representation on the Commission.
 
<LI>The Governor and the Legislature should work to streamline the textbook adoption process and place greater authority with districts as much as is possible within the constitutional restrictions of the textbook adoption program.
 
<LI>The California State University should be supported in its attempt to eliminate remedial courses within its system.  The sending districts should be required to pay for remediation of its high school graduates.
 
<LI>The Legislature should pass legislation eliminating teacher tenure and revamping teacher education in the state's universities.  Prospective elementary school teachers need to be trained in intensive systematic phonics instruction.  Recent surveys indicate the general public supports these reforms, as well as merit pay.
</UL>

<B>For the Federal Government:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>The quality of American education is not dependent on the existence of a federal bureaucracy. Congress should pass H.R. 1883, which eliminates the Department of Education and returns authority for education to parents, teachers, communities, and states in the form of block grants. Programs are transferred to other departments under this proposal, called the "Back to Basics Education Reform Act."  
 
<LI>Congress should avoid the proposed combining of the departments of Education and Labor. Instead, we should consolidate job training programs into one or more block grants and place them under the jurisdiction of the Labor Department.
 
<LI>Congress should repeal provisions of the Improve America's Schools Act requiring states to send plans for state standards and curriculum to the federal government.  Furthermore, it should preserve local and state authority over expenditures by repealing the "opportunity to learn" standards in Goals 2000/IASA which potentially subject states to judicial rulings.
</UL>

The experience of California shows that only with these reforms can real education standards, higher expectations for students, and accountability for teachers be realized.  To go beyond the mantra of standards, it is vital to have parents, teachers, and, yes, politicians involved in this effort.  But educating students for the 21st century requires these measures sooner rather than later.<P>

<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
Few topics in recent years have inflamed parents and grassroots
education activists as the Clinton administration's Goals 2000:
Educate America Act, passed in 1994.  Although the law's supporters
contend that Goals 2000 is merely a helpful attempt to increase
academic standards in K-12 education, the authors of this study
find that in any common sensical reading of the law, power is
transferred from state and local education authorities to the
federal bureaucracy in Washington.
<P>
The law makes mandatory a wide variety of federal dictates, controls
education's purse strings, requires national standards, issues
federal &quot;skill certificates,&quot; imposes new regulations,
and manipulates state and local assessments.  In so doing, Goals
2000 radically alters the education decisionmaking landscape by
centralizing policymaking at the federal level, leaving the states
and localities to carry out Washington's dictates.
<P>
The major findings of this study include:
<UL>
<LI>Drafters of the Goals 2000 law use the command &quot;will&quot;
over forty times in describing what the federal government expects
states and local districts to do to accomplish the Act's eight
national goals.  The more permissive &quot;should&quot; is used
only three times.
</UL>


<P>
*This paper is co-published with The Pacific Research Institute
for Public Policy, San Francisco, California.
<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 creates a wide variety of bureaucracies (e.g.,
the National Goals Panel, regional education laboratories, federal
education research institutes, etc.) which are endowed with wide
&quot;advocacy&quot; powers in order to get states and localities
to implement the national goals and objectives contained in the
Act.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Once a state accepts federal Goals 2000 money, it must implement
the national goals and objectives of Goals 2000.  According to
the Act, any state that applies for Goals 2000 funding must devise
a state improvement plan that incorporates &quot;strategies for
meeting the National Education Goals.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Through its control of the purse, the federal government will
increase its influence over school curricula.  Washington explicitly
recommends that states include &quot;gender equitable and multicultural
materials&quot; in its improvement strategies.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 tells states how to cut their education pie and
in some cases even dictates the size of the pie (the level of
spending) and mandates what social services schools are to provide
on campus.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 creates a National Skills Standards Board that
will endorse a broad spectrum of skills standards to be considered
by business and employers when hiring.  The related School-to-Work
law strongly encourages states to issue &quot;skill certificates&quot;
to students who supposedly have met the skills standards promulgated
by the National Skills Standards Board.  Schools and students
who refuse to participate in the skill-certificate program will
be at a disadvantage in the job market.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Even though compliance with Goals 2000 is &quot;voluntary&quot;
for states, the law holds disadvantaged children hostage to its
dictates.  Goals 2000 requires states that receive federal money
under the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA) to align
state assessments, curriculum, and professional teacher development
programs with the standards contained in the Goals 2000 law. 
California is slated to receive more than $1 billion in IASA money
in 1995-96; two-thirds of this money goes to &quot;compensatory
education.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 may impose radical and untried ideas on most of
the nation, but its objectives are already mirrored in California's
subject frameworks and its statewide assessment (both the defunct
CLAS test and the proposed new assessment).  In other words, California
has &quot;been there, done that.&quot;  Since student performance
in California has continued to fall under these frameworks, we
can expect no improvement if California decides to participate
in Goals 2000.
</UL>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;We seek to support and encourage; we do not dictate or
determine local or </I>

<I>U.S. Secretary of Education</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;In the future, because of Goals 2000 and its tight linkage
to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. . . federal regulation
may extend much more directly into what is taught, how it is taught,
the conditions in which it is taught, and how </I>
<P>
<I>it is tested.&quot;</I>

<I>Diane Ravitch</I>
<P>
<I>former Assistant Secretary of Education</I>
<P>
In 1989, the nation's governors met with President Bush and issued
a list of six education goals that they wanted America to achieve
by the year 2000.  Then-governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton was
a big proponent of this goal-setting process, which combined national
leadership with state innovation and flexibility.  There were
no federal dollars involved, and no new federal bureaucracy was
created to administer it.  It was a state-centered program pledged
to broad national goals, with the key role of policy development
left to the governors of the fifty states.
<P>
But once Clinton moved from the statehouse to the White House,
he abandoned this state-centered program.  Instead of a <I>national
</I>program of statehouse leadership, it became a <I>federal government
</I>initiative-a distinction that has been lost or forgotten by
many of the governors who had joined the Bush initiative.  The
original six goals were expanded to eight by Clinton and his new
Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, and the eight goals were
tied to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, which channels billions of dollars to local school districts.
<P>
Why has Goals 2000 become controversial?  After all, what could
be wrong with wanting American students to be number one in the
world in math and science?  Or wanting every American adult to
be literate?  Or wanting to increase parental involvement?
<P>
The answer, of course, is that there is nothing wrong with desiring
these and some of the other laudable goals contained in the Goals
2000 law.  However, as with many worthwhile objectives, the means
to the ends are just as important as the ends themselves.  And
in the case of Goals 2000, the means contained in the law's more
than 150 pages of fine print should give great pause to anyone
who takes seriously the notion of state and local control of education.
<P>
This paper, a joint publication of the Pacific Research Institute
and the Claremont Institute, examines the fine print in Goals
2000 and focuses on how this law will affect California's public
education system-and by inference, the public school systems in
other states.  Although the law has been seen by many as helpful
at best and innocuous at worst, the authors of this study find
that Goals 2000 threatens to dominate and control its subject
area and concentrate decision-making power in a few unelected
officials in Washington.  For this reason, it is fair to call
it &quot;devolution in retreat,&quot; a step backward to greater
centralization of authority, not forward to more state and local
responsibility.  As such, it is a piece of warmed-over 1970s legislation,
not a progressive step into the 21st Century.
<P>
<B>MECHANISMS OF FEDERAL CONTROL</B>
<P>
Congress and the Clinton administration were well aware of the
suspicion that had grown in many quarters regarding Goals 2000's
potential for federal usurpation of educational decision-making
authority.  The Goals 2000 law, therefore, specifically cites
past laws enacted by Congress that reserves responsibility for
education to the states and local school systems.  Section 319
of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (hereafter &quot;the Act&quot;)
notes:
<P>
Public Law 96-88 specified that the establishment of the Department
of Education shall not increase the authority of the Federal Government
over education or diminish the responsibility for education which
is reserved to the States and local school systems and other instrumentalities
of the States<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
This statement is more than a little disingenuous, however, since
everyone knows that the vast array of federal programs that funnel
federal tax dollars to the states all come with strings and conditions
that increase Washington's control over what goes on at local
levels.  For example, many public schools in low-income areas
must ensure that their actions conform to Washington's requirements
if they are to receive the millions of federal dollars earmarked
for disadvantaged children.
<P>
Still, the Act maintains that:
<P>
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize an officer
or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control
a State, local educational agency, or school's curriculum, program
of instruction, or allocation of State or local resources or mandate
a State or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur
any costs not paid for under this Act.
<P>
Viewed in isolation, this provision seems to preclude the type
of federal intrusion that has become all too familiar over the
last thirty years.  Unfortunately, the Act is laden with terminology,
programs and incentives that clearly contradict this supposed
respect for the autonomy of states and local jurisdictions.
<P>
In Title I, which lays out the eight national education goals
and the thirty-five objectives listed under the goals, there is
a troubling pattern of word usage that indicates a greater willingness
by the federal government to impose its will than it would have
the public believe.<FONT SIZE=2>  Although the Clinton administration
emphasizes the voluntary nature of the goals, the Act uses the
command &quot;will&quot; at least forty-five times in describing
what the federal government expects states, localities, and individuals
to do to accomplish the various goals.</FONT>
<P>
Thus, one finds dictates such as:
<P>
All children <B>will have</B> access to high-quality and developmentally
appropriate preschool programs. . . .
<P>
Parents<B> will have</B> access to the training and support parents
need.
<P>
Children<B> will receive</B> the nutrition, physical activity,
experiences, and health care needed to arrive at school with healthy
minds and bodies. . . .
<P>
All students <B>will be</B> knowledgeable about the diverse cultural
heritage of this Nation. . . .
<P>
All teachers <B>will have</B> access to preservice teacher education
and continuing professional development activities. . . .
<P>
States and school districts <B>will create</B> integrated strategies
to attract, recruit, prepare, retrain, and support the continued
professional development of teachers, administrators, and other
educators. . . .
<P>
Schools, in implementing comprehensive parent involvement programs,
<B>will offer</B> more adult literacy, parent training and life-long
learning opportunities. . . .
<P>
Every local educational agency <B>will develop</B> a sequential,
comprehensive kindergarten through twelfth grade drug and alcohol
prevention education 
<P>
program. . .<FONT SIZE=2> .  (Emphases added.)</FONT>
<P>
What are the meanings of phrases such as &quot;will have access
to,&quot; &quot;will offer,&quot; &quot;will develop,&quot; and
&quot;will create&quot;?  Do they not mean that states and local
school districts have an obligation to create a plethora of new
programs to fulfill the imperatives of the Act?
<P>
It is obvious that the use of the command &quot;will&quot; was
deliberate.  In Title I, the permissive word &quot;should&quot;
is used as well, but only three times.  Thus, for example:
<P>
Community-based teams <B>should be</B> <B>organized</B> to provide
students and teachers with needed support.
<P>
Every school<B> should work</B> to eliminate sexual harassment.
 (Emphases added.)
<P>
Why the difference?  One expert on legal drafting observes that
the word &quot;will&quot; not only expresses a future contingency,
but also, &quot;when the relationship is a delicate one, expresses
both parties' obligations.&quot;.<FONT SIZE=2>  Under such a definition
of &quot;will,&quot; the states could find themselves forced to
implement the goals' many objectives (especially if, as will be
discussed later, the states decide to accept the federal funding
attached to the Act).</FONT>
<P>
A principal problem that arises from such usage is judicial interpretation
in future court cases.  Recent judicial history is replete with
examples of courts making critical changes in public policy through
loose interpretations of the words in laws.  The word &quot;will&quot;
is not permissive; it is a mandate to do a specific thing, and
federal courts will likely interpret it that way.
<P>
<B>New Bureaucracies</B>
<P>
Another concern is the various federal entities that are created
under the Act.  For instance, the National Education Goals Panel
is empowered to report progress that the states and the nation
are making toward achieving the goals of the Act.  Among the Goals
Panel's duties is to &quot;identify actions that should be taken
by Federal, State, and local governments to enhance progress toward
achieving the National Education Goals and to provide all students
with a fair opportunity to learn.&quot;  Although states and local
jurisdictions may decide to ignore the identified actions, as
we discuss in the following section on the federal &quot;purse,&quot;
resisting federal &quot;advice&quot; will not be as easy as it
may seem.
<P>
The Goals Panel is also charged with an advocacy mission:
<P>
The Goals panel shall help build a nationwide, bipartisan consensus
for the reforms necessary to achieve the National Education Goals<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Statements by Colorado Governor Roy Romer, an active supporter
of Goals 2000, demonstrate what type of advocacy one can expect
from the Goals Panel and its bureaucratic subgroups.  According
to Romer, Goals 2000 is in trouble because &quot;parents and voters
oppose the scheme.&quot;  In view of this skepticism on the part
of the public, Romer is encouraging the Goals Panel's subgroups
to work with business executives and state legislators who have
been resistant to Goals 2000.  In other words, if local leaders
aren't showing the proper enthusiasm, they must be educated and
propagandized until they come around.  The federal goals will
drive local reforms, not the other way around.
<P>
The Act also creates Resource and Technical Planning Groups on
School Readiness.  A primary duty of these Groups is to &quot;create
clear guidelines regarding the nature, functions, and uses of
early childhood assessments, including assessment formats that
are appropriate for use in culturally and linguistically diverse
communities, based on model elements of school readiness.&quot;<FONT SIZE=2>
 What is the force of these guidelines?  Will the federal government
determine the validity of assessments in areas such as bilingualism?
 Even though the Planning Groups are supposed to operate in an
advisory capacity, in California their guidelines could have a
disproportionate impact on the state's assessment programs.  The
assessment debate in California continues to rage after last year's
California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) debacle, leaving
an open field for federal influence. </FONT>
<P>
A major body created by the Act, the National Education Standards
and Improvement Council (NESIC), which is charged with overseeing
the creation of the voluntary national content and student performance
standards, is currently the target of defunding moves in Congress.
 Although still not officially dead, the NESIC will not be a factor
for some time, if at all (at present, no nominations have been
put forward for any Council member positions).  It should be remembered,
however, that the NESIC's possible demise does not eliminate the
national standards themselves, or the fact that states receiving
federal funds will have to meet those standards.
<P>
The Act also creates a number of federal research institutes.
 The problem with these institutes is that the mission outlined
for them in the Act contains provisions that would turn them into
advocacy organizations.  For example, the National Institute on
Student Achievement, Curriculum and Assessment (NISACA)<B> </B>is
charged with, among other things, identifying:
<P>
(viii) the impact and effectiveness of Federal, State, and local
efforts to provide gender-fair educational opportunities to elementary
and secondary students;
<P>
(ix) programs, policies, and approaches which promote gender equity
in elementary and secondary education.
<P>
Given this charter, what would the Institute have to say about
recent efforts by African-American parents to create single-sex
schools, which have been shown to improve the achievement and
discipline of children, especially male children, in that community?
 It is hard to imagine that such innovations would be able to
receive a fair hearing and analysis.
<P>
Another group of bureaucracies created by the Act, which have
so far received little attention, are the &quot;regional educational
laboratories.&quot;  Under Section 941(h) of the Act, the United
States would be divided up into regions each having a regional
educational laboratory.  States participating in Goals 2000 must
give their consent to the formation of these laboratories through
their chief state school officials and their state boards of education.
 The mission of the labs is to promote reform efforts.  The labs
are supposed to be, among other things, a resource for schools
within the region.
<P>
Although the regional labs may prove to be innocuous, they are
simply another layer of bureaucracy that have the potential to
impose their will on local schools.  The regional labs will be
governed by an unelected, appointed board made up of various state
officials and special interest representatives.  Among its main
duties, the board:
<P>
Directs the regional educational laboratory to carry out the laboratory's
duties in a manner as will make progress toward achieving the
National Education Goals and reforming schools and education systems.
<P>
Like the Goals Panel and the research institutes, the board and
the labs are given an advocacy mission.
<P>
Potentially more damaging to local control of schools is the labs'
stated duty to:
<P>
Facilitate school restructuring at the individual school level,
including technical assistance for adapting model demonstration
grant programs to each school<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
This duty is much more interventionist than simply supplying educational
research to state and local school agencies.  Furthermore, &quot;restructuring&quot;
has become a buzz word in many education circles for changing
school curricula and school governance and for promoting the controversial
principles of outcome-based education.  The fact that unelected
bureaucratic entities such as the regional educational labs have,
as a primary duty, the facilitation of this controversial concept
at the school site level is an open invitation to unwanted federally-sponsored
meddling into local decision-making. 
<P>
<B>Federal Requirements Come with the Money</B>
<P>
Perhaps the most pernicious instrument of federal control of state
and local education policy is the additional federal funding that
is made available by the Goals 2000 Act.  Under Title III of the
Act, $400 million was authorized for fiscal year 1994-95 for the
purpose of allowing the federal government to make allotments
to the states.  In order for states to receive this funding they
must, unsurprisingly, meet a number of requirements contained
in the Act.
<P>
What are those requirements?  According to Section 306 of the
Act, &quot;any State educational agency that wishes to receive
an allotment under [Title III] after its first year of participation
shall develop and implement a State improvement plan for the improvement
of elementary and secondary education in the State.<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;
 In turn, the required state improvement plan must itself meet
an important requirement:</FONT>
<P>
Each State educational agency, with broad-based classroom teacher
input, shall establish and include in its State improvement plan
strategies for meeting the National Education Goals by improving
teaching and learning and students' mastery of basic and advanced
skills. . <FONT SIZE=2>. .</FONT>
<P>
In order for the states to get the Goals 2000 money, they must
adhere to the goals, objectives and standards laid out by the
Act.  The minute any state decides to accept any part of the Goals
2000 largesse, the supposedly &quot;voluntary&quot; goals become
mandatory.
<P>
But this is not all.  The Act not only requires that states abide
by its goals, it also lists the strategies that they must follow
in order to meet the goals.  Alarmingly, these required strategies
open the door to radical policy-meddling by federal officials.
 For example, a state strategy must include:
<P>
A process for aligning State or local curricula, instructional
materials, and State assessments with the State content standards
and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
The trouble is that under Goals 2000, state content and student
performance standards are heavily influenced by the federal government.
 (This influence is explained in detail below.)  The federal government
will therefore have a heavy influence on the curricula, books
and tests of local schools.
<P>
What kinds of books and materials does the federal government
wish to promote?  Again, the Act explicitly recommends that state
strategies include:
<P>
A process for developing, selecting, or recommending instructional
materials, including gender equitable and multicultural materials,
and technology to support and assist local educational agencies
and schools to provide all students the opportunity to meet State
content standards and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Gender-equity and multiculturalist textbooks and materials have
caused extreme controversy and division among parents and state
and local school officials.  Many of these works are infused with
anti-male and anti-Western biases, and often rely more on polemics
than on objective scholarship.  Yet this is the type of instructional
material that Washington singles out for inclusion in state strategies.
<P>
Further, the Act seeks to affect the exact ways in which states
divide their education budget pie.  The Act recommends that strategies
include:
<P>
Assessing the effectiveness and equity of the school finance program
of the State to identify disparities in the resources available
to each local educational agency and school in such State and
how such disparities affect the ability of the State educational
agency and local educational agencies to develop and implement
plans under [Title III<FONT SIZE=2>].</FONT>
<P>
In view of provisions such as this, the Act's pretense of not
directing how a state or locality allocates its resources is no
more than empty rhetoric.
<P>
A good example of the gap between a good goal and bad means can
be found in the Act's standards regarding parental and community
involvement.  On the positive side, the Act requires that:
<P>
Each State improvement plan shall describe strategies for how
the State educational agency will involve parents and other community
representatives in planning, designing, and implementing the State
improvement plan. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
The strategy described by the Act as a way to achieve parental
and community involvement raises very serious questions.  The
Act envisions a strategy which will result in:
<P>
Increasing the access of all students to social services, health
care, nutrition, related services, and child care services, and
locating such services in schools, cooperating service agencies,
community-based centers, or other convenient sites designed to
provide &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for parents and students<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
To what social services must the state and local jurisdictions
provide &quot;access&quot; to?  What types of health care services?
 Perhaps those &quot;reproductive services&quot; advocated by
former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders?  And what types of child
care services?  And how appropriate is it to locate these services
on school campuses?  Is this not another example of schools taking
on new roles that divert it from its primary mission-to teach?
<P>
<B>Carrots and Sticks: Federal Approval of State Plans and Strategies</B>
<P>
Although Goals 2000 advocates in California downplay the mandatory
nature of the state improvement plans and the strategies required
to implement them, there is no getting around the fact that under
Section 307 of the Act, it is the federal Secretary of Education
who has approval power over a state's application for funding
under the Act.  More important, after the first year of funding,
the Secretary will approve further funding only if he has approved
the state improvement plan and has determined &quot;that the State
has made substantial progress in developing its State improvement
plan and will implement such plan not later than the end of the
second year of participation.&quot;
<P>
This process raises important questions, such as:
<UL>
<LI>Does the state's improvement plan and accompanying strategies
include gender equitable and multicultural textbooks?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Does it include an &quot;equitable&quot; distribution (at
least in Washington's eyes) of state education budget dollars?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Are large numbers of social services, including perhaps even
reproductive services, available to the state's children?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Has the state included in its plan and strategies ways to
implement the thirty-five objectives listed under the eight national
goals?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The answers to such questions could determine whether the federal
Secretary decides to bestow a Goals 2000 grant on a state.  In
other words, the federal Secretary has significant discretionary
power to accept or reject a state's application based on the state's
adherence to Washington's policies.  Given that states have historically
accepted federal dictates that translate to more dollars in their
budgets, there will be powerful and irresistible pressure on states
to conform to federal education policies.
<P>
It is not just the Secretary's power to approve a state's improvement
plan that gives his agency carrot-and-stick leverage.  According
to Section 317 of the Act, the Secretary of Education can award
technology grants to states that, as part of their state improvement
plans, include:
<P>
[A] systemic statewide plan to increase the use of state-of-the-art
technologies that enhance elementary and secondary student learning
and staff development in support of the National Education Goals
and State content standards and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Again, behind the promise of money is the requirement that the
federal goals be promoted.  It is also instructive to note that
the Act dictates how the states allocate the funds they receive
under its auspices.  After the first year of funding, at least
ninety percent of a state's allotment must be used either to fund
the state improvement plan at the local level or &quot;to improve
educator preservice programs and for professional development
activities that are consistent with the State improvement plan<FONT SIZE=2>.&quot;
 The remaining ten percent or less can be used for state activities
such as promoting public magnet and charter schools; supporting
contracting with private management organizations to reform schools;
and supporting violence-reduction programs in schools.  In essence,
teachers are given access to the vast majority of the Act's funds,
but supporters of cutting-edge reforms such as charter schools
and private contracting have access to only a tiny fraction of
these funds.</FONT>
<P>
Even supporters of Goals 2000 admit that there are potential control
problems if states decide to take the Act's funding.  California's
state Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), which supports California's
participation in the Act, nevertheless warns that &quot;Taking
advantage of the federal framework is not risk-free. . . .&quot;
 The LAO realizes that the voluntary nature of the Act is more
illusion than reality:
<P>
The state would always be able to opt out of Goals 2000 if it
appeared federal policy making was interfering with state or local
authority.  (Of course, California would also have to relinquish
the federal funds provided under Goals 2000, which would not be
easy.)
<P>
The amount of money California has received under the Act has
been modest thus far.  In 1994-1995, California was allocated
$10 million.  For 1995-1996, however, California is to receive
$42 million.  After that, the amount increases even more dramatically.
 How easy will it be for the state to withdraw after local districts
become dependent on this money?  And remember, only the state
has this option; California's 1,002 districts will have no such
option.
<P>
<B>GOALS 2000 AND THE FEDERAL SCHOOL-TO-WORK LAW</B>
<P>
Usurping local decision-making power is just one troubling aspect
of the Goals 2000 Act.  Equally disturbing is the Act's intrusion
into the private labor market.  Under the Act, a<B> </B>National
Skill Standards Board is established, the purpose of which is:
<P>
. . . to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development and
adoption of a voluntary national system of skill standards and
of assessment and certification of attainment of skill standards.
<P>
Why the need for &quot;skill standards&quot;?  According to the
Act, the standards, assessment, and certification are to be used:
<P>
(A) by the Nation, to ensure the development of a high skills,
high quality, high performance workforce, including the most skilled
front-line workforce in the world;
<P>
(B) by industries, as a vehicle for informing training providers
and prospective employees of skills necessary for employment;
<P>
(C) by employers, to assist in evaluating the skill levels of
prospective employees and to assist in the training of current
employees;
<P>
(D) by labor organizations, to enhance the employment security
of workers by providing portable credentials and skills;
<P>
(E) by workers, to
<P>
(i) obtain certifications of their skills to protect against dislocation;
<P>
(ii) pursue career advancement; and
<P>
(iii) enhance their ability to reenter the workforce;
<P>
(F) by students and entry level workers, to determine the skill
levels and competencies needed to be obtained in order to compete
effectively for high wage jobs;
<P>
(G) by training providers and educators, to determine appropriate
training services to offer<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
In other words, <I>everybody </I>should be using these skill standards.
<P>
As with the Act's national goals, skill standards may, at first,
seem like a good idea, especially in view of employer complaints
about the quality of new workers coming out of the public schools.
 Unfortunately, the envisioned skill standards, like the national
goals, are a Pandora's box of federal entanglement in local education
and the private sector job market.
<P>
The National Skills Standards Board will, after conferring with
representatives of business, labor, education, and various other
organizations, adopt skill standards for a broad spectrum of private
industries (the Act refers to &quot;broad clusters of major occupations&quot;).
 These standards must take into account, among other things, standards
used in other countries, requirements of work organizations, and,
perhaps most importantly, &quot;content and performance standards&quot;
certified by the National Education Goals Panel.  Thus, the education
standards created by the National Education Goals Panel will be
incorporated into the national skills standards that Washington
wants employers to use.  It is apparent that the Clinton administration
wants the business community to pressure local schools to use
the education standards contained in the Act so that students
will be able (supposedly) to meet the new skill standards.
<P>
Goals 2000 supporters will undoubtedly point out that, like other
provisions in the Act, the skills standards will be voluntary.
 However, like these other &quot;voluntary&quot; provisions, closer
scrutiny shows that there is less &quot;voluntaryness&quot; here
than meets the eye.
<P>
To judge fully just how &quot;voluntary&quot; the skills standards
are, it is necessary to look at the federal School-To-Work Opportunities
Act of 1994 (referred to below as STW), which is a companion law
to the Goals 2000 Act.  According to its stated purpose, STW establishes:
<P>
. . . a national framework within which all States can create
statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems that-
<P>
(A) are part of comprehensive education reform;
<P>
(B) are integrated with the systems developed under Goals 2000:
Educate America Act and the National Skill Standards Act of 1994;
and
<P>
(C) offer opportunities for all students to participate in a performance-based
education training program. . .<FONT SIZE=2> .</FONT>
<P>
In addition, STW explicitly states that another of its purposes
is:
<P>
. . . to further the National Education Goals set forth in Title
I of the Goals 2000:
<P>
 Educate America Act.
<P>
STW, therefore, exists in large part simply to further the reach
of Goals 2000.
<P>
One of the principal tools used by STW to ensure that the ideology
of Goals 2000 becomes part of both school and workplace is the
creation of a &quot;skill certificate.&quot;  According to STW,
a skills certificate is:
<P>
. . . a portable, industry-recognized credential issued by a School-to-Work
Opportunities program under an approved State plan, that certifies
that a student has mastered skills at levels that are at least
as challenging as skill standards endorsed by the National Skill
Standards Board established under the National Skill Standards
Act of 1994, except that until such skill standards are developed,
the term &quot;skill certificate&quot; means a credential issued
under a process described in the approved State plan.
<P>
Why is this skill certificate so critical?  If the government
is handing out skill certificates to select students, then these
students will, at least initially, have an advantage 
<P>
over those students who do not have a certificate when it comes
to getting a job or perhaps getting into college.  The problem
then becomes two-fold.  First, those states and local jurisdictions
that want to resist participation in Goals 2000 will feel pressure
to reverse their position because students from states and localities
participating in Goals 2000/ STW will be receiving skill certificates
which will, as a consequence, place the students from non-participating
jurisdictions at an initial competitive disadvantage.  Second,
those students without a certificate will not just be those youngsters
who have failed to study hard and perform, but will also include
many students who attend private schools and home schools that
oppose participation in Goals 2000/STW because of fear of government
control.
<P>
If states, localities and private schools decide to participate
in the offering of skill certificates, the inevitable result will
be teaching to the certificate:  curricula will be shaped to improve
the chances of students to obtain these certificates.  This is
important since, as has been noted, the skills certificates issued
under any state plan must meet the skill levels and standards
endorsed by the National Skills Standards Board.  It will be this
federal Board, therefore, that will set the broad criteria for
getting a skill certificate, not the states or localities.  This
power will give the federal government strong influence over what
is being taught in the classroom. 
<P>
Further, STW also increases federal power by requiring that a
state or local School-to-Work Opportunities program that awards
skill certificates include:
<P>
. . . a program of study designed to meet the same academic content
standards the State has established for all students, including,
where applicable, standards established under the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Thus, all those supposedly voluntary standards contained in the
Goals 2000 Act suddenly become mandatory if a state or local jurisdiction
wants to award skill certificates under STW.  Federal education
priorities, not local ones, will, therefore, become dominant.
<P>
As with the Goals 2000 Act, the federal government also increases
its education policy-making power through the disbursement of
federal dollars.  Under STW, states can apply for grants to develop
a School-to-Work Opportunities system.  Not surprisingly, there
is a big condition that must be met if states are to get their
federal money:
<P>
The Secretaries [of Education and Labor] may approve an application
submitted by a State under section 203 only if the State demonstrates
in such application that the activities proposed to be undertaken
by the State to develop a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities
system are consistent with the State improvement plan for the
State, if any, under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Furthermore, in the grant application the state's School-to-Work
Opportunities plan must:
<P>
. . . describe how the State will adopt, develop, or assist local
partnerships to adopt or develop model curricula and innovative
instructional methodologies, to be used in the secondary, and
where possible, the elementary grades, that integrate academic
and vocational learning and promote career awareness, and that
are consistent with academic and skill standards established pursuant
to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the National Skill
Standards Act of 1994.
<P>
Also, a state's grant application must:
<P>
. . . describe the process of the State for assessing the skills
and knowledge required in career majors, and the process for awarding
skill certificates that is, to the extent feasible, consistent
with the skills standards certification system endorsed under
the National Skill Standards Act of 1994<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
In other words, unless a state can demonstrate that its School-to-Work
Opportunities plan is following the national goals and standards
contained in the Goals 2000 Act, and that its skills certification
system is following the skills standards laid down by the Goals
2000 Act's National Skill Standards Board, a state will not be
able to receive its grant.  In view of these requirements, STW's
Section 604, which purports to prohibit STW from imposing federal
mandates, direction, and control, becomes just so much ineffectual
boilerplate.  The reality is that states will be forced to bend
to the federal will because that is what the federal funding strings
require.
<P>
Is this too harsh an assessment of what faces California and other
states?  The evidence to date, unfortunately, indicates that this
assessment is all too accurate.  In June 1994, Governor Wilson
created a School-to-Career Task Force.  A preliminary report of
that task force endorsed the skill certificate concept (the task
force proposed &quot;certificates of mastery&quot;).
<P>
In addition, this year several school-to-work bills were introduced
in the State Legislature.  One bill, AB 1835 by Assemblywoman
Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), would have created &quot;certificates
of mastery&quot; that would have been coordinated and integrated
with the Goals 2000 Act and STW.  These certificates would be
awarded based on &quot;performance-based&quot; assessments of
pupils.  It should be pointed out that performance-based assessments
are not synonymous with <I>skill-based</I> assessments.  In today's
testing and assessment environment, they often involve putting
emphasis on what a child feels rather than what the child knows
about the subject.  It was this deficiency that led to the cancellation
of the CLAS test last year.
<P>
Although none of the school-to-work legislation passed, bills
such as AB 1835 give Californians an insight into what could lie
ahead in their education future under STW.  It seems odd that
California, which is one of the leaders in the charter school
movementa movement based on empowering parents, teachers, and
principals at the school sitecould also be on the verge of taking
a bite out of the STW apple and transferring key powers to federal
bureaucrats in Washington.  Indeed, it is chilling to read that
under STW:
<P>
. . . the Secretaries [of Education and Labor] shall jointly provide
for, and shall exercise final authority over, the administration
of this Act, and shall have final authority to jointly issue whatever
procedures, guidelines, and regulations, in accordance with section
553 of Title V, United States Code, the Secretaries consider necessary
and appropriate to administer and enforce the provisions of this
Act<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Is this not an opening for greatly expanded federal regulation
of education?  A common sensical reading of Goals 2000 and STW
would make it hard not to feel uncomfortable when answering this
question. 
<P>
<B>HOLDING CHILDREN HOSTAGE:</B>
<P>
<B>THE IMPROVING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ACT (IASA)</B>
<P>
In addition to School-to-Work schemes, another federal program
is guided by Goals 2000 and involves vastly greater sums of federal
dollars-the<B> </B>Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA).
 The IASA reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act (ESEA), and allocated approximately $12 billion to thirty-two
separate federal funding programs.  In 1994-1995, California received
$900 million in ESEA money, and will receive more than $1 billion
in 1995-1996.  More than two-thirds of this money goes to &quot;compensatory
education,&quot; i.e., money for services to disadvantaged children.
 
<P>
In a critical analysis titled, &quot;Goals 2000 and a Reauthorized
ESEA: National Standards and Accompanying Controversies,&quot;
authors Michael W. Kirst and James W. Guthrie note that Goals
2000 will alter the Chapter One element from its long-standing
regulatory and fiscal role to a &quot;powerfully administrative
instrument for fundamentally changing America's public schools.&quot;
  Goals 2000 in effect achieves a marriage between the financial
clout of the reauthorized ESEA/IASA-nearly $1 billion in California-and
the administrative authority of a planning process aimed at comprehensive
goals for all schools.
<P>
It should come as no surprise that in order to receive its ESEA/IASA
money, California must use the Goals 2000 standards.  In summarizing
the state responsibilities under ESEA/IASA, the LAO notes:
<P>
Title 1Compensatory Education
<P>
*  Develop content and performance standards and assessments to
evaluate school performance in mathematics and reading.  States
are required to use the standards and assessments developed under
Goals 2000 if they are participating in that act.
<P>
Title 2Professional Development
<P>
*  Develop a plan to provide teachers and administrators the skills
to help students meet Goals 2000 performance standards. . . .
<P>
* Align teacher training and licensing with Goals 2000 curriculum
and performance standards.
<P>
Local education agencies, according to the LAO, must also adhere
to the Goals 2000 agenda:
<P>
Title 2Professional Development
<P>
* Apply to the state for Title 2 grants.  Local applications must
be focused on the training needed to meet Goals 2000 standards.
. . .
<P>
Title 6Innovative Education Strategies
<P>
* Develop a plan for the use of funds that helps the district
meet the Goals 2000 standards. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Further, under ESEA/ IASA Title V, which is designed to promote
equity of magnet school assistance, priority funding is given
to magnet schools that propose to implement approaches that are
consistent with Title III of the Goals 2000 Act (recall that this
was the part of the Act dealing with state and local improvement
plans).
<P>
In testimony before Congress, former Secretaries of Education
William Bennett and Lamar Alexander observed that the legislation
reauthorizing ESEA &quot;mandates the kinds of federally-approved
'standards' that Goals 2000 said would be voluntary.&quot;  However,
said the two former Secretaries, &quot;Only with those approved
'content' and 'student performance' standards in place can a state
or community get its federal aid.&quot;  Finally, Bennett and
Alexander warn:
<P>
[The IASA/ESEA] bill takes a giant step toward reviving the legitimacy-and
federal supervision-of criteria that judge schools by their spending
levels, pupil-teacher ratios, and suchlike, instead of their effectiveness.
 And since Goals 2000 authorized the Education Department to develop
national &quot;opportunity to learn&quot; standards, we can expect
that these will soon exist-and be used.
<P>
Bennett's and Alexander's fears are more than justified.  The
Legislative Analyst Office, for example, recommends that:
<P>
Local ESEA plans should be required to address the standards set
out in the state's Goals 2000 plan<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
If the state follows such recommendations, federal control of
state and local education will have been accomplished by the states
and localities themselves.  As Diane Ravitch, former Assistant
Secretary of Education in the Bush administration and a highly
respected education writer, observed:
<P>
What bears watching in Goals 2000 is the precedent it establishes
for federal legislation that influences the kinds of textbooks,
teaching materials, teacher training methods, and research findings
that must be used in every school to receive federal funds.  For
many years, the federal government exercised great restraint by
respecting state and local control of education.  In the future,
because of Goals 2000 and its tight linkage to the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act . . . federal regulation may extend
much more directly into what is taught, how it is taught, the
conditions in which it is taught, and how it is tested.
<P>
<B>GOALS 2000 AND CALIFORNIA'S DECLINING STANDARDS</B>
<P>
Given that Goals 2000 and its related laws will increase federal
control over education decision-making, it is fair to ask what
effect the Act will have on education standards in California.
 Most Americans would agree that any standard adopted by policymakers
should 
<P>
be clearly measurable and based on academics.  Ravitch says that
&quot;A standard is both a goal (what should be done) and a measure
of progress toward that goal (how well it was done).&quot;
<P>
The Act gives us a clue to the type of standards it will endorse
when it says that one of its purposes is &quot;to improve learning
and teaching by providing a national framework for education reform.&quot;
 Those involved in recent debates on tests and standards will
recognize the term &quot;frameworks.&quot;  It is the buzz word
for California's troubled experiment with outcome-based education.
 As one California report noted:
<P>
Outcome-based education, or whatever it is called by the various
school districts, is not yet specifically defined at the state
level, though the frameworks suggest learning outcomes.  Each
district will be required to conform to standards of achievement
based on an implied understanding of what reform documents actually
mean.
<P>
Goals 2000, therefore, will have a great impact on how the state
and local districts understand what standards they should adhere
to.
<P>
The existing California Subject Matter Frameworks are designed
to be a guide for what is taught in California schools.  However,
methods promoted in the Mathematics and English/Language Arts
Frameworks have resulted in the de-emphasis of basic math skills
and phonics.  As a result of growing pressure from the public,
valid criticisms are surfacing. The following is a brief discussion
of the current state of &quot;frameworks,&quot; standards, and
basic skills in California.
<P>
<B>California Math Standards</B>
<P>
Under California's current &quot;Math Frameworks,&quot; the emphasis
is on problem solving rather than on basic skills or rote memorization
(e.g., multiplication tables).  Critics charge, however, that
without a good working knowledge of basic skills, it is hard to
expect students to come up with academically rigorous responses
to word problems.  In a recent critique of the California Math
Framework, Dr. Wayne Bishop, who teaches mathematics at California
State University at Los Angeles, finds that there is little commitment
to teaching deepening levels of mathematical competence and sophistication
as students progress through the curriculum:
<P>
There are to be no assumptions of, let alone mandates of, minimal
computational 
<P>
and conceptual competence at progressively higher grade levels.
 Since there is no 
<P>
data to support the contention that this current practice is aiding
students at either end of the performance spectrum, and massive
evidence is that it is hindering progress of students overall,
this philosophy must be critically challenged instead of embraced.
<P>
Indeed, with the development of the California Learning Assessment
System assessment test (which downplays the importance of correct
computational answers in favor of answers based on feelings and
sincerity), the state, according to Dr. Bishop, has taken steps
to eliminate heretofore well-understood statewide assessment.
<P>
<B>Reading Skills in California</B>
<P>
At a time when even teachers union publications are admitting
that phonics is the superior English reading instructional technique,
many schools in California are still de-emphasizing phonics. 
 Through its English/Language Arts Frameworks, California has
been a leader in adopting the &quot;whole language&quot; approach
to reading which calls for teachers to spend more time reading
stories to children than on specific skills such as spelling,
the sounds of letters or syllables.
<P>
Other states have caught on where California has not.  In Ohio,
a law was passed which requires the teaching of systematic, intensive
phonics in the primary grades.  Teachers are now receiving phonics
in-service programs.  The National Right To Read Foundation indicates
that there are currently nine states working on phonics legislation:
Texas, Michigan, Ohio, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Missouri,
New York, and Illinois.
<P>
<B>Goals 2000 and the CLAS Fiasco: The Untold Story</B>
<P>
What is the connection between these state Math and English frameworks
and the Goals 2000 debate over measuring standards?  The answer
to that question lies with the California Learning Assessment
System (CLAS), the assessment test that was developed by the State
Department of Education.  The link is that the CLAS test was designed
to measure the effectiveness of education reforms envisioned under
Goals 2000 programs.  Indeed, since CLAS is &quot;performance-based&quot;
(i.e., it attempts to measure a child's thought processes rather
than simply totaling up right and wrong answers), <I>it is exactly
the type of test envisioned and preferred by Goals 2000 and its
supporters.  </I>
<P>
News media reports on the 1994 CLAS scores showed students unable
to read critically or apply math to real-world problems, but virtually
no mention was given to the fact that the English portion of the
CLAS exam did not test for incorrect spelling or incorrect grammar,
or that the Math portion did not emphasize basic skills.  The
unwritten story, therefore, is that even the low scores reported
on the CLAS exam were still artificially high.
<P>
How can California's parents and policymakers judge the effectiveness
of the new state frameworks if the state's measuring tool bases
its scoring on <I>non-academic</I> benchmarks?  Thus, although
Superintendent Eastin has assigned task forces to examine the
state Frameworks, it is disturbing to note the all-out support
Ms. Eastin has given for a performance-based successor to the
now defunct CLAS test.  The ultimate problem of testing based
on non-academic benchmarks is that even if scores rise, the public
has no assurance that this is the result of improved student learning
of academic subject matter.
<P>
<B>A Case Study: How One California School District Uses Goals
2000 Funding</B>
<P>
How will districts use Goals 2000 money?  The linkage between
Goals 2000 and the IASA permits the philosophy behind Goals 2000
to permeate the more than thirty programs authorized under IASA.
 Poway Unified School District in San Diego County provides a
revealing example.  The district plans to use Goals 2000 money
for elementary school counselors to assist in meeting the supposed
emotional and social needs of district children.
<P>
As part of these counseling services, Poway has issued so-called
&quot;wellness&quot; manuals.  These manuals, used without parents'
knowledge or permission, contain questions and techniques to get
children to reveal private feelings about their family.  Questions
and techniques include &quot;Do you feel that no one at home loves
you and cares about you?  Yes or No?&quot; and &quot;As bonding
and trust evolve, the [counseling] group becomes a safe place
where youngsters talk openly about their lives, sometimes sharing
secrets they've never talked about before.&quot;
<P>
Poway will also use Goals 2000 money to promote an array of &quot;core
values&quot;: all students learning; parents as partners; competent
and caring staff; staff participation in decision-making; safe,
orderly, and attractive environment; and effective management
of resources.  All these goals may sound worthwhile, but notice
that the focus is not on academics.  The interaction of the Goals
2000 triad (Goals 2000, IASA, and STW) will mean a significant
expansion in these &quot;soft&quot; areas of school management
and school environment, with no assurance as to improved student
performance or a higher quality of classroom instruction.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</B>
<P>
California should just say &quot;no&quot; to Goals 2000 and School-to-Work
dollars. 
<UL>
<LI>Although the funding amounts are not huge at present, there
is a clear expansion of federal control underway.  At a time when
there is a national consensus that decisionmaking power should
be returned to the state and local level, Goals 2000 is a throwback
to the discredited &quot;Washington-knows-best&quot; solutions
of the Great Society. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>California does not need to look to Washington for ways to
improve education.  Charter schools, privatization, radical decentralization
of school finance, streamlining of categorical programs, alternative
teacher certification, tenure reform, and other innovations can
radically turn around education in our state without any need
for approval from a federal bureaucrat.  Goals 2000 is a muddy
detour on the road to reform, a detour California can't afford
to take.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 will discourage and hinder the development of rigorous
standards for California's public schools.  At a time when parents
and others at the grassroots are demanding that students be made
to demonstrate what objective knowledge they possess, Goals 2000
will do nothing to satisfy these demands-and in fact, will impede
real reform.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Rigorous academic standards will only be established  by involving
the public in a broad-based deliberation on the subject, thereby
building a genuine and informed consensus.  Goals 2000 obfuscates
and delays that public debate by purveying the myth that new federal
goals, standards, and strategies are meeting these needs.  That
is demonstrably not the case.  Goals 2000 is, in reality, a gigantic
hoax played on the public by the education bureaucrats and the
teachers unions, both in Washington and Sacramento.  Given what
is at stake, the rescue of our failing schools, politicians who
contribute to this hoax should face ridicule for the misuse of
taxpayers funds.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Rejecting Goals 2000 funding is only a starting point.  Local
control must be given more than lip service, and education standards
must mean more than testing for &quot;self-esteem.&quot;  Financial
incentives and disguised mandates from the federal level to use
any particular type of learning strategy or curriculum program
should be rejected.
</UL>

<P>
For too long local schools have opted to rely on supposed &quot;experts&quot;
in state and federal bureaucracies to dictate standards and curricula.
 Goals 2000 merely encourages this dependency, which carries over
to other areas, such as textbook adoptions.  This process relies
heavily on State Department of Education staff, who are generally
more committed to the latest curriculum fads than to rigorous
academic standards. 
<P>
What is lost in this fevered quest for federal dollars is local
control in any meaningful sense.  Local school boards do not understand
and therefore cannot influence this process; they become mere
observers and cheerleaders for the local superintendent and his
team.  Federal dollars and state bureaucrats drive both curriculum
choices and budget decisions in this system.  The current system
is bad enough without adding another federally approved state
plan to the mix.

2000</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
It is widely recognized that California's academic standards are
deficient and that the basic skills of the state's students are
at a woeful level.  The paramount question for Goals 2000 is,
therefore, will Goals 2000 improve learning or will the attempt
to achieve the national goals, not all of which are academic,
further dilute academics in the average school day?  An examination
of the National Educational Goals gives thoughtful citizens cause
for concern.  Presented below are the eight goals and a brief
commentary on each.
<P>
<B>1. SCHOOL READINESS</B>
<P>
&quot;<I>By the year 2000, all children in America will start
school ready to learn.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> This goal opens the door for government intrusion
into family life under the guise of assuring that all children
are ready to learn.  In an attempt to cure the ills of a few children
who may not be well cared for, all families, good and bad, are
subject to the government playing nanny.  The entire social service
agenda of the Clinton administration can be imposed on schools
through this goal.  A National Education Goals Panel Report states:
&quot;Readiness to learn necessarily begins long before school,
even before birth itself, and we conclude that 'school readiness'
relates to the child's health, to the home environment, and to
preschool education.&quot;  The federal government will be in
a position to determine what is and what is not an appropriate
home environment through the implementation of Goal #1.
<P>
<B>2. SCHOOL COMPLETION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, the high school graduation rate will
increase to at least ninety percent.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B>  Creates an incentive for schools to lower the
requirements for graduation in order to boost the percentage rates
of students who are graduating.  Does not contain an incentive
to hold students to rigorous academic standards, but rather gives
incentive to teach down to the lowest common denominator.  Students
are not allowed to choose from a wide array of curriculum and
program options;  therefore, this goal could homogenize all students
and discourage healthy diversity.
<P>
<B>3. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND CITIZENSHIP</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, all students will leave grades 4, 8,
and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging subject
matter including English, mathematics, science, foreign languages,
civics and government, economics, arts, history and geography,
and every school in America will ensure that all students learn
to use their minds well so they may be prepared for responsible
citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our
nation's modern economy.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B>  In response to this goal of &quot;responsible
citizenship,&quot; many schools are beginning to mandate community
service as a graduation requirement.  This is problematic because
of the vagueness of what qualifies as community service.  Is it
really a good use of students' valuable school time to coerce
them into community service programs when many are graduating
from high schools without basic reading, writing, and computational
skills?  Is it hypocritical to teach volunteerism by mandating
it?
<P>
<B>4.  TEACHER EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, the nation's teaching force will have
access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional
skills and the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills
needed to instruct and prepare all American students for the next
century.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> This is one of the goals added to the original
six by the Clinton administration.  Throughout the Goals 2000
Act, teacher education and training is a recurrent theme.  This
is not surprising since the National Education Association and
other teacher unions view increased funding for teacher training
as one of their top objectives and President Clinton has received
key support from the teachers unions.  Unfortunately, the underlying
premise of this goal is wrong.  The unions feel that the only
thing that is needed to turn bad teachers into good ones is a
little more training.  Yet the real reason for poor teacher performance
is union-imposed collective bargaining agreements that protect
incompetent teachers.  Teacher advancement and pay scales are
based on seniority rather than merit. 
<P>
This goal does not address the serious problem of barriers to
non-traditional teachers, whereby many highly skilled individuals
such as engineers, chemists and others with professional degrees
are not allowed to teach in a public school classroom simply because
they lack an irrelevant teaching certificate.  As written, this
goal serves only the interests of the teacher unions, and it obstructs
efforts to open the teaching profession to retirees and others
who have much to offer our children.
<P>
<B>5.  MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, United States students will be first
in the world in mathematics and science achievement.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> In view of the current Mathematics Framework
and the increasing numbers of students enrolled in remedial math
at the university level, it is difficult to see how this goal
will be reached without an increased focus on academics in California.
 Further, Californians should take little comfort in this year's
publicized bump upward in SAT scores.  A key reason why SAT math
scores rose is because students were allowed, for the first time,
to take calculators into the exam.
<P>
<B>6.  ADULT LITERACY AND LIFELONG LEARNING</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete
in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> Given that an estimated twenty-seven million
adults are &quot;functionally illiterate,&quot; is the Clinton
administration advocating an entirely new public schooling system
for those adults who did not learn to read in 12 years of public
education?  If so, how much would this cost?  Is it logical to
entrust this task to the public school system, which often graduates
eighteen year-olds without even eighth-grade reading skills? 

<P>
<B>7.  SAFE, DISCIPLINED, AND ALCOHOL AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every school in the United States will
be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of firearms
and alcohol and will offer a disciplined environment conducive
to learning.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> It is difficult to see the Clinton administration
making much headway on this goal.  Lackadaisical enforcement efforts,
poor leadership, and outright endorsement of drug use (e.g., the
pronouncements of former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders) have
characterized the Clinton administration's poor record on curbing
illegal drug use.  It is no wonder that drug use in California
(as in many other states) has risen in the years following the
Reagan administration's concerted anti-drug campaigns.  According
to one recent report, &quot;Since 1989, drug use among seventh,
ninth, and eleventh graders in California has revealed a disturbing
trend of increased use.&quot; 
<P>
Controlling juvenile violence will be just as difficult.  Although
a recent study showed that juvenile crime rises by seventeen percent
for every ten percent increase in the number of children living
in single-parent homes, the Clinton administration has done little
to address the problem of rising illegitimate births or to break
the connection between illegitimacy and high welfare payments
(both of which contribute to juvenile crime).  The reality is
that violent juvenile crime will increase dramatically because
of demographic trends.  From 1983 to 1992, juvenile arrests for
violent crime (homicide, forcible rape, robbery, assault and kidnapping)
increased from 12,321 to 21,549, a 74.8 percent increase.  Between
1995 and the year 2004, California's 11 to 17-year-old population
will increase thirty-three percent, growing from approximately
three million to nearly four million.  Even if the arrest rate
stays the same, the state Legislative Analyst's Office says that
the number of juvenile arrests for violent crimes will rise by
62 percent over 1993's total.
<P>
<B>8.  PARENTAL PARTICIPATION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every school will promote partnerships
that will increase parental involvement and participation in promoting
the social, emotional and academic growth of children.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> Parent participation often translates into parenting
skills classes and mandatory compliance with government programs.
 All schools that receive funds under this Act are required to
have a plan to achieve Goal #8:
<P>
Section 2 (8).  The purpose of this Act is to provide a framework
for meeting the National Education Goals established by Title
I of this Act by . . . assisting every elementary and secondary
school that receives funds under this Act to actively involve
parents and families in supporting the academic work of their
children at home and in providing parents with skills to advocate
for their children at school.
<P>
Under Title IV of the Act, states and non-profit agencies can
apply for federal grants to fund parent information centers. 
Groups applying for grants must include as part of their grant
application an assurance that part of the funds they receive will
be directed to &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; (PAT) programs
and are required to use the Missouri program as a model.
<P>
The &quot;certified parent educators&quot; are trained to identify
certain &quot;risk factors&quot; that exist in the child's home.
 Risk factors documented under PAT programs include &quot;inability
of parent to relate to or connect with child, overindulgence,
undue spoiling on part of parent, low functioning parent (due
to limited ability or illness), low weight gain, poor appetite,
frequent illness, other.&quot; (Missouri Department of Elementary
and Secondary Education, PAT National Center)  Thus, the laudable
goal of involving parents becomes in practice a device for government
agencies to intrude into the personal lives of individuals.  Parents
have the greatest interest in the quality of education that their
children receive.
<P>
The practical effect of Goals 2000 will be to undercut parental
rights and derail parental empowerment.  When  schools become
counseling centers for parents, parents become just one more client
group of an expanding social service bureaucracy.

<h1>The Endangered Species Act Reconsidered</h1>

<h3>How Congress Can Restore Balance and Common Sense 
    to the Protection of Endangered Species</h3>

</CENTER>

<hr>

<h4>Introduction</h4>


Republicans in the new Congress have assumed responsibility for
directing the nation's legislative agenda for the first time in
nearly half a century.  Among the most important issues they must
consider in 1995 is the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due for
reauthorization this year.
<P>
Reauthorization of the ESA is certain to engender fierce debate
in Congress.  The ESA needs to be changed in fundamental ways,
not only in its actual workings and administration by a zealous
bureaucracy, but also in its design and purpose.  The public needs
to understand what is at stake in this debate, and both Congress
and state lawmakers need to be alert to the land mines awaiting
the implementation of attempted reforms.
<P>
The emerging debate on the ESA may well be more intense than those
over the Balanced Budget Amendment or welfare reform.  This is
because it will force Congress and the nation to choose between
individual liberty and big government.  For the first time since
the beginnings of the environmental movement in the 1970s, a major
environmental policy will be evaluated on the basis of the actual
results of its enforcement, and not the self-congratulatory rhetoric
of the bureaucrats who administer it.  For the first time since
its passage in 1973, the ESA will be debated as a matter of <I>public
policy</I>, not a matter of state religion.  In their deliberations,
the people's representatives will have to weigh the possibility-indeed,
the considerable evidence-that the ESA has done more harm than
good to the environment.  For all these reasons, the ESA debate
will stand as a watershed event in the history of environmental
legislation.
<P>
<B>The Political Species Act</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act has been described as one of the most
far-reaching laws ever passed, yet most Americans are only vaguely
aware of its profoundly radical character.  Unlike most laws,
which attempt to balance competing interests in an effort to achieve
equitable results, the ESA is virtually absolute in its favoritism
toward what its authors perceived to be &quot;environmental&quot;
interests.  Under the ESA, an &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;threatened&quot;
species is <I>always </I>favored over the competing interests
of men.
<P>
Like all special interest legislation, the ESA is unevenly applied.
 Few exceptions to the ESA are allowed, but with enough political
clout the law can be circumvented.  For example, when a little
fish called the snail darter held up the Tennessee Valley Authority's
giant Tellico dam project in Tennessee, Senator Howard Baker led
the charge in Congress to create special legislation to exempt
the project from the Act.  Other <I>ad hoc</I> exemptions followed,
including limited exceptions for agricultural pests and the so-called
&quot;God Squad&quot; cabinet level exemption, whereby a committee
of cabinet heads may override the law and thereby pass judgment
on the fate of a threatened or endangered species.
<P>
Sometimes this special interest favoritism goes too far and the
courts intervene.  In the case of the controversy of the Northern
Spotted Owl, for example, a federal court ruled that Congressional
antics to overrule a lower court's findings were unconstitutional.
 But in general, political exceptions to the ESA have little or
no relevance to ecology, and frequently go unchallenged.  This
arbitrariness is but one reason that the ESA is inimical to the
principle of the rule of law.  To be fair and just, a law must
be certain, and the ESA's application in particular cases is as
far from certain as the bald eagle is from extinction.
<P>
<B>&quot;Shoot, Shovel, and Shut Up&quot;:  Advanced Weed Abatement
and Other Perverse Incentives Of The Endangered Species Act</B>
<P>
That the ESA contains perverse incentives toward the destruction
of species is a fact that even environmental groups cannot deny.
 Because the ESA imposes the full burden of its costs on property
owners, property owners have a strong incentive to ensure that
there are no endangered species or habitat on their land.  Ever
since Richard P. Christy shot and killed a protected grizzly bear
that was marauding his livestock, landowners have sought to minimize
or eliminate any endangered species or endangered species habitat
from their property.  Examples are legion, from destruction of
habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker in the South to the careful
weed abatement practiced nearly everywhere else.  Such measures
are known in the West, and increasingly across the country, as
the code of &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up.&quot;  The court
that heard Christy's case ruled that under the ESA, he had no
right to protect his property from destruction by the bear.  But
most Americans, despite their sentimentality and charity toward
wildlife, put themselves ahead of all other species, endangered
or otherwise.
<P>
The law is equally unkind to those who might extend their charity
to help endangered species.  The United States Fish and Wildlife
Service is empowered to determine what constitutes &quot;harassment&quot;
of an endangered or threatened species.  All too often, productive
use of a private conservator's land is deemed &quot;harassment&quot;
and thus is prohibited.  It is therefore not surprising that private
efforts to create habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker, the
northern grayling (a fish), and the bald eagle have been abandoned.
<P>
But Congress can and must learn from the remarkable private efforts-undertaken
before the enactment of the ESA-to restore the populations of
the wood duck, the bluebird, and the falcon, as well as dozens
of other endangered and threatened species.  The private sector
has proven its ability to protect truly endangered species, and
can do so again, but only if the current perverse incentives of
the ESA are removed.
<P>
<B>The Secret Process of Endangered Species Listings</B>
<P>
Central to the application of the ESA is the &quot;listing&quot;
of threatened and endangered species.  Such species are listed
through a complex political process that is completely outside
the arena of public debate and without the benefit of traditional
scientific analysis or peer review.  One U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service biologist determines whether or not a species is listed.
 Imagine our government permitting one physician to decree a serious
public health hazard!  Yet when it comes to endangered species
we are bound by the opinion of a single federal civil servant.
<P>
The failure of this system is illustrated by the listing as an
endangered species of the so-called Alabama Sturgeon.  That fish
is indistinguishable from other sturgeon that inhabit waters elsewhere,
and yet it was listed as endangered despite over-whelming scientific
evidence to the contrary.  U.S. Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL)
argued persuasively against the listing to no avail.  The story
of the Alabama Sturgeon is similar to that of the kangaroo rat,
another plentiful species listed as endangered because many distinct
populations in the West are smaller than the government thinks
they ought to be.
<P>
Saving every distinct population without regard to the real impact
on human beings is wrongheaded and impractical.  That it is wrong
is best illustrated by the unnecessary destruction of private
property caused by a wildfire fueled by uncleared brushbrush that
the government had declared kangaroo rat habitat.  Saving every
distinct population under the ESA is impractical in that huge
expenditures are made to protect creatures that are endangered
not due to human action but to the harshness of nature.  Moreover,
many species whose range lies primarily outside the geographical
United States are protected even though they are plentiful in
their chief habitats.  At the same time, funding for other, truly
endangered species goes wanting.  Despite self-congratulatory
rhetoric from federal agencies, there is no hard evidence that
a single species has been saved from extinction by application
of the ESA.
<P>
The dismal record of the ESA as a species-saving measure is well
documented.  Under the ESA several species have certainly become
extinct, and the government itself claims to have saved only one
species from extinction.  Like other command-and-control environmental
laws, the ESA fails to enhance the environment.  For the reasons
stated above, habitat is destroyed rather than enhanced, and truly
endangered species are further endangered by those who consider
them a blight on their land.  There is also a high probability
that many of the 853 species listed as endangered and the 3900
candidate species are not, in fact, endangered.  Many have been
listed for purely political purposes to serve the ends of special
interests or to enhance the reputation of the biologist who recommends
the listing.
<P>
Given public awareness of the absurd consequences of the listing
process, one might imagine that the federal bureaucracy would
at least try to improve it.  However, Senator Shelby has accurately
described the &quot;avalanche of proposed rules and the continuing
expansion of the law's scope beyond the preservation of species
in peril from immediate development.&quot;  Do Americans need
more bureaucratic experts making these decisions without regard
to their efficacy or the consequences to the citizenry?  The public,
not just pressure groups, should have a role in the listing process,
and all scientific evidence with regard to listing under the ESA
should be subjected to an academic's peer review process.
<P>
<B>The Real Costs of &quot;No Cost&quot; Federal Land-Use Controls</B>
<P>
The real impact of the ESA is that it amounts to a &quot;no cost&quot;
federal land-use law.  That is, it severely limits the use of
private lands and yet costs its advocates almost nothing to invoke.
 Many commentators have remarked that the ESA is but one of many
arrows in the quiver available to opponents of land development
and public projects.  In fact, a legal challenge to land development
can be made by any interested party seeking to invoke the ESA.
 If an invocation is successful and development is blocked, the
landowner must shoulder the cost of attorney's fees.  Since most
environmental groups have large budgets with which to pay their
lawyers and private landowners typically have little with which
to fight back with, it is nearly always a winning proposition
for a special interest group to try to invoke the ESA.  Even failed
challenges may result in an eventual victory.  Designation of
a species as &quot;threatened&quot; instead of &quot;endangered&quot;
has nearly the same effect-the private land-use or public project
may not proceed.  The ESA is actually more valuable to special
interest groups that want to block land development than that
it is to genuine environmentalists concerned with saving species.
<P>
Because the Fish and Wildlife Service is not constrained by cost
in its efforts to implement the law, application of the ESA is
said by its proponents to be &quot;free,&quot; but the actual
costs of the law are staggering.  From increased costs of raw
materials and financial hardship to landowners to the loss of
productivity of lands and tax losses to local government, the
true costs of the ESA certainly run into the billions of dollars
annually.  The notion that the ESA is &quot;free&quot; assumes
that it costs government little or nothing to enforce.  This view
fails to take into account the loss of liberty to the productive
sector of our economy.
<P>
<B>Environmentalism As a Religion</B>
<P>
One may wonder, given the poor record of the ESA, how such a law
can be supported.  To understand support for the ESA, one must
look to the law's origins.  During the 1960s there was growing
concern that human activity, particularly industrialization and
public works, was rapidly destroying many species that were vital
to the earth's ecosystems.  Lacking scientific agreement and scientific
support on the subject, many of those concerned with the issue
turned to an anti-Western philosophical argument to support a
new environmental policy.
<P>
The primary academic bulwark for this new philosophy of ecology
was the work of University of California at Los Angeles history
professor Lynn White.  White's thesis is that our Judeo-Christian
heritage, and Christianity in particular, is the root cause of
environmental pollution and destruction of the earth's ecosystems.
 White proposed a new ethic, essentially based on Eastern pantheism,
that was readily adopted by environmentalists.
<P>
Environmentalist pantheism asserts that all species are equal
and that mankind is the principal threat to the environment. 
To extreme environmentalists, mankind is a virus on the earth.
 Environmentalism grew in popularity as the American media was
announcing the &quot;death of God.&quot;  Hence it filled a spiritual
need for many Americans, especially among those most susceptible
to influence by the media and the academic elites.  When codified
into the ESA, a new religious order was created, officially sanctioned
by the government of the United States. Earth Day is its religious
holiday, dutifully celebrated by the faithful.
<P>
The ESA (1973) was enacted and the Environmental Protection Agency
(1971) established at the height of environmentalist enthusiasm.
But it is the wholesale, root-and-branch attack on our Western
heritage, not the goal of protecting endangered species, that
now alarms most Americans.  As an abstract idea, environmentalism
and reverence for the natural world had and still has broad appeal.
 But its popularity wanes in direct proportion to the visibility
and economic impact of its bureaucratic manifestations in everyday
life.  Experience with the ESA over the past twenty years has
generated a popular backlash against its excesses.  Radical environmentalism
today retains its religious character only on college campuses
and among clergy of &quot;progressive&quot; churches, where it
is one of the pillars of Political Correctness.  Outside that
insular world, most Americans are re-evaluating the impact and
legacy of that destructive era.
<P>
Despite its popularity among environmental activists, Professor
White's thesis has been widely disputed on both philosophical
and historical grounds.  Father Robert Sirico, a Paulist priest
and economist, squarely identifies the religious nature of environmentalism
and argues that it is inimical to our heritage.  Other writers
have also demonstrated the poverty of White's thesis against the
richness of the Western tradition and Judeo-Christian teaching.
 Christianity mandates individual<I> responsibility</I> as a necessary
corollary of individual <I>liberty</I>.  Whatever warm feelings
may come about from &quot;saving&quot; endangered species, adherence
to the basic tenets of &quot;species egalitarianism&quot; -that
all species are morally indistinguishable and that other species
are to be given priority over mankind's interests -is contrary
to our Western heritage and common sense. 
<P>
Most Americans have concluded that much of the environmentalist
litany is patently ridiculous.  If the premises of the ESA were
broadly accepted by the American public, we would let cows walk
in the streets, rats forage unmolested in our restaurants, and
bears roam in our school yards.  Moreover, reverence for &quot;natural
processes&quot; would mean abandonment of attempts to defeat the
HIV virus and other diseases.
<P>
<B>The Endangered Species Act and the Rule of Law</B>
<P>
Another sober realization now shaping the American political landscape
is that the Endangered Species Act works in opposition to the
economic interests of most Americans.  Unwary citizens can have
their entire estates bound up in land subjected to government
control, and thousands of jobs are lost through ESA enforcement.
 When it comes to endangered species, individuals are forced to
pit their own interests against the purported interests of the
state.
<P>
Thus it comes as no surprise that citizens &quot;shoot, shovel,
and shut up,&quot; cut down trees before they can become habitat,
ensure that weeds are plowed under rather than letting land lie
fallow, and fill all low spots to avoid vernal pools on their
land.  The fact that the law cannot be fairly applied without
extraordinary coercion is a telltale sign that it violates the
cornerstone of our ordered system of liberty-the rule of law.
<P>
Our legal system is based upon the rule of law.  It assumes that
the law exists to preserve the liberty <I>of the citizens</I>.
 To work, it must be universally applied and general enough to
receive the support of the populace.  It must also be certain
in its effects.  The ESA has popular support only when it is applied
against some giant corporation whose position in the community
may be easy to envy and criticize.  As regards certainty, it is
certain only that the ESA will yield disparate, unfair results.
 Landowners who do not destroy habitat will be affected, and then
only if the endangered species chooses their land instead of a
neighbor's.  It is also uncertain because government agencies
and large corporate interests can often buy special rules to avoid
it.  The ESA thus lacks the universality, generality and certainty
basic to the rule of law.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act needs to be amended.  Reform should
be grounded upon the principle of balance, and the objective of
the law should be to preserve not federal power but endangered
species.  The debate should begin from the premise that human
liberty is the guiding principle of American law.  Private property,
a vital prerequisite and safeguard of ordered liberty, should
not be denigrated.  Individual responsibility with regard to the
environment should be encouraged.
<P>
Congress must address specific deficiencies in the current law.
 But the first order of business should be to open up the debate
and insist on &quot;truth in advertising.&quot;  This means that
the philosophical underpinnings of the current program and the
proposed solutions should be openly discussed and called by their
right names.  The American people should not again submit to the
wholesale abandonment of their traditions and their liberties,
as when the ESA was passed in 1973.  If we wish to reauthorize
a new state religion-pantheistic environmentalism-we should be
open about doing so.  The law should not be &quot;curious,&quot;
as Chief Justice Warren Burger described the ESA in the case of
<I>TVA v.</I> <I>Hill</I>.  Its preferences must be clearly stated
and labeled.
<P>
Specific features that need to be changed in the law include the
following:
<UL>
<LI>Congress should provide that the listing and de-listing process
includes peer review of all candidates for endangered and threatened
species.  Funding of peer reviewers should be disclosed to ensure
that the review is objective, as should any special relationships
or conflicts of interest.
<LI>Public input into the listing and de-listing process should
be required, as should ample public notice so as to ensure the
opportunity for all those concerned or affected to be heard.
<LI>Congress should state explicitly that all species are not
created equal.  The revised ESA should state a preference for
mankind where balance is an issue.  And the impact on humans of
endangered species listings should be part of the listing analysis.
 Economic impacts should be part of any listing procedure as well.
 That is, a full analysis of the true economic costs of endangered
species listing should be required whenever a candidate is considered
for listing.
<LI>Congress should state that some non-human endangered species
may be determined to be more important than others.  In this way,
limited public resources may be allocated to those species deemed
the most important public resource. 
<LI>Congress should require periodic re-evaluation of species
listed and all candidates for listing.
<LI>Congress must compensate for the loss of private property
taken by endangered species regulation.  Compensation must be
required for full, partial, and temporary takings, and it should
be paid upon determination that private property must be taken
for use by an endangered species.  Also, a declaration of condemnation
and filing of condemnation proceedings must be filed not just
in any court competent to hear the action, but within the congressional
district of the affected citizen or that in which the property
is located.  Nothing in the condemnation proceedings may infringe
upon the property owner's right to just compensation as guaranteed
by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
<LI>Congress should also encourage individual efforts to enhance
endangered and threatened species.  Such private efforts have
the greatest chance of enhancing small numbers of species and
of preserving or creating critical habitat.  Permits should not
be required to use private property for endangered species enhancement,
except in cases where such efforts may constitute a public nuisance.
 Tax incentives should be established, including deductions from
estate and income taxes, for the contribution of private property
for endangered species habitat.  No income tax should be levied
upon the sale of critical habitat to conservation organizations
devoted to endangered or threatened species enhancement.  A divided
real property estate should qualify for endangered or threatened
species tax treatment.  In this way, the presence of an endangered
species would be a boon to the landowner instead of a dreaded
blight.
<LI>Commercial opportunities geared to endangered species enhancement
should be permitted.  Congress should allow private husbandry
of threatened and endangered species.  It also should allow regulated
marketing of threatened and endangered species, following the
enlightened example of Zimbabwe, whose game population has flourished
under commercial management.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Congress should address reauthorization of the Endangered Species
Act in a manner consistent with American tradition, through open
and honest debate, and with a view toward protecting both the
liberty of our citizens and truly endangered species.  Only in
this manner can the injustices and excesses of the existing law
be rectified.  In crafting the language to effect these changes,
and in monitoring their implementation, Congress must be alert
to the self-interest of the bureaucracy in perpetuating and extending
its discretionary powers. 
<P>
After Congress acts to correct ESA deficiencies, the states must
follow suit in revising state plans to reflect the new federal
policies.  State policy-makers must match federal changes with
innovative steps of their own in the balancing of competing interests,
compensation for takings of private property, and other changes
in the direction of common sense.

<P>
<B>Rethinking Welfare Reform in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
In 1966, one year after Lyndon Johnson and Congress declared war
on poverty, the poverty rate stood at 14.7 percent.  Over a quarter
century later, after approximately $5 trillion in federal, state,
and local welfare spending, the poverty rate remains virtually
the same at 14.5 percent in 1992.  In California, even as the
economy boomed in the 1980s, welfare caseloads continued to grow,
and they continue to grow rapidly in 1994.
<P>
Over the past three years the Wilson administration, in concert
with a reluctant Democratic legislature, has made several changes-from
cuts in individual grants to instituting fingerprinting programs-and
their effects on the California budget have been relatively beneficial.
 Budget tinkering, however, will not solve welfare's core crisis.
 Through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other
programs, we subsidize behavior that destroys communities.  Teenage
motherhood, divorce and separation, absent and delinquent fathers,
and even drug addiction can qualify a person for state payment.
 Fortunately, after nearly thirty years of destructive social
policy, a new consensus has emerged:  something has gone dreadfully
wrong with the welfare state.  Unfortunately, this new consensus
on the scope of the problem does not yet extend to agreement on
how to fix it.  
<P>
We can learn from the experience of past generations.  We need
not be prisoners of welfare state misconceptions and biases about
either &quot;root causes&quot; or workable solutions.  In fact,
it is only by looking beyond the &quot;welfare establishment&quot;
that we find innovative thinking and viable solutions.  The history
of that last thirty years teaches us one clear lesson: our goal
should not be to &quot;reform&quot; welfare or to turn it into
a new public works program.  Our goal must be to abolish it.
<P>
Much can be learned from examining how welfare was managed in
19th century, which was done largely, and more successfully, by
private charities.  We must relearn and reapply what was common
knowledge less than a hundred years ago, before the rise of the
welfare state, its entitlements, and its bureaucracies.
<P>
Prior to outlining new proposals for reform, we will examine trends
in California welfare in the 1980s and 1990s.  We will also explain
why Bill Clinton's program to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot;
will not help California-or do anything substantial to break the
cycle of dependency.  
<P>
<B>RECENT TRENDS</B>
<P>
<B>Expenditures</B>
<P>
Welfare in California operates on several different levels.  The
main program is AFDC, the costs of which are shared by the federal
and state governments.  AFDC falls into two categories:  AFDC-Family
Group (AFDC-FG) which goes to single-parent families, and AFDC-Unemployment
Parent (AFDC-U) which goes to two-parent households with at least
one unemployed parent.  In 1992-93 these two programs enrolled
2,458,6000 individuals per month at a cost of $5.9 billion, of
which California paid $2.8 billion and counties paid $0.4 billion.
 (California accounted for 27 percent of all money spent on AFDC
nationwide in 1993-more than double the average per capita for
the nation.)
<P>
The two AFDC categories differ in significant ways.  AFDC-FG now
accounts for 84 percent of the AFDC caseload.  Growth in the AFDC-FG
caseload was &quot;completely unrelated&quot; to fluctuations
in the unemployment rate for ten of twelve large counties in California
over a seven-year period through 1991-92.  In contrast, the Department
of Social Services found that the recession accounted from much
of the growth in the AFDC-U caseload.
<P>
Why do people go on welfare in the first place?  According to
nationwide data on AFDC, 75 percent of AFDC-FG cases begin receiving
aid because of changes in family structure, while only 15 percent
do so as direct result of a reduction in income.  Of those who
leave AFDC, 46 percent leave because of changes in family structure,
and 26 percent leave AFDC because of increased income.
<P>
This information suggests that offering employment in exchange
for AFDC-FG will not significantly reduce the caseload.  There
is another element at work-teenage pregnancy.
<P>
California has the highest teenage birthrate in the nation, with
births to mothers under age 18 comprising over 10 percent of all
births.  During the 1980s, the teenage birthrate increased by
12 percent.  These numbers have a direct effect on the AFDC-FG
program.  Approximately 54 percent of women currently receiving
aid had their first child as a teenager, and 32 percent of AFDC
families have additional children after first receiving aid, making
them eligible for a larger grant.  This suggests that if we reduce
teen pregnancy, AFDC payments will also fall.  We believe an inverse
relationship exists as well.  Reduce or eliminate AFDC and replace
it with a system absent the current perverse incentives, and teen
pregnancy will fall significantly.
<P>
Other forms of welfare in California include General Assistance,
a county-operated program which enrolls approximately 165,000
people per month, providing benefits mostly to adults with no
children.  Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program
(SSI/SSP) is jointly funded by federal and state governments,
and provides aid to 960,500 aged, blind, and disabled people per
month.
<P>
The Department of Finance estimates that in the fiscal year 1993-94,
2.6 million people, or 8.2 percent, of all Californians received
some kind of welfare benefit.  This is up from 7.3 percent in
1991-92-an 11 percent increase in two years.
<P>
<B>Recent Reforms</B>
<P>
Some progress has been made in reducing the size of individual
welfare grants, which are currently 12.9 percent below 1990-91
levels.  The &quot;need standard&quot; (a schedule that reflects
the state's determination of the income that families need to
subsist) has increased to reflect the cost of living.  The difference
between the two is now 15.1 percent, and the legislature has lifted
some limitations on work income for recipients.  Despite these
changes in benefit levels, the AFDC caseload and budget will continue
to grow, 4.5 percent for AFDC-FG, and 4.7 percent for AFDC-U,
according to Department of Finance estimates..
<P>
The current 1994-95 budget will reduce individual grants for a
family of one parent and two children from $607 to $593 per month,
but because of increasing caseloads, the entire Health and Welfare
budget will increase by 3.3 percent.  The costs of new cases are
outstripping the reductions in individual grants.  Clearly, just
reducing the size of individual grants is not enough.
<P>
The new budget includes two additional changes.  First, beginning
in November 1995, AFDC families will no longer receive the automatic
increase in benefits from having another child.  Welfare families
will also be allowed to keep their benefits for one year after
marriage.

<P>
Even these modest improvements, however, are in jeopardy.  On
July 13, 1994 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
cutting individual welfare payments is against the law.  In 1992,
California obtained a waiver from the Bush administration to reduce
AFDC payments.  Now, two years later, Judge Alfred Goodwin of
the Ninth Circuit Court has written that the Bush administration
improperly considered the request's effect on the poor.  The ruling
also called into question this year's decision to deny additional
benefits for children born while their mothers are on AFDC.  The
Wilson administration is appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
<P>
In December 1992 welfare payments to out-of state emigrants were
reduced to home state levels, but a U.S. District Judge promptly
blocked the law.  In April 1994, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of appeals upheld the decision, agreeing that new residents must
be held equal with respect to the &quot;basic necessities of life.&quot;
 The Wilson administration is, once again, appealing the decision
to the Supreme Court.
<P>
In our 1992 report, we found that welfare fraud is more prevalent
than is officially reported.  New data collected by the Department
of Finance has backed that view.  To address this problem, Los
Angeles County has instituted a fingerprinting program for general
assistance benefits, as has San Francisco. That city-home to 14,900
general assistance recipients-has seen between 400 and 610 people
ignore two notices to be fingerprinted or be kicked out of the
system.  If just 350 of those people leave the system, the city
estimates savings of $1.2 million annually.  In the budget this
year is a provision for a pilot fingerprinting program in Los
Angeles for state AFDC benefits<I>.</I>

<P>
<B>The GAIN Program</B>
<P>
Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) is California's version
of the federal JOBS program, a provision of the Family Support
Act of 1988.  The GAIN program is overseen by the Department of
Social Services and administered by the 58 counties.  The Department
of Social Services estimates the GAIN budget for all levels of
government for  the 1993-94 year to be $211 million.
<P>
The California Department of Social Services commissioned the
Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation in New York to evaluate
GAIN'S effects on welfare recipients.  MDRC has tracked 33,000
welfare recipients in six counties for three years.  A control
group that was precluded from the GAIN program but could seek
employment services in the community was compared with the 33,000
in employment rates, average earnings, average AFDC payments,
and percentage of each group that left the AFDC rolls.
<P>
That last category should be the ultimate test of any work-training
program, and GAIN's impact on this has been modest at best.  At
the end of three years MDRC found virtually no difference between
the control group and the GAIN group for both AFDC-FG and AFDC-U
in leaving welfare (the difference was only three percent).  In
some countries, there were marginal to significant increases in
average total earnings and employment of GAIN participants, and
welfare savings were achieved through individual grant reduction.
 Nevertheless, these gains are modest and it is premature to call
GAIN a success.  We can't say GAIN has succeeded until it moves
people off welfare for good or reduces the entire welfare budget,
and so far, that hasn't happened.
<P>
Undoubtedly, the GAIN program has produced positive results for
a number of individuals, although that number is a fraction of
the total AFDC population.  In California, 171,865 people, or
20 percent of adults receiving AFDC, will participate in GAIN
in the current budget year.  Thus, it is probably true that GAIN
has been a worthwhile reform, and should be continued.  Yet it
is too early to gauge its long-term impact or its effectiveness
in reducing welfare expenditures statewide.
<P>
It is also too early to gauge the effects of fraud prevention
measures.  If the San Francisco experience is typical, fingerprinting
programs may save the state considerably.  Likewise, some evidence
shows that moving AFDC recipients into training and education
programs like GAIN can achieve some savings in some counties.
 But legitimate welfare caseloads are still on the rise, outstripping
the modest gains realized through fraud prevention and worker
training programs.  Until we stem that tide, reducing individual
payments or stamping out fraud is akin to rearranging deck chairs
on the <I>Titanic</I>.
<P>
<B>THE SOCIAL COSTS OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY</B>
<P>
Governor Wilson justifies his welfare reform proposals &quot;because
of the severe nature of the fiscal circumstances facing California,&quot;
and in the face of Democratic majorities in the legislature, Wilson's
success in reducing welfare payments <I>at all</I> is laudable.
 But the logic of Wilson's economic argument implies that if fiscal
circumstances were more favorable, we should maintain, or even
increase, welfare grants.  In confining his arguments strictly
to the budget impact, Wilson ignores the seminal reason for welfare
reform: government welfare payments have demoralized their recipients
and have created a culture of dependency.  Yes, comprehensive
welfare reform will save Californians money, but saving money
in itself ought not be the primary goal.
<P>
Consider two recent news stories, representative of events occurring
across America nearly every day.  From <I>Newsweek</I> magazine:
<P>
The cops found the last of 19 [children] asleep under a mound
of dirty clothes; one 4-year-old gnarled by cerebral palsy, bore
welts and bruises.  . . . And though the six mothers living there
collected a total of $4,500 a month in welfare and food stamps,
there was barely any food in the house.
<P>
In Sacramento recently, four boys-two 17-year-olds, a 14-year-old,
and one just 13-were arrested for a string of robberies and callous
shootings.  &quot;Don't care about nobody,&quot; said the 13-year-old,
who was the &quot;designated shooter&quot; in the group.  The
grandmother of the 14-year-old spoke to the <I>Sacramento Bee:</I>
<P>
We are stunned and very sad.  I feel very badly about the people
who were hurt. . .  In my age it was different.  I worked all
my life.  I set an example.  I was a nurse for 30 years.  I got
an education.  None of this welfare business. . . . It's just
a mass problem, and I don't have the answers. . . . The truth
is, these kids need their mom.
<P>
It turns out that the boy's mom has a drug problem and his father
is gone. 
<P>
<B>The Illegitimacy Connection</B>
<P>
These examples are extreme, yet we see them in the headlines every
day.  At the same time youth crime has become more common and
increasingly serious, out-of-wedlock births have skyrocketed,
and both common sense and statistics demonstrate a strong correlation
with welfare.  Robert Tector of the Heritage Foundation provides
the common sense:  &quot;[A teenage single mother] will continue
to receive her 'paycheck' as long as she fulfills two conditions:
1) She must not work; and 2) she must not marry and employed male.&quot;
 In the early 1940s illegitimacy among blacks was 19 percent,
at a time when racial discrimination was high, and crime rates
were relatively low.  By 1965 that rate had risen to 28 percent.
 Since 1965, however, the rate is up to 68 percent overall, and
is much higher in many inner city neighborhoods.  Among whites,
the illegitimate birth rate stands at 22 percent, and for high
school dropouts it is 48 percent and rising rapidly.
<P>
Establishing that births to unwed mothers has increased is relatively
simple.  What links that fact with the breakdown of cities like
Washington D.C. and New York?
<P>
Social scientists Douglas Smith and Roger Jarjoura found that
high crime rates are caused by a greater number of single-parent
families.  Other factors found to contribute to high crime rates
were population density, mobility, and the percentage of adolescents
in a community.
<P>
Poverty<I> per se</I> is not the driving force behind violent
crime.  Other factors are far more decisive.  Dr. June O'Neill
of Baruch College found that young black men raised in single-parent
families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activity than
black men raised in two parent families, even accounting for variables
like family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment,
and parents' education.
<P>
Furthermore, children from one-parent families are two to three
times more likely to need psychiatric care than those in two-parent
families, and more likely to begin sexual activity at a younger
age, thereby increasing the chance the cycle will continue.
<P>
An alternative theory popular with the social welfare establishment
is that high crime rates are not the results of generous welfare
benefits and illegitimacy, but result from the absence of available
jobs in inner cities, giving residents nothing to do but join
gangs and commit crimes.  This is the philosophy behind Jesse
Jackson's answer to &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; laws.
 &quot;Four Balls, You're On&quot; includes job training, education,
and guaranteed employment.
<P>
The available evidence suggests that the more likely answer is
not the absence of jobs, but the absence of a<I> work ethic</I>,
the very foundation of seeking and keeping a job.  Mayron Magnet,
a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, illustrates the point:
<P>
That is the lesson of Korean economic success in ghetto neighborhoods.
 No opportunity?  Then why do Korean greengrocers flourish in
Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, where no such business has flourished
for years... It doesn't take arcane skills to run a vegetable
stand, only hard work, long hours, determination, rudimentary
entrepreneurialism, and family cooperation... What limits economic
opportunity for the underclass above all is the lack of such skills-skills
like being able to show up on time dependably, to be conscientious
and have manners, to treat customers well enough so they'll come
back, to stick to something unpleasant and arduous, to attend
to details.
<P>
Why do families with no fathers tend to produce juvenile criminals,
and  contribute to the overall breakdown of values in a community?
 UCLA political scientist James Q. Wilson believes the key to
community harmony is that &quot;fathers live there.&quot;  That
is, it the males who live in a given neighborhood are responsible
adults with something to protect, the community will likely be
safer than a neighborhood in which many of the males are rootless
and lawless.  Professor Wilson suggests that young males without
fathers still feel the need for them, and finding none present,
turn to street gangs for that guidance.
<P>
In addition, many of the single-mothers in the communities Wilson
is talking about are ill-equipped to be parents themselves.  A
recent study by the Columbia University Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse demonstrates the disastrous level of alcohol and
drug abuse among AFDC recipients.  From the report:
<UL>
<LI>37 percent of women on AFDC 18 to 24 years of age abuse or
are addicted to alcohol and drugs.
<LI>Mothers receiving AFDC are three times more likely to abuse
or be addicted to alcohol and drugs than mothers not receiving
AFDC (27 percent compared to 9 percent).
<LI>14 percent of pregnant women on public assistance in California
would test positive for cocaine use.
<LI>Nationally, 200,000 drug-exposed babies will be born every
year to mothers on AFDC.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
As the study shows, too many children are left not only without
fathers, but without any parent at all.
<P>
In an influential essay in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, Charles
Murray of the Manhattan Institute predicted that if this trend
is nor revised, we can count on high crime and high unemployment
in white communities, a crisis of bigger proportions because of
sheer numbers.
<P>
In every human society, from Brazil's Yanomamo Indians to Communist
China, the family has been the basis for bringing the next generation
into the society, teaching its members that particular society's
customs and laws.  Our welfare system thwarts this pattern by
subsidizing a system in which one person (usually the biological
mother) is charged with raising one or more children, and penalized
if she attempts to marry or become self-sufficient.  When viewed
through the scope of human history and experience throughout the
world, the result is unsurprising: many of our youth are growing
up uneducated, anti-social, and violent.
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: BOLD RHETORIC. BALD POLITICS</B>
<P>
In an NBC News interview, President Clinton commented on Charles
Murray's widely-read essay, published a month earlier.  &quot;He
did the country a great service.  I mean, he and I have often
disagreed, but I think his analysis is essentially right.  There's
no question that [ending welfare payments to single mothers] would
work.  The question is . . . is it morally right?&quot;
<P>
Clinton's answer to his own question is found in the &quot;Work
and Responsibility Act of 1994.&quot;  Unfortunately, his plan
doesn't live up the advance billing.  Instead of bold new ideas,
it falls into the pattern of other liberal &quot;reforms&quot;
of the recent past.  The plan simply calls for more of the same-more
job training, guaranteed (&quot;last resort&quot;) government
jobs, and incredibly, <I>more money</I>.  President Clinton would
spend an additional $9.3 billion over five years in order to &quot;save
money in the long run.&quot;  (It's a quintessential Congressional
reform plan: spend now, save later-in the &quot;out years&quot;
of the budget calendar).
<P>
Some of President Clinton's proposals are laudable.  He would
require unwed teenage mothers to live with their parents or a
responsible adult before they receive a welfare payment.  Currently,
young teenage mothers might be put up separately in their own
apartments.
<P>
The few positive effects of the Clinton plan, however, would be
offset by its sheer irrelevance in solving what the President
himself acknowledges is the core problem, namely, the cycle of
dependency.  Clinton's plan does propose to eliminate welfare
benefits after two years, but this change is a hollow reform because
the federal government would guarantee a public service job at
that point.  So much for &quot;ending welfare as we know it.&quot;
 This jobs program will almost certainly cost more than projected,
since by  administration estimates, government-subsidized jobs
will increase from 15,000 today to 394,000 by the year 2000. 
Furthermore, the major provisions of the plan will apply only
to those born after 1971.  This means that only one-third of welfare
recipients will be affected by the program.
<P>
In the final analysis, the Clinton plan will do virtually nothing
to solve the underlying problems of the American welfare system.
 For all of his eloquent speeches about the breakdown of the family
and the specter of teenage motherhood, the Clinton plan is nothing
but gradualism and &quot;business as usual&quot; for the welfare
state:  $9.3 billion in new expenditures and a guaranteed public
works job for those who can't find or keep a job in the private
sector.  This is warmed-over Democratic machine politics: put
people on the public dole and they'll vote for you forever.  A
&quot;guaranteed job&quot; is no job at all; it's merely disguised
public assistance, and no one will be fooled.  If there is no
threat of firing, whether explicit or implicit, what incentive
is there to work?
<P>
To his credit, President Clinton proposes to allow states to cut
benefits for additional children born while the mother is on AFDC.
 But it is likely that any Clinton reforms wouldn't take effect
until 1996 or 1997.  California can't wait that long.
<P>
The irony is that nothing short of radical solutions will change
the trends, yet Americans are traditionally wary of radical reforms
from which there is no escape, i.e., a Congressional mandate encompassing
the entire United States.  Americans want to see something work
<I>somewhere</I>; before it is implemented <I>everywhere</I>.
 The answer is for Congress and the President to remove all impediments
to state- and county-based reforms.  This idea, like most good
ideas, is not new; but has never been allowed a trial run.  Allowing
real freedom for states to test new welfare concepts would be
a radical departure from the history of the past thirty years.
 Its an idea whose time has come . . . again.
<P>
<B>WELFARE BEFORE THE WELFARE STATE</B>
<P>
Most people have at least heard of the two milestones of the American
welfare state:  the New Deal in the 1930's and the Great Society
programs launched in 1965.  But how many Americans know what welfare
&quot;programs&quot; were in place <I>before</I> the Great Society?
 Without AFDC, did single mothers and their children starve to
death in the streets?
<P>
Marvin Olasky of the University of Texas studied the approach
to welfare in the late 1800s and early twentieth century.  He
found that the approach to welfare was nearly the mirror opposite
of today's practices-and the results far more benign.  The ingredients
were legislative support for the family, and local community support
for those known as the deserving poor: widows, orphans, and the
disabled.  Distinctions were made between those physically unable
to work, and the able-bodied who were temporarily down on their
luck.
<P>
Olasky writes of a more striking crisis in the 1890s in New York
City:
<P>
Thousands of orphans roamed the streets.  Infant mortality rates
were 10 times present levels . . . A survey found 6,576 New York
slum families living in tenement 'inside' rooms-rooms without
windows facing out, only air-shafts, which many tenants used as
garbage chutes.
<P>
According to Olasky, a &quot;war on poverty&quot; was waged by
various local charities and religious groups using firm principles:
<P>
Emphasizing the restoration of broken ties to family and friends
. . . forging long-term contact between a volunteer and a needy
person . . . Using &quot;work tests&quot; and background checks
to distinguish among different types of applicants . . . Learning
to say 'no' in the short run so as to produce better long-term
results . . . Requiring work from every able-bodied person . .
. Helping the able needy to resist enslavement to the charity
of governmental or private masters.
<P>
Federally funded welfare has induced national amnesia.  Grants
are now seen by recipients, bureaucrats, and social welfare advocates
not as charity, but as an entitlement from a faceless bureaucracy,
for which nothing is owed in return.
<P>
Charity, in the proper sense if the word, is a voluntary expression
of compassion for someone in need.  Exactly who is in need is
determined by those willing to give, and when the transaction
is voluntary, the relationship enriches both parties.  Comments
by one Sacramento welfare mother points out the core distinction
in any charity program:  &quot;There are those who honestly need
it as a steppingstone.&quot;  She is right, but who best can distinguish
between those truly in need and those simply trying to sponge?
 The answer is-those who are closest to the problem: individuals,
private charities, and in some cases, local governments.
<P>
<B>THE FIRST STEP IS CRIME CONTROL</B>
<P>
No welfare reform plan can hope to succeed without simultaneously
addressing the other crisis of the American city-juvenile crime.
 The U.S. Department of Justice reports that in the four years
between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles in court for murders
increased by 55 percent.  For aggravated assault, robberies, and
forcible rapes, the increases were 80 percent, 52 percent, and
27 percent respectively.  But the real tragedy is that children
ages 12 to 17 are the most common <I>victims</I> of violent crime
in America.
<P>
When violent crimes like murder, rape, and armed robbery are commonly
committed by teenagers, some as young as 13, a light sentence
of 10 years is simply not enough.  These perpetrators must be
considered adult criminals and sentenced accordingly.  Their values
and outlook on life are so empty of human consideration that even
human life has no meaning.  And what values does one learn in
the prison system?  For most, exactly the same values they learned
growing up without proper parental guidance.  Turning these young
criminals loose at the age of twenty-five will do nothing but
endanger more innocent lives.  We must eliminate age discrimination
in sentencing.  Violent crime is violent crime no matter what
the age.
<P>
This get-tough policy regarding juvenile crime is not a matter
of imposing heavy punishment for the sake of retribution.  Its
goal is to remove the criminal element from the streets so that
the law-abiding population can pursue jobs, family life, and recreation
in safety and security.  Communities cannot be built in a war
zone.  
<P>
As we identify and incarcerate the few pathological juveniles
among the teenage population, so too can we identify those who
show early signs of criminality with relatively minor transgressions,
such as shoplifting or vandalism.  For these minor crimes, we
should not allow suspended sentences or lenient treatment after
a first offense.  On a second offense, even of minor crimes, the
time for leniency has passed.  There are any number of punishment
options, from boot camps, to forcing vandals to clean up the walls
of a city, to minimum security jail time.  The important thing
is not the specific punishment exacted, but that any punishment
is swiftly and surely applied.  This will send a message that
even minor transgressions will be taken seriously, and that actions
have consequences.  This is a message rarely conveyed today to
any criminals, least of all to juveniles.
<P>
Getting violent young hoodlums off the streets is essential to
making neighborhoods and schools safe for young people who want
to pursue positive goals, to build families and prepare for careers.
 Without such policies to bring crime under control, the &quot;positive
role models&quot; in every community will continue to be victimized
by gangs and street crime.
<P>
<B>INVESTING IN THE FUTURE</B>
<P>
The other component of radical welfare reform is fortifying family
structures through new incentives and new mechanisms for fostering
family life.  What do we know about successful child-rearing?
 Close supervision, attention to the child's needs (often in place
of the parents' selfish interests) and making that child feel
needed and loved are important ingredients.  It is abundantly
clear that most teenagers are incapable of the maturity needed
to raise a child.  This problem is greatly exacerbated if the
teenage mother is alone.  That is a recipe for social disaster,
as we have learned to our collective sorrow.
<P>
Once we accept this basic truth, there are several approaches
we can follow.  The first and most essential reform must be to
abolish the AFDC program at both the state and federal levels.
 It is time for the federal government to end its &quot;war on
poverty.&quot;  As part of a radical restructuring of welfare
policy, the social welfare function should be returned to the
states, with federal taxes reduced commensurably to allow states
the latitude to finance needed reforms at the local level.
<P>
Once the problem is reduced to a state and county level, it becomes
less overwhelming.  The people in each locality must then answer
two questions for themselves: First, what can we do about teenage
mothers and their children <I>today</I>?  And once we have agreed
that teenage motherhood is on the whole undesirable, how do we
reverse the trend?
<P>
For the present, for young mothers already on welfare, we must
move to alternative structures and incentives.  We  must encourage
them to support themselves in some way, either by getting married,
getting a job, or living with their family, or all three.  For
mothers with preschool age children and nowhere else to turn,
group homes can be established under county government or-better
yet-private charities to provide both generations much needed
parenting.
<P>
Once the children are of school age, the mothers must move out
on their own, and they will have a choice.  If they have proved
their willingness and ability to care for the child at home, they
may take him home, and enroll him in a public school.  If the
mother cannot provide for the child, or feels the child is better
off elsewhere, public or private <I>boarding</I> schools should
be created.  These new schools, financed through philanthropy,
vouchers, and local government money, can also be available to
non-welfare recipients.  The schools should have great latitude
in instilling discipline and responsibility in their students.
 No federal money, mandates, or federal court decisions should
be involved.  This is a plan that can radically change the face
of the inner city, but will only work at a grassroots, hands-on
level.
<P>
Several notable programs are meeting with success with no help
from the federal government.  In Cleveland, the private National
Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Development has
been counseling wayward teens since 1982.  The Institute employs
counselors (available 24 hours a day) assigned to young fathers
and mothers who haven't had parental guidance.  Fifty-seven year-old
Charles Ballard, himself a former teenage father and founder of
the Institute, talks about the requirements for the program: 
<P>
We only insisted on three things.  First, legitimize your child.
 Second, be in school or a GED class.  Third, find a job, no matter
how menial, to learn financial responsibility.  We also spent
a lot of time teaching how to change diapers, to feed and bathe
the child-and how to respect the mother.
<P>
In addition to boarding schools, adoption should be expanded.
 In particular, racism in adoption policies must be abolished.
 Just such a bill, authored by Senator Howard Metzenbaum, is currently
in the House/Senate conference committee.  According to Al Hunt
of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, there are currently 200,000
children available for adoption, 40 percent of which are black.
 Minority children on the average wait twice as long to be adopted,
in part due to a policy position by the National Association of
Black Social Workers, which calls interracial adoptions a &quot;blatant
form of racial and cultural genocide.&quot;  Such ideological
nonsense should not pass for social policy.
<P>
For the mothers who are unable to care for their children, once
relieved of the burden of not having to support them, they can
go to work.  If they have drug or alcohol problems, one-chance
community programs can be implemented.
<P>
In these ways, we can convince pre-teen girls that teenage pregnancy
is an impediment to success, not a path to independence.  The
boarding schools will instill this message clearly and effectively.
 Combined with abstinence (not condom) education, this is a program
that can significantly reduce the teenage pregnancy rate in coming
years.
<P>
<B>FEDERAL MANDATES: TIME FOR A REVOLUTION?</B>
<P>
There is a web of federal statutes that force state governments
to implement various welfare programs, including AFDC.  This labyrinthine
system of mandates hamstrings state legislatures if they want
innovative change.  Assume that a state legislator or the Governor
wants to create a new program to combat AFDC fraud, or amend an
existing program, or even eliminate one.  Included in such legislation
must be a provision for the Department of Social Services to apply
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver
to implement the change.  If HHS refuses, the state legislation
is invalidated.
<P>
During the last 12 years, not a single waiver has been denied
for welfare demonstration projects in California.  However, this
does not mean California has had a free hand in experimenting
with changes in AFDC or other elements of the welfare system.
 State Department of Social Services officials contemplating a
waiver request must calculate the costs, delays, and difficulties
in negotiating a formal waiver request with the federal government.
 Moreover, the request must first be approved <I>internally </I>with
the leadership of the legislature and the Governor's office. 
At this design stage, the request is &quot;pre-negotiated&quot;
with HHS regional and national headquarters staff, and informal
consultation that smokes out the arguments, the obstacles, the
threatened law suits, and the likely outcome.  Thus, all too often
this &quot;pre-negotiated&quot; stage acts as a screen against
genuine change: radical reforms are bartered away for  more &quot;realistic&quot;
ones.  In other words, the fact that waivers must be approved
by the federal government-and now by the federal courts!-determines
the parameters of permissible reform.
<P>
The waiver process itself leads to abominations such as the two
recent Federal Circuit Court decisions (described above) that
have invalidated wavers for California welfare reform.  That states
must apply for &quot;wavers&quot; to decide how they will spend
their tax money is perverse, and must be changed if we are to
make any significant improvements.  Unfortunately, this change
will require changes in federal legislation, which will not occur
without far more aggressive political leadership by governors
and state legislatures.
<P>
There is yet another, more fundamental obstacle to state experimentation
with welfare reform.  States are under many federal mandates that
are costly and burdensome.  But ending the mandates would be only
a first step in creating a policy framework for true reform. 
Bringing full welfare responsibility back to the states will also
require reducing the federal tax burden so that states may have
the fiscal resources to shape and administer alternative plans.
 Without significant federal tax reform as part of a total reformulation
of the federal partnership, shifting full welfare responsibility
to the states would be yet another unfunded mandate.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Our proposals have covered only the AFDC program and the federal-state
nexus fro welfare policy.  We have not examined the General Assistance
programs, largely because they are locally administered.  California
counties are strapped for funds and have ample incentive for policy
innovation-if the state government and federal bureaucracy will
let them do it.
<P>
For a variety of reasons, reform on a comprehensive scale is only
possible through a massive power shift from Washington D.C. back
to the states, followed by further devolution to the counties
and local communities.  Inefficient and perverse programs like
AFDC must be eliminated and their budgets revert back to local
governments, to be replaced by more efficient systems of determining
who are the truly needy.  Innovations like these have heretofore
been stifled by the long arm of federal bureaucracy.
<P>
This policy shift will require a revolution in thinking about
welfare.  Not a revolution from above, but from below, in thousands
of communities across the nation.  Communities are different,
and we should leave administration of welfare for the needy to
them.  No county or state should be forced to apply to Washington
D.C. to change a failed system.
<P>
Congress has exhausted its moral authority in the realm of welfare
policy, and should return welfare to its rightful place in our
political system-to the people in the respective states and counties.
 Then the real revolution can begin.

<B>A Practical, Market-Based Concept to Solve Certain</B>
<P>
<B>Air Quality Problems in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<I>The following paper was  presented at a conference on air quality
cosponsored by The Claremont Institute and the California Environmental
Protection Agency, January 20, 1993, Los Angeles, California.
 </I>
<P>
Nearly everyone but the hard core socialist holdout on his academic
campus agrees that our ecological problems will not be adequately
addressed unless market forces are put to work to control pollution.
 Our efforts to solve these serious problems through police action
have been abysmally ineffective.  Not only have these efforts
been horrendously costly, taking jobs and hastening the de-industrialization
of our country, but they have also threatened our liberty.  Worse,
they have not solved the problem.  So, many of us are in agreement
that we need to go back to what works, the overpowering forces
of the market as the means to address our waste of the environment.
<P>
I would like to present an outline of an idea that is based upon
market principles, which at its core, stresses individual responsibility.
 Without individuals choosing between alternatives, no market
may exist.  Individual accountability is the swiftest and most
effective means to achieve our goals and is the essence of any
market.
<P>
Nobel laureate Ronald Coase demonstrated in &quot;The Problem
of  Social Cost,&quot; that both economic systems (economists)
and blame allocating systems (lawyers) cost society the same number
of dollars when applied to social ills.  If both systems cost
the same, why not continue increasing the regulatory system, exacting
fines from those who pollute.  First, the efficiencies and effectiveness
of using economics instead of blame to deal with social problems
that are generally caused by a majority of the population create
opportunity of choice.  Second, blame is difficult is allocate
among majorities and is ant-democratic.  Third, government lawyers
and their police enforcers  have not surprisingly demonstrated
gross inefficiencies in the area of controlling pollution.  In
summary, it is not possible to regulate clean air.
<P>
Sixty percent of the air pollution of this state is caused by
autos.  A small fraction of this total is caused by commuters
going to and from work.  (That is partly why the car-pool idea,
even when coerced, has not done much about air quality).  The
vast bulk of this air pollution is caused by housewives and other
individuals when they attend to their daily routines and affairs,
privately and efficiently, in their own autos.  These individuals
are very difficult to regulate-that is, it is not possible to
deny them the opportunity to move about by car.  It is this population
of users or buyers in the market that we must address.
<P>
Even though most of the individuals who cause the majority of
the air pollution would like to &quot;do something&quot; about
the problem, there are no opportunities for them to contribute
to the effort.  So, they go about wasting public resources without
regard to the true social cost of their activity other than to
perhaps experience some misguided guilt.  This situation is analogous
to the days when everyone talked about recycling as though it
was someone else's duty.  We all want clean air, but a public
commodity like air is hard to restrict, and is virtually impossible
to package for sale.  Air is the product, but it must be marketed
to the polluter / user.  How can this be done?  By putting a value
on air that is wasted.
<P>
Valuing a common resource poses a problem.  To John Locke the
waste of natural resources was immoral.  Locke's words regarding
the waste of common property are true today.  But, we live in
a relativistic society with little institutional regard for moral
sentiment.  To individuals, Locke's words probably still have
meaning, and I submit this is why they want to &quot;do something&quot;
about the problem.  To institutions, the notion that there is
some moral compunction limiting one's use of public goods is doubtful.
 Nevertheless, our government, which is to exist, &quot;by the
people, and for the people,&quot; may, even in this time of limited
moral accountability, be requested to follow the will of the people.
<P>
Who should put a value on wasted air?  Since it is a public resource,
the logical answer is that the state should initially put a value
on air that is wasted.  How is that value determined?  It should
be determined fairly, equitably and should not be influenced by
false notion that certain individuals have a right, because of
their social status, to pollute.  I suppose that the value of
wasted air could be set in some manner similar to rate setting
for other monopolistic enterprises, with public input.
<P>
How can the wasted air be quantified or sold?  The state of California
has at its disposal and use, extensive, detailed data on the amount
of pollution put into the air by virtually every one of the autos
in the state.  This data is provided by the Smog Check program.
 Each Smog Check testing device records all pertinent data from
each auto registered in the state and that data is stored in digital
memory storage in Sacramento.  Smog Checks are done annually or
bi-annually, depending upon the car's location, and upon each
transfer of the car.  Thus, there is an accurate means of measuring
the amount of air wasted by each auto in areas that do not attain
the standards set by the California Clean Air Act.  The state
should be able to bill each individual for the air that he or
she has wasted with precision during the period between Smog Checks.
 The bill for payment would logically come at the time the car
is registered or re-registered.
<P>
This program could be implemented with little cost of bother to
the state.  The state should alter its shopworn ad valorem system
of licensing fees and replace it with fees paid by the owners
of autos for the value of air wasted by each auto.  Obviously,
this would make low polluting cars very attractive to most people.
 This may not result in an immediate loss of state revenues, but
it most assuredly would have that effect over time because air
pollution from autos would decrease.  Many should cheer this result
on its own merit.  The cost to individuals would vary, according
to their use and wasting of air.  Thus, strong and symbolic incentives
would be given to the individuals to either drive lower polluting
vehicles or drive higher polluting vehicles less.  The choice
would rest with the car owner, not the state.  Like recycling,
wasting air will become not only a matter of conscience, but will
also carry a significant price to the individual choosing to pollute.
 The state would not have to regulate by coercion and thereby
restrict liberty, because the individual would choose how much
he could afford or wished to pollute.
<P>
Since the ad valorem system of taxation on vehicle license fees
is out of place in an age when autos are everyman's, and this
type of tax falls under Proposition 13, the first step to accomplish
this scheme would be for the state legislature to vote by the
supermajority of both houses to implement this program.  Failing
that, a vote of the people could implement this change.
<P>
As the author envisions this program, the cost of this new market
should be approximately equal in terms of dollars to our current
polluted/ regulated status.  In other words, there is no reason
for the state to establish a value for wasted air that is higher
or lower than the tax currently generated by the ad valorem system
of licensing fees.  This is based upon Ronald Coase's theorem
that market focus usually results in the same social cost as a
fault-allocating system.  Since there is presently no fault associated
with one's incremental wasting of air, the current total licensing
fee burden may initially set the value of wasted air.  The state
should not try to make a killing on this market just because it
will play a role in establishing it.  The price of wasted air
would thereafter be adjusted, depending upon the willingness of
the public to tolerate air pollution caused by cars.  Like cigarettes,
pollution may be literally priced out of reach. Or , we may find
a level of air pollution tolerable to the electorate.  Over time,
the improvement in air quality will offset the tremendous costs
of polluted air, enriching everyone.  But most importantly, the
individuals affected by the polluted air will now have a choice
in the matter.
<P>
One may anticipate that the ultra-egalitarians will argue that
individuals of lesser means will be shortchanged by this program.
 After all, under my program the poor must &quot;give up&quot;
something that God has provided them if they cannot afford to
pay for their wasteful use of it.  While I cannot agree with the
philosophy underlying such thinking, I can offer a solution to
this objection.  Presently some $100 millions are collected annually
from surcharges to vehicle registration fees.  These are supposed
to be spent on reducing air pollution caused by motor vehicles.
 Instead of spending all this money on air police employed by
the various air quality agencies, it should be set aside, invested
by private banks and used to provide low-cost loans and other
subsidies to qualified individuals who wish to get rid of their
belchmobiles and trade up into a new low pollution model.  Also,
there is no reason that the revenues raised by my air pricing
system cannot also be used partly for this purpose.  Putting poor
people into a new car may not make them rich, but it may help
them safely and reliably get to work.
<P>
I think that you will agree that this idea is practicable.  It
is timely. It is politically acceptable and realizable.  It would
be a good initial step  toward the establishment of individual
accountability for air pollution.  Best of all, by actually providing
individual incentives to clean up the air, it may mark the beginning
of the end to the ever expanding regulatory police state

<TITLE>THE CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLAN: BAD MEDICINE FOR CALIFORNIA?
</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 2.0z Beta">
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>The Clinton Health Plan:</B>
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine For California's Ailing Economy</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION: A MANUFACTURED CRISIS</B>
<P>
 In 1990, state and federal governments spent $280 billion on
health care, amounting to over 42 percent of health care spending
in the United States.  This is up from just $24.9 billion in 1970.
 The nation's Medicaid bill in 1990 was $34.2 billion, up 150
percent since 1980.  MediCal cost California $9.9 billion in 1990,
up from $3.9 billion in 1983. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted,
government experts predicted that its 1990 budget would be $9
billion to $12 billion in 1990.  In reality it was $107 billion-almost
1000 percent higher than predicted. 
<P>
 Despite these statistics demonstrating government's inability
to control, much less predict, its own health care costs, the
Clinton administration proposes a radical <I>increase</I> in government
control.  To sell the idea, it must convince Americans that their
health care system is in a crisis.  Thus, for instance, we are
told that there are 37 million uninsured Americans. This is extremely
misleading.
<P>
 For one thing, the 37-million figure comes from a snapshot of
society which fails to account for people in-between jobs or recently
married.  In fact, &quot;half of all uninsured spells end within
four months, and only 12 to 13 percent of  the uninsured have
spells that last more than 24 months.&quot;  The Congressional
Budget Office itself has found that 51 percent of the 37 million
are uninsured for less than four months, and 72 percent less than
one year.  Realistically, then, we have 10.4 million Americans
who are without health insurance for twelve months or longer-nowhere
near the 37 million touted by the Clinton Administration.  
<P>
 For another thing, lack of health insurance does not mean lack
of health care.  By law, hospitals may not deny emergency health
care to anyone who walks through the door. Indeed in 1991, the
American Hospital Association estimated that hospitals provide
$10 billion annually in uncompensated care.  Fred Barnes memorably
illustrates the absurdity of the Clinton administration's claims
by revealing the free care now available to a poor uninsured AIDS
patient at a Washington D.C. health clinic: the patient would
be treated immediately, and if circumstances required it, he or
she would be given AZT, which costs $5000 a year.  The doctor
care, the AZT, any other required drugs, and laboratory work would
be financed, mostly by the federal government.
<P>
 In spite of the facts of the matter, the Clinton public relations
campaign has been effective.  The Center for Health Care Policy
and Evaluation examined 29 public opinion surveys over a two year
period and found that nine out of ten Americans indeed believe
there is a health care crisis.  When asked to relate health care
problems to their own personal situation, however, 70 percent
of Americans were &quot;very satisfied&quot; or &quot;somewhat
satisfied&quot; with the quality and availability of coverage.
 Satisfaction levels increased with income, but even 61 percent
of those making less than $20,000 a year were satisfied.  A Gallup
poll in May 1993 showed that 81 percent are &quot;satisfied with
the quality of health care for themselves and their families.&quot;

<P>
 What explains the mixed signals given by public opinion polls?
 While there is no crisis in access to health care, some health
care costs are soaring.  The goal of health care reform should
be to lower these costs, including and especially the costs for
the uninsured who receive medical care from emergency rooms. 
We will suggest below how such cost containment might be accomplished
without the radical bureaucratization of the Clinton-plan, which
judging from the history of government intervention in health
care and other areas, would lead to soaring rather than lower
costs.
<P>
<B>HEALTH CARE REFORM IN CALIFORNIA TODAY</B>
<P>
 In 1993 California enacted a form of managed competition, establishing
a Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperative (HIPC) to negotiate
with insurance companies on behalf of small businesses.  Businesses
with between five and 50 employees are allowed to join on a voluntary
basis.  In 1997 eligibility will increase to businesses with as
few as three employees. 
<P>
 California's HIPC provides a wide choice of plans to member businesses.
 Early results are encouraging: 32,587 Californians are already
enrolled.  Twenty-one percent of participating employers didn't
previously offer health insurance.  The rest are obtaining coverage
at a lower cost.
<P>
 HIPC does use a form of price control-no insurer may charge 20%
above the average premium-but since the plan is voluntary, businesses
and insurance companies can choose to leave HIPC if they find
a better option.  The system's weakness is that it does not sufficiently
address cost containment.  Included in the HIPC bill were provisions
reforming MediCal and malpractice insurance, but one of the major
causes of inflated medical costs, third party payment for health
care, is left unaddressed.  Still, HIPC provides a good foundation
for any further needed reform.
<P>
 Already the California legislature is considering such reform.
 For instance, Senator Bill Leonard introduced a bill last year
to create Medisave accounts.  It died in the Revenue and Taxation
Committee, but Leonard will submit a scaled back version of the
bill again this year as a pilot program for some state employees.
<P>
 One of the worst consequences of the Clinton health care plan
is that it would cut short the innovations in health care reform
now taking place in the 50 states.  Here in California, for instance,
it would eliminate the existing improvements brought by the HIPC
and force the creation of quasi-governmental bodies called &quot;Health
Alliances.&quot;
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: EMPOWERING A NEW BUREAUCRACY</B>
<P>
<B>An Overview</B>
<P>
 The Clinton administration's claim that its health care plan
will help control costs was dealt a major setback on February
8, when the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified
to Congress that the &quot;premiums&quot; to be paid by employers
under the Clinton plan are, indeed, a tax, and that the plan will
add $74 billion to the federal budget deficit, rather than reduce
it by $58 billion as the White House has claimed.
<P>
 At the top of the pyramid of the Clinton health care bureaucracy
would be the National Health Board (NHB), comprised of seven members
appointed by the President to four year terms.  Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala described the proposed NHB as
a &quot;relatively minor oversight group.&quot;  In truth, it
would establish &quot;global budgets&quot; and &quot;premium targets&quot;
for state governments as well as establish and oversee a package
of  benefits which insurance companies would be required to offer
and which consumers would be forced to buy.  The NHB would also
&quot;certify&quot; individual state compliance with their specifications.
<P>
 Consider just the establishing of &quot;global budgets&quot;
by this &quot;minor agency.&quot;  These budgets-a form of price
controls; they set an advance limit on total health care expenditures-are
meant to encourage savings through increased efficiency.  The
history of price controls, however, teaches us clearly that they
end in restricting supply.  In this case, restricted supply coupled
with increased demand for health care-universal coverage-will
inevitably lead to some form of health care rationing.  (Canada's
provinces all operate under global budgets.  As a result, Canadian
hospitals close beds for part of the year, limit the number of
operations performed, or use what are known as &quot;bed blockers&quot;less
costly patients occupying beds that could be used to serve those
with more costly diseases.  Thus the infamous months-long waiting
lists for major surgeries.  Needless to say, in Canada as in Europe,
politicians in need of surgery go directly to the head of the
line, while everyone else waits, often in severe pain.)
<P>
 The Clinton plan creates several new bureaucratic agencies in
addition to NHB, including (but not limited to) the following:
<P>
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR):  collects
and analyzes data from Patient Outcome Research Teams (PORTs),
which gather physician and hospital medical practice patterns.
<P>
Long-Term Care Insurance Advisory Council (LTCIAC): a five-member
board appointed by the secretary of Health and Human Services
to &quot;monitor the development of the insurance market.&quot;
<P>
National Health Advisory Committee (NHAC): advises the NHB and
is comprised of  &quot;representatives of states, health providers,
employers, consumers and affected industries.&quot;
<P>
National Health Data Advisory Council (NHDAC): &quot;oversees
the information and data activities, including standard setting
and privacy protection, of the federal government under health
care reform.&quot;
<P>
National Privacy Panel (NPP): ensures &quot;privacy protection
as applied to health information.&quot;
<P>
Premium Target Advisory Commission (PTAC): appointed by the NHB
to recommend adjustments to the methodology for calculating premium
targets.
<P>
Risk Adjustment Advisory Committee (RAAC): institutes the &quot;Risk
Adjustment System&quot; which will set &quot;premium payments
to health plans to reflect the level of risk assumed for patients
enrolled in comparison to the average population in the area.&quot;
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to creating new government agencies and expanding
duties of existing agencies such as the Departments of Labor and
Health and Human Services, the Clinton health care plan would
create programs to train physicians and to mandate what specialties
medical students will study-or whether they will study a specialty
at all-on the basis of &quot;national need.&quot;
<P>
<B>Health Alliances</B>
<P>
 The Clinton health care plan would operate on individual Americans
most directly through regional health alliances.  These alliances,
like the current HIPC in California, are non-profit bodies created
to negotiate with insurance companies on behalf of businesses.
The similarities, however, stop there.  For one thing, there is
nothing voluntary about participation.  Due to the so-called &quot;employer
mandate&quot; component of the plan, all businesses with under
5000 employees would be forced to buy their insurance through
their regional alliance. Each employer's &quot;premium&quot; would
be 80 percent of their employees' health insurance costs, although
no company would be obligated to pay more than 7.9 percent of
its payroll.  The Clinton plan currently offers federal subsidies
on a sliding scale to companies with fewer than 75 employees.
 For example, the smallest businesses will pay premiums of no
more than 3.5 percent of payroll, and others will be subsidized
at various rates up to 7.9 percent.  The Clinton administration
has proclaimed the exact amounts of the subsidies to be negotiable.
<P>
 Health alliances would have the sole power to determine which
health plans operate in their geographic area and to decide how
those plans are presented to the public, effectively limiting
choices and eliminating competitive advertising.  Alliances may
exclude a health plan for a number of reasons: for exceeding the
average premium by 20 percent, for failing to have the &quot;capacity
to deliver services,&quot; etc.  Obviously the government, not
the consumer, will decide these things.  (The Clintons maintain
against reason that health alliances aren't the government.  But
what else can one call not-for-profit agencies created by legislation
to carry out such functions?)
<P>
 Health alliances would also have the power of the purse, that
is, the power to levy taxes:  They would be authorized to assess
businesses and workers up to 2.5 percent of their insurance premiums
to provide for the alliance's &quot;administrative allowance,&quot;
plus up to 1.5 percent of premiums to fund federal academic health
centers and graduate medical educational programs.  And in order
to comply with the global budget set by the NHB, alliances are
authorized to impose fee schedules on doctor's services.
<P>
 At least one of the plans offered in each alliance must be a
fee-for-service plan, in which consumers pay directly for a doctor's
care.  But this plan would be subject to strict price controls,
and the absence of tax relief for such expenses would make it
untenable for all but the rich.  If an individual refuses to join
a plan from the health alliance, they may obtain other insurance,
but will be charged double the premium they would otherwise have
paid.
<P>
<B>Community Rating</B>
<P>
 The most egregious problem with the Clinton plan is what is known
as &quot;community rating.&quot;-a complicated way of saying that
everyone in a given alliance area is charged the same insurance
premium regardless of health risk or condition.  The top ten causes
of death in the United States are behavior-related; community
rating provides no incentives for people with unhealthy behavior
to change their ways.  And it would supersede a longstanding tradition
of fairness in the insurance industry which &quot;protects insured
persons from paying excessive amounts to subsidize high-risk policyholders
and groups.&quot;  One commentator has concluded that community
rating undermines the very idea of insurance:
<P>
Healthy people purchase health insurance because they fear the
possible financial consequences of illness.  People purchase health
insurance while they are well, so that they will have it when
they are ill.  However, if health insurance become available regardless
of health status, much of the incentive to pay for health insurance
while healthy will be removed.  For many people, it will be a
rational choice to do without health insurance until the need
arises.
<P>
 The Clinton plan's answer to this problem, of course, is to force
everyone to buy high-priced, standard-package benefits, thereby
subsidizing high risk patients in the same alliance region.
<P>
 Beginning in 1993, the State of New York has operated under community
rating.  As a result, the average price for commercial insurance
is up 18 percent, and has more than doubled for some New Yorkers.
 The table below dramatically demonstrates the economic effects
of community rating.

<B>The Divisive Politics of the Clinton Plan</B>
<P>
 Taken together, regional health alliances and community rating
are a recipe for political gerrymandering.  The Clinton plan tries
to account for this problem by mandating that &quot;the entire
portion of a metropolitan statistical area location in a state
shall be included in the same alliance area.&quot; But this will
not keep politicians from fighting and conniving to place their
constituents out of high health risk areas like San Francisco
or Los Angeles, or areas with acute illegal alien populations
such as San Diego, in order to get the lower community-rated premiums.
 
<P>
 As Elizabeth McCaughey has written,  &quot;Everyone will figure
out that you get more health care for your dollar or pay lower
premiums in an alliance without inner-city problems.  The plan
will bear an incentive for employers to abandon cities and relocate.&quot;
Real estate prices will be drastically affected by all this reshuffling,
as businesses and homeowners attempt to leave high risk alliance
regions.
<P>
<B>Impact on the California Economy</B>
<P>
 Most economic impact studies on the Clinton plan have had a national
focus, but one can extrapolate from them a dire prognosis for
California.  Lewin-VHI, a non-partisan research firm based in
Virginia, found that 67 percent of firms not now providing insurance
will be forced to pay at least $1,000 per year extra per employee,
and that half of all working-age households will pay more for
health care under the Clinton plan.  Professors June and David
O'Neill of Baruch College estimate that 3.1 million jobs will
be lost as a result of the employer mandate alone.  Seventy-five
percent of these jobs will be concentrated in service industries
such as restaurants and agriculture.
<P>
 The most prominent study to date examining the effect specifically
on California comes from the Legislative Analyst's Office.  It
estimates the Clinton plan might result in 75,000 lost jobs. 
At the same time it estimates an eventual annual savings to the
state of several hundred millions of dollars.  But most of this
savings comes from shifting the financial burden of health care
to the federal budget, and away from state and county budgets.
 That is, California's taxpayers will still foot the increased
bill for the Clinton plan through federal taxes.
<P>
 The estimated savings in the Legislative Analyst's study amount
to the federal government assuming the burden for some services,
while the estimated costs generally amount to new mandates on
the state government.  For example, the Clinton plan requires
that states share the costs of a new federal program for home
and community based long-term care.  The Analyst predicts a cost
of $200 million in 1996 and higher thereafter.  We must keep in
mind though that the federal government can easily unload its
funding responsibility for the plan onto the states at a future
date.  This occurred in the mid-1980s when federal &quot;Revenue
Sharing&quot; was the first item to get chopped when Congress
started cutting costs.
<P>
 The Clinton administration also plans to increase federal taxes
on cigarettes and alcohol, which the state already taxes, as a
way to help fund the plan.  The Legislative Analyst predicts the
new federal levies will reduce state revenue by $200 million.
<P>
 The Wilson administration is worried about several adverse effects
of the Clinton plan on the California economy.  First and foremost
is the devastating effect of the employer mandate on small businesses,
which account for 85 percent of California's new jobs.  A White
House official's recent response to an expression of concern about
California job loss was unsettling:  &quot;We haven't factored
that in at this point.&quot;
<P>
 A survey of the 48,000 California members of the National Federation
of Independent Business revealed that over 90% oppose the employer
mandate feature of the Clinton plan.  They do not believe that
the promised subsidies for the smallest businesses will work over
the long term.  Such subsidies will simply put more strain on
the federal government to provide something else for which it
doesn't have the means.  Moreover, the subsidies require new appropriations
each year, and can be easily reduced or eliminated by Congress
after the health care plan is entrenched, putting the burden on
the states, whose coffers are already depleted.
<P>
<B>The Death Knell of Federalism</B>
<P>
 Under the Clinton proposal, by January 1, 1997, California must
submit a report to the National Health Board detailing how it
intends to comply with the Clinton plan.  If any state resists,
the secretary of Health and Human Services has two options: she
may withhold federal funds for hospitals and other federally funded
programs in the state or, failing that, she may do what is &quot;necessary&quot;
to make sure that the &quot;comprehensive benefits package is
provided to eligible individuals in the state during the year.&quot;
 In lieu of state compliance, she may also assess yet another
tax on premiums-up to 15 percent-to offset administrative overhead
in setting up one or more regional alliances in a non-participating
state.
<P>
 If the Clinton plan becomes law, the only option available to
the states besides compliance is a state-instituted &quot;single-payer&quot;
system.  Thus Assembly Bill 16, authored by Assemblyman Burt Margolin,
and Senate Bill 1098, authored by Senator Art Torres, which would
implement a Clinton-type plan on the state level.  These Clinton
clones include state global budgets, a seven member California
Health Commission responsible for creating a standard benefits
package, and are written &quot;in anticipation of federal action.&quot;
<P>
 In short, the Clinton plan will effectively usurp the authority
of state governments over health care policy.  Constitutional
justifications for like infringements on state powers in recent
years have cited the power of Congress to regulate commerce, a
power originally meant to override interstate trade barriers.
 In <I>Wickard v. Filburn</I> in 1942, however, the Supreme Court
used the commerce clause to rule that a farmer growing wheat for
his own consumption had an effect on interstate commerce.  Therefore,
Congress was permitted to bar him from doing so.  David Rivkin
warns that the Clinton plan threatens to stretch the commerce
clause to dangerous new limits:
<P>
 If the courts uphold Congress's authority to impose this system,
they must once and for all draw the curtain on the Constitution
of 1787 and admit that there is nothing that Congress cannot do
under the Commerce Clause.... For example, if Congress thinks
Americans are too fat-many are-and that this somehow will affect
interstate commerce, can it not decree that Americans shall lose
weight?  Indeed, under the new system, any activity that might
increase the costs of health care might be regulatable.
<P>
<B>MARKET-ORIENTED REFORM ALTERNATIVES</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B>
<P>
 The largest health-care cost-containment problem comes from the
fact that most medical bills are paid by third parties.  This
reduces efficiency because patients do not feel they are spending
their own money.  J. Patrick Rooney, Chairman of  Golden Rule
Insurance, employs an analogy to demonstrate the point:
<P>
Imagine if employers provided &quot;grocery credit cards&quot;
as a fringe benefit the same way they now provide employee health
care.  It would pay 80 percent of an employee's food bill after
a $100 per year deductible, then, 100% after the first $5,000.
 If that were a fringe benefit like health care, grocery stores
would stack only the highest-price food because that is all that
employees would want to buy.... People spend their own money on
food.... Hence, grocery prices are not increasing in the range
of 15 to 20 percent per year the way health care spending has
been.
<P>
 The use of Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) can change this destructive
pattern. These are tax-free accounts, similar to IRAs.  Employers
would purchase high-deductible, lower-premium health insurance
policies, and put the difference in the MSA to cover the deductibles.
 Employees would contribute, for example, up to $3,000 a year
to cover routine medical expenses.  At the end of the year, money
not spent on health care can be taken out of the MSA (subject
to income taxes) or rolled over for medical expenses in the next
year.  Since Americans never spend on health care in a year what
they spend on health insurance, money will usually be left over
at the end of the year.
<P>
 As competition for the savings account money increases, prices
will fall, making health insurance affordable for more and more
businesses and individuals.
<P>
 Vouchers might be provided to the poor for MSAs instead of, or
in addition to, the MediCal coverage they now receive.  This would
have the immediate effect of allowing doctors to compete for MediCal
patients rather than struggling to avoid them, because they lose
so much money in treating them in the highly regulated MediCal
market.
<P>
 The main objection to MASs concerns the numbers.  The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that the difference between the premiums
of high-deductible policies is insufficient to cover the deductible
that must be paid in the event of a catastrophe.  However, in
any given year, it is likely that the deductible will go unused.
 In Los Angeles in 1992, for example, health care costs for 88
per cent of the population were below $3,000.  In Chicago and
Cincinnati the numbers were 90 and 92 percent respectively. Even
if the CBO's estimate is correct, then, the contributions of one
year could be rolled over into the second year. As a last resort,
more of the employees' wages can be placed in the account to cover
the deductible.  While  the employee would see less take home
pay, the money could be removed at the end of the year if there
was no medical emergency requiring deductible payment.
<P>
 Another objection to MSAs is that people won't go to the doctor
as often if they know they are spending their own money.  But
this is the real key to cost containment.  Someone must decide
to spend money on health care or on something else.  Advocates
of MSAs believe the individual should do so-not the government.
<P>
<B>Medicare/ Medical Reform</B>
<P>
 As shown at the outset of this report, Medicare and MediCal costs
have exploded over the last 15 years.  The surest solution to
this is to inject competition into the system. For instance, vouchers
could be issued to both Medicare and MediCal recipients by which
they could purchase a private insurance policy or start a medical
savings account.
<P>
<B>Medical Liability Reform</B>
<P>
 Malpractice insurance cost hospitals and doctors $10 billion
in 1991, and that cost is estimated to rise to $15 billion in
1998.  The costs of &quot;defensive medicine&quot;- doctors ordering
unnecessary tests to guard against lawsuits-was $27 billion in
1993.  In a recent study of lawsuits filed against hospitals and
doctors in New York, 80 percent were found to be without basis.
To curb this trend we might adopt the rule that the loser pays
all lawyers' fees, a practice most other countries in the world
employ to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Insurance Mandates</B>
<P>
 The number of state laws mandating that insurance companies include
certain benefits rose from 48 in 1974 to over 700 in 1991.  These
mandates raise the prices of minimum benefits and make insurance
too costly for people with the lowest incomes-thus increasing
the number of uninsured.  This could be solved by offering a &quot;no
frills&quot; package of benefits to the public, absent the expensive
mandates.
<P>
<B>Occupational Licensing</B>
<P>
 By restricting entry into the medical profession, licensing laws
have increased the price of medical services.  While needed to
protect the consumer, these laws can be amended to increase efficiency.
 For instance, hospitals might be given more leeway in licensing
personnel for routine services.
<P>
<B>CONGRESSIONAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE CLINTON PLAN</B>
<P>
<B>The Chafee Plan:</B>
<P>
 Senator John Chafee's proposal has the essential structure of
the Clinton plan, but injects some competition into the formula.
 It would eliminate the employer mandate and avoids spending caps
and global budgeting.  States would be required to set up purchasing
cooperatives similar to health alliances, but more than one would
be allowed in a given geographic area.  A national commission
would establish a minimum benefits package.
<P>
 Under the Chafee proposal, health plans &quot;may not discriminate
on the basis of  health status.&quot;  This amounts to community
rating and all the problems that entails.  Chafee would create
MSAs, but they are not central to the plan.  The main problem
with the Chafee plan is the potential for expansion.  Hillary
Clinton herself has said that the Chafee plan is a good first
step, since much of the structure (National Health Board, standard
benefits package, community rating) is already in the bill and
may be easily expanded later.
<P>
<B>The Cooper Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Congressman Jim Cooper's proposal has much in common with both
Clinton and Chafee.  It eliminates the employer mandate, but a
national commission would establish a minimum benefits package
and premiums offered by the cooperatives will be community rated.
 The Cooper plan has been supported by some business groups, most
notably the Business Roundtable.  But it contains provisions that
impose significant costs and constraints on business, and which
can be easily expanded once the program is in place. William Kristol
has pointed out that through changes in the tax code in the Cooper
plan, &quot;businesses that today offer their employees generous
health plans would effectively be forced either to accept the
government's more austere benefit limits or face stiff economic
penalties.&quot;
<P>
 Another onerous provision of the Cooper bill  requires all business
firms with fewer than 100 employees (about 93% of all businesses)
to register with regional Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives,
forward information about all their full- and part-time employees,
and deduct from all paychecks the cost of health care premiums-whether
or not the firms were providing health care coverage.  The Cooper
plan doesn't include MSAs.  Like Clinton, its implementation would
require a massive tax hike.
<P>
<B>The Nickles Plan</B> 
<P>
 Senator Don Nickles' proposal is modeled on the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, which serves 10 million federal workers,
and gives its members a choice of nearly 30 plans with a variety
of benefits and prices.
<P>
 Nickles calls his bill &quot;The Consumer Choice Health Security
Act.&quot;  It would outlaw exclusions for pre-existing conditions,
cap medical malpractice awards, and require only that Americans
buy catastrophic health insurance.  A potential drawback is that
&quot;underwriting&quot; would not be allowed beyond age, sex,
and geography, a restriction that is only slightly better than
a full community rating.  But insurance companies would be allowed
to give incentive discounts to promote healthy behavior.
<P>
 The focal point of the Nickles MSAs, into which participants
could put up to $3,000 per year plus $500 for every dependent,
tax-free.  Tax credits would be offered to the poor to purchase
their own MSAs.
<P>
<B>The Gramm Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Senator Phil Gramm's proposal differs little from Nickles.  It
would institute medical savings accounts and leave most choices
up to the health care consumer.  Unlike Nickles, Gramm does not
require individuals to buy catastrophic insurance; rather it institutes
a wage garnishing mechanism to punish those who abuse the system.
 The Gramm plan has no community rating, though it does offer
some relief for individuals with pre-existing conditions.  And
it would require that losers pay winners' fees in malpractice
cases.   
<P>
 All of the these congressional alternatives offer cuts in Medicare
and Medicaid, as well as malpractice reform.  A final bill will
likely have these included.
<P>
 From California's perspective, any one of these plans would be
preferable to Clinton, since all avoid the job-killing employer
mandate.  Only Nickles and Gramm, however, avoid the other major
problems of the Clinton plan, and clearly address the cost-containment
obstacle of third-party payment.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
  No one believes that the revolutionary Clinton health care plan
will pass without being &quot;melded&quot; to Cooper or some version
of Chafee-Cooper.  It is unlikely any of the plans can pass in
the Senate without some Republican votes or in the House without
moderate Democrats.  The key question is this:  Will Republicans
and moderate Democrats hold out for a genuine alternative that
avoids a federal takeover of the health care industry and massive
new taxes to finance it?
<P>
 The answer may depend on how coherent the Republicans' alternative
plan is, and how persuasive Senators Dole, Nickles, Gramm and
other Republicans can be in taking it to the nation.
<P>
 Rejecting the &quot;crisis&quot; atmosphere fostered by the Clinton
propaganda machine is the first step in resisting the Clinton-Cooper
juggernaut.  The second step is an insistence on honest numbers
and truth-in-packaging.  The third step is to show courage in
resisting and rebutting the White House demagoguery against the
health care industry.  If these steps are taken, it will be possible
to gain widespread public support for an alternative plan that
provides practical remedies to real problems.
<P>
 Some health care reform-changing the federal tax code to allow
for medical savings accounts and Medicare reform, for example-must
be done in Washington.  But aside from these federal actions,
health care reform should be left to the states.  The best strategy
is to support market-oriented plans at the federal level that
won't encroach on the right of California and other states to
implement their own modifications in the future.  The Clinton
plan closes the door not only to consumer choice but to California's
policy options as well.

<B>The California Teachers Association:</B>
<P>
<B>Power Politics vs. Education Reform</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
Editor's Note
<P>
<I> This is the first in a series of reports on the California
Teachers Association and its role in the California public policy
arena. It sketches the outlines of a large and energetic organization,
and lays the groundwork for future reports on the CTA's pervasive
impact on California's educational system.</I>
<P>
<I> We will try to shed light on the CTA's record of opposition
to meaningful education reform-from alternative certification
and merit pay to charter schools, parental choice, and district
decentralization. We will explore its operations at the local
level-its collective bargaining strategies, its  relationships
with local school boards and superintendents, its role in the
fiscal mismanagement of local school districts, and its efforts
to obstruct charter schools. We will also spotlight CTA's not
negligible contribution to the state's budget and fiscal crisis
through Proposition 98 and other political stratagems. (Be forewarned:
the CTA is considering a &quot;Super-Prop. 98&quot;  initiative
measure that &quot;closes the loopholes&quot; and guarantees the
schools an even bigger slice of state outlays. It could be called
the Kevorkian Amendment: assisted suicide for the state budget.)</I>
<P>
<I> It is not accurate or fair to blame all of the state's education
woes on the teachers' union. Others have contributed and deserve
recognition. Some big city school boards (like Los Angeles Unified)
have failed at both management and leadership: those mammoth districts
need to be broken up.  The educational media have not been the
most vigilant watchdogs of the public interest in covering educational
matters: reporters' attention span is short and they often behave
like PR flaks for the education industry. What the PTA-or the
PTSA-stands for is hard to discern, but it is not parent empowerment.</I>
<P>
<I> Yet by far the most disappointing performance has been that
of the business community. With a few notable exceptions, business
leaders are surprisingly naive in dealing with educational matters.
Always seeking a safe &quot;middle road,&quot;  they're easily
coaxed  into supporting incremental add-ons and enhancements,
particularly if the new funds are targeted on &quot;at-risk&quot;
kids. (We should ask why the definition and number of &quot;at
risk&quot; students keep growing, and whether rewarding schools
with more money for finding more children &quot;at risk&quot;
is a good idea. In the business world, if you subsidize something,
you tend to get more of it. Is there any reason to expect anything
different in education?) The result is that nothing much changes
in public education except the price tag. Our schools aren't any
better than a decade ago, they just cost more.</I>
<P>
<I> Who is responsible for this state of affairs? California legislators,
State Board of Education members, the state school chief, elected
school board officials- are all accountable to the public, however
imperfectly. What about the CTA?  The CTA  is accountable only
to its members-which is fine; it is a private organization. The
problem arises when it claims to speak not for its members' interests
but</I><B> <I>for our children's future</I></B><I>. The point
was perfectly illustrated by American Federation of Teachers president
Albert Shanker's quip, &quot;I'll start representing kids when
kids start paying union dues.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I> The CTA can't have it both ways. If the level of  teachers'
salaries and benefits were the measure of school quality, California
would have the 7th best schools in the nation. Our public schools
rank 29th in math proficiency, 42nd in high school graduation
rates, and near the top only in one category-public disaffection.</I>
<P>
<I> It's time for our public officials to look beyond the familiar
rhetoric of &quot;more is better.&quot; More centralization is
not better. More categorical aid is not better. More strikes are
not better. More school district bankruptcies are not better.
More state debt is not better.  The only way to foster the needed
economies, innovation, and accountability is through a new kind
of thinking. Instead of trying to &quot;reinvent&quot; schools
from the top down, why not a revolution <B>from the bottom up-</B>through
radical decentralization, expanded charter schools and charter
districts, alternative certification of teachers,  and parental
choice? Such actions would set in motion a new dynamic:  local
communities could redesign their own schools without permission
from bureaucrats.</I>
<P>
<I> </I>
<P>
<I> The CTA stands across the path to such innovation, saying,
&quot;Over my dead body!&quot; Born of the struggles of the 70s,
it fears change in the 90s, and it means to fight any threat to
its financial empire. But it cannot hold back the tide of change
forever. Parents will continue to flee government schools in search
of a better education for their children, especially in the inner
cities. Creative teachers and talented principals increasingly
will seek out charter schools and other escape hatches. And savvy
politicians will learn that the empowerment strategy pays dividends
for everyone.</I>
<P>
<I> The task of bringing fundamental change to public education
in California will require more than summits and public relations
wizardry. The good news is-it doesn't require more money. What
it does require is more leadership.     </I>

    &quot;Follow the money.&quot;
<P>
    - Deep Throat in <I>All the President's Men</I>
<P>
 The California Teachers Association (CTA) operates what most
observers consider the best organized and most effective political
machine in the state.  Affiliated with the National Education
Association (NEA), the CTA's influence on California government
is unmatched by any business or trade group. Its political clout
is envied by other special interest lobbies.  It wages ferocious
political battle when its vital interests are at stake-which is
to say, its economic interests. 
<P>
 CTA represents teachers in over 950 of the state's 1,006 public
school districts, at most community colleges, and in the 19-campus
California State University system.  CTA's 235,000 membership
includes 186,600 full-time teachers and 39,900 associate members.
 Another 8,500 non-members are required to pay &quot;representation&quot;
fees to CTA for contract negotiations and collective bargaining.
<P>
 CTA's affluence (and influence) arises mainly from its large
membership and regular source of income, consisting of mandatory
teachers' dues.  With membership of more than 235,000, its annual
budget approaches $74 million.  A CTA member pays $600 per year-$200
more than the national average-with the NEA netting $99, CTA $376,
and local chapters $125.  (A chapter is defined as a local unit
of self-governance, chartered through CTA and affiliated with
NEA.)
<P>
 More than a third of all school districts-and all major districts-operate
as agency shops, thus forcing non-union teachers to pay the CTA
for collective bargaining expenses (although not for political
activities, under current law).  As of September 1991, 357 of
the approximately 900 CTA-chartered locals operated under agency
shop rules.   
<P>
 In a &quot;fair share&quot; agreement, a teacher with religious-
or philosophically-based objections against CTA membership must
contribute the equivalent dues amount to a CTA-approved charity.
In 1993-94 the 8,500 non-union members will pay $2,350,000-or
3.6 percent-of CTA's current budget.
<P>
 The amount of such &quot;representation fees&quot; is determined
by the union, unless challenged in court by an individual teacher.
 According to the Public Employees Relation Board (PERB), CTA
set its representation fees for the 1991/92 school year at 81.5%,
or about $300.  For 1993/94, the CTA adjusted the amount downward
to just over three-quarters of its spending.  In other words,
the CTA claims (under oath) that it uses 76.1% of all revenues
for negotiating collective bargaining agreements.  
<P>
 The CTA also imposes special levies on its members.  A recent
levy will generate over $12 million over three years, with funds
going to pay costs of defeating Proposition 174, the voucher initiative.
 Another levy instituted in 1990 yielded over $2 million for a
television campaign to protect Proposition 98-the 1988 Constitutional
Amendment guaranteeing a minimum funding level for public education.
<P>
 The CTA's clout is due not only to its financial resources but
to its vast membership, which can be mobilized in every state
legislative district down to the precinct level.  It has become
adept at guerrilla warfare as well, as seen in efforts to obstruct
and sabotage signature gathering to get Proposition 174 on the
ballot.
<P>
 A discussion of the emergence of public sector unions is beyond
the scope of this paper. But it is important to understand that
the emergence of teachers' unions is part of a larger phenomenon,
the rise of public sector unions in state and local government.
Secondly, it is important to note that this rise has been simultaneous
with the <I>decline</I> of unionization in the private sector
since 1960. Public sector unions have inherited all the folklore
and political mythology of traditional unions, but they are in
fact far more powerful than their private sector counterparts
ever were. The reason for this is essentially the absence of any
external market constraints on the demands public sector unions
can make: the only constraints are political, not economic. Thus,
when politics becomes the handmaiden of  politicized unions, and
politicians are so tied to them that they fail to balance competing
interests, public policy and the public interest are the victims.
<P>
 That the self-interest of its members is the touchstone of CTA
policy is made clear by the CTA mission statement, in case anyone
had any doubts.  According to the CTA's &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives: 1992-94,&quot; its central mission is threefold:
 &quot;To protect and promote the well-being of its members; to
advance the cause of free, universal, and quality public education;
and to contribute to the establishment of a more just, equitable
and democratic society.&quot;
<P>
That the interests of its members come first in this trilogy is
not news, but it is good to keep it in mind when listening to
CTA rhetoric about the needs of children. And, of course, &quot;free,
universal ...education&quot; will be pursued all the more energetically
if the union is in the politically protected position of being
the sole provider of this &quot;quality&quot; education. The document
then lists 11 institutional goals for 1992-94 in order to pursue
CTA's mission:
<P>

<CENTER>

<P>
CTA ASCENDANCY
<P>
 In the 1960s, certified teachers and classified school employees
(e.g., &quot;clerical&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot; workers)
were represented by employee organizations within school districts.
 These organizations were limited to representing their members
only, and could meet and confer over a school board's policies
of employment without negotiating a binding contract.
<P>
 CTA rewrote its constitution in the early 1970s to exclude administrators
as members and became more involved in collective bargaining for
its teacher members.  In 1975, Senate Bill 160 (Rhodda) and the
Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) were signed by Governor
Jerry Brown.  The Rhodda Act required school districts to recognize
elected unions as the sole bargaining agents and to negotiate
binding contracts with them.  Under the EERA, a union could become
the exclusive representative either in certification by the Public
Employee Relations Board (PERB) or by voluntary employer recognition.

<P>
 Many of the pre-existing certified teachers and classified school
employees' organizations established in the 1960s and early 1970s
remained largely unaffected by the EERA's new collective bargaining
system.  That was the case until 1982, when Governor Edmund G.
&quot;Jerry&quot; Brown granted forced dues privileges to state
employee unions, including teacher unions.  And in 1983, automatic
deduction of non-member &quot;agency&quot; fees became negotiable
for teachers unions.  
<P>
 In 1978, the struggle over collective bargaining rights was eclipsed
by Proposition 13, which slashed property taxes-the major source
of school funding.  At that time CTA's political action committee
and fragmented state organization was ineffective against the
initiative's juggernaut.  CTA President Ed Foglia explained: &quot;We
came to understand that politics is not just a publicity campaign.
 Politics is door-to-door-the kinds of things that you have to
do in order to win elections.&quot;
<P>
 Subsequently, Foglia helped develop a &quot;Blueprint for Political
Action,&quot; which is CTA's centralized system of data retrieval,
voter registration, absentee canvassing and extensive member education.
 This fostered a consolidation and integration of CTA's campaign
apparatus and statewide lobbying infrastructure.  
<P>
 In 1983 Alice Huffman, a close ally of Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, was hired as a lobbyist for CTA.  The following year she
was promoted to director of government relations, and soon after
CTA's political action committee was making the top ten lists
of state campaign donors.  Huffman's major accomplishment was
to help CTA better mobilize its economic resources and &quot;people
power&quot; in shaping public policy.  As Huffman points out,
she &quot;politicized&quot; CTA, overseeing the fine tuning of
a sophisticated grass-roots operation in which a chapter can,
on short notice, mobilize the people-power to man phone banks,
 walk precincts, or host media events.  Says Huffman, &quot;I
had to teach them that they [CTA] could do the right thing and
be successful.&quot;
<P>
CTA OPERATIONS
<P>
 Registered with the IRS as a 501(c)(5) non-profit labor organization,
CTA is exempt from property taxes. It receives tax deductible
contributions as well as government grants for educational research.
 With headquarters in  Burlingame, the thirty-one CTA offices
from San Diego to Eureka occupy 204,100 square feet of office
space.  
<P>
 CTA has approximately 480 full-time employees on its payroll,
nearly half the number employed by the state Department of Education
to direct the entire statewide education bureaucracy.  Included
in the CTA total are 21 managers and assistant managers, who are
paid an average of $110,000 per year (excluding benefits, which
are generous) to oversee CTA's 17 departments. These include Governance,
Governmental Relations,  Association for Better Citizenship (CTA/ABC
- CTA's political action committee), Group Legal Services, and
Training and Bargaining Services.  Three other departments-Communications,
Human Rights, and Instruction &amp; Professional Development-work
together to make up the Information and Development Division,
under the supervision of the associate executive director.  
<P>
GOVERNANCE
<P>
 There are two categories to CTA Governance: policy making and
policy implementation.  Policy making occurs at both the state
and chapter levels.  Smaller chapters hold regular meetings to
adopt policies and determine program direction, while larger chapters
delegate policy authority to an elected body, called the State
Council of Education. 
<P>
 The State Council is a 660-plus member representative body which
serves as the legislative and policy-making arm for the membership.
 Representatives are elected from among the state's rank-and-file
teachers.  The ratio of  representation is 1:350 members, so small
chapters share Council delegates while large chapters have more
than one.  The State Council has thirteen standing committees
that assist in developing recommendations to implement CTA policy.
 Policies are approved by a simple majority voice vote of Council
delegates.
<P>
 Among other duties, the Council approves the increasingly frequent
special levies, which is used to fund CTA's political action and
advertising efforts. Recently, the Council was asked to approve
a $6 dues increase, designed to raise an additional $1,000,000
annually,  &quot;for future political struggles,&quot; including
a possible 1996 initiative campaign for a successor to Proposition
98.  The Council is expected to approve the dues hike at its June
1994 meeting. This new levy would come on top of the $19 annual
surcharge approved in 1993 to fund the campaign against Proposition
174. A prior surcharge of  $12 in 1991 raised $2.4 million for
the advertising blitz that helped derail Governor Wilson's effort
to suspend the provisions of Proposition 98.
<P>
 
<P>
 Policy implementation is the responsibility of CTA's executive
body.  It has a 24-member Board of Directors (or Executive Committee),
three executive officers, 16 directors from various geographical
districts, an Executive Director, two Minority Directors-at-large,
and one NEA Director.  The board creates its own committees or
task forces to assist it in implementing policy.  Altogether,
these special committees and CTA leadership constitute the &quot;action
arm&quot; of CTA.
<P>
 The three executive officers-President, Vice President, and Secretary/
Treasurer-are elected by the State Council to a maximum of two
2-year terms.  The President serves as CTA's main executive officer
and official spokesman on policy matters.
<P>
LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY / REGIONAL SERVICES
<P>
 For administrative and organizational purposes, CTA divides its
statewide operations into four geographical regions.  Most CTA
programs and services to chapters are provided and coordinated
through an integrated system of offices and staff throughout each
region.  These regions, in turn, are divided into Directorial
Districts A through P, each producing one elected director on
the Board of Directors.
<P>
 CTA regional offices were established in 1971.  Regional Services
assists with chapter organization, trains chapter leadership,
and develops communication systems among members, local leaders,
and the community (e.g., phone trees, drop systems, local Association
Newspaper, Media Relations).  This department also helps chapters
with collective bargaining negotiations, contract monitoring,
membership recruitment, Group Legal Services, and political action.
 Hence Regional Services is part of the action arm of CTA in implementing
the association's policies.
<P>
 Included in Local Service Delivery are the 24 Service Center
Councils, a network of chapter presidents and State Council representatives
who inform membership of actions under consideration by the State
Council and Board and coordinate membership participation in regional
CTA activities (i.e. political activities and CTA/NEA representative
elections).  More importantly, this department develops regional
strategic action plans to organize regional membership for political
action.  This grass-roots corps is the fountainhead of CTA's political
activities. 
<P>
 With 159 full-time employees in the four Regions, Local Service
Delivery's share of CTA's  1993-94 budget is 41.5% or $30,040,556.
 This large allocation suggests that Local Service Delivery plays
a vital role in implementing and coordinating CTA policy.
<P>
GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS &AMP; CTA/ABC-PAC
<P>
 The Governmental Relations Department seeks to attain CTA's political
objectives and serves as liaison to government and private agencies.
 Alice Huffman, who heads this department, explains: &quot;The
job of this department...is to help CTA implement through legislation
and political action the goals set by CTA members and enunciated
by the State Council of Education, the Board of Directors, and
the elected officers.&quot;  This involves aggressive lobbying
and massive political expenditures.  The department oversees membership
political activity and regularly organizes rank-and-file teachers
to flock to Sacramento to &quot;inform&quot; legislators on issues
of concern to CTA
<P>
 CTA/ABC (Association for Better Citizenship) provides campaign
contributions to CTA-endorsed candidates for local and state offices,
coordinates and directs membership involvement in political campaigns,
offers political action training, maintains a membership database,
and conducts member and public opinion polls to support the CTA's
political agenda.  Since 1985, CTA's PAC consistently has ranked
among the top five contributors to state legislative campaigns,
according to California Common Cause. It ranked number one in
1989-90.  In the past eight years the  CTA PAC  has given out
nearly $3.2 million in legislative campaign contributions.
<P>
 CTA claims to be non-partisan, but of the nearly $1 million it
donated to legislative campaigns in 1991-92,  91% or $903,352
was doled out to Democrats with an astounding 81% win rate.  Just
9% ($89,343) was donated to Republican candidates, and of this
small amount only $7,500 was contributed <I>after</I> the 1992
June primaries. This means that  80% of the amount given to Republicans
was given to spend against other Republicans.  Less than 1% of
CTA's $992,695 PAC money was contributed to Republicans to use
against Democrats.  
<P>
 With this record in mind it is curious to note that, according
to the co-directors of NEA's &quot;Republican Educators Caucus,&quot;
42.8% of CTA's membership are registered Republicans, including
CTA President Del Weber.
<P>
 CTA has a second political action committee, devoted solely to
ballot measures and non-candidate campaign expenditures.  Since
1985, this CTA Issues PAC has forked over more than $10 million
to support or oppose various initiatives. This total includes
expenditures to pass Proposition 98, but also includes hundreds
of thousands of dollars spent on measures completely unrelated
to education.  For example, in 1992 CTA spent almost $300,000
on behalf of failed Proposition 167, which would have raised taxes
on California businesses.  CTA has also expended funds to oppose
term limits ( Prop. 140) and prison inmate labor (Prop. 139),
to influence reapportionment (Props. 39, 118 and 119), and to
support Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird and Big Green (Prop. 130).
<P>
 CTA's success rate in political endorsements is impressive. In
November 1992, 99 of the 119 CTA-endorsed state and federal candidates
were elected-a whopping 83% win rate.  Of CTA contributions made
toward 181 local school board races and issues, CTA Secretary/Treasurer
Lois Tinson claims a 70% win rate.
<P>
 It is noteworthy that CTA dedicates at least 25% of its political
action money to local school board elections and requests that
local chapters' political action committees match these donations.
 Thus, while CTA/ABC  handed out over $1 million to state candidates
during 1991/92, it also gave over $300,000 to local candidates.
<P>
 School boards are considered the &quot;employer&quot; in collective
bargaining agreements (which set salaries, benefits, and other
working conditions), while the CTA is the bargaining agent. School
boards often give in to union demands for politically expedient
reasons.  This observation is underscored by the Little Hoover
Commission's study, &quot;Costs and Casualties of K-12 Education
in California&quot;:
<P>
The fact that school board members receive monetary contributions
from teachers' unions does...make for the appearance of a relationship
between unions and school boards and, at the very least, can contribute
to diminished public confidence in the board's independence.
<P>
 The Little Hoover Commission's study determined that this intermixing
of school board and union interests fosters a negative financial
impact on school districts and even the state budget:
<P>
Thus many of the agreements reached through collective bargaining
are not based on the long-term interests of the district and the
financial condition of the State...[such] decisions are not based
on the soundest of fiscal considerations [but] are arrived at
nevertheless because of political pressures.
<P>
 Such political pressures include the threat or execution of teacher
strikes, which force school boards to agree to unsound fiscal
policies regardless of the district's or State's financial condition.
 Indeed, teachers' salaries and benefits gobble up at least 83%
of the State's General Fund expenditures, reducing budgets for
textbooks, library books, maintenance, and other needs vital to
learning.  In 1991-92, a mere 3.87% of the school expenditures
went for vital learning materials like textbooks, computers, and
classroom supplies.  Moreover, during fiscal year 1991-92,  529
school districts-over half-ran budget deficits and four were so
miserably managed that they became wards of the state.
<P>
 In addition to its direct campaign contributions to causes and
candidates, CTA has spent millions on lobbying and other political
expenses.  According to California Common Cause, the CTA ranked
number one in political expenditures during the 1991-92 political
cycle, far outdistancing other moneyed interests such as the California
Medical Association, California Trial Lawyers Association, and
the Association of California Insurance Companies.  In fact, of
the $7.4 million that CTA spent on political purposes during 1991-92,
$3.9 million went for lobbying in Sacramento, making it the biggest
spending political lobby during the two-year session.  Moreover,
CTA's &quot;soft&quot; spending to run its political apparatus
handily doubles its total political expenditures.
<P>
 Perhaps more important than raw dollars spent on campaigns is
the extent of the grassroots political activism under the direct
control of the CTA.  CTA's Governmental Relations Department annually
holds a Political Action Institute in the first week of August,
designed to train teachers and local chapter leaders in effective
grass-roots politics.  Recently, the CTA claimed that more than
1,000 teachers received intensive training in political activism
to fight against Proposition 174, through the Institute and at
a Chapter President's Conference.
<P>
 Furthermore, a special department program of CTA/ABC, the Master
Plan for Political Action, actively promotes political involvement.
 The Master Plan provides workshops on political activism, internal
polling of members' political attitudes and participation in state
political parties, and instructional materials such as a political
action handbook. It  maintains a Political Action Database for
use in contacting and mobilizing members on political issues,
and hires outside political consultants.  Specific political contributions
and expenditures are recommended to the Board of Directors by
the CTA/ABC Committee to support the Master Plan.
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS
<P>
 The Communications Department's threefold task is public relations,
internal communications, and membership promotion. The department's
seven professionals and four full-time support staff issue numerous
publications, including tabloids, leadership newsletters, news
releases, feature and op-ed pieces, letters to the editor, and
the CTA Briefing Memo (directed to media professionals).  Its
primary aim is to boost CTA's public image and advance its political
agenda. The department coordinates the annual John Swett Awards,
given to newspapers, radio and television stations, and individual
journalists for what the CTA considers exemplary coverage of education
issues. 
<P>
HUMAN RIGHTS
<P>
 &quot;Members can call upon Human Rights,&quot; explains Department
Manager Dolores Heisinger, &quot;for assistance in racial-ethnic
minority group concerns, equal rights for women, teacher/student
rights, affirmative action, sex equity issues, discrimination,
academic freedom, far right attacks, segregation and integration,
violence in the schools, comparable worth, and peace and international
relations.&quot;  With just six employees and only 1.2% of CTA's
budget, this department focuses on minority leadership development,
women's leadership training and, in its words, &quot;far right
awareness.&quot;
<P>
 In a 1984 CTA pamphlet entitled &quot;Guidelines for Academic
Freedom in the Public Schools,&quot; the CTA Tenure and Academic
Freedom Committee expressed opposition to the &quot;New Right&quot;
as follows: &quot;Who dare take on religion, free enterprise,
patriotism, and motherhood?  We do, and we must!&quot;  When this
extreme statement is compared with the recent CTA-sponsored workshop,
&quot;Extremist Attacks on Academic Freedom,&quot; held at Madera
High School in February 1993, it appears to accurately encapsulate
CTA policy.  
<P>
 In the workshop booklet, CTA defines extreme groups and individuals
as those &quot;who attempt to set moral judgments for everyone,&quot;
and proceeds to list six &quot;far right&quot; organizations active
in California.  They are: Citizens for Excellence in Education,
American Family Association, Traditional Values Coalition, Concerned
Women For America, American Coalition For Traditional Values,
and Focus On The Family.  CTA claims that the policies of such
&quot;far right&quot; groups &quot;are detrimental to public education&quot;
and urges all CTA chapters to &quot;actively oppose&quot; them.
<P>
 Since CTA is an NEA affiliate, it is bound to support NEA resolutions
and policies and affirms this in its &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives, 1992-94&quot; (see page 5 above). In the
arena of human rights, the NEA, and by extension the CTA, supports
affirmative action quotas, gay and lesbian rights, the dispensing
of condoms in public schools, abortion-on-demand, in-school care
for teen-age parents, a nuclear freeze, drafting women in the
military, gun control, socialized medicine, and statehood for
Washington DC. None of these policies have ever been submitted
to rank and file CTA members for their vote.  CTA by-laws do not
require it.
<P>
INSTRUCTION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (IPD)
<P>
 The goal of IPD, according to department manager Deborah Edginton,
is  to &quot;make the classroom work of our members both easier
and more productive.&quot;  IPD serves as CTA's liaison to dozens
of government agencies and private organizations, and thus provides
the basis of CTA's educational image. It spends only 1.4% of the
CTA budget on these instructional activities. 
<P>
 IPD sponsors numerous workshops and conferences to inform teachers
of their union rights, and synthesizes and disseminates information
that promotes the teaching profession.  IPD conducts research,
publishes studies on educational issues, provides research information
for other CTA departments, and works with a number of private
sector foundations providing funding for educational projects.
 
<P>
 As a non-profit labor organization, CTA is eligible for government
grants and tax deductible private donations. Thus IPD taps into
outside sources of revenue to finance its research.
<P>
 IPD staff works with three State Council committees, including
Curriculum and Instruction, Credentials and Professional Development,
and the Special Education Coordinating Committee. IPD has forged
a close relationship with colleges and universities to coordinate
and promote interaction between education departments and K-12
teachers on mutually beneficial projects.
<P>
GROUP LEGAL SERVICES 
<P>
 Providing free legal protection to CTA members and chapters,
Group Legal Services produces publications, conferences and workshops
on legal issues such as fair share, assists in agency fee reporting
and record keeping obligations, and maintains a comprehensive
labor-law library.  It fights teachers' lay-off notices, strengthens
probationary teachers' rights, comparable worth salary placement,
and defends CTA's right to strike.  At last count Legal Services
employed at least six attorneys and ten support staff in its Burlingame
and Los Angeles offices.
<P>
TRAINING AND BARGAINING SERVICES (TBS)
<P>
 Each summer CTA holds a Negotiations Finance Institute that has
trained thousands of contract negotiators.  Dick Odgers, Manager
of TBS,  explains, &quot;We've developed a Collective Bargaining
Reference Manual that serves as a guide for contract negotiations
around the state, and we were involved in the development of the
new State Budget forms which are in effect in 240 districts this
year [1991], all districts next year.  And we've developed training
for staff and chapters to help them understand these new forms.&quot;
<P>
 TBS maintains a Contract Master Index and Microfiche File to
provide chapters and negotiation teams with comprehensive contract
information.  Additionally, TBS furnishes ready access to California's
state budget, and often makes such information available to CTA
negotiators before it is available to school districts.
<P>
 CTA has developed a &quot;master agreement,&quot; containing
what are thought to be the best features of  all local agreements.
This functions as a template for local chapters to use in their
collective bargaining. Presumably, the CTA updates this template
each time new agreements are reached with desirable new features;
it is then redistributed to local chapters. Some of the features
of this master agreement will be examined in a future paper.
<P>
<B>SERVICE DEPARTMENTS</B>
<P>
 Service departments, operating from the Burlingame headquarters,
assist all other CTA departments.  They include the usual business
functions:  Accounting, Central Services, Data Processing, Governance
Support, Human Resources, and Management.
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to these traditional service departments there is
a budget category, &quot;Other Expenditures,&quot; which finances
the purchase of property, equipment, and computers. It also includes
three not-so-traditional funds-the Crisis Assistance Fund, Media
Advertising Fund, and the Voucher/Choice Fund.
<P>
 <B>The Crisis Assistance Fund </B> provides money to chapters
undergoing negotiations or &quot;representation&quot; problems.
 This fund provides interest free loans of $70.00 per day to CTA
members on a chapter sanctioned strike of five days or more. 
It also enforces CTA's &quot;Brezhnev&quot; doctrine of exclusive
bargaining representation for all CTA chartered locals. Should
a chapter opt for alternative representation in collective bargaining,
CTA would disqualify the chapter and its membership and use its
Legal Services department to maintain CTA control.  Conversely,
CTA provides &quot;crisis assistance&quot; to CTA chapters not
certified as sole bargaining representatives in order to achieve
this coveted status.  Hence the purpose of this special fund is
to consolidate and expand CTA's control-and prevent defections.
<P>
 <B>The Media Advertising Fund </B> is financed by a dues increase
of $12 approved by the State Council of Education in March 1990.
 Its purpose is to sponsor annual television &quot;blitzes&quot;
promoting public education or CTA and place advertisements and
commentaries in the print media.  In 1991 this fund financed a
television commercial telling Governor Wilson, &quot;Don't Suspend
Proposition 98,&quot; which is generally credited with turning
public sentiment against Wilson's proposal.
<P>
<B>The Voucher/Choice Fund</B> consists of income generated by
a $19 dues increase for a period of three years, beginning in
1992-93.  It will generate over $12 million of the approximately
$13 million that CTA spent in its fall 1993 campaign against Prop.
174.
<P>
<B>THE CTA AND THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION REFORM </B>
<P>
 Despite its record of political success and legislative clout,
CTA is not satisfied. We learn from CTA President Del Weber that
CTA's mission to promote &quot;the well-being of its members&quot;
is failing: &quot;California's teachers work under grueling conditions,
with little support, a lack of funding and too many students in
their classrooms.&quot; Weber has hinted  at the CTA's future
strategy: &quot;Several circles within this organization...are
discussing that CTA might have to carry a future initiative for
school funding. The one we have is not working.&quot;  According
to Weber, the guaranteed minimum funding level under Proposition
98 is too easily evaded. (Proposition 98 was amended by Proposition
111, which effectively reduces the original 40% to about 33%.)
<P>
 Teachers' pay and benefits absorb about 80% of classroom funds
but only 51% of total funds spent at the district and county levels.
Translated, this means that 49% of funds are going to non-teaching
costs. So has CTA challenged California's top-heavy system of
thirteen non-teaching staff to every ten teachers?  Not yet. And
CTA has consistently opposed attempts to break up the state's
gargantuan school districts or cap non-teaching positions.
<P>
 Despite CTA's on-going campaign to puff public education's image,
CTA's policies are failing miserably at improving the actual quality
of public education. 
<UL>
<LI>Student drop-out rates in California schools are topping 30%-worse
than 41 other states-and 50% of those who do graduate get a seventh
grade education or less, lacking the basic skills to fill out
a job application.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>More than one million students in California do not speak
English well enough to understand what is going on in the classroom,
despite (or perhaps because of) tens of millions of dollars spent
on CTA-backed bilingual programs.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  SAT scores in California are declining relative to other
states' scores.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Violent crime in California's  public schools is on the rise,
threatening the safety of students, administrators and teachers
alike.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 CTA's answer to any criticism of the schools is always the same:
We need more money. But &quot;more money for schools&quot; always
translates to more money for salaries and benefits. This is not
to say that teachers' salaries are too high, but it is noteworthy
that  they are 7th in the nation, and that salaries have more
than kept pace with inflation since 1980.  
<P>
 It's interesting that teachers who are parents behave much like
other citizens when confronted with the choices available in the
public schools. According to a statement by NEA president Keith
Geiger, 40% of urban area public school teachers send their children
to private schools. AFT president Albert Shanker disputed this
figure in a series of paid ads in national magazines. But whatever
the rate of teacher bailout, it is not an indictment of unions.
Teachers-as-parents are parents first, union members second. Bravo!
<P>
 But teachers <I>as political activists</I> are another story.
Do we fully understand the implications of a <I>teachers' union
</I>using 91% of its PAC money, nearly half of which comes from
the forced union dues from non-Democrat members, to support Democrat
candidates for state and federal office?  Thomas Jefferson rightly
observed, &quot;To compel a man to furnish contributions of money
for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors
is sinful and tyrannical.&quot; 
<P>
 In 1992 the CTA sent 365 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention and 25 delegates to the Republican National Convention-a
ratio of over 14 to 1. This cohabitation of CTA PAC funds and
political operatives within the California Democrat Party  raises
interesting questions.  Is this heavy commitment to a single political
party a healthy thing <I>for California classrooms</I>? Even if
one assumes that individual teachers will make a conscientious
effort at fairness in discussing current events, it is disturbing
to know that teachers <I>collectively </I>so closely identify
their interests with the fortunes of a particular political party.

<P>
 And what about &quot;fair share&quot; fees taken from non-union
members?  Is it really credible, as CTA claims under oath, that
it devotes 76% of all its dues to <I>collective bargaining</I>?
 When taking into account not only CTA's overt political expenditures
but also the CTA activities that support its legislative, public
advocacy, and communications programs, the 76% figure appears
to be inflated.  After all, collective bargaining per se is the
job of the local chapter.  Yet CTA claims to spend only 24% on
its non-collective bargaining activities-the political and legislative
activities that are in reality its heart and soul.
<P>
 The CTA believes it not only has a right to speak for its members,
it should speak for <I>all </I>Californians in deciding what is
fit for public debate and decision. Regarding CTA's blocking campaign
against the 1991 petition drive to qualify the school voucher
initiative for the November 1992 ballot, CTA President Del Weber
explained their new mandate:
<P>
[CTA] realized that we would be accused of acting in an undemocratic
manner.  What was wrong, after all, with letting people vote on
an issue?  Our answer was firm.  There are some proposals that
are so evil that they should never even be presented to the voters.
<P>
 Arrogance and intolerance of this magnitude might be excusable
in almost any other interest group; after all, it's not unnatural
for groups to have strong opinions about the rightness of their
cause.  What is especially malodorous about the CTA's arrogance
is that these are the people who claim to know <I>better than
parents</I> what is best for California's children.  They claim
to teach citizenship, while trying to subvert the initiative and
referendum process. They claim to promote democracy, while suppressing
debate within their own organization. Through NEA and CTA Resolutions
they claim to speak for all teachers on dozens of controversial
(and often non-education) issues without polling their membership
to determine its views.
<P>
 The CTA, of course, is free to make claims and promote policies
as it sees fit. The public is also free to exercise some skepticism
about these claims and positions. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
 Teachers are entitled to representation in the legislative arena,
but so are parents and taxpayers. It is the job of  policy makers
to balance the professional views and economic interests of the
teachers' union with the interests of the public in improved educational
performance and expanded choices and opportunities.
<P>
 The test of sound policy in education should <I>not</I> be whether
a proposal meets with the approval of CTA or any other special
interest lobby. The test should be whether it expands choices
and opportunities for students and parents trapped in a failed
system.
<P>
 The dilemma facing the state's political leadership is as simple
as it is stark: The system that the CTA built hasn't failed the
CTA-it is doing quite well, thank you. But it has failed California.
That the state legislature is held in such low esteem by the voters
may have something to do with the public perception that special
interest lobbies are calling the shots. Whether in educational
affairs political leaders can change that perception without first
changing the reality is the question of the hour.

Taking Crime Seriously<BR>
An Agenda for the Governor's Crime Summit
<H1>Executive Summary</H1>

</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The increase in violent crime in California calls for new approaches
and a new directness in dealing with criminals.  Putting criminals
in jail-and funding the prisons needed to keep them there-must
take precedence over attempts to solve the &quot;root problems&quot;
that supposedly underlie criminal behavior.  While these efforts
have an understandable appeal, they have become a roadblock to
effective crime control policies because they allow politicians
to pretend to be solving a problem when they aren't.  Sound public
policy requires a sober admission that such &quot;root-cause&quot;
policies have failed; government must focus on putting criminals
in jail and keeping them there. Any policy that doesn't focus
on this goal is a fraud.
<P>
 We must put aside the misguided ideas that framed the social
policy approaches of the 1960s and 1970s.  We must realize that
although rehabilitation is a necessary and worthwhile effort for
many first-time offenders, habitual offenders need to be locked
up. To achieve effective crime control and restore public order
to acceptable levels, we propose a four point program:
<UL>
<LI>Reform the Juvenile Justice System
<LI>Expand Community-Based Policing
<LI>Secure Our Borders from Illegal Immigration
<LI>Reform Our Sentencing and Corrections Practices
</UL>

<H2>Juvenile Crime: Turn Off the Spigot</H2>

<P>
 Locking up all &quot;three-time losers&quot; will not halt the
rise in crime rates if our system continues to produce growing
numbers of young criminals to take their place on our streets.
 Children who are mere &quot;status offenders&quot; can be identified
and treated through community-based programs that do not involve
incarceration, while juvenile offenders who commit violent crimes
should be subject to adult penalties and incarceration.  Juvenile
court proceedings should be open to the public and juvenile records
shared across jurisdictional lines, and juvenile records must
be part of a criminal's record when he commits his first crime
as an adult. 
<H2>Road to Safe Streets: Adopt Community-Based Policing</H2>

<P>
 Until fairly recently in American cities, police patrolled on
foot and exercised broad authority to discourage a range of offensive
behaviors and petty crimes.  Such foot patrols also were effective
in discouraging violent crime.  As the police presence in urban
neighborhoods has declined, both community life and economic activity
have suffered, meaning a loss of jobs and opportunities for urban
residents.  Recent court decisions have reversed the prohibitions
against regulating anti-social behavior and improved the community's
ability to assure safe streets to its citizens.  California's
cities and counties should act to implement a range of policies
to restore safer streets and neighborhoods.  This is a necessary
first step toward restoring stable and livable communities that
will attract employers and halt the flight of middle-class families
to the safer environments in the suburbs.
<H2>Securing Our Borders: A Time for Leadership</H2>

<P>
 The rising tide of illegal immigration into California adds considerable
direct and indirect costs on the criminal justice and corrections
systems.  Concerted action is needed at both state and federal
levels to stem this tide. Illegal aliens arrested for minor offenses
should be fingerprinted and deported rather than tried and incarcerated
at taxpayers' expense.  Those convicted of serious crimes should
be subject to extradition through expanded prisoner-exchange programs.
 
<H2>Career Criminals: Lock Them Up</H2>

<P>
 Many politicians across the state bemoan the resort to an initiative
ballot to enact tougher sentencing guidelines for third-time offenders.
It must be recognized that such grass-roots efforts signal a failure
of public policy:  If legislators had provided leadership to address
the underlying problems, such initiatives would be unnecessary.
It is time for a total overhaul of our sentencing and corrections
practices that will assure citizens that offenders who commit
violent crimes are kept off the streets.
<H1>
<CENTER>
A New Agenda: Getting the Priorities Right
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
<I> </I>In a recent poll of Californians, crime was ranked as
the top concern. And with good cause.  Other surveys report that
Americans consider crime to be the number one problem in their
neighborhoods, with 60% fearing criminal assault in their own
homes. Although national statistics show that the overall crime
rate is slightly lower than last year, the reduction is due to
a drop in property crime. Violent crime is on the increase.  Few
areas of the country provide a more dramatic example of this than
California.  Between 1952 and 1992, as the state's population
has nearly tripled, the rate of violent crime has increased seven-fold.
 A person born in California today is five times more likely to
be murdered and ten times more likely to suffer serious injury
from criminal assault than one born forty years ago.
<P>
 Widespread public fear of crime first appeared as a public policy
issue in the 1960s.  Government's response to it was to accept
the advice of social theorists and adopt programs focusing on
its &quot;root causes.&quot;  These were identified as poverty,
ignorance and social oppression.  A corollary or logical result
of this was to emphasize rehabilitation over incarceration. 
<P>
 The broader policy framework for this change in criminal justice
policy was the massive investment in  the &quot;Great Society&quot;
approach to urban development.  Federal and state bureaucracies
were created to funnel tens of billions of tax dollars to programs
delivering services for the poor, particularly the residents of
urban areas.  Parallel to these &quot;urban strategies&quot; probation
and parole alternatives for those convicted of crimes were increased
dramatically.  California was at the forefront of this effort,
and it suffered immensely as a result: the explosion in crime
rates began in 1967, when the increase in crime was double what
it was five years earlier.
<P>
 Public officials  and bureaucrats have continued to fight to
preserve the social reform approach to criminal justice, despite
growing public anger and opposition. Their response to public
demands for tougher law enforcement is always the same: more calls
for increased attention to the &quot;root causes,&quot; which
are always found in social pathology rather than personal conduct.
<H2>The Citizens' Revolt Against Permissiveness</H2>

<P>
 Despite this failure of political leadership in California's
governing elite, California voters were successful in re-establishing
public safety as the top criminal justice priority in virtually
every area available to them.  California has adopted three death
penalty laws since 1972.  Since 1981, voters have passed five
general obligation bond measures authorizing $2.5 billion for
prison construction and anti-crime initiatives containing two
dozen major reforms which the state legislature was unwilling
to adopt. In 1986 voters took the unprecedented step of rejecting
three members of the California Supreme Court because of their
apparent unwillingness to enforce the death penalty and other
strong sanctions against criminals. 
<P>
 There has been no lack of public support for more comprehensive
reforms, but the California legislature's unwillingness to adopt
them has allowed remnants of the social reform movement to influence
the three important areas of the criminal justice system most
essential to the effective control of crime: handling of juvenile
offenders, policies concerning illegal aliens and public order,
and the rules governing sentencing and corrections.  Current practices
in these areas continue to contribute to the crime problem.
<H2>Unmasking the Funding Bogeyman</H2>

<P>
 Politicians who say Californians are unwilling to pay the bill
for more police officers on the streets and new prison construction
need a lesson in elementary arithmetic.  There is plenty of room
in a $57 billion state budget for funding the operations of our
criminal justice system and adequate prisons and corrections staff.
All politicians need to do is reread the Constitution and their
oath of office: the protection of life, liberty, and property
is the first order of business for democratic government-not something
government does if it has money left over after all the special
interests are taken care of. If citizens themselves were allowed
to rank the state's spending priorities instead of having it done
by Sacramento, many of the things government is doing with that
$57 billion would fall off the list. 
<P>
 The public's demand for effective crime control is not a passing
whim or product of media hype. It is an expression of the public's
justified concern and anger over failed leadership. Budget priorities
must be set straight. 
<H1>
<CENTER>
Meeting the Challenge of Juvenile Justice
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 Future crime rates in California will be greatly affected by
the state's ability to make the juvenile justice system effective
at preventing juvenile delinquents from becoming hard-core criminals.
In a 1989 study, juvenile justice expert Donna Clontz identified
attempts over the previous decade to &quot;graft public safety
concepts into a system designed purely for rehabilitation&quot;
as cause for the system's failure to succeed in either area:
<P>
The current system, in its effort to rehabilitate, actually contributes
to the delinquency of many minors by allowing them to commit multiple
crimes before taking any substantial action . . . . there is little
or no consequence until aberrant patterns are so ingrained that
it is very difficult to change them.
<P>
 A review of juvenile arrests seems to bear this out. Between
1987 and 1992 the number of adults arrested for violent crimes
increased by 35%.  Over the same period, the number of juveniles
arrested for violent crimes shot up 75%.  To combat this trend
California must first realize that its juvenile justice system
is failing to stem this flow of juvenile offenders into a life
of adult crime.  For the thousands who are today committing violent
crimes, the diversion of scarce resources for rehabilitation cannot
be justified.  In most cases the goal should be to remove them
from society, hopefully to a penal system which requires the development
of occupational skills and basic education as the criteria for
release.  The crime that a person commits, regardless of his age,
must become the primary basis for the length of his confinement.

<H2>Identification and Filtering</H2>

<P>
 The first priority of  any juvenile justice system should be
to protect the public.  The second is to act in the best interests
of the minor.  To accomplish this, children developing a pattern
of violating the law must be identified before they begin to commit
serious crimes.  The bulk of California's juvenile justice resources
must be focused upon those most likely to benefit, the youth at
the front end of the system.  The popular term for this is &quot;early
intervention.&quot;  The first step is to change the way the system
deals with status offenders.  Children who habitually run away
from home, who are truant or incorrigible, who roam the streets
at night, are displaying early behavior patterns common among
criminals.  Existing resources at both the state and local level,
including schools, juvenile courts, local offender juvenile programs,
and probation departments, must be pooled to help identify these
at-risk children and to monitor changes in their behavior.
<P>
 As a major step toward an overhaul of local juvenile justice
programs, California should require counties to develop community-based
programs which involve parental control and supervision while
applying a uniform schedule of increasing consequences for repeated
offenses. 
<P>
 An existing program which has been successful is the voluntary,
community-based effort to deal with truancy under section 601
of California's Welfare and Institutions Code.  The School Attendance
Review Board (SARB) program utilizes a team of local representatives
from schools, law enforcement and juvenile justice to identify
children who are habitually truant from school and require that
the child and the parent(s) participate in a counseling program
focused on preventing future delinquency.  Children and parents
who fail to participate are referred to the juvenile court to
face the possibility of more severe consequences.  At this early
stage of misbehavior, the specter of parental and official authority
has a positive effect on children.  An expanded version of this
program should be adopted in every county to identify and monitor
truants, runaways, incorrigibles and curfew violators.
<P>
 Every child who habitually commits these offenses, and the parents
of that child, should be required to participate in SARB-type
counseling as the initial contact with the juvenile justice system.
 This program should also be utilized to monitor the behavior
of juveniles who continue to commit offenses and have graduated
to more serious consequences.  This is the first step in a much-needed
identification and filtering process.
<H2>Increased Supervision of Young Offenders</H2>

<P>
 Presently, juveniles on formal probation for committing crimes
are supervised by a probation officer.  In some counties probation
officers have caseloads of over eighty offenders.  In a given
month these overburdened officers often find it difficult to communicate
with their charges over the telephone, let alone through visits
to their homes.
<P>
 California must make a strong commitment to increase the supervision
of its juvenile offenders.  This will necessarily require additional
expenditures, including funds for an increase in the number of
probation officers.
<P>
 Schools can play a major roll in this increased supervision for
students who are on probation. The assignment of probation officers
should be based on where juveniles attend school, and probation
officers should visit these schools on a regular basis.  At the
same time, schools must not be coerced into retaining juveniles
who are seriously disruptive.  Teachers should be notified when
their students are on probation, what the conditions of probation
are, and how to report violations of those conditions or other
suspicious behavior.
<P>
 In areas where there is community-based policing, officers should
also be notified of the juveniles on his or her beat currently
on probation and, when possible, become familiar with the juvenile's
home, parents and neighbors.  Under this system the young offender
will be constantly aware that someone is monitoring his behavior.

<H2>Sharing Information Across Jurisdictions</H2>

<P>
 Presently, in most parts of California, there is no way patrol
officers can quickly access the record of juveniles.  This means
that they may often be at risk of attack, release a serious or
chronic offender with only a warning, fail to detain a youth with
an active warrant, prolong investigations, or make other important
decisions without proper information.  Additionally, many agencies
working with juveniles have inaccurate or incomplete information
about their charges.
<P>
 Juvenile court judges, probation officers and the staff at county
and state juvenile facilities have many options regarding the
handling of young offenders.  Their decisions should be based
upon accurate information about a juvenile's previous contact
with the system and the evaluations of those who have been responsible
for him.  When a juvenile offender reaches adulthood the criminal
justice system is unaware of his history of juvenile offenses.
 In most cases the offender's fingerprints are not even on file.
 
<P>
 California must establish a system of documenting and sharing
the criminal histories of juvenile offenders.  At initial contact
with the juvenile justice system, every juvenile should be fingerprinted
and that print should be maintained by the state department of
justice.  A juvenile's future record of arrests, referrals, commitments
and treatment programs should be maintained and indexed to his
fingerprints and made available to law enforcement agencies and
other government entities responsible for him. 
<H2>Increased Consequences</H2>

<P>
 It is essential that all young people clearly understand that
the price for breaking the law goes up with repeated offenses.
 Regardless of where an offender is arrested, local authorities
should be able to quickly review his history and determine what
sanctions have already been applied for his prior offenses.  Donna
Clontz described the practice in her 1989 study:
<P>
In most jurisdictions, real sanctions are nonexistent early in
a juvenile delinquent's career.  The message to the minor is &quot;It's
okay to break the law.  Nothing happens to you.&quot;  The result
is a total disrespect for &quot;juvenile justice&quot;-because
it is not providing justice for anyone at all.  It is important
that people who fashion consequences for crimes and create solutions
to diverse youthful problems retain some discretion in decision
making.  However, they too must be held accountable for providing
consistent consequences as well as requiring parental participation.
<P>
 California must establish a basic schedule of increasing consequences,
incorporating programs generally available throughout the state,
including probation, community service work programs, suspension
of driving privileges, boot camp, counseling, and juvenile hall.
 Counties should be required to follow this schedule.  Changes
in juvenile court procedures and the evidence requirements to
prove violations of probation-making them comparable with those
in the adult system-would be a major step in demonstrating to
juvenile offenders that breaking the rules will not be tolerated.
<P>
 The California Youth Authority (CYA), which has increasingly
become a warehouse for serious juvenile offenders, should provide
a last opportunity for those who have gone through the basic schedule
of locally administered consequences to avoid the lengthy confinement
associated with adult habitual criminals. 
<P>
 A person should be sent to a CYA facility only once.  A juvenile
whose most serious offense is a misdemeanor should not be eligible
for CYA.  Violent offenders should be held and treated separately
from habitual, nonviolent juveniles.  While confined at CYA, juveniles
should be required to participate in programs designed to educate
them about the consequences of future criminal activity and other
programs designed to address specific categories of offenders.
 Currently available services include drug rehabilitation, development
of occupational skills, and sex offender counseling.  In most
cases, a CYA commitment should be no longer than it takes to administer
and evaluate the effect of such programs.  An appropriate goal
might be six months.  Offenders who fail to perform should be
transferred to state-run facilities for juveniles which operate
like adult prisons.
<P>
 Juveniles who commit additional crimes after a CYA commitment
should be referred to adult court and, upon conviction, sentenced
to adult-length terms to be served in the above-mentioned prisons
until they reach the age of 18 and can be transferred to an adult
correctional facility.
<H2>Opening Up the System</H2>

<P>
 The public knows very little about what happens in juvenile court
because most cases are decided in closed hearings.  With current
levels of juvenile crime, it is no longer prudent to allow such
proceedings to be conducted in secret.  The community-based approach
to juvenile crime, discussed earlier in this paper, requires the
full support of the local citizenry.  To assure this support and
that the system is working to protect the safety of the public,
juvenile hearings should be opened to the public.  In states that
have opened their juvenile courts on the same basis as their adult
courts, none have experienced increased expenses due to spectators
or had other negative side effects.  The individual juvenile's
desire for privacy is far outweighed by the public's need for
information about the operation of its juvenile courts and their
effect on public safety.
<H1>
<CENTER>
The Road to Safe Streets: Community-based Policing
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 Until the latter part of this century the maintenance of public
order was a major priority of  American law enforcement.  In virtually
every big city and small town, police patrolled on foot and exercised
broad authority to discourage vagrants, rowdiness, public drunkenness,
and other offensive behavior.  This role of police changed as
the economic benefits of using patrol cars equipped with radios
to police growing urban centers were recognized.  The radical
changes in social policies of the 1960s included successful political
and legal efforts to strike down laws which had given police authority
to control the behavior of vagrants and panhandlers.  In the face
of these developments, prosecution agencies were reluctant to
test existing laws, political leaders were reluctant to enact
new ones, and municipal police departments completely abandoned
their order-maintenance duties. 
<P>
 This official tolerance of public nuisances had a dramatic effect
on serious crime.  In his book <I>Thinking About Crime</I>, Professor
James Q. Wilson discusses studies conducted in New York and Great
Britain between 1954 and 1965 reporting that increases in foot
patrols resulted in reductions of serious street crime by more
than thirty percent.  An article Wilson wrote in <I>The Atlantic</I>
in 1982 with George L. Kelling further established the link between
general order and serious crime. It and subsequent studies have
led many American cities to restore foot patrols (community-based
policing) and enact local statutes to discourage aggressive panhandling,
prostitution, sleeping in parks and on sidewalks, and other offensive
behavior which has converted prosperous urban business and residential
areas into filthy, open-air flophouses where the only commerce
is in drugs and violence. 
<P>
 While homeless advocates and civil liberties groups continue
to challenge these actions as class discrimination and unconstitutional
violations of free expression, some recent federal court decisions
to allow enforcement of laws punishing behavior rather than status
offer encouragement.  For instance, a 1992 United States Supreme
Court decision in <I>International Society for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc.</I> v.<I> Lee</I>  upheld a New York law prohibiting panhandling
in airports. In 1990  the federal Court of Appeals ruled in <I>Young
</I>v.<I> New York City Transit Authority</I> that another New
York law prohibiting panhandling in subways passed constitutional
muster.
<P>
 It is important to note that national studies have repeatedly
proven that estimates regarding the size and makeup of the &quot;homeless&quot;
population advanced by these advocates and accepted by the news
industry are highly inflated.
<P>
 In places where public order laws have been enforced, the effect
has been positive.  Since 1990, for example, following the Young
decision to allow enforcement of public order regulations in New
York's subway system, the rate for robbery has dropped by 41%
and the rates for felonious assault and grand larceny have decreased
36%.
<P>
 The arguments for reducing crime through enforcement of similar
laws on public streets are compelling.  The director of a homeless
shelter in Boston underscored this when he publicly requested
that people not give panhandlers money because it is used to buy
drugs, subverting any rehabilitative efforts the city provides
and increasing the expense for medical treatment.  In light of
findings that the bulk of America's street population consists
of drug-addicted and alcoholic males, this request makes very
good sense.
<P>
 In order to reduce crime and improve the economic environment
of its urban areas California must become an initiator and a supporter
of community-based policing and the maintenance of public order
as a law enforcement priority. 
<P>
 In <I>A Guide to Regulating Panhandling</I>, published last April,
public interest attorney Kent S. Scheidegger offers model laws
which give beat officers a means of controlling the behavior of
panhandlers.  Similar laws and others addressing sleeping in public
parks and blocking sidewalks have been adopted in many communities,
including several cities in California.  Some of these laws are
currently being tested in state and federal court.  State efforts
to encourage communities to adopt these policies, perhaps with
incentives, will speed efforts to make our streets, sidewalks
and parks safe and attractive for everyone.

SECURING OUR BORDERS
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The nonenforcement of immigration laws teaches those entering
California illegally, and others already here, the same lesson
that criminals learn from urban streets littered with drunks,
drug addicts and prostitutes, i.e., &quot;the law is not enforced
here.&quot;  Exacerbating the federal government's unwillingness
to enforce the law at the border, the local policy in some urban
areas has been to actually forbid police who discover illegal
aliens while investigating crimes from reporting them to federal
authorities for deportation.
<P>
 The annual cost of confining illegal immigrants who commit crimes
is estimated to be $500 million.  This does not take into account
the cost of arrest and conviction, which is borne by counties.
 The state suffers an even larger financial burden for social
programs delivered to illegal aliens.
<P>
 Governor Wilson has focused upon this problem and suggested several
steps to stop the flow of illegal aliens, and several members
of California's congressional delegation have expressed support
for some of these proposals.  Yet there is still no consensus
on the need for urgent action.  It is time for all of California's
political leaders-state and federal, Republican and Democrat-to
unite behind a demand that the federal government fulfill its
legal obligation to secure California's borders against alien
immigration.
<P>
 It may take time for the federal government to fulfill its obligations
in this area, but there are immediate steps that the state can
take to alleviate the problem.  As a first step, state and local
government agencies should be required to identify and report
illegal aliens among the populations they serve.  The cost for
such an effort would be far less than continuing to provide illegals
with services and process those who violate state laws through
the criminal justice system.
<P>
 With regard to illegals in the criminal population, there are
specific steps the state can take.  Illegal aliens arrested for
less serious crimes should be fingerprinted and deported rather
than tried and confined at the expense of taxpayers.
<P>
 The federal government must do its part.  California's political
leaders should ask the President to direct the State Department
to clarify and strengthen extradition agreements with foreign
governments to allow illegals convicted and sentenced for serious
crimes to be confined in prisons in their home country with a
similar understanding regarding the return of American lawbreakers
for confinement here.  The adoption of NAFTA leaves the United
States in a good position to make this agreement with Mexico.
<P>
 While the greatest benefits from these actions would be to reduce
state spending for social programs, the savings in local and state
criminal justice resources would be substantial.

<CENTER>
Corrections and Sentencing Reform 
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 In December 1993, national headlines were dominated by another
abhorrent crime apparently committed by an habitual criminal.
 The kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas has brought
to the forefront the rules governing California's system for sentencing
and confining serious repeat offenders.  Robert Allen Davis, who
has been charged with the crime, had prior convictions for two
major felonies and was released from state prison four months
before the girl's kidnapping and murder. State laws granting convicted
criminals release after serving only half of their sentence undoubtedly
provided Davis with the freedom to commit other crimes.
<P>
 Under California law, a criminal sentenced to prison receives
credits for good behavior totaling roughly one-third of his confinement
upon entry to prison.  To lose part of this &quot;good time&quot;
the criminal must be found to have broken prison rules through
a time-consuming complaint and hearing process.  An inmate who
does lose part of his &quot;good time&quot; for attacking a guard,
for example, can earn it back by avoiding being caught and found
guilty of another offense over a fixed period of time.  In effect,
a criminal can continue to commit crimes while in prison and still
be eligible for early release so long as he spaces out his offenses
enough to regain his &quot;good time.&quot;  In addition, state
law provides that inmates who are willing to work receive one
day off their sentence for each day they are willing to work,
even if there is no work to do.  The maximum amount of credit
which can be earned utilizing &quot;good time&quot; and &quot;work
time&quot; reduces a criminal's sentence by one-half.  Even convicted
murderers are eligible for these sentence reductions.
<P>
 The time to abandon this practice is long past. Strong truth-in-sentencing
guidelines must  require that habitual offenders serve the full
terms of their sentences.  
<P>
 While some correctional administrators have argued that such
sentence reduction credits provide incentives for convicts to
behave, and thereby become  easier to manage, correctional officers
actually working in prisons consider them useless in controlling
inmate behavior and actually a license to commit some offenses
with impunity.
<P>
 California must replace &quot;good time&quot; and &quot;work
time&quot; credits with changes in the determinate sentencing
law to retain a minimum base term while creating an indeterminate
upper term.  Like the federal prison system, the overriding rule
in California should be, &quot;If you do the crime, you do the
time.&quot;  California's sentence for a first conviction for
forcible rape, for example, could be changed from the current
range of 3, 6 or 8 years, to an indeterminate term of 5 to 8 years.
 The new sentencing scheme would provide that only rapists who
avoid additional offenses and participate in work and other rehabilitative
programs would be eligible for release at completion of the five-year
base term.  Inmates who continued to offend or refused to participate
would not be considered for release until their behavior conformed
for a significant period (perhaps one year).  Those unwilling
to cooperate would remain in prison until completion of the upper
term of 8 years.  The key to this system is that the desired behavior
would be required for release at the end of the base term rather
than as a bargaining chip for a sentence reduction.   
<H2>The Discipline of Work</H2>

<P>
 Productive work should also be a requirement rather than an option.
 In the past, efforts to allow more meaningful work for inmates
have been blocked by labor interest complaints that working inmates
would take jobs away from law-abiding citizens.  The state of
California currently provides billions of dollars worth of services
to the public which are funded by the taxpayers.  The state also
owns and maintains buildings (including prisons), motor vehicles,
highways, dams and parks.  Inmates should be required to perform
these services (as attrition permits).  The savings would lower
the tax burden on California's economy, which has been shown to
encourage the creation of jobs in the private sector.
<P>
 Currently, many inmates are paid by the state for the work they
perform.  The wages can be used by inmates as &quot;credits&quot;
for the purchase of items from the prison commissary.  This practice
has not been proven to contribute to inmate rehabilitation and
can create problems in controlling them.  It should be abandoned.
 The savings realized from inmate labor should be used to help
pay for the cost of their conviction, confinement, and to support
programs and services related to public safety such as local courts
and delinquency prevention efforts. 
<P>
 The size of California's prison system has allowed for a wide
variety of living conditions among the various facilities.  The
state already utilizes these differences to separate inmates by
their level of criminal sophistication and behavior in confinement.
 This process should be continued and expanded to provide incentives
for inmates to behave well and participate in work programs. 
In the interest of rehabilitation, inmates who perform well should
be transferred to institutions offering work which can develop
proficiency in marketable skills, such as plumbing, carpentry
and computer programming.  Inmates with chronic behavior problems
should spend their indeterminate terms in institutions offering
work which relies less on skills and teamwork than on manual labor.

<H2>Habitual Criminals: The Cost of Prisons vs. the Costs of Crime
</H2>

<P>
 The greatest threat of crime is presented by habitual criminals.
 One survey conducted by the Rand Corporation found that the average
career criminal commits between 187 and 287 crimes per year, at
an average cost for each crime of $2,300.  The current cost of
confining a criminal in California is $25,000 per year.  This
does not include the expense of investigating crimes, arrest or
conviction.  Comparing the minimum $430,000 annual cost of keeping
an habitual criminal on the street with the $25,000 expense of
confinement makes a powerful case for the proposition that individuals
who continue to commit crimes should be imprisoned for increasingly
longer periods of time.  California voters demonstrated their
support for this with adoption of Proposition 8 in 1982, which
added five years to the sentence of a convicted felon for each
prior conviction.  With the above-discussed elimination of &quot;good
time&quot; and &quot;work time&quot; credits, California would
finally have an honest and effective process for confining most
habitual criminals. 
<P>
 California can further improve this process by taking three important
steps. 
<P>
 <I>Habitual criminals convicted for a third time of any major
felony should receive a mandatory prison sentence of life without
the possibility of parole.</I>
<P>
 While a proposal currently being circulated in California, identified
in the press as the &quot;Three Strikes You're Out&quot; initiative,
does appear to increase confinement for habitual criminals by
requiring a mandatory prison term of twenty-five years to life
for a third felony conviction, the proposal retains a 20% &quot;good
time&quot; credit, reducing the minimum commitment to 20 years.
 After serving that term the criminal would be eligible for parole.
 A better alternative was adopted last November in the state of
Washington.  That state's Initiative #593, also labeled &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out,&quot; mandates a life without parole sentence
for a third violent felony conviction.  California should enact
a similar law.
<P>
 <I>Sentences for <B>violent</B> crimes should be increased across
the board. For example, persons convicted for a second time of
attempted murder should receive a mandatory prison sentence of
life without possibility of parole.</I>
<P>
 Criminals with a history of violent behavior should not get 
&quot;three chances&quot; to repeat their crimes. Armed robbers
who demand that their victims lie face down and then fire bullets
into them should not be shown mercy because, by some miracle,
the victim survived. A would-be murderer who fails twice to kill
his victim should never receive another opportunity.
<P>
 <I>Elderly inmates who have been convicted of <B>nonviolent</B>
offenses should be considered for early release.</I>
<P>
 The recidivism rate for prisoners between the ages of 18 to 24
is roughly 22 percent, but it drops to only 2.1 percent for those
over the age of 45.  This dramatic reduction in the threat to
public safety, coupled with an estimated maintenance cost of $69,000
annually for older inmates (nearly three times the cost of younger
ones), raises questions about the benefits derived from their
continued confinement.  With many state prisons operating beyond
capacity and a large street population of young and violent repeat
offenders needing confinement, it is worth considering the early
release of inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses whose age
and behavior suggest that they can be managed outside of prison
with adequate parole supervision. 
<H1>
<CENTER>
Postscript:  the Gun Control Experience
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
 The purpose of this paper has been to identify the major reforms
California must undertake to control crime and violence.  There
are many intermediate steps which can also be taken to correct
problems with post-conviction appeals, funding of courts, and
impediments to criminal investigations.  One proposal which is
conspicuous by its absence is for additional controls on the purchase
of firearms.
<P>
 For several years California has attempted to enforce a ban on
certain types of &quot;assault weapons&quot; purportedly popular
with criminals.  It has also had one of the longest waiting periods
for the purchase of handguns in the nation.  These restrictions
of hardware typically purchased illegally by criminals to aid
in their commission of other illegal acts do not appear to have
reduced the number and type of firearms used by criminals or the
rate of serious crime. 
<P>
 In large American cities with the most restrictive laws governing
the purchase and carrying of firearms, similar laws seem to have
had no appreciable effect on crime at all.  Of the five American
cities with the highest murder rates in 1991-Washington, D.C.,
New Orleans, St. Louis, Detroit, and Birmingham-all but one, New
Orleans, are in states which have, for years, had strict gun control
laws requiring a license to purchase or carry a handgun and/or
registration of gun ownership.  The most restrictive gun control
law is enforced in Washington, D.C., which has, by far, the highest
murder rate of any American city.  
<P>
 While these figures do not prove that anti-gun laws are without
merit, they do indicate that energy and resources expended to
outlaw hardware might be better spent rounding up and confining
the criminals who are using it to threaten, injure and kill their
victims.

<B>California</B>'<B>s Private Schools:  </B>
<P>
<B>Survey Results</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
As the school choice debate heats up, the focus is on California's
private schools.  Anti-choice advocates vilify them as havens
for the wealthy and dens of discrimination.  Are these charges
true?  And if California should adopt a voucher system, how would
these schools react?
<P>
To answer these and other questions, the Claremont Institute commissioned
a survey of California private schools.  Approximately five hundred
schools responded, and the data permits us to reach some intriguing
conclusions about the likely consequences of a voucher system.
<P>
<B>The Survey</B>
<P>
The Private School Survey consisted of 25 questions which sought
to establish profiles of a cross section of California's private
schools.  Schools were differentiated by religious affiliation
(or non-affiliation), grade levels offered, type of property on
which the school sits, types and numbers of staff employed, length
of school day, parental involvement, size of student population,
admissions criteria, teaching methods, revenues and revenue sources,
and current expenditures.  The survey also asked private schools
to discuss their plans for the years ahead, with and without a
voucher system.
<P>
The results of the survey paint a picture of private schools far
different than the stereotype offered up by school choice opponents.
 They are diverse and varied, meeting the needs of widely different
segments of the population.  In other words, the educational marketplace,
like the marketplace for other goods, produces a wide variety
of products that meet the varying demand of consumers-in this
case, the needs of parents seeking an effective education for
their children.
<P>
<B>Private School Profiles</B>
<P>
Of the private schools that responded to the survey, about a third
were non-religious.  Of the remaining two-thirds, religious affiliation
ran the gamut from Catholic (22 percent of the total), Association
of Christian Schools (22 percent), general Protestant (7 percent),
Lutheran (6 percent), with smaller numbers of schools run by Seventh
Day Adventists, Jews, Episcopalians, and others.
<P>
In terms of enrollment size, a strong majority of the schools
fall into the medium range, with 56 percent having 100 to 499
students and 17.7 percent 50 to 99 students, followed by schools
with between 25 and 49 students (12.4 percent), very large schools
with more than 500 students (9.1 percent), and very small schools
with under 25 students (3.9 percent).  Although an almost equal
number of Catholic and ASC schools responded to the survey, Catholic
schools have by far the larger number of students (48 percent
of all the students in the religiously-affiliated schools).
<P>
Approximately four-fifths of the schools offer instruction in
grades K-6, 65 percent at the 7th and 8th grade level, and between
32 and 35 percent at the 9th to 12th grade level.  Although the
length of schools years ranged from very short to very long, nearly
64 percent said that it is between 175 and 180 days.  The average
school day is just over six hours.  Parental involvement in the
schools is not required by the 64 percent of respondents.
<P>
Schools in our survey obtained their buildings through various
means.  Fifty-five-plus percent constructed them.  Others bought
them (15.5 percent) or used a church or church property (13 percent),
a commercial property (9.3 percent), or a residential property
(8.9 percent).  The property the buildings stand on are most often
owned by an organization affiliated with the school (47.6 percent)
or by the school itself (36.1  percent).  Sixteen percent lease
their facilities.
<P>
In fact, the average annual revenue for the private schools responding
to the survey was just over $1 million, with nearly 64 percent
having revenues over $250,000.  Non-religious private schools
had a revenue average of $1.3 million, and religious schools $850,000.
<P>
Most revenues come from tuition and fees-nearly 84 percent of
the $1 million annual total (slightly more for non-religious schools,
slightly less for the others).  Remaining revenues come from parent/student
fund-raising, benefactor and alumni donations, and aid from affiliated
organizations.
<P>
<B>Teaching Methods</B>
<P>
The great majority of the schools responding to the survey (66.6
percent) employ interdisciplinary course work and instruction.
 This is the most familiar type of instruction:  instruction in
the sciences, math, English, social sciences, fine arts, etc.
 A significant minority (37 percent) use individualized courses
of study based on each child's ability rather than age or grade
level.  This includes a majority (58 percent) of the non-religious
schools.
<P>
Montessori teaching methods are used by 9.9 percent of the responding
schools, magnet-style instruction in a particular subject by 8.2
percent, and cooperative learning by 2.3 percent.  Although two-thirds
of the schools responding to the survey were religiously affiliated,
a bare one percent use religious teaching methods.  
<P>
Although few schools use religious teaching methods, 66.6 percent
engage in moral character training.  This includes 83 percent
of the religiously-affiliated schools and 32 percent of the others.
 
<P>
<B>Ratio of Teachers to Administrators</B>
<P>
One of the hottest issues in education is staffing.  In particular,
the public school system has been accused of being top-heavy with
non-teaching personnel.  In the California public school system,
the State Department of Education admits that non-teachers outnumber
teachers by a ration of approximately 13 to 10.
<P>
In their groundbreaking book <I>Politics, Markets and America's
Schools</I>, John Chubb and Terry Moe found &quot;an emerging
consensus among scholars and reformers that centralization and
bureaucratization are substantially at odds with the effective
organization of schools and the successful provision of education.&quot;
 The Private School Survey suggests that private schools are more
in line with this consensus:  Teachers outnumber non-teaching
staff in the private schools by a ratio of 2.2 to 1.  Adding classroom
aides into the picture, the ratio rises to 2.8 to 1.
<P>
Private school spending figures bear out this emphasis on the
classroom.  Of those responding to the survey, total spending
on teachers was three times that on non-teaching staff ($202 million
versus $65.7 million).  The numbers are even more dramatic in
private schools with per pupil expenditures under $3,000 per year,
where more than four times as much is spent ($58.7 million versus
$13.6 million).  
<P>
<B>Admissions Criteria</B>
<P>
Academic aptitude was listed by 74 percent of responding schools
as an admissions criterion.  This was especially true of religious
schools, with 80 percent of them (and 92 percent of Catholic schools)
taking academic merit into account.
<P>
Surprisingly, less than half of the religious schools (47 percent)
listed religious affiliation as an admissions criterion.  Indeed,
less than 38 percent of the evangelical-leaning ASC schools did
so.  The extremes on the scale were represented by Jewish schools
(82 percent) and Episcopal schools (11 percent), with 63 percent
of the Catholic schools considering religion.  Nor is having a
family member who is affiliated with a religion as important as
might be thought:  less than 23 percent listed this as a criterion
in their admissions process.  The same is true of &quot;connections&quot;:
 only 32 percent of the schools listed family affiliation with
the school as an admissions criterion.
<P>
Perhaps most surprising is the survey finding that a minority
of the private schools (41 percent) listed ability to pay tuition
as a criterion for admission.  The difference between non-religious
and religious schools in this regard was minimal (38 percent versus
42.6 percent).  Catholic schools were among the least concerned
with ability to pay tuition (34.7 percent).  
<P>
Other criteria used by schools included the catch-all category
of &quot;background of student&quot; (48 percent), student attitude
(14.2 percent), and learning disability/special needs (5 percent).
<P>
<B>Vouchers and Enrollment Growth</B>
<P>
Another hot topic concerns space availability in private schools.
 Critics of vouchers say that the private school system in the
state cannot expand quickly enough to handle the demand vouchers
will create.
<P>
First, according to the survey, an overwhelming number of the
responding schools (80 percent) would accept vouchers.  Just over
4 percent would not.  (The remaining 16 percent were unsure or
did not answer).  Schools with an annual per pupil expenditure
under $3,000 were more likely to accept vouchers (86.7 percent).
<P>
But what about space availability?  Of the schools responding,
49.6 percent said they had more spaces than applicants for the
1992-93 school year, while 46.5 percent had more applicants than
spaces.  Of schools with a per-pupil expenditure under $3,000,
nearly 52 percent had more spaces than applicants.
<P>
Thus clearly, existing facilities would not be enough to meet
the greater demand generated by vouchers.  And there are limitations
to expansion of existing schools.  Local zoning ordinances, for
example, limit the ability to expand facilities for 28 percent
of responding schools.  
<P>
If a voucher system is adopted, almost half (48%) of the schools
responding said that they would increase their size and capacity.
 Some would use portable classrooms to increase their capacity
(22 percent); others would build additional classrooms on their
current site (22.5 percent).  Thirteen percent said that they
would expand by opening an additional school at a new site, while
11 percent said they would expand by moving to a new site.  
<P>
In short, there will be an immediate and dramatic increase in
space and capacity in the state's private schools.  In 1995-96,
the responding schools would enroll approximately 8.6% more students
if the voucher initiative were passed.  In the outlying years,
this percentage increases.  In 1998-99, approximately 15% more
students, and in 2003-04, approximately 24% more students would
be enrolled if vouchers were available.
<P>
Of course, these enrollment projections do not account for the
building of <I>new</I> schools in response to increased demand
for private educational services.  Judging by the effects on colleges
and universities following passage of the G.I. Bill after World
War II, this proliferation of schools will be just as dramatic
as enrollment expansion in existing schools.
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
It is possible to make some broad generalizations based on the
Private School Survey.  The majority of private schools are medium-sized,
religiously affiliated, with budgets over $250,000.  Most of their
revenues come from tuition and fees, and are spent primarily on
teaching staff rather than administrators.  Academic merit, not
religious affiliation, is the most influential admissions criterion.
 The majority would accept vouchers, and nearly half would expand
their capacity to take new voucher students.  New private schools
will certainly need to be created to satisfy market demand under
a voucher system.  The best news is that if their profile resembles
that of existing private schools, California education can only
benefit.

<B>The Limitations of Land Use Planning:</B>
<P>
<B>A Warning for Californians</B>
</CENTER>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
 As California looks ahead to a resumption of the economic growth
and prosperity of the 1980s, the issue of how to manage its population
growth has returned to the top of the policy agenda.  The state's
population has topped 31 million and continues to grow by over
500,000 per year.  Projections are for  36 million by the end
of the century.
<P>
 This paper will outline and explain the inherent limitations
of long-range land-use planning, and recommend alternative growth
management guidelines.  It will pay special attention to SB 377,
Senator Robert Presley's key bill on growth management.
<H2>The Inherent Limitations of Planning</H2>

<P>
 Land-use planning is a variation of resource allocation.  The
same kind of general problems exist as in allocating other resources
through a governmental planning process.  Conversely, the case
<I>for</I> land use planning and regulation rests on the same
ground as that for any other kind of economic regulation:  the
argument that the marketplace, left to itself, will create negative
&quot;externalities&quot; or will use resources inefficiently.
 
<P>
 The inherent difficulty of trying to design a comprehensive,
long range land-use planning system is that it attempts to supersede
the decentralized decision-making system of the marketplace with
administrative judgment.  The practical problems facing planners
are extremely daunting:
<P>
* Information and projections about population and economic growth
are fundamentally unreliable and will place constrictions on land
use that further distort actual growth patterns.
<P>
* The various uses to which a parcel of land may be put, or the
relative attractiveness of alternative uses that are contingent
on surrounding land uses, are not possible to comprehend through
a comprehensive planning process.  Linkages between various land
uses and their effects (e.g., traffic congestion, business development,
compatibility of adjacent uses) are indirect, inconsistent, and
occasionally obscure.  Land is not a one-dimensional resource.
 
<P>
* Comprehensive planning underestimates, and cannot account for,
the uncertainties of the land-use market.  While land-use plans
tend to be static, the real market forces for land use are highly
dynamic.
<P>
<B>Population Projections</B>
<P>
 At the outset of any comprehensive planning, there must be long-range
population projections.  These must be segmented both demographically
and geographically.  In other words, the planner needs to know
not only the socio-economic status of the new population (to match
income and household size), but also exactly where this growth
is going to occur.
<P>
 California has a very poor track record with projections of this
kind.  Department of Finance (DoF) projections for growing areas
of the state have underestimated population growth by as much
as 10 percent within five years of the date of the projection.
 For example, DoF's 1977 projection for Riverside County underestimated
actual population growth for 1980-three years out-by 40,000. 
By 1990 this projection was off by nearly 400,000.  The 1981 revised
projection was still off by nearly 200,000.  In San Bernardino
County, DoF's 1977 projection for 1990 was off by 500,000, bringing
the cumulative error for the Inland Empire to 900,000.
<P>
 DoF projections are revised annually, but growth plans and urban
limit lines based on them are not.  This may have severe consequences.
 Consider:  Population projections for the greater-Los Angeles
area for the year 2010 differ by as much as 1.5 million.  The
use of an inaccurate projection of this magnitude in a growth
plan will lead to a mix of higher housing prices, overburdened
infrastructure, diminished opportunity (especially for the young
and the poor), and the displacement of growth to other regions.
<P>
 Had the state imposed a 20-year land-use plan in Riverside and
San Bernardino Counties in 1980 based on DoF population projections,
this growing region would have suffered dramatic constrictions
of land use, causing higher housing prices, inadequate infrastructure
capacity, and diminished economic growth and opportunity.
<P>
 Given that our ability to project population growth accurately
is limited to five years at best, most 20-year comprehensive land-use
plans (which require about five years to develop) <I>will be obsolete
just as they are implemented.</I>
<H2>Land-Use Judgments</H2>

<P>
 Even with reliable demographic information, long-range comprehensive
planning is highly problematic, given the difficulty of comprehending
all of the linkages among land use (e.g., traffic generation,
housing, and infrastructure usage).  In this, comprehensive planning
suffers on a larger scale the defects of traditional zoning. 
For instance:  A piece of land that is suitable for a particular
use one day may not be a year later, because of the uses to which
other landowners have put their property.  
<P>
 If a comprehensive plan lacks the flexibility to allow the market
to adapt to such changes, it will clog up the market, imposing
unnecessary and inefficient costs on the economy.  If the plan
allows such flexibility, on the other hand, it will necessarily
be less &quot;comprehensive.&quot;
<P>
 States with comprehensive regional planning, such as Florida
and Oregon, try to solve this dilemma with a rigorous plan-amendment
process.  Although in principle this provides a degree of flexibility
and local autonomy, in practice there is no flexibility.  All
plan amendments must be consistent with the comprehensive statewide
or regional goals.  The documentary requirements for a plan amendment
in Florida can stack up to six feet high.  This cumbersome and
time-consuming process imposes costs far in excess of benefits,
and imposes a heavy burden on local jurisdictions.
<P>
 The deeper point is this:  it is impossible for <I>any</I> system
of long-range planning to comprehend all of the factors that compose
the market for land-use transactions-lease rates, land prices,
shifting consumer demand, commodity prices, changes in the competitive
mix of the local economy, etc.
<H2>Does SB 377 Overcome these Limitations?</H2>

<P>
 If poor predictions, bad land-use judgments and lack of adequate
information for decisionmaking are problems inherent to long-term
land-use planning efforts, Californians must wonder whether SB
377, the highly-touted growth management legislation authored
by State Senator Robert Presley (D-Riverside), overcomes them.

<P>
 SB 377 requires regional agencies (e.g., councils of government
and air quality districts) within each urbanized region to propose
a regional growth management strategy by January 1, 1995.  These
strategies will be guided by state-mandated goals contained in
SB 377.  Underlying these goals is the Legislature's desire to
establish &quot;fundamental principles of resource conservation
and sustainable conservation and development to guide public policy&quot;.
 
<P>
 In fairness, it must be said that SB 377 attempts to avoid some
of the obvious pitfalls of central land-use planning.  For example,
it does not seek to create a new state land-use agency to direct
land-use decisions from Sacramento.  Also, it supports market-based
transportation pricing mechanisms, which would presumably include
peak-hour road pricing.  And it states that among its goals are
<P>
 (ii) reductions in development fees and other development requirements;
(iii) expedited project review procedures; (iv) reduction and
simplification of review, approval, and appeal criteria. . . .
<P>
 These nods to the market are laudatory.  But even a cursory reading
of SB 377 reveals the same problems that have doomed other central
land-use planning schemes.
<P>
 First , SB 377 adopts a typical long-term baseline:
<P>
Policies and actions to achieve this objective shall include,
but are not limited to, establishment in each region of land designation
system clearly identifying areas proposed for planned compact
development over areas proposed for <I>20-year period</I>, and
areas proposed for long-term or permanent protection from urban
development.<B> </B>[emphasis added]
<P>
 To repeat:  land-use plans that adopt 20-year base periods are
guaranteed to misproject the actual growth of the area in question.
 SB 377 would force such predictions to be made for all parts
of California.  Every city and county in the state would be forced
to live with the potentially disastrous effects of an off-target
projection.
<H2>SB 377 and the Misguided War on &quot;Urban Sprawl&quot;</H2>

<P>
 Despite the appearance of flexibility, SB 377 will lock land
into certain uses.  Its overriding goal is &quot;compact development,&quot;
a pattern of development &quot;with average residential densities
higher than those prevailing in the region in 1992.&quot;<B> 
</B>In other words, the bill seeks to force Californians to live
in more crowded urban areas.
<P>
<B> </B>SB 377 would break down all California land into four
categories: (1) existing communities suitable for maximum feasible
redevelopment, (2) communities suitable for infill growth that
will meet density standards for compact development, (3) urban
reserve areas that are not developed, but could be suitable for
development after 20 years, and (4) agricultural and other productive
lands and environmentally sensitive areas suitable for maximum
long-term conservation or permanent protection.<B>  </B>The idea
behind these categories is to increase density where people are
currently living and prevent other areas from being developed.
<P>
 Why force people to live closer together?  According to SB 377
it is to combat &quot;urban sprawl,&quot; i.e., the suburbanization
of housing patterns that has occurred since the 1950s.  The evils
that stem from &quot;urban sprawl,&quot; according to its enemies,
include increased traffic congestion and air pollution (both due
to longer work commutes) and inefficient use of land resources.
<P>
 Empirical evidence, however, clearly demonstrates that these
and other claims against suburbanization are false.  For instance:
 According to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Transportation,
most of the increase in peak-hour traffic congestion during the
1970s and early '80s came from <I>non</I>-work-related travel.
 As people have become more affluent, an increasing number have
been taking discretionary trips, especially during peak-hours.
 The survey also found that any growth in work-related commuting
has occurred during <I>non</I>-peak hours.  Urban sprawl, therefore,
is not the primary cause of increased peak-hour congestion or
air pollution.
<P>
 Ironically, increased densities of the sort sought by SB 377
will itself lead to increased congestion.  Why?  Because increased
densities will lead to more discretionary commutes in more densely
developed areas.
<P>
<B> </B>Like most central land-use plans, SB 377 also seeks to
increase the use of public mass transit-specifically light rail.<B>
 </B>What it doesn't detail is the enormous cost to the public
of mass transit systems.  Miami's rail system, for example, costs
a staggering $16.77 per passenger.  And according to a study by
the Congressional Budget Office, light rail is the most expensive
form of mass transit on a per-passenger-mile cost basis.
<P>
<B> </B>Another myth about urban sprawl-enshrined in the fourth
land category defined in SB 377-is that it is depleting beautiful
land and vital agricultural land.  But the facts show that urban
development constitutes less than 3 percent of the land in the
United States.  In California, there are now more acres under
agricultural cultivation than in the 1950s, even though the state's
population has doubled.  This is because irrigation and other
technologies have allowed more unused land to be converted into
farm land.
<H2>The Economics of SB 377 </H2>

<P>
 Although SB 377 offers rhetoric about economic development, its
words ring hollow.  By attempting to counter urban sprawl by reducing
the supply of land that can be developed, the bill will almost
surely raise the cost of land.  Reduced developer fees and expedited
review procedures will not be enough to offset the fact that less
land means higher prices.  
<P>
 In Southeast England, which has its own version of &quot;compact
development&quot; and land categorization, an acre of urban land
is an unbelievable 235-times more expensive than an acre of agricultural
land.  In California, where land prices are already high, more
rising costs will cause another round of business flight, not
to mention misery to home-buying families who can barely afford
current government-distorted housing costs.  
<P>
 Already businesses cite California's high land prices as a prime
reason why they are relocating or thinking about relocating. 
SB 377 would only exacerbate this serious problem.
<P>
 SB 377 fails to recognize that &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is actually
an important factor in business expansion and profitability. 
For instance, as urban ecologist John Kasarda has pointed out:
 &quot;Regarding cost effectiveness, it is well documented that
many modern industries operate more efficiently in outlying locations
than in densely built-up centers, and that the costs of living
and costs of local government soar in large population concentrations.&quot;<B>
 </B>This view is echoed by USC professors Peter Gordon and Harry
Richardson, who say that business and industry has followed people
out to the less expensive suburbs.  They warn:  &quot;Problems
are most likely to arise when restrictive zoning measures prevent
industrial deconcentration or when 'slow growth' or 'growth centers'
policies limit it.&quot;<B>  </B>What this amounts to is that
job-creation will be undermined severely by the imposition of
&quot;compact development.&quot;
<P>
 Gordon and Richardson's USC colleague Richard Peiser makes the
point that &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is, over time, self-correcting.
 That is, in a freely operating land market, suburban areas promote
higher-density development and are converted eventually into high
density areas.  Central land-use planning of the sort envisioned
by SB 377 is therefore unnecessary.
<H2>The Wide Net of SB 377 </H2>

<P>
 What is most troublesome about SB 377 is the wide net it throws.
 Through its planning mechanisms, it seeks to address public infrastructure
investment, social equity considerations, environmental quality,
natural resource protection, housing affordability, and a myriad
of other goals and subgoals.  And despite all its soothing talk
of &quot;coordination,&quot; &quot;consistency,&quot; and &quot;cooperation,&quot;
the bill admits the problem:
<P>
[C]onflicts may occur between one or more goals or objectives
referenced in this section.  Therefore, it is the intent of the
Legislature that these conflicts be resolved by locating the development
and infrastructure necessary to accomodate planned levels of growth
within more compact development patterns within designated urban
areas established through a local regional planning process. .
. .
<P>
<B> </B>A clue to the nature and intensity of the conflicts inherent
in the bill's far-reaching goals can be seen in the provision
to &quot;ensure that the decisionmaking process regarding growth
and economic development reflects the ethnic, racial, gender,
and occupational diversity of California&quot; and &quot;that
substantive decisions provide for a fair and equitable sharing
of benefits and burdens among all ethnic, racial, gender, and
occupational groups.&quot;  SB 377 offers only vague generalizations
about how these goals will be implemented, e.g., it speaks of
&quot;measures to ensure enhanced representation of and accountability
to the state's diverse population in the decisionmaking process.&quot;
 Would .......such measures include subsidies to certain groups
or quotas in housing and quotas on government land-use planning
boards?  It is ominous in this context that a laundry list of
activist pro-affirmative action organizations (e.g., MALDEF and
the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans) have lined up in support
of SB 377.
<P>
 In sum, SB 377, for all its good intentions, will not achieve
its goals and will dangerously impair intelligent land-use planning
by cities and localities.  It incorporates many of the worst features
of central planning.  If Californians wish to achieve the goals
contained in SB 377-economic development, cleaner air, less congested
roads, etc.-they would do well to turn instead to the many market-based
solutions on the table.
<H2>Market-based Solutions</H2>

<P>
 Instead of comprehensive land use planning, our goal should be
a growth-management framework that allows the market to be largely
self-regulating.  
<P>
 A more direct and effective state strategy for growth management
would work through changes in the state Standard Zoning and Enabling
Act, the basic charter for local land-use planning authority.
 Through amendments to this act, the state could establish the
following guidelines:
<P>
*  Allow the building of accessory units in or on the property
of single family housing.  This would generate additional density
in suburbs without radically altering their character.  The Kemp
Commission on Affordable Housing estimates that this policy would
result in over three million affordable housing units nationwide.
 That is larger than the whole stock of publicly owned housing
in the nation.
<P>
*  Require that all residential land be zoned at up to eight units
to the acre, or some other moderate density standard.  This too
would generate additional density in places where there is demand
for it.  And it could encourage the private provision of open
space by allowing a reduction in minimum lot size.
<P>
*  Adopt an effective measure to reduce planning delays.  In Massachusetts,
local planning bodies have 120 days to rule.  If they do not,
approval is automatic.  Extensions are allowed under extraordinary
circumstances that are tightly defined.  Approvals may not be
appealed.  Refusals may be appealed to a judicial body established
by the state.  That body, too, has a strict time limit under which
to operate.
<P>
*  Restrict the use of impact fees, especially for &quot;infill&quot;
development.  We should fund our roads, which are the most costly
component of the infrastructure problem, with tolls and user charges,
as mentioned above.
<P>
 In addition, we should pass legislation allowing direct user-charges,
especially in the form of variable-rate or peak-hour pricing.
 A direct road pricing scheme will be a powerful incentive, in
the form of spontaneous price signals, for infill development
and rural land conservation.
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
 As Californians wrestle over what our state should like in the
years to come, the keen observation of Nobel laureate economist
Frederick Hayek in his <I>Constitution of Liberty</I> should serve
as a warning to policy-maker who seek further centralization of
the planning function:
<P>
We must not overlook the fact that the market has, on the whole,
guided the evolution of cities more successfully, though imperfectly,
than is commonly realized and that most proposals to improve upon
this, not by making it work better, but by superimposing a system
of central direction, show little awareness of what such a system
would have to accomplish, even to equal the market in effectiveness.

Trends Point To Chaos:<BR>
California's Budget And California's Future
</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
When the 1993-94 state budget compromise was reached, a collective
sigh of relief arose from the Capitol.  The dread possibility
of a repeat of last year's budget stalemate was avoided.  But
this relief is shortsighted.  The fiscal and budgetary trends
of the past several years, taken with projections for the rest
of the decade, suggest strongly that unless dramatic steps are
taken to revive the state's economy, California is headed toward
an economic Armageddon.
<H2>Declining Revenues</H2>

<P>
For three years California's government has overprojected revenues.
 In 1990-91, the state's initial revenue estimate was $5 billion
too high.  In 1991-92 the overestimate was $7 billion.  In 1992-93,
it was high again by about $5 billion.  In other words, the aggregate
miscalculation of revenue projections over the past three years
was $17 billion-or 11 percent of that period's aggregate budget
total.
<P>
Why were these forecasts so grossly inaccurate?  Because they
were based on false predictions of a statewide economic recovery.
<P>
It is worth emphasizing that the decline in state revenues is
not the result of low taxation.  Indeed, in 1991-92 California
experienced the biggest tax increase in its history.  Still revenues
fell.  As the Legislative Analyst's Office concluded, &quot;Most
of this weakness in the performance of state revenues can be attributed
to the weak performance of the state's economy.&quot;  It continued:
 
<P>
The state's revenue forecasting models, which are based primarily
on historical relationships between economic variables and tax
receipts, are currently subject to greater-than-normal error margins.
 In part, this reflects the fact that the state has no relevant
historical experience to guide it in forecasting revenues under
severe recessionary conditions.
<P>
We must conclude:  The urgent question for the Governor and the
Legislature is <I>not</I> how to increase taxes, but how to revive
the state's economy.  Unfortunately, despite a lot of rhetoric
about making California competitive again, little positive has
been done to revive the state's business climate.
<P>
Early this year, California's Department of Finance (DoF) forecast
modest economic gains following the third quarter of 1993 and
continuing through 1994.  But its recent survey of state revenue
figures revealed June 1993 sales tax revenues of $121 million,
7.3 percent below its own earlier projections.  Reporting general
fund revenues through June to be $65 million below its forecast,
DoF acknowledged:  &quot;California's recession entered its fourth
year in June, with few signs of any sustained turnaround....&quot;
 
<P>
Independent experts agree.  Consider a May 1993 study by Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric:  &quot;California shows very few signs of
immediate recovery from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.&quot;
 According to PG&amp;E projections, state unemployment in 1994
will remain between 9.0 and 9.5 percent, or 2.0 to 2.5 percent
higher than the national unemployment level.
<P>
If such independent analyses are accurate, one can expect another
state budget shortfall in 1994, in addition to the $2.7 billion
deficit rolled over as part of the 1993 budget compromise.
<P>
Since the end of fiscal year 1989, the state has had to borrow
money-despite the existence on paper of positive budget balances-because
of a hidden cash-flow problem.  It is estimated that this cash
flow &quot;gap&quot; will total $1.7 billion at the end of 1993-94.
 More ominously, the state has been borrowing money against future
revenues.  By the end of 1993-94, it will be saddled with a $2-billion
liability that does not show up in the normal budget numbers.
<P>
Furthermore, even with the state's optimistic economic forecast,
the Legislative Analyst's Office projects a budget shortfall for
1994-95 of another $5 billion.
<P>
In brief, the underlying ills of California's economy, as outlined
in last year's Council on California Competitiveness report, have
yet to be addressed by state policymakers.  Overregulation, high
taxes, and a Byzantine legal system continue to drive jobs and
industry out of the state.
<H2>Spending Growth</H2>

<P>
At the same time economic stagnation reduces revenues, state spending
continues to rise.
<P>
It is often said that 85 to 90 percent of the budget is &quot;locked
in.&quot;  This means that most of the programs in the budget
(such as education and welfare) are automatically fully funded.
 Thus, for instance, under Proposition 98 spending formulas, K-12
education must not only receive a minimum 40 percent of the budget,
it also receives an inordinate share of extra revenues.  Because
such programs are run according to automatic spending formulas,
any increase in the number of program recipients requires the
state to spend more money, regardless of whether it has any money.
 That is, as the numbers of public school students, welfare recipients,
Medi-Cal recipients, etc. continue to increase, spending must
increase regardless of the state's funding resources.  Alarmingly,
these increases are projected to accelerate for the rest of the
decade.
<P>
In the aggregate, there are now six taxpayers for every five tax
recipients in California.  By 1995, it is estimated that the state
will have more tax recipients than taxpayers.  And by the year
2000, the imbalance will worsen to the point where there will
be only four taxpayers for every five tax recipients.
<P>
The consequences are clear:  &quot;After 1993-94, the shortfall
continues to widen because of the on-going disparity between baseline
spending growth and the rate of revenue growth.&quot;  In other
words, deficits will worsen.
<P>
Consider education:  The K-14 student population will increase
by 85,000 from 1993 to 1994.  This represents an added funding
responsibility of more than $300 million.  Longer term, student
population is projected to increase 40 percent (three times faster
than the working and taxpaying population) through 2000.  Even
assuming that state spending remains at $4,200 per student, this
would translate into an additional cost of $5.8 billion.  Nor
does this include the cost of building new schools to accomodate
the additional students, which could add another $1.1 billion
to the total.
<P>
The fact is, in California, education has become an entitlement
program.  According to Prop 98 funding formulas, today's $4,200-per-student
state spending rate has become an effective spending floor.  Although
Governor Wilson has thus far prevailed over the public school
establishment in interpreting Prop 98, state spending per student
has not declined.  Also under Prop 98, when economic conditions
force the state to limit increases in education spending, drastic
increases are required when the economy recovers-regardless of
whether the public and its representatives believe such increases
are warranted.  Such requirements have placed the budget on automatic
pilot, in effect guaranteeing increased spending and widening
deficits.
<P>
Or consider welfare:  In 1992-93, approximately 2.46 million Californians
were on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the state's
principal welfare program.  This will increase by 114,000 to 2.57
million in 1993-94.  By the year 2000, it will have increased
to almost 3 million.  Costs to the state's general fund would
rise from $2.9 billion this year to $4-4.5 billion in 2000.  According
to 1992 DoF estimates, in 1980 there were 6.9 taxpayers for each
AFDC recipient.  By 2000, this ratio will be 2.94-1.
<P>
Medi-Cal is another entitlement program that is headed toward
unprecedented caseload growth.  In 1993-94, Medi-Cal will cost
the state's general fund $5.5 billion, with 5.4 million people
qualifying.  By the end of the decade, the number of recipients
is projected to rise to 6.8 million, costing the state general
fund $12.3 billion.
<P>
Finally, conservative estimates are that 100,000 foreigners per
year enter California illegally to join the 1.3 million illegal
immigrants already here.  The State Auditor General estimates
the net cost of the services provided by state and local governments
to illegal aliens to be a whopping $3 billion a year.  Nor does
this take into account the infants born to illegal aliens in the
state, who are then classified as U.S. citizens.  In California's
public schools, 866,000 students (17 percent of the total public
school population) are the children of illegal and noncitizen
immigrants.  These students cost the state and local school districts
$3.6 billion a year.
<P>
Although it is difficult not to feel real sympathy for the hardships
that these people are forced to endure in their homelands, the
cold, hard fact is that the costs they impose on state taxpayers
are just as real and are growing exponentially.  With guaranteed
spending formulas in place for education and other social services,
illegal immigration threatens to break the bank.
<P>
These spending trends, added together with declining revenue trends,
indicate that fiscal chaos lies just around the corner.  In fact,
state finance experts have openly discussed the possibility of
a $20-billion state budget deficit by the year 2000.
<H2>Dead-end Reforms</H2>

<P>
California's recurring budget deficits have spawned a couple of
proposed solutions.  One is multi-year budgeting.  Instead of
trying to balance the budget every year, multi-year budgeting
allows for the deficit to be spread over a two-or-more-year period.
 This is the so-called &quot;rollover'' of the deficit that was
agreed to in the 1993 compromise.  
<P>
Unfortunately, multi-year budgeting fails to address the real
budget trends described above.  It does nothing to revive the
economy or increase revenues.  Nor does it reduce caseload growth
in entitlement programs or government spending in general.  Multi-year
budgeting is a stopgap measure that only delays the day of reckoning.
<P>
The second idea to solve the state's budget problems is reducing
the legislative vote requirement for budget approval from two-thirds
to a simple majority.  The argument here is that by allowing a
simple majority to approve a budget, the majority party in the
Legislature will have to shoulder full responsibility.
<P>
Although this proposal is theoretically appealing from a democratic
point of view, it has several problems.  First, from a practical
perspective, it would give the current big-spending liberal majority
carte blanche to exacerbate the budget problem beyond repair.
 Second, it does not address the so-called &quot;trailer bills&quot;
which set specific spending totals for state programs.  Unless
these latter (which currently require a two-thirds vote) are also
subject to majority approval, a majority vote on the budget resolution
would be useless.
<P>
Finally, as with rolling over the deficit, this reform does not
address the root problems:  declining revenues and rising expenditures.
<H2>Radical Reforms Needed</H2>

<P>
Is it possible to avert fiscal chaos in California?  Yes.  But
several painful and difficult steps must be taken.
<P>
What is required is nothing less than a radical overhaul of the
tax-spend-and-regulate status quo in Sacramento.  In brief, the
state's economy must be revived through tax cuts and a wholesale
rollback of regulations.  
<P>
On the spending front, Proposition 98 must be amended or suspended
and parents should be provided vouchers to send their children
to more cost-effective private schools.  Whole bureaucracies should
be eliminated, either through privatization or by recognizing
that they are not needed.  Welfare should be cut significantly.
 The state should eliminate all services to illegal aliens, even
if it means challenging the federal government and the courts.
<P>
These steps are painful and difficult indeed.  But only such a
radical prescription will steer us clear of economic chaos.

REGULATING THE AMERICAN DREAM:<BR>
THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA
<H1>Conference Summary</H1>

</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
<I>To examine and evaluate California's current housing crisis,
the Claremont Institute and the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) sponsored a conference on June
1-2, 1993 in Newport Beach, entitled &quot;Regulating the American
Dream:  The Housing Crisis in California.&quot;  This is a brief
report on its major speeches, discussions and conclusions.  </I>
<P>
California's population continues to grow as the construction
of reasonably priced housing units is sharply declining.  The
state's housing is among the least affordable in the nation. 
What accounts for this?  Some say &quot;too much growth.&quot;
 Others point to regulation of the home building industry.  On
June 1-2, leaders from state and local governments, the academy,
the building industry and environmental organizations gathered
in Newport Beach to address this disagreement on panels dealing
with growth and demographics, regulatory barriers, environmental
regulation, impact fees, the credit crunch, and growth management.
<P>
&quot;Regulating the American Dream:  The Housing Crisis in California&quot;
featured luncheon addresses by Thomas Sayles, Secretary of the
California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, and Anthony
Downs of the Brookings Institution.  Secretary Sayles demonstrated
that housing regulation is responsible for preventing development
in the inner-cities.  Builders who might consider financing larger
and more affordable projects are being driven away by over-regulation
and the huge costs associated with the approval process.  Mr.
Downs seconded this argument, explaining how those most hurt by
regulations are often those whom the regulations are intended
to help.  
<P>
A discussion of the Endangered Species Act dominated the first
afternoon.  Douglas Wheeler, Secretary of the California Resources
Agency and one of the original architects of the legislation,
argued that the law's original intent was to protect endangered
species on public lands.  Gradually the law came to include private
lands as well.  Mr. Wheeler suggested that governmental &quot;takings&quot;
of private property be eliminated in favor of a program that purchased
private lands inhabited by endangered species.  Claremont Institute
President Larry Arnn warned that if there were insufficient funds
for such a program, development would likely be stopped.  Property
owners would then be forced to pay the entire cost of species
protection.
<P>
On the second morning, Richard Sybert, Director of the California
Office of Planning and Research, presented Governor Wilson's Strategic
Growth Plan.  He noted that the plan purposefully avoids the phrase
&quot;growth management&quot; in order to reflect the fact that
better planning and regulatory reform would result in job creation
and economic development.  The Governor's plan does not arbitrarily
limit growth, but would enable the state to adjust to inevitable
population increases.
<P>
Most attendees expressed caution regarding state involvement in
land-use issues.  While the state should advocate reform of local
regulations hindering housing development, it should not replace
local government as the authority on land-use decisions.
<P>
The conference concluded with a plenary session moderated by HCD
Director Timothy Coyle and Claremont Institute President Larry
Arnn.  Its overwhelming conclusion was that immediate action is
needed to reverse the troubling trend toward over-regulation.
 Six adverse polices that should be reformed and four positive
actions to be taken by state and local governments were identified:
<H2>ADVERSE POLICIES TO BE REFORMED</H2>

<P>
1. CEQA REVIEWS-Under the California Environmental Quality Act,
construction reviews are concluded when the project is in progress.
 Mandated changes customarily involve enormous expense that is
passed on to the consumer.  It would be more reasonable for these
reviews to be conducted in the planning stage.
<P>
2. IMPACT FEES-As things stand, impact fees can exceed $25,000
per housing unit.  In addition to decreasing the number of affordable
units, these fees place a heavy and inequitable burden for public
works and local government services on new home buyers-primarily
the young and the poor.  These fees should be reduced in number
as well as amount and brought into line with the cost of the actual
service provided.
<P>
3. UNCOMPENSATED TAKINGS-Through regulation, state and local governments
are unjustly reducing the worth of private property.  The state
should develop means to ensure enforcement of the takings clause
of the Fifth Amendment.
<P>
4. DOWNZONING-Zoning ordinances which limit the number of units
built on a piece of property force home builders to overbuild
the high-price end of the housing market.  Inevitably, when that
surplus is realized, crashing property values have a severe economic
impact.  Downzoning should be discontinued through the adoption
of minimum-density standards.
<P>
5. DELAYS AND FEE INCREASES-A largely unrecognized problem faced
by home builders is the length of time required to obtain the
necessary permits and approvals.  Time is money, and the new home
buyer or renter is the one who will end up paying for that time.
 In addition, regulatory changes are sometimes made and fees increased
in mid-project.  The  permit process should be streamlined and
fees should be guaranteed at the project inception.  
<P>
6. FEDERALIZATION-Broad national standards fitting a certain theoretical
model are increasingly applied without exception to the many,
diverse communities of the country.  At best these regulations
are unnecessary or irrelevant.  At worst they are contrary to
their intended purpose.  The principle of allowing local people
to decide local issues should be revived.
<H2>POSITIVE ACTIONS</H2>

<P>
1. FOCUS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION-The state should shift its priorities
to focus on housing production rather than regulation.
<P>
2. UNIVERSAL 8 UNITS/ACRE-The state should adopt the recommendation
of the HUD Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing
to allow up to 8 housing units per acre.
<P>
3. TIME LIMITS-The state should set strict limits on delays, guaranteeing
that unless permits are denied within a set period of time, development
may proceed as planned.
<P>
4. USE OF AVAILABLE FUNDS-State and local governments should use
existing funds to compensate for unjust takings.
<P>
California's population will continue to grow and the demand for
housing in the state will increase.  It is time to recognize that
life in California will be different than it was in the 1950s.
 This is not to say it will be bad.  Market forces should be given
latitude in helping California adjust to changing demographics
and economic forces.  We cannot afford to stifle opportunity.
 We must encourage the private initiative that has always made
California great.

Environmental Protection through Market Incentives:
A Strategy for the Future
</h1>

</CENTER>

<P>
<I>The Claremont Institute and the California Environmental Protection
Agency sponsored a major conference, entitled &quot;Environmental
Protection Through Market Incentives: A Strategy for the Future,&quot;
at the Los Angeles Biltmore on January 20-21, 1993.  This conference
addressed the promise of market-based solutions to environmental
problems, as opposed to the command-and-control strategies of
the past.  The following two essays are adapted from the luncheon
speeches delivered at the conference.</I>
<P>

<CENTER>
*     *     *
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>&quot;That We Should Fix The Roof While The Sun Is Shining&quot;</B>
<P>
James M. Strock, California Secretary for Environmental Protection
<P>
 There are just a couple of points I'd like to make.  The first
concerns where this market incentive issue fits into what Cal/EPA
is trying to do overall to meet the Governor's agenda.  The Governor
made it clear from Day One that a key goal of his in creating
Cal/EPA was to help reconcile environmental improvement and economic
activity and also to change the dialogue in this area.  Clearly
market incentives are key opportunities for us in these very difficult
times.
<P>
 There are three key priorities: (1) reform and simplification
of the permitting process, (2) taking advantage of environmental
technology, and (3) moving toward better market incentive policies.
<P>
 Today, government <I>truly is</I> looking at market incentives,
because it simply cannot meet all of the mandates, much less the
expectations now before it, through traditional means.  Public
support will not be there when you look at some of the implications
of continuing along the lines of the past.  That's not to discredit
the past; it is merely to keep growing and go beyond it.
<P>
 The areas of market incentives which we are focused on at this
conference over these are very important, and we hope to leave
here with one or two proposals that, working with key legislators
and with the Governor's leadership, we might be able to be put
into practice in the next few years.  That includes tradable permit
systems.  And I'd remind people that there is a real potential
for a national debate on this concept in conjunction with the
Clean Water Act reauthorization this coming year.  Also, we intend
to continue to help in the RECLAIM efforts, and to look at the
use of market incentives in transportation areas and in informational
areas like Prop 65 and the toxics release inventory.  Finally,
state procurement efforts are already occurring for alternative
fuel vehiclesthe &quot;Green Lights&quot; program and others.
<P>
 That being said, why is this so important?  Why does this matter
to us so much right now?
<P>
 First, I think it's because market incentive programs, if they
work, empower people.  They give people more choicesthat is, better
choicesin how to produce things and how to meet environmental
standards.  They also lead to better informed decisions by consumers,
as will occur when Prop 65 meets its purpose.  
<P>
 A second reason market incentives are desirable is that they
hold the promise of reducing the number of middlemen or middlewomen
in the process.  There are two types of these that are most important.
 One is government itself involved in permit decisions.  The other
is the myriad of lawyers and consultants who now have to get paid
several hundred dollars an hour to figure out how to do these
things.  We all know that this is not value-added activity.  Here
is a key area where we can make progress on transaction fees consistent
with the need to protect the environment.
<P>
 So what are the implications of market-incentive programs that
we have to think about as we move ahead, particularly if we want
to get public support?
<P>
 First, it is very important that the early efforts be made to
work and be seen to work.  That, of course, is a big issue with
the very strong leadership moves by the South Coast Air Quality
District on RECLAIM.  There are very tough questions with respect
to the inventories being considered, and the baseline numbers
that result, and the enforcement and monitoring that will result.
 But these are not reasons to give up.  They are reasons to press
on very hard.  
<P>
 Second, we need to look at integrated pollution control.  The
existing divisions between air and water and waste and pesticides
really only make sense because of the way these laws were created.
 If we were starting today, for either environmental or economic
reasons, we would not proceed based on these divisions.  The fact
is that if market incentive programs are done totally without
regard to the effect of, for instance, air programs on water programs,
or programs in one geographic area on another geographic area,
we will not be doing a service but merely recreating the kind
of trouble we have had in the past. 
<P>
 Finally, there are very tough distributional issues among businesses
and among people in general.  But again, we can make these things
work and make progress.  The key is to work together now and to
focus on this very directly within the next few months.
<P>
 We all know there is very strong public support-as there ought
to be-for environmental protection.  But it is important, given
the tremendous resources California is putting into environmental
protection, that we fix the roof while the sun is shining and
improve the system.  We're being driven toward it by competition
both here and, of course, abroad.
<P>
 When The Claremont Institute was putting together parts of this
conference, it turned out that some international journalists
were going to come and cover it.  This is because market incentive
programs are something their countries might adopt.  They don't
come and cover our decisions on permitting because they don't
want to adopt our permitting system.  That ought to tell us something.
 What we are doing today is going to be a very real economic and
environmental benefitif it's done right.  The choice lies with
people like those at this conference and their willingness to
work with leaders like the Governor who seek to move forward in
this area.
<P>
 Finally, a personal point.  David Sive, of the Environmental
Law Institute, has made the point that the whole first phase of
environmental protection in this country was unique in being a
social movement driven by law and lawyers.  And so it was.  And
what a remarkable achievement it was.  But I think the next phase
will not be so dominated by laws and lawyers.  Now there are tremendous
opportunities to bring together the environment and the economy,
including the people who are creative in business and the people
who work in science.  
<P>
 In the future, we should keep the benefits of a legal approach
while also being mindful of at least one negative: lawyers tend
to get paid to go through a big document or a big problem and
come back with a whole list of more problems.  That is very useful
in its place.  But we can't let this kind of attention to detail
limit the greater vision or opportunities we have.  And I hope
that with strong leadership we can get to the next phase and do
something quite productive.

<B>Market Incentives and Market Opportunities:</B>
<P>
<B>A Fresh Look at Environmental Regulation in California</B>
<P>
Julie Meier Wright, California Secretary for Trade and Commerce
<P>
 At the heart of the long-term solution needed to strengthen California's
economy is the need for dramatic changes in our current method
of environmental protection.  While we recognize the need to safeguard
our environment, there also exists an opportunity for California
to benefit from our expertise as innovators in a $200 billion
annual worldwide market for environmental technology.
<P>
 If it is true that past is prologue, then we should look at recent
events in planning for the future.  An underlying dynamic in the
collapse of Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the
dramatic changes in the nations of Eastern Europe was the utter
failure of the command-and-control economic system in those nations.
<P>
 A command-and-control system cannot compete with a free market
system.  The economies of Eastern Europe and Soviet Union collapsed
because of their inability to meet the fundamental needs of their
people.  The free market economies of the West and the Pacific
Rim won an economic victory over communism.
<P>
 There is a lesson for us here.  The same is true for a command-and-control
based method of environmental protection.  The Wilson Administration
is proposing to move to a market incentive based system of environmental
protection.  We believe such a move will make California's economy
more efficient and competitive, while simultaneously providing
us with a cleaner environment.
<P>
 This conference has included some fabulous presentations on the
specifics of establishing a market incentive based program of
environmental protection.  I want to touch upon the economic advantages
for California and the opportunities to create California jobs
in both market-incentive based environmental protection and cutting-edge
environmental technology.  I also want to provide a business perspective
on the ways in which Governor Wilson and his Administration are
working to streamline California's environmental regulations to
make our state more competitive and on some of the initiatives
we are supporting to nurture our state's environmental technology
industry.
<P>
 California is a major player in the global economy.  Were we
an independent nation, we would have the world's eighth largest
economy.  Trade plays a vital role in our state's economy.  Since
1990, California has suffered a loss of 800,000 jobs.  It would
have been far worse if not for our growing international trade.
 During this period, California exports grew by $4.7 billion,
creating nearly 50,000 new jobs.  These jobs are just the beginning.
 California is ideally situated to take advantage of the explosive
increase in global commerce.
<P>
 At the turn of the century, American diplomat John Hay said,
&quot;The Mediterranean is the ocean of the past, the Atlantic
is the ocean of the present, the Pacific is the ocean of the future.&quot;
 For California, Hay's prophecy is coming true.  Today eight of
our top ten trading partners are Pacific Rim nations.  The importance
of this is illustrated by the fact that U.S. trade with the Pacific
Rim is greater than our trade with Atlantic Basin nations.
<P>
 In addition to looking west to the Pacific Rim, we must look
south to Mexico and ultimately, I hope, to all of Central and
South America.  A study by KPMG Peat Marwick estimates that the
North American Free Trade Agreement will mean the creation of
3,800 jobs per year and an additional $2.3 billion annually for
our state's economy.  
<P>
 Clearly, trade and the global economy are vital to our state.
 When Governor Wilson named me Secretary of the newly-created
cabinet-level Trade and Commerce Agency, he gave me a mandate
to expand California's role in international trade.  He recognizes
the inexorable linkage between trade and job growth, and the absolute
necessity for California to compete in the global marketplace.
<P>
 For California businesses to compete in this global marketplace,
they must be what I call &quot;competitive at the bottom line.&quot;
 They need a cooperative relationship with California's regulators
to replace the adversarial relationship that too often exists
today.  Let me stress that I'm not talking about reduced environmental
standards-California's strong health and safety standards are
vital to our quality of life.  They are part of the reason we've
been able to attract a high-quality workforce.  And, for the most
part, it's not the standards that create the Excedrin-sized headaches
for our state's business community.  The problem lies in the command-and-control
regulations with which businesses must comply.  Our environmental
standards should be descriptive, not prescriptive; results-based,
not rules-based.
<P>
 Californians are the most innovative people in the world.  What
we need are clear standards that allow businesses flexibility
to meet them in ways best suited to their businesses.  We should
set limits, not mandate how businesses reach those limits.  I
think we would be pleasantly surprised at the results.  This approach
offers two clear advantages.  First, it makes our businesses more
competitive.  Second, it enables us to deploy cutting-edge technology.
<P>
 What is the competitive issue?  Primarily that for business time
is money.  The game of regulatory roulette some of our businesses
find themselves playing can quickly turn into a game of Russian
roulette: you never know when you may find yourself looking down
the barrel at a job-killing regulatory delay.  Sadly, but understandably,
we in the Trade and Commerce Agency find that some businesses
refuse to play this game.  They find it safer to move their jobs
and capital to other states or nations.  Not so they don't have
to comply with high standards, but so that they can have confidence
that they can bring their investments on-line in a timely way.
 The result for California is lost jobs.
<P>
 For this reason, Governor Wilson asked Secretary Jim Strock of
Cal/EPA and me to work together to streamline our system of environmental
regulations.  This state permit reform effort has been an inclusive
one, and several state agencies are exploring the feasibility
of market-based incentives.  The market-incentive program that
has been undertaken by the South Coast AQMD evolved from such
a process.  We support this program and are convinced that it
will provide us with an important body of knowledge as we seek
to apply market-based incentives to other environmental regulatory
programs.
<P>
 The Governor's Council on California Competitiveness found that
72 different agencies-local, state and federal-have environmental
authority in Los Angeles County alone, with a typical business
requiring a dozen or so permits.  A new business might have successfully
filed 12 permits, and then have their opening delayed due to problems
with required permit number 13.  For large companies, this means
overhead in the form of experts to work a complex process.  For
a small company, this could mean an inability even to get off
the ground-at a time when new small companies are key to bringing
California out of the recession.
<P>
 At a meeting with Sacramento business leaders earlier this month,
one entrepreneur told Governor Wilson, &quot;I'd rather get a
'no' in two months than a 'yes' in two years.&quot;  I can tell
you that if all we can promise is two years, we won't even have
the chance to try.  And more California jobs will disappear.
<P>
 What are we doing about it?  We're pushing through permit streamlining
and one-stop permitting.  In addition, we're working with Cal/EPA
to assign an environmental compliance specialist to each of the
Trade and Commerce Agency's four regional offices, as front-line
business assistance.  The Red Team approach I brought to state
government works, but it's only a temporary solutionand it's not
a substitute for sound public policy reform that makes compatible
a clean environment and a strong economy.
<P>
 Eliminating the command-and-control approach also enables us
to bring cutting-edge environmental technology to the marketplace
far more quickly.  The very nature of a command-and-control system
of regulation means that environmental technologies are often
obsolete by the time they travel through the regulatory gauntlet.
 We will all benefitin high environmental standards and in developing
new marketsif we create a system that gets cutting-edge technology
into the marketplace as soon as possible.  We will enable businesses
to better meet their environmental obligations and to do so more
quickly and less expensively, and we will create California jobs.
<P>
 As you may have detected by now, the California endangered species
that concerns me most is the high-wage job.  Nothing has a greater
adverse effect on one's immediate environment than losing one's
job.  The beauty of the regulatory reforms we're discussing at
this conference is that they will positively affect both our physical
environment and our economic environment.
<P>
 In announcing the creation of the California Environmental Protection
Agency, Governor Wilson said: &quot;Environmental protection and
economic progress should not be viewed as competing goals but,
to the greatest possible extent, as complementary.  Where traditional
command-and-control regulation can be effectively supplemented
or supplanted by protective and legally enforceable market incentive
arrangements, we should do so.&quot;
<P>
 Just as a market-incentive based economy enabled us to win the
Cold War, so too will market-based environmental regulation enable
us to win the economic battles we are now fighting.  The command-and-control
economic system of the Soviet Union couldn't compete with free
market economies.  By taking the global lead in moving away from
a command-and-control regulatory system, we will have the competitive
advantage we need to successfully compete for jobs and industry.

<P>
 In addition to making our existing industries more competitive,
moving California into the forefront of new environmental technologies
helps us to grow an exciting new industry in which we already
have a strong foothold.  At present, there is a $200 billion annual
worldwide market for environmental technology.  California's share
is $25 billion.  When I look at a $25 billion industrial base
for California, I see a lot of jobs.  I also see opportunity for
even more growth.  Just by maintaining our market share, we would
see some growth due to an increasing demand for environmental
technologya demand that has the market growing at a sustained
7-8 percent per year.
<P>
 One of the things I learned in the private sector is that you
never stop marketing.  And you don't just maintain market share,
you gain share or you lose it.  
<P>
 There are some other reasons why the environmental technology
field is well-suited to providing the jobs our state needs.  Environmental
jobs are first and foremost technology jobs.  California is blessed
with a rich technology heritage and a technologically capable
workforce that is a national asset.  Many of these high-skilled
workers have been hurt by the defense budget cuts.  We have lost
more than 90,000 direct jobs, and their ripple effect on our overall
employment is 200,000 jobs-nearly 25 percent of our job loss since
the recession began.  For environmental technology business growth,
this shrinking defense base is a good source of skilled professionals-managerial,
engineering, and manufacturing.  A number of our aerospace companies
have already moved into the environmental control area by, in
some cases, adapting space technology and, in other cases, bringing
to the challenges of environmental cleanup their strong systems
engineering talents.
<P>
 Technology jobs demand a strong educational base, and our public
and private universities will continue to produce the scientists
and engineers needed to help us keep our technological edge. 
This is a high growth industry, just what we need to provide the
jobs for a rapidly growing population.  Today's $200 billion market
doesn't come close to providing the environmental protection and
mitigation our globe needs, and I believe that the steady growth
rate of the past few years will escalate as countries have the
opportunity to do it right the first time. 
<P>
 Earlier this century, California enjoyed tremendous spurts of
growth as we assumed world leadership in technology-intensive
industries such as aviation and electronics.  Today, there are
more than a million jobs associated with the high-technology industries
in our state.  When we are in a position to apply technology,
and when we create a regulatory environment that will let us retain
manufacturing jobs, we can create large numbers of jobs in California.
<P>
 Our high environmental standards have created a strong local
market for technology solutions.  Combined with our understanding
of world markets, this places us in a good position to compete
on a global basis.  There is a worldwide market for environmental
technology.  International trade is going to play a major role
in California's economic recovery, and this industry is becoming
one of our most important exports.
<P>
 These competitive advantages in and of themselves are not enough
for California's environmental technology industry to reach its
full potential.  Government has an important role to play.  After
all, government-mandated environmental standards created this
market for environmental technology.
<P>
 Governor Wilson identified environmental technology in his State
of the State address as a major area for economic growth and job
creation, and outlined a series of business incentives that will
spur the growth of this and other 21st century industries.  These
incentives will be particularly helpful to small businesses, start-up
businesses, and technology-based businessesthree categories into
which many of our environmental firms fall.
<P>
 These proposals include: (1) Increasing the research-and-development
tax credit from 8 percent to 12 percent, and doubling it to 24
percent for university-based research.  (2) Last year, Governor
Wilson signed legislation which makes it easier for small companies
to issue stock.  This year, he is calling for a small business
investment tax credit, one which encourages patient capital. 
The investment tax credit would be on a sliding scalefour percent
for investments held two years up to 16 percent for longer-term
investments.  (3) Restoring the Net Operating Loss carry forward
provision in 1993.
<P>
 The Governor has also asked his newly formed Council of Economic
Advisors headed by former Secretary of State and Secretary of
Treasury George Schultz to determine how a sales tax exemption
or investment tax credit on manufacturing equipment purchases
can be implemented in a way that will create the greatest number
of new jobs and the highest return to the General Fund.  At a
time of continuing budget crisis, the decision to call for these
tax incentives was not easily reached.  However, the Governor
believes the answer to California's economic ills is jobs-and
that incentives to create job growth are vital.
<P>
 Finally, to lead our state's efforts in marketing environmental
technology, the Governor created a blue-ribbon task forcethe California
Environmental Technology Partnership-composed of business leaders,
environmental groups and research institutions and the continuing
partnership of Cal/EPA and the Trade and Commerce Agency.
<P>
 Regulatory reform and business incentives require the support
of the Legislature, and they need to hear from you.  I hope each
of you will support our efforts towards market incentive-based
environmental regulation, towards regulatory reform and permit
streamlining, towards a government-industry-academic-environmental
partnership, and towards the implementation of the kind of business
incentives which will provide a dynamic boost to the environmental
technology industry and other emerging companies in our state.
<P>
 We also need your help in supporting real workers' compensation
reform.  Our best efforts at creating new industries will be for
naught if our scandalous workers' compensation system drives the
jobs out of state.
<P>
 This is an exciting time in California.  Today we have the opportunity
not just to move toward market-based incentives to allow California
companies predictability and creativity to respond, but we also
have the opportunity to take the fruits of that creativity and
market it around the world.  Then California's high standards
will have paid off in not only a cleaner environment, but in sustained
economic growtha real win-win situation for the Golden State.

<TITLE>How California Can Lead the Way Against Illegal Immigration</TITLE>

<h1>How California Can Lead the Way<BR>
Against Illegal Immigration</h1>

</CENTER>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<hr>
<p>

In a 1992 Roper Poll, 86 percent of Americans
said that illegal immigration is an important issue.  Yet with
a few notable exceptions, our political leaders have been silent
on the issue.  Why?
<p>

Part of the reason lies in the reluctance of
many of our leaders to violate the taboos of &quot;political correctness.&quot; 
 According to the standards of this code, law and common sense
are no excuses for opposing the growing tide of Mexicans flooding
into California each day.  Thus Congressman Dana Rohrabacher and
others have found that standing against this tide invites charges
of racism in the liberal media.
<p>

In addition, state officials
often dismiss illegal immigration as a federal problem, saying
that there is little they can do about it.

<p>

In this paper, we will
show, first, that the problem of illegal immigration is so dramatic
that the &quot;politically correct&quot; position is economically,
not to mention constitutionally irresponsible.  Second, we will
show that while <I>border control</I> is a federal responsibility,
there is a whole range of actions that California can take on
its own, now, to discourage illegal immigration.

<h3>The Economic Cost of Illegal Immigration</h3>

When confronted with
the immense scale of illegal immigration, opponents of get-tough
policies often claim that it represents an economic boon; that
illegal immigrants work and pay taxes, and that their net impact
on America's economy is positive.  In fact, illegal immigration
places a massive financial burden on California's taxpayers. 

<p>

In a recent report, the State Auditor General's Office has calculated
the costs of illegal immigration on San Diego County alone.  While
acknowledging that illegal immigrants lower the cost of locally
produced goods and services because of the reduced wages they
receive, and contribute $60.5 million in taxes to state and county
government, the report makes it abundantly clear that these benefits
are offset by staggering costs.

<p>

For one thing, more than half of
illegal immigrants do not have taxes withheld from their wages,
and only 19 percent file income tax returns.  For another, illegal
immigrants enjoy many expensive taxpayer-supported government
benefits.

<p>

Consider education.  In San Diego County schools, there
are between 11,000 and 13,000 illegal immigrant children.  The
annual average cost of their education is $49.2 million.  Add
the costs of General Education Grants, Limited English Proficiency
Grants, and tax-subsidized higher education services, and the
total annual cost to county and state taxpayers for educating
illegal immigrants in San Diego County comes to $60.6 million.
 This alone offsets the aforementioned tax revenues.

<p>

Illegal immigrants also enjoy various health-care benefits, including indigent medical
care at specified clinics, maternal health care, Medi-Cal-provided
emergency and pregnancy services, and ambulance and paramedic
services.  The price tag for delivery of these health services
to illegal immigrants living in San Diego County is a hefty $26.6
million per year.

<p>

Social services, especially welfare, represent
a third significant cost.  There were nearly 4,000 cases of illegal-immigrant
use of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)the state's
main welfare programin San Diego County during the course of the
Auditor General's study.  The annual cost runs to $11.7 million.
 Furthermore,

<blockquote>

<P>
It is thought that certain undocumented immigrants gain entry
into the United States illegally <I>for the express purpose of
giving birth to a child on United States soil. </I> Once born
in the United States, the child becomes eligible for a variety
of programs as a United States citizen, including AFDC. . . . 
Technically, under AFDC, it is the United States citizen child
who receives the aid, but the <I>de facto</I> recipients may be
undocumented immigrant parents or family members in guardianship
of the child. 

</blockquote>

<p>
The final large-cost area is the criminal justice
system.  In San Diego County, an average of 16,000 felony and
misdemeanor cases involving illegal immigrants pass through this
system every year.  Add police costs, court costs, district attorney
and public defender costs, probation investigation costs, and
incarceration costs, and the annual price tag amounts to an astounding
$105.7 million.  Of course the larger social costs are inestimable.

<p>

If one adds up the costs of state and local government services to
illegal immigrants in San Diego County, and subtracts illegal
immigrant tax revenues, the annual net cost to taxpayers is a
whopping $145.9 million.

<p>

Again:  this is just San Diego County.
 In Los Angeles County, it is estimated that the net cost of providing
health, education, and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants
rose by almost $70 million (a 34-percent increase) over the past
two years, to a total of $276 million.

<p>

Consider too that California's
state prisons currently hold some 15,000 illegal immigrant convicted
felons.  The cost of feeding and housing them comes to $300 million
per year.  This figure will no doubt increase given the fact that,
according to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, nearly one-third
of the hoodlums who looted and pillaged Los Angeles in the May
1992 riots were illegal immigrants.

<p>

What, then, is the total annual
net cost to Californians of illegal immigration?  By the Auditor
General's conservative estimate, a breathtaking $3 billion.

<p>

Although he was criticized by the liberal media for his comments, the cold,
hard facts support Governor Wilson's observation that illegal
immigration is a significant cause of California's fiscal woes.

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

Illegal immigration is not exclusively a federal
problem.  Indeed, the root of the problem in California lies in
the incentives to illegal immigration which exist in the state
and which can be largely eliminated at the state level.  Below
we list the most important areas in which incentives exist and
numerous specific reform measures which should be taken.

<H4>Government Benefits</H4>

<P>
<B>1.  Implement the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement
computerized data system (SAVE) in all state agencies that grant
benefits.  </B>

<p>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service maintains
SAVE, which lists all legal residents in the United States.  The
federal government now uses SAVE to prevent illegal immigrants
from obtaining welfare and other cash benefits to which they are
not entitled:  If a person's name does not show up on the computer
lists, he or she does not get the benefit.  At this time many
state agencies in charge of supplying benefits do not use SAVE.
 They should be required to do so by executive order and/or legislation
without delay.
<P>
<B>2.  Employ SAVE to screen public housing applicants.</B>
<p>
State
government funds public housing, both by operating public-housing
facilities and by making grants to builders and others for the
construction or rehabilitation of homes and rental units.  Unfortunatelylike
the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington,
D.C.the state does not screen public housing applicants to determine
their residency status.  The officials and agencies involved should
be required to do so.
<P>
<B>3.  Employ SAVE at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  </B>
<p>
Obtaining
benefits often requires valid identification such as a driver's
license.  Procuring such identification is far too easy.  The
Department of Motor Vehicles, for instance, rarely asks about
residency status when issuing a driver's license.  It should be
required to verify such status before any license is issued.
<P>
<B>4.  Require information-sharing between state agencies and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</B>
<p>
As things stand,
there is precious little sharing of information among different
agencies at different levels of government.  Procedures should
be established to require state and county agencies to notify
each other and the INS when they have information that illegal
immigrants are applying for benefits.


<H2>Education</H2>

<P>
<B>1.  Restrict admission to state universities to citizens and
legal residents.  </B>
<p>
Currently, qualified applicants are being
turned away from the public universities of their choice because
of budget limitations and overcrowding.  Yet these tax-supported
schools admit illegal immigrants.  In the Auditor General's report
mentioned above, it is estimated that the cost to the California
taxpayer of illegal immigrant students just at San Diego State
University and California State University-San Marcos is $635,000.
 This situation is absurd.  It can and should be stopped.
<P>
<B>2.  Challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1982 decision in Pyler
v. Doe, requiring the states to provide public education at the
elementary and secondary levels to illegal immigrant children.</B>

<p>
In California's ongoing budget crisis, rising education costs
represent the biggest problem.  To a large extent, the bloated
education bureaucracy is at fault.  Still, the fact is that a
new school has to be built each day to meet demand.  In this light
it makes no sense that California taxpayers are forced to finance
the education of children who are in our country illegally.  
The Supreme Court decision behind this requirementone of the oddest
and potentially most destructive decisions in the history of the
Courtpassed a decade ago by a slim 5 to 4 vote.  There is now
new blood on the Supreme Court, and this issue screams to be revisited.
 California taxpayers, school districts, county governments and/or
the Attorney General should initiate legal actions to bring the
matter back before the courts.


<H2>Employment</H2>

<B>1.  Initiate a statewide policy to transfer jobs from illegal
immigrants to unemployed American citizens and legal residents
who are now receiving welfare.  </B>
<p>
Unemployment in California
is nearing 10 percent and welfare costs are skyrocketing.  Cooperative
efforts should be established between county welfare departments,
the State Employment Development Department, and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to ensure that when illegal immigrants
are apprehended and removed from worksites, legal workers (particularly
those on welfare) are referred to the employer to fill the vacancies.
 Incentives, such as reduced fines, can be given to cooperating
employers.  Such action on the part of the Governor and/or the
legislature will at once reduce welfare costs, unemployment, and
the blackmarket job pool which represents a significant incentive
for illegal immigration.
<P>

<B>2.  Require the California Employment Development Department
to employ SAVE to screen out illegal immigrant job applicants.
</B>

<p>
Currently, while applicants for unemployment insurance are
screened to ensure that they are citizens or legal residentsand
while federal law requires private employers to screen applicantsan
illegal immigrant can walk into a state EDD office and receive
job-placement assistance.  EDD should be directed by the Governor
and/or legislation to remedy the situation immediately with strict
screening procedures.
<P>

<B>3.  Require similar screening practices at city job centers.</B>

<p>

Many cities operate their own tax-funded job centers to assist
people in finding jobs.  Like EDD, many of these do not screen
their clients to determine if they are illegal immigrants.  The
legislature should act now to require them to do so.  

<P>

<B>4.  Increase penalties for employers who fail to withhold taxes
from illegal immigrant workers.  </B>

<p>

As noted above, over half
of those employing illegal immigrants in California do not withhold
taxes from their wages.  Penalties for this practice should be
increased and the back-taxes collected should be forfeited to
the state.

<H2>Criminal Justice</H2>

<P>

<B>1.  Deport illegal immigrants currently in our court system,
jails, and prisons.  </B>
<p>

Illegal immigrants often pass through
our court system without ever being identified as illegal.  In
Orange County, the Superior Court recently invited the Immigration
and Naturalization Service into the courtrooms to identify and
process illegal immigrant defendants.  This approach worked and
should be initiated statewide.  The initial costs will more than
be repaid in a short period through increased deportations.Likewise,
state and county governments should work with the federal government
to provide hearing space and staff to conduct deportation hearings
for all illegal immigrant convicts now in California jails or
prisons.  Upon the end of their terms, these convicts should be
immediately deported.   
<P>
<B>2.  Pass state legislation to override so-called &quot;sanctuary
laws.&quot;</B>
<p>
In a number of cities such as San Francisco, local
laws have been passed which forbid local police from cooperating
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  State legislation
should be passed to prohibit and override these laws.  Federal,
state, and local law enforcement must be allowed to cooperate
to uphold immigration law as they do other kinds of law.


<H3>Conclusion</h3>

Human beings respond to incentives.  Current policies
in California that make it easy for illegal immigrants to enjoy
government benefits, receive free or tax-subsidized education,
gain employment, and take advantage of our criminal justice system
serve as incentives to illegal immigration.  Change these policies
to remove these incentives and illegal immigration will decrease.
 It's that simple.California must not hesitate to make these changes.
 Illegal immigration is exacerbating the state's crime problem
and represents an increasing drain on its financial resources.
 What is more, despite the new euphemism for illegal immigrants-&quot;undocumented
immigrants&quot;-these people are in our country illegally.  We
are a nation where law is king, and to openly allow and even encourage
a class of people to exist above the law is to subvert one of
our dearest constitutional principles.  Illegal immigration at
its current high levels is an economic disaster in the making
and a national disgrace.  California should take the lead in acting
to stop it now.

<h3>California's Public Schools Are Miserably Mismanaged</h3>

</CENTER>

IntroductionOver the past several years, no issue in Sacramento
has generated as much heated rhetoric as education spending. 
K-12 education represents the largest chunk of the state's budget.
 This makes it one of the obvious places to look for ways to save
money, given the urgency of addressing the state's growing deficit.
 But as soon as anyone even ventures to take a peek, the education
establishment comes out swinging.In defending their turf, education
bureaucrats and union leaders have resorted not only to the emotional
appeals we have seen on television, but to pure and simple disinformation.
 Consider:  In recent testimony to the Little Hoover Commission,
State Superintendent of Education Bill Honig characterized the
administration of public education in California as &quot;lean
and mean.&quot;  Indeed, he said that California schools could
use $4 billion more than the record $27 billion now being spent.1But
far from being &quot;lean and mean,&quot; gross waste and mismanagement
are fast becoming inherent characteristics of California's education
system.  Last year's revelations about the Richmond Unified School
District were just the tip of the iceberg.2  In recent months,
three separate grand juries have issued scathing reports on the
management practices of California school districts.  These reports
have wide implications for our public education system as a whole,
in which nearly half of the 1,068 school districts ran deficits
in 1990.
<P>

The Sacramento County Grand Jury ReportThe Sacramento County
Grand Jury's investigation of the Grant Joint Union High School
District (GJUHSD)-the fourth such inquiry in ten years-found an
array of questionable fiscal and management practices.[The District's]
problems were manifested in an almost complete breakdown of community
support and confidence; in poor business practices, especially
the management and oversight of legal counsel and consultant service
contracts; in questionable personnel practices; in the deterioration
of employee morale; and in routine, but essential, business not
being completed in a timely manner or not being completed at all.3
Just how bad were Grant's business practices?  In a special audit,
it was discovered that the District lacked bids or quotes for
contracted services; did not keep requisitions or purchase orders;
paid for services before they were completed; and issued inadequate
policies regarding business operations.4 Furthermore, the grand
jury found that the District maintained a slew of legal counsel
contracts &quot;involving many hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;
Some had no backup documentation such as signed contracts or board
minutes.  Some involved retired former District employees, which
may have violated sections of the state education code.  Others
did not indicate the specific source of District funding for the
contract.5With regard to the legal counsel contracts in particular,
the grand jury noted that in the past decade &quot;the GJUHSD
has had at least seven legal firms representing it, some in duplicative
or redundant capacities.  An audit stated, '. . . the District
had extraordinarily high expenditures for legal services.'&quot;6
How high?  In one instance, the District paid $700,000 to a law
firm for 15 months of work.  A subsequent audit found that this
amount was probably double what the work was worth.7   In another
example, the District was billed $297,773 by a law firm whose
contract had been terminated.  After an investigation by another
law firm, the District settled the bill for $16,326.  Yet despite
this outrageous overcharge of $281,447, the law firm in question
was subsequently rehired to do more work for the District.8 Additionally,
it was found that the District has hired, fired, promoted, and
demoted personnel without following established procedures.  These
actions resulted in embarrassing financial consequences:

<P>

<i>In 1986, GJUHSD paid $300,000 for a wrongful dismissal.  Currently,
there are tens of millions of dollars of 'wrongful' dismissal
or demotion lawsuits filed against GJUHSD.9 In sum, while it is
true that people are hurting in the District, the cause of this
hurt lies not with stinginess on the part of the taxpayer.  Rather,
it has been directly caused by the immoral waste of untold millions
in tax monies.
</i>
<P>

The Santa Cruz County Grand Jury ReportDown in central California,
the Santa Cruz County Grand Jury has issued a report detailing
the troubles of the Pajaro Valley Unified School District (PVUSD).
 Although this District has complained that declining state aid
has forced it to lay off teachers, the report suggests other causes:
 sloppy and incomplete record-keeping, gross cost overruns, and
poor management decisions.10 Some of the grand jury's specific
findings were incredible.  For example, it discovered that although
the elected school board has ultimate authority over the budget,
many budget decisions were simply &quot;relegated to the Administration
and the unions&quot;-the groups most interested in increasing
the District's budget.11 The District budget frequently omitted
information such as the amount of money actually spent at a school
site or at District headquarters.  Indeed, the grand jury found
that it &quot;reflected the amount the Trustees believed was spent
the previous year and what they thought should be spent the next
year, with no basis in fact.&quot;12.

<P>
Still lacking is any substantive information about which departments
are exceeding their budgets and which are within their budgets.
 Without detailed budget information, the Board of Trustees will
continue to be unable to control costs or make realistic reductions
in its budget as required by the State Education Code.13In other
words, teacher layoffs would likely have been unnecessary if the
District had been administratively prepared and willing to adopt
a rational plan to reduce or eliminate unnecessary expenditures.Where
might the PVUSD have looked to make some cuts?  For starters:

<P>
The Administration claims its costs have been cut by 400 percent
over the past two years.  Yet expenditures for the Superintendent's
and Business Services' budgets have far exceeded the amount budgeted.
 Actual cuts are not as great as they appear to be on paper. 
While the District office is exceeding its budget, many school
sites have been prudent with their money and actually spent less
than their budget.14Also, the grand jury found several large transfers
of funds between budget accounts, raising the question of &quot;whether
the funds are being appropriately spent for educational purposes.&quot;15
 This suggests that the instincts of the average citizen have
been right all along.  Bureaucratic fat at the district level
comes at the direct expense of the classroom.  The PVUSD also
wasted tens of thousands of dollars on its employee benefit package.
 Instead of joining a less costly plan with other county school
districts, it operated a self-insurance fund which covered medical,
dental, and vision benefits for employees and dependents.  And
the school board abdicated its oversight responsibility:
<P>

Until recently, the Trustees had no control over this fund.  It
was administered solely by the Business Services Director and
a group of union members who decided what benefits would be covered
and how much money would be set aside by the District to cover
claims.16Poor office management was another serious problem. 
Because the District consistently failed to complete its fiscal
paperwork on time, it was often late in receiving state education
reimbursements.  This caused cash-flow problems every June, forcing
the District to take out short-term bank loans to meet its payroll.
 These loans &quot;cost the District tens of thousands of dollars
in interest.&quot;17 Additionally, state and federal funds earmarked
for migrant and low-income students went unaudited, in violation
of requirements.  Questionable expenditures resulted.18  The grand
jury report concludes that &quot;an educational institution should
not operate in this manner.&quot;19   It is painfully obvious
that the PVUSD has been cheating the children in its charge, all
the while whining about the parsimony of the California taxpayer.

<P>

The San Diego County Grand Jury ReportFinally, in Southern
California, the San Diego County Grand Jury has just issued explosive
findings on the San Ysidro School District (SYSD).  For example,
like Grant, San Ysidro &quot;has paid out at least $1 million
in judgments and legal fees arising from the ill-conceived and
often illegal personnel actions of the Trustees.&quot;20More tax
dollars were wasted in the District's bilingual education program:

<P>
The Board has failed to direct or support proper use of funds
provided for bilingual education.  In several instances, students
were placed in the Bilingual Program or English-Only Program,
based on space availability, with no regard for parental request
or children's needs.21Worse was the grand jury's finding that
the program's goal-the assimilation of non-English-speaking children
into the schools and into American society in generalis being
ignored in the interest of a politically correct segregation:
 &quot;Currently, proficiency in Spanish with the preservation
of Mexican culture, at the expense of English learning, is the
governing philosophy [of the District].&quot;22Under this philosophy,
the prospect of English proficiency becomes a very dim possibility:

<P>
The almost universally Hispanic ethnicity of the student population
makes the English language transition a most difficult objective
for the school system.  The opposition of the majority of the
Trustees to this objective virtually guarantees its failure.23
It should come as no surprise that the test scores of San Ysidro
students are the lowest in all of California and that &quot;the
net result has been and continues to be children unable to communicate.&quot;24Nor
does the District brook dissent: 

<P>
Non-conformists are demoted, fired, or otherwise eliminated from
the system.  With very few exceptions, non-Spanish speakers are
purged from the system, regardless of qualifications or performance.
 So are those bilingual teachers who consider English proficiency
a matter of urgency.25 The response of SYSD's elected trustees
has been anything but forthcoming.  For instance, in the face
of evidence that one trustee's son was promoted from vice principal
to principal in violation of established selection procedures,
another trustee responded:  &quot;Favoritism, yes; nepotism, no.&quot;26
It is little wonder that Richard B. Macfie, foreman of the San
Diego County Grand Jury, concluded that:

<P>
At the current pace of irresponsible leadership, the San Ysidro
School District will soon be bankrupt financially.  Educational
bankruptcy appears already to have been achieved.27

<H3>Conclusion &quot;Lean and Mean&quot;?</h3>

These recent grand jury
reports supply further proof that although California is spending
more than ever on education, much of that money continues to be
wasted on special-interest programs or squandered through poor
decision-making.28 Governor Wilson's recent decision to put the
brakes on the spiraling education budget by limiting spending
to the minimum amount allowed under Prop 98 is a recognition that
fiscal discipline-not more tax money-is the critical first step
to fixing our education system.  In the long run, however, true
reform will require implementing school choice of the sort being
promoted by the Bush administration, restoring parental control
and injecting competition into the current centralized, monopolistic
education market.

<H1>The Deeper Lesson of California’s Budget Crisis</H1>

</center>

<I>

California faces an unprecedented fiscal crisis:  The 1991-92 state budget finds itself 
with a shortfall of at least $14.3 billion, out of a total budget of about $55 billion.  And 
the gap between reality and what is being said about this crisis is huge.
<P>

<LI>The state is said to face a Hobson’s choice between spending cuts and tax increases.  
Even the Governor has proposed some $6.6 billion of the latter.  But we must resist the 
steady drumbeat of pressure for higher taxes, understanding that the working people of 
our state are already overtaxed, and that justice requires that they retain as much as 
possible of what they earn.  
<P>

<LI>There is an urgent requirement to stop the incredible waste of the taxpayer’s dollar in 
California.  The Governor and his Working Group have come up with ideas that 
represent a good beginning.  The Little Hoover Commission and various private-sector 
groups have proposed others.  No stone should be left unturned.
<P>

<LI>The deeper lesson to be drawn from this crisis is that there is a systemic problem with 
our state’s budgeting process.  In short, centralized administration and the 
increasingly common practice of “earmarking” portions of the budget have rendered 
California’s government essentially unaccountable, not only to the people, but even to 
their elected officials.  
<P>

<LI>In addition to the spending cuts proposed by Governor Wilson and others, then, 
dramatic reform of the budgeting process is necessary, if future such crises are to be 
averted.   

</ul></i>

<P>

It is amazing that California is confronting a $14.3-billion budget deficit, even allowing 
for the severity of the recession.  One way of gaining perspective on the situation is to recall the 
words of Governor Ronald Reagan in 1973:  “Unless something is done to curb the government’s 
unlimited power to tax, this year’s $9.3—billion budget will grow to a staggering $47 billion by 
1989.”  California’s 1989 budget, of course, came in at more than $50 billion, with subsequent 
budgets jumping quickly to the $55-billion neighborhood.
<P>

What makes this amazing in light of Governor Reagan’s prophecy is that Californians did 
do something about the government’s power to tax:  they passed Proposition 13 (with its two-
thirds vote requirement for tax increases and a property tax limit) and the Gann spending limit.  
Of course, supporters of taxes say that this is precisely why we face such a massive shortfall:  
that we are undertaxed.  Yet inflation-adjusted government spending per capita still increased 
dramatically during the 1980s.  And tax revenues as a proportion of personal income have 
increased from 4.8 percent in 1962 to about 8.5 percent today.  
<P>

The early 1960s, we might recall, was the heyday of Governor Pat Brown’s great building 
programs, with huge investments in schools, state colleges, highways, and the state water 
project—the very sorts of public works that our government today is unable to deliver.  
Ironically, Pat Brown, the bete noir of fiscal conservatives in the 1960s, could be held up today 
as a model of fiscal responsibility.
<P>

This is all to suggest that previous attempts at tax-and-spending limitations have not been 
sufficient to control big government, or that they have not reached the heart of the matter of 
public spending.  The real lesson of the budget crisis is that the state’s bureaucracy, in tandem 
with powerful narrow interests, has been able to subvert the budget process to break the bonds of publicly mandated limitations on the size and scope of government.
<P>

There are three key factors at work:  Increased social-spending mandates, budgetary 
“earmarking,” and centralized administration. 


<H3>Shifting Budget Priorities and “Earmarking” </H3>

In California over the last 15 years, relative spending has shifted away from those basic 
public works necessary to accommodate population growth, e.g., transportation, and toward such rapidly increasing-cost items as health, education, and welfare (see Chart A).  In other words, the ordinary taxpayer is getting less and less for his or her money.  

<P>
Additionally, over 90 percent of state spending is “earmarked” by prior statute, judicial 
decree, or federal mandate, and rises inexorably without either legislative deliberation or rational relation to revenue growth.  Only about 8 percent of state spending is discretionary; that is, only about 8 percent is controlled by the governor and the legislature (see Chart B).  
<P>

<! -- whereis chart B?>

Source:  State Controller’s Annual Reports

<! -- whereis Chart A?>
<P>

If 8 percent is all there is to fight over, the people of California might very well wonder 
why they even bother to elect representatives. 
<P>

An important complement to earmarking is a procedure known as “workload budgeting” 
or “current services budgeting.”  Automatically each year, the costs of each program are notched upward; if the governor or the legislature reduces the automatic increase, the program is said to have been “cut,” even though absolute outlays will still be rising.  This effect is especially pronounced in social spending programs.  
<P>

The structural problem with the budget arises from the following facts:  While the 
average annual growth rate of personal income in California for the last decade has hovered 
around 8 percent per year and tax revenues have been growing at about 7 percent, spending has been growing at approximately 11 percent; and this year and next it is moving even beyond that, to about 13 percent.  If nothing is done, this trend will require endless tax increases until, in the fullness of time, the state of California would come to consume the entire income of its citizens.
<P>

The budgeting phenomena of “earmarking” and “workload budgeting” really mean that 
when it comes to budgeting—the bread-and-butter function of the legislative and executive branches—our representatives have abdicated or let slip away their responsibilities.  Missing from the current budget debate is the recognition of the extent to which government spending has ceased to be in the control of elected officials.  This is why the spending reforms proposed by Governor Wilson and others, by themselves, will not solve the problem.  

<H3>Centralized Administration</H3>

There is a third factor to be taken into account.  A broad review of the character of public 
spending and administration in California over the last two decades reveals that both have 
become increasingly centralized.  One good way to see this is to look at the shift in the relative 
share of the public dollar between state and county governments (see Chart C).  This 
centralization was accelerated by the passage of Proposition 13 and can be considered the major unintended consequence of that landmark event of the tax revolt.  
<P>

Indeed, the administration of all public spending has been centralized.  For instance, a 
special feature of Proposition 111, the gas tax increase of 1990, was a requirement that local 
jurisdictions have a state—approved transportation management plan before their local share of 
gas tax revenue could be distributed.  In hundreds of ways like this, the administrative apparatus 
of state government subjugates local governments.

<! -- whereis Chart C?>

<H3>The Systemic Problem</H3>

There are three key observations to make about this state of affairs.  
<P>

First and most obviously, “earmarking” precludes deliberation by public representatives 
and diffuses the responsibility and accountability of the legislature.  The public cannot put its 
finger on who is responsible for the character of public spending.  It is difficult to hold legislators 
accountable at election time for voting to appropriate funds, when the appropriation is done 
automatically as a part of a formula.
<P>

Second, “earmarking” enables special interests to organize more easily and effectively at 
the public expense.  Witness the political campaign currently being waged by the California 
Teachers Association on behalf of Proposition 98.  It is no exaggeration to say that earmarking 
has the low character of a raid on the public treasury by special, narrowly self-interested 
constituencies.
<P>

Third, in the end, the real needs of the taxpayer—for roads, schools, and other public 
works—get slighted, probably deliberately so.  
<P>

Why deliberately?  Think of it as a variation of the infamous strategy whereby the U.S. 
Department of the Interior responds to any proposed budget reduction by saying it will have to 
close down the Washington Monument.  Thus California working people, who as things stand 
pay a lot of money in taxes, are told that if they want roads, or schools, or prisons, or sewers, 
they will have to:  pay more taxes.  This is the Prop 111 gas-tax solution, the Prop 99 tobacco-tax 
solution, etc.  It becomes progressively nearer to impossible in such a regime to impose any 
discipline on public spending.  Those things which used to be the first priority of government are 
now, de facto, the last.  And no one, not even our representatives, seem to think they can do 
anything about it.

<P>

The interests of the administrative apparatus of government and of elected officials are 
increasingly connected to the interests of certain groups who might well be regarded as 
government clients:  public employee unions, regulatory bureaucracies, the business community 
(who are also invited to relate to government in the manner of supplicants), organized advocacy 
groups, and direct recipients of public aid.  Over time these combine to create the conditions 
whereby the taxpayers are forced to say “uncle” to new taxes, and the stage is set for a new wave of government growth.  Even fiscally conservative legislators, responding to the powerful 
incentives that now operate, have said that opposing any tax increase will mean that their districts will lose out when the budget pie is divided up.

<H3>Reform</H3>

These fundamental trends need to be understood before the budget can be sorted out in 
the long term.  And what will that require?  

<P>
n analysis of all 50 state budgets by former OMB Director James Miller and George 
Mason University economist Mark Crain found that spending in states that practice “earmarking” 
grew about 1.2 percent a year faster than in states whose entire budgets were subject to regular 
deliberation and appropriation. They also found that spending grew faster in states with single, 
unified, and thus very detailed budget bills, as compared to states which have separate, simple 
budget bills for each major component of government.  Here are two major reforms that should 
be considered. 
 
<P>
Above all, deliberation and accountability must be restored to the process.

<P>
In conclusion, tax-and-spending limitations are insufficient to solve California’s budget 
crisis.  What is required is control of the administrative apparatus, which can come about only 
through a coherent and forceful executive and legislative agenda.

<B>NOTE:  President Jimmy Carter was scoffed at when he proposed to institute “zero-based budgeting”— the spending needs for each program and department of the government evaluating from scratch every year—at the federal level.  Today in California, in the aftermath of “earmarking” Propositions 98, 99, 111, and the lottery, the idea of the legislature deliberating about the relative merits of various kinds of spending programs seems quaint, if not medieval.</B>

<H1>California Workfare Reform and Decentralization</H1>

</center>

<hr size=4>
<P>

Traveling in the United States in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville was 
struck that, unlike our European cousins with their aristocratic airs, Americans 
found no dishonor in work.  On the contrary, work in the United States was 
“regarded as positively honorable.”  This attitude toward work was a major 
ingredient in Americans’ renowned independent character and a great boon to 
democracy (since democracy requires an independent people).

<P>
A century and a half later, Americans still regard almost any kind of honest 
work as honorable, to be sure.  What has diminished, perhaps, especially in the 
aftermath of the Great Society welfare state, is the dishonor or shame that we once 
associated with not working.  That is, in the decades after 1965, refusing to take a 
difficult or low-paying job in order to support oneself or one’s family became 
increasingly acceptable and in some cases even profitable.
<P>

The ease with which the welfare system could be abused, the slothful (and 
sometimes criminal) behavior it encouraged in some who grew utterly dependent 
upon it, and its burgeoning cost to the private sector, especially during the 
inflationary late 1970s, led to frequent calls for welfare reform.  And in the next 
decade, one of the ideas most often discussed was “workfare,” mandatory work 
programs for recipients of welfare payments.
<P>

The idea behind workfare has deep historical roots in our country.  Long 
before America became centrally bureaucratized, the poor were routinely and 
adequately cared for by local governments and religious charities.  But except for 
the aged or infirm, those supported were required to perform useful labor, often in 
government-run factories, until they could find work on their own.  A free ride was 
definitely not part of the bargain.

Under Governor Deukmejian, California became one of the first states to 
institute workfare during the 1980s.  But from the start, California’s workfare 
program—called Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN)—has been beset with 
problems of its own, leading the Governor to call recently for its reform.
<P>

GAIN was intended to achieve a noble goal:  to wean the poor (many of 
whom were now being spoken as members of a “permanent underclass”) from the 
public dole and to prepare them for better-paying, private-sector jobs.  But GAIN’s 
track record since 1986 is unimpressive.  Over $850 million has been spent on, or 
committed to, the program, and California’s welfare caseload continues to grow—
and to grow even faster than the state’s steadily growing population.
<P>

GAIN’s problems stem, in part, from the many exceptions and loopholes 
allowing welfare recipients to get around its work requirement.  For instance, one 
provision which was added at the time of its passage provided that the requirement 
be waived if the man or woman on welfare required further education.  The stated 
purpose of this exception was that welfare recipients who needed minimal 
training—such as a high school equivalency degree or improvement in English 
language skills—would receive it before finding a job.  But instead, the provision 
has been interpreted broadly, allowing people to avoid work as long as they stay in 
school—through college and into graduate school if they wish—all the while 
receiving welfare payments.
<P>

Of course any and all attempts to close such loopholes and eliminate 
exceptions to workfare requirements are to be applauded.  But we should not be 
sanguine about the likelihood that such simple reform will fix the welfare system.  
GAIN is itself, after all—like its predecessor—a state program, directed by 
bureaucrats in Sacramento.  For one thing, the prevents the administration of 
welfare on a case-by-case basis; welfare policy in Temecula is the same as that in 
San Francisco, although the problems (and requisite solutions) may be altogether 
different.  For another, it means that the people in charge are not directly 
responsible to the tax-paying public for the program’s success or failure.
<P>

In the 1830s, Tocqueville marveled at how most problems in America were 
handled at the local level.  (This was anything but true in Tocqueville’s native 
France, where he reported that people looked immediately to Paris for help at the 
slightest sign of trouble.)  This was notable not only for its value in maintaining our 
independent, democratic spirit, but also for the fact the it worked so well.  
Especially in the 1960s, many Americans seem to have forgotten the simple truth 
(ask almost any Eastern European) that administration of policies by a distant 
bureaucracy is expensive and clumsy and inefficient, not to mention unaccountable.  
We have largely forgotten, that is, the old Yankee adage about having to do 
something yourself if you want it done right.
<P>

This is to suggest that until we decentralize the administration of social 
welfare programs, until we return the power to administer welfare to localities 
where it was and worked effectively for most of our nation’s history, even the best-
intentioned programs like GAIN will not likely be effective in actually reducing the 
number of people on welfare.

<H1>Why Not Criminalize Semi-Autos?</H1>
</center>

<hr size=4>

<P>

In The Federalist #46, Madison wrote that “the advantage of being armed, which the 
Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation” provides them with an 
almost “insurmountable” barrier to tyranny.  He knew, as did Americans generally, that 
potential tyrants would endeavor to disarm the citizenry—under the guise of providing 
public safety—as a first step to undermining democratic forms.  Indeed, Madison’s fellow 
Virginian George Mason declared that “to disarm the people . . . [is] the best and most 
effectual way to enslave them.”  Mason, although an active participant in the 
Constitutional Convention and a supporter of a strong national government, refused to 
endorse ratification of the Constitution because the Convention had failed to include in it 
a bill of rights.  Richard Henry Lee, author of the widely published “Letters of a Federal 
Farmer,” resolutely  declared that “to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body 
of the people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use 
them.”  Lee, too, opposed ratification because the Constitution lacked a bill of rights.  
Madison, although initially opposed to this idea, became the chief architect of the Bill of 
Rights in the first Congress.  He did so, he said, in order to “render [the Constitution] as 
acceptable to the whole people of the United States, as it has been found acceptable to a 
majority of them.”  And second only to the amendment guaranteeing the freedoms of 
religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition stood the following:  “A well regulated 
Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and 
bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

<P>

Today, California and the nation are witnessing a vigorous assault upon the Second 
Amendment in the form of regulations and legislation aimed at the importation, 
manufacture, and ownership of semi-automatic weapons.  Proponents, adapting many of 
the arguments used in the past for restricting handguns, tell us that the Second 
Amendment only protects the rights of organized militias to keep and bear arms, that 
individuals are accorded no such protection since the Second Amendment refers only to 
the people collectively.

<P>

But this all-too-common interpretation is directly at odds with federal law.  The 
United States Code [10 U.S.C. 311(a)] states that “[the] militia of the United States 
consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and. . . under 45 years of age.”

<P>

Moreover, such an interpretation of the Second Amendment stands in contradiction to 
the well-defined structure of the Bill of Rights as a whole.  It is beyond cavil that the 
rights adumbrated therein are individual rights.  When the First Amendment speaks of 
“the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a 
redress of grievances,” it obviously does not contemplate the assemblage of the whole of 
the American people; nor any ban on petition by individual citizens.  Similarly, when the 
Fourth Amendment guarantees the “right of the people” against “unreasonable searches 
and seizures,” it makes that guarantee to individuals, not to the whole body of the people.  
There is no textual evidence whatsoever to indicate that the Second Amendment, unlike 
the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, does not accord protection to individuals.  
The burden of proof rests with those who argue this to show why it is an exception.

<P>

A commonsensical reading of the Second Amendment is readily available:  “Since 
militias are necessary to the security of a free state, the people must therefore have the 
right to keep and bear arms.”  It is almost too obvious to point out that militias are 
comprised of individual citizens, and part of being a citizen of a free state is service in the 
militia.  Militias exist so that the people by dint of their own efforts can ensure their 
liberty; militias do not exist in order to secure the freedom of militias.

<P>

But today, so goes the response, public safety requires that the individual’s right to 
possess arms be curtailed.  But regulation and legislation to this end will create only the 
illusion of safety, since the net effect will be the disarming of law-abiding citizens and the 
granting of a monopoly of arms (or of certain kinds of arms) to criminals, police, and the 
military.

<P>

Legislators have learned in recent years that it is much easier to enforce the law upon 
the law-abiding than to enforce it upon criminals.  The Constitution, as misinterpreted 
and misapplied by judges and prosecutors, is too often used as a barrier to effective law 
enforcement.  The case of Stockton killer Patrick Purdy is illustrative.  He had previously 
been arrested for robbery, selling dangerous weapons in violation of federal law, 
receiving stolen property, drug possession, and sex crimes.  In each case, felony charges 
were plea-bargained to misdemeanor offenses.  Had existing laws been enforced, Purdy 
would still be in prison.  Plea-bargaining—a practice disdained by most Western 
nations—has become all too common in the criminal justice system.
<P>

A ban on semi-automatic weapons will do nothing to stop criminals; it will only make 
it easier for them to prey upon the law-abiding.  Most drug dealers do not use semi-
automatic weapons in any case; they prefer fully automatic firearms, the unlicensed 
possession of which is already a felony under both California and federal law.  At a time, 
then, when the police are either unwilling or unable to enforce the law— as appears to be 
the case in Washington, D.C., and other large cities—and when individual citizens 
become almost wholly responsible for defending themselves and their families and 
property—which is especially true of those forced to live in the inner-city—it is 
politically, indeed morally irresponsible to impose gun control policies of any stripe.
<P>

Battles over what has been called “gun control” are certainly nothing new.  The 
battles of the past, however, generally focused on one particular type of handgun or 
handgun ammunition.  The campaigns to ban “Saturday Night Specials,” “cop-killer 
bullets,” and “plastic guns” were each the subject of prolonged debate and media 
attention.  But most of the debate was desultory at best, since the definition of “Saturday 
Night Special” was more than a little nebulous; “cop-killer bullets” proved to have no 
greater powers than ordinary ones; and “plastic guns” turned out to be built mostly of 
steel.
<P>

The debate now raging here in California and elsewhere, however, aims squarely at 
the semi-automatic rifle.  As almost everyone by now knows, the rifles in question 
require no manual reloading after a shot, but chamber a new round automatically, and can 
thus be fired rapidly.  In most cases, they employ technology that has existed since the 
turn of the century.  Some, but by no means all, resemble or are related to the fully- 
automatic rifles used by most nations’ military forces.  
<P>

But misperceptions persist about these rifles, and those who oppose private ownership 
of firearms have been quick to note, and capitalize on, these misperceptions.  One 
prominent gun control organization informs its supporters that,
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>The weapons’ menacing looks, coupled with the public’s 
confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-
automatic assault weapons—anything that looks like a machine 
gun is assumed to be a machine gun—can only increase that 
chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

Furthering confusion, the major print media, having prejudiced the argument from the 
start by attaching the label “assault weapon” to semi-autos, have prefaced editorials with 
pat phrases that are now familiar to all:  “no legitimate purpose,” “designed only to kill 
people,” etc.—epithets, interestingly enough, that were applied to handguns only a few 
years ago.  Likewise, television has offered nothing of educational substance about what 
these arms are or do, giving air time instead to footage of the effects of semi-auto rifle 
fire on melons or concrete blocks.  (Countless non-semi-automatic firearms are capable of 
splitting concrete blocks.  So what do these pictures mean?)  Often, too, to T.V. clips 
show fully—automatic weapons being fired, thus taking advantage of the aforementioned 
confusion over the difference between semi-automatic rifles and fully—automatic assault 
weapons.  These apparently had their effect on California Attorney General John Van de 
Kamp, who boasted to the California Assembly that he could mow them all down with a 
semi-automatic AK-47 in the space of two minutes.
<P>

Most of those appearing to defend semi-autos, on the other hand, whether on 
television or in print, have found themselves at a loss to provide any argument that would 
justify private possession.  To their discredit, they have failed to move beyond describing 
the pleasure they take in hunting, shooting cans and bottles, or the importance they place 
on having certain semi-autos in private collections—in other words, arguments that 
simply rest on the private right to have fun.  The argument for the role of gun ownership 
to civic responsibility has been completely neglected in those upon whom the defense has 
fallen.  Clearly, if this is the best the defenders of self-loading rifles can do, the strength 
of their opponents in the public forum is hardly surprising.
<P>

The passion of this most recent gun control debate, and the failure of either side to 
give reasoned argument, is especially unfortunate.  For unlike the handgun debates of 
years past, the present case points forcefully to the very serious purpose that informs the 
Second Amendment:  While hand guns have a proper role in the defense of one’s person, 
home, property, and family, their limited range and power make them of little use in 
protecting “the security of a free State.”
<P>

Let us be candid.  In The Federalist 57, James Madison praised the “vigilant and 
manly spirit which actuates the people of America—a spirit which nourishes freedom and 
in return is nourished by it.”  This reminds us that, in accordance with our founding 
principles in the stirring opening passages of the Declaration of Independence, we reserve 
the right to revolution in perpetuity.  But if the American people reserve this right, then 
surely they reserve as well the right to revolution’s means.  And these means must be 
adequate to the times.  Does the Second Amendment, in this age of superior weapons 
technology, mean that the people have only the right to possess muskets?  Despots and 
potential despots, of course, would argue so.  A free people will not be deluded.
<P>

Two events within recent memory are instructive.  Afghanistan may yet become a 
free country.  The Afghan people are a freedom-loving people with a fierce desire to 
determine their own political fate.  They are also a people who have made guns an 
important part of their national existence.  They have proven to the world that the 
possession of weapons of self-defense invokes the spirit of freedom in a people because it 
imparts the sure knowledge that their liberty is a product of their own efforts and 
sacrifice.  With their skill in firearms the Afghans were able to withstand, and in some 
measure even humiliate, the greatest force for despotism in the modern world.  They 
began their resistance with World War I vintage Lee Enfields; when their determination 
attracted the attention of the free world, their arsenal was supplemented by more 
sophisticated weapons, most notably the Stinger Missile.  But it was their expertise with 
individual weapons, primarily semi-automatic and automatic rifles, that won the day.  
<P>

In contrast, the people of Cambodia had no such tradition of gun ownership or use.  
They became easy prey for the well-armed and brutal Khmer Rouge.
<P>

Like the Afghans and the Swiss—all male citizens of Switzerland are required by law 
to maintain and to be proficient at using semi-autos—Americans have a tradition of 
respect for guns.  Thomas Jefferson demonstrated that he understood the relationship 
between self-reliance, liberty, and guns in a letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr:
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>A strong body makes the mind strong.  As to the species of 
exercises, I advise the gun.  While this gives a moderate exercise 
to the Body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence to 
the mind. . . .  Let your gun therefore be the constant companion 
of your walks.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

In the United States, long after the Army had grown and assumed primary 
responsibility for the nation’s defenses, it continued to depend upon a civilian population 
trained in the use of arms from which it could draw men who would make good soldiers.  
Thus, the government of the United States in 1903 established the National Board for the 
Promotion of Rifle Practice.  The board’s principal mission was to see to the “training of 
U.S. civilians  in  the  use  of rifled  arms  who  might  be  called  into  service  in time of 
national emergency.”  The Board’s mission is reflected today in the U.S. Army’s Director 
of Civilian Marksmanship, whose office sponsors formal marksmanship matches across 
the nation and offers surplus semi-automatic M-1 rifles and ammunition to marksmen and 
clubs dedicated to marksmanship.*   
<P>

But even beyond the militia’s vital role with respect to foreign invasions, the deepest 
object of the Second Amendment goes back to the fundamental “Right of the People to 
alter or abolish [fundamentally unjust government]”:  it is to serve as a free people’s 
ultimate bulwark against internal subversion of civil liberty.  The authors of our Bill of 
Rights recognized that such a people are always susceptible to enemies of liberty—
particularly demagogues—and they sought some means to insure that no individual or 
faction could subvert democracy with impunity.  Retaining for the great body of 
citizens—the unorganized militia—the right to possess firearms provided that insurance.  
<P>

Consider the great Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story’s remarks in his authoritative 
Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States:  
<P>

<blockquote>

<B>The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been 
considered as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it 
offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary 
power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in 
the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over 
them.</B>

</blockquote>
<P>

This is the central point that informs the Second Amendment, and should inform the 
present discussion of semi-automatic rifles.  Remarkably enough, it has been almost 
completely overlooked.  But foreign invasion, unlikely as it may seem at any given time, 
is an ever-present possibility, as is the corruption of constitutional forms—as much if not 
more so now, in an age of monstrously large and impersonal bureaucracies, as it was in 
the age of kings and queens.  (And dare we note that when Madison wrote of our “manly 
spirit,” he was explaining what would prevent the House of Representatives from 
unconstitutionally passing laws from which it exempts itself—as it now does routinely?)  
It has been, and will continue to be, individual Americans—armed with weapons 
comparable to those held by the state—who stand as the final guardians of civil liberty.
<P>

Semi-automatic rifles represent nothing more or less than the state of the art in 
firearms.  Among free men, and as a hedge against the corruption of government by 
freedom’s enemies, their private possession by law-abiding citizens and training in their 
use ought to be encouraged rather than prohibited.  Those who use them—or any 
firearm—in the commission of a crime, on the other hand, should receive harsh 
punishment and no quarter.
<P>

Lately, as in years past, the media has exhorted legislators in Sacramento and 
Washington to be bold and to “stand up to the NRA.”  Indeed the boldness and the 
foresight of the statesman are required of our leaders now.  But boldness should not, and 
keen foresight will not, have them standing up to a lobbying group in this case.  Rather 
they must stand for the Constitution—and for the moment against a hasty and unwise 
sentiment on the part of many citizens that represents a willingness to surrender the 
keystone of American liberty.

<center>
<H1>In Defense of Proposition 13<BR>
and the Gann Limit</H1>
</center>

<P>

Proposition 13 remains as controversial today as it was 11 years ago when 
California voters approved it by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.  Indeed, the Proposition 13 
property tax cut provoked the sound and fury of the apocalypse, with liberal critics 
warning that Proposition 13 would cripple government services, and conservative 
supporters cheered by that same prospect.

<P>

A decade later, the critics of Proposition 13 are claiming vindication.  The "I-told-
you-so" critics say Proposition 13 has deprived local government of badly needed 
revenue for new schools, new roads, sewers, water, and other basic services, and the 
constitutional spending limit, better known as the "Gann Limit," is blamed for the state's 
inability to step into the breach.  Proposition 13 is now commonly regarded as a major 
factor in state and local government's inability to keep up with growth, and is therefore 
blamed by developers and much of the business community for contributing to the slow-
growth movement that is gaining strength throughout California.  Today there are calls 
from the Legislative Analyst and many other leaders in the state to repeal the spending 
limit and raise taxes.

<H3>Background</H3>

In order to judge the wisdom of Proposition 13 and the Gann limit a decade later, it 
is necessary to review briefly the extraordinary circumstances that led to the landslide 
passage of Prop 13 in the first place, and it is necessary to separate and sort out the 
various issues and arguments about the present condition of state and local government.  
When you begin to look more closely at Proposition 13, you come to discover some 
ironies and surprises.

<P>

In the mid-1970s, housing prices in California were skyrocketing far faster than the 
surging national inflation rate.  Housing prices in the Los Angeles and San Francisco 
areas were rising at an average rate of 14 to 15 percent a year.  Assessed valuations for 
property tax purposes were climbing along with prices.  Because most counties 
reassessed property values only every two or three years, many property owners were 
seeing their property tax bill suddenly double or triple.  Between inflation and the sudden 
shock of the property tax increase, many homeowners thought thing were getting out of 
control.

<P>

But this shocking increase was deceptive because of several quirks in the property 
tax system, mostly having to do with the exemption on the first $1,750 of assessed 
valuation, which exaggerated the increase in property tax bills.  It turns out that as a 
proportion of personal income, the property tax was not rising at all, but in fact remained 
steady at about 5 percent of personal income all through the 1970s-about the same 
proportion of income as in 1960.

<P>

But although the property tax was not rising as a proportion of personal income, 
other state taxes (especially the state income tax) were rising fast, resulting in a sharply 
rising overall tax burden.  The total tax burden in California had risen from 11.29 percent 
of personal income in 1960 to 15.44 percent by 1978.  The state income tax in particular 
was a very elastic tax for the state treasury;  for every 1-percent rise in personal income, 
the state enjoyed a 1.6-percent increase in income tax revenues, making the state 
government the major winner from the high inflation of the 1970s.  By 1978, California 
was among the highest-taxed states in America (see Chart 1).

<P>

Meanwhile, the state had accumulated a huge budget surplus, estimated to be more 
than $4 billion, which added to the annoyance of taxpayers.  (Governor Jerry Brown 
denied for a time that a surplus existed at all.)  The legislature fiddled with some property 
tax relief measures, but could come to no agreement.  Repeated attempts by the 
legislature to fashion a property tax relief measure floundered in partisan wrangling.  
Even the prospect of Proposition 13 could not break the legislative deadlock.

<P>

And yet, in the months before the June vote on Proposition 13, public opinion polls 
found that the voters were evenly divided over the measure, with a large undecided 
segment.  Then an extraordinary bureaucratic episode tipped the scales in favor of 
Proposition 13.  One month before the June election, Los Angeles County residents 
received their new property valuation assessments and property tax estimates for the 
following year from the County Assessor, Alexander Pope.  There was a huge outcry 
about the large increases in taxes, which made news headlines statewide and prompted 
many voters to fear that they were next.  The interesting thing about this episode is that 
the new assessments for Los Angeles County were not due to be delivered to the 
taxpayers until July, after the election.  A rare case of bureaucratic efficiency was the 
proximate cause in helping to pass the measure to deprive the bureaucracy of tax 
revenues.

<P>

Even so, Proposition 13 terrified the liberal establishment, which planned to defeat 
the initiative with scare tactics, as they had previous tax -limitation initiatives. (Voters 
had rejected previous limitation measures, including Governor Reagan's 1973 tax and 
spending-limitation initiative, because they thought those initiatives would cause higher 
local taxes and reduced services.)

<P>

<center>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="/claremont/images/gsp02-1.gif">
</center>

<H3>Chart 1</H3>

<P>

The liberal establishment mounted an all-out attack.  The Los Angeles Times said 
Proposition 13 would cause the doubling or tripling of the state income and sales tax.  
John Van de Kamp, the Los Angeles District Attorney, called it "a gift-wrapped time 
bomb."  Governor Jerry Brown called it a "rip off" and a "consumer fraud."  The state 
Democratic party chairman said it would mean "turning the state over to the current-day 
anarchists."  Teachers threatened to go on strike in response to possible staff cutbacks.

<P>

Even national organizations got in on the act.  On the eve of the election, the 
National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National Association 
of Counties called a press conference in Washington D.C., to deplore Proposition 13, 
calling it a "wrecking ball" that would cripple local government.  One economic study 
said it would cost the state 450,000 jobs.  (Just the opposite, of course, of what actually 
happened.)  Even the Communist party called a press conference to denounce Prop 13.  It 
was all for nought, as the voters were unmoved by the parade of imaginary horrors.


<H3>The Effects for the Taxpayer</H3>

<P>

The results of Proposition 13 have been rather happy for the taxpayer.  Property 
taxes fell by more than 50 percent, which has saved taxpayers over $100 billion in the last 
ten years.  The frightened legislature moved to adopt indexing for the state income tax in 
the panicky aftermath of Proposition 13, which has saved taxpayers another $23 billion 
on their income taxes in the last decade.  Most importantly, these steps reversed the 
steady increase in the state's tax burden on personal income, which, as mentioned above, 
had grown from 11.3 percent in 1960 to 15.4 percent by 1978.  With the passage of 
Proposition 13 and income-tax indexing, the tax burden dropped back to 11.8 percent, 
and has remained steady since then.  But even at this rate, California remains one of the 
highest-taxed states in the Union.

<P>

The next most important result of Proposition 13 was the 1979 vote in favor of 
Proposition 4, the "Gann Limit," which was presented as a means of completing the 
reform begun by Proposition 13.  Then Gann measure limits state spending according to a 
formula based on population increases and inflation.

<P>

California came up against the spending limit for the first time in 1987, which led to 
rebates to California taxpayers.

<H3>The Effects on Local Government</H3>

The chief area of enduring controversy about Proposition 13 concerns its effect on 
city and county government.  Whether the sky has fallen on local government, as the 
Chicken Littles predicted, is still in dispute.  An analysis of city and county budgets 
reveals that their budgets have continued to grow steadily since Proposition 13.  The loss 
of property-tax revenue has been made up through a number of means.  First of all, 
Sacramento stepped in immediately after Proposition 13 passed and bailed out local 
government with the $4.4-billion state surplus.  This aid very nearly made up for the $5 
billion lost through the property tax reduction. State aid continues to be the single largest 
source of revenue for cities and counties.  Second, cities and counties moved to increase 
the use of fees and other special assessments to maintain service levels.

<P>

What Proposition 13 did was force city and county governments to run much more 
efficiently.  Local spending for public safety and health, adjusted for inflation, has 
continued to rise; spending for general government administration has fallen.  In the city 
of Los Angeles alone, the payroll today is 4,000 paychecks smaller than in 1978.

<P>

But understand that with state financing comes state control.  Liberals had long 
wanted the state to assume greater authority for local government because liberals have 
greater influence with state government than with the hundreds of local government units.  
Shortly after Proposition 13 passed, economist Frank Levy of the Urban Institute wrote: 
"The passage of Proposition 13 has caused almost the entire liberal agenda to be de facto 
adopted.  The state now pays for most county health and welfare costs, and state support 
of public schools has increased from about 40 percent of all expenditure prior to 
Proposition 13, to 67 today."  Economist William Oakland concurred: "Local control or 
`home rule' may become a thing of past in California."

<H3>The Growth of State Government</H3>

The aggrandizement of state government is, then, the greatest irony of Proposition 
13.  It must be remembered that the property tax is a tax for local government, and that 
Proposition 13 has done nothing to restrain the growth of state government, where is 
found the most obnoxious spending priorities and bureaucracy.  When you begin to 
examine the budget trends over the last 20 years, you begin to see that Proposition 13 did 
not slow the growth of state spending at all.  Way back in 1973, Governor Ronald Reagan 
warned: "Unless something is done to check government's unlimited power to tax, 
California's state budget will grow from this year's $9.3. billion to a staggering $47 
billion by 1989."  The 1989 state budget calls for spending $47.8 billion.  The state 
budget has nearly doubled during the seven years of the Deukmejian administration.

<P>

So it become plausible to wonder whether the reason the state does not build new 
roads and school classroom is a shortage of money, or because our state government has 
become very expensive and does not do the kind of things with the budget that it used to 
do, such as building roads and schools, or providing aid for local governments to do these 
things.

<P>

Twenty-five years ago, for instance, the state government spent nearly 16 percent of 
the budget on transportation.  Today California spends less than 6 percent, and ranks last 
in the nation in transportation spending per capita.  Moreover, that 16 percent we used to 
spend was largely for new road construction.  Today the majority of our transportation 
money is simply for maintenance.

<P>

Education is the other point of contention in state government.  But again, 
Proposition 13 and the Gann spending limit are not the real culprits.  Education received 
massive funding increases under Governor Deukmejian.  Spending per student, adjusted 
for  inflation, has risen by one-fifth since Proposition 13, from $3,046 per student in 1978 
to 3,793 next year. (Amounts are in constant 1988 dollars.)  Indeed, the next budget calls 
for spending almost as much for education ($23.4 billion) as we spent for all purposes 
when Governor Deukmejian was elected seven years ago (the 1982 state budget was $25 
billion).  The mystery over the seeming shortage of funds for education disappears when 
you examine the high administrative costs for many of the state's 40 categorical 
educational programs, or when you find that California has one of the highest ratios of 
school administrators to classroom teachers in the nation.

<P>

In other words, the passage of Proposition 13 did not really derail the liberal 
bureaucracy in Sacramento, as the rise in spending for welfare and education continued 
unabated.  But the decline in spending for roads and other basic infrastructure services, 
already declining under Governor Jerry Brown, accelerated after Proposition 13.  
Proposition 13, like the Reagan tax cuts, has made California's economy more 
prosperous.  It also made local government more efficient, but waste and bureaucracy still 
abound in Sacramento as they do in Washington.

<P>

California is a lot better off for having passed Proposition 13, the Gann spending 
limit, and income tax indexing-just think of how fast government spending would have 
risen without these measures.  But we are not as well governed as we should be.  
Proposition 13 was only the first battle in the war to cut government spending and make 
the government do what it used to do.  There are many more battles still to be fought in 
Sacramento.

<h1>Foreign Investment:</h1>
<h3>Benefit or Threat?</h3>
</center>

Remember about ten years back, when OPEC was riding high, gasoline was $1.25 
a gallon, and Arab merchants were buying seemingly every farm in Iowa and Kansas, 
along with downtown London?  So extreme was the paranoia that “<I>foreign interests</I>” 
would end up owning America’s heartland that many politicians and business leaders 
proposed that there be restrictions in foreign ownership of American assets.

<P>

Of course, the fortunes of OPEC and the Arab oil merchants suffered a swift 
reversal, and yet, despite the salutary lesson in the vicissitudes of world markets, the 
paranoia over foreign investment is with us again.  The chief culprits are the Japanese, 
and so strong has been the backlash to Japanese and other Asian investment that the joke 
has arisen that, should we go to war again, America will have to bomb Pearl Harbor, for 
the Japanese, having failed to conquer Hawaii in 1942, have come to own nearly the 
whole of it.

<P>

At the present time, the clamor for restrictions on foreign ownership of American 
assets is not sufficiently strong to bring the sentiment to effect—but it is there.  Aside 
from the Japan-bashing chatter you hear at cocktail parties, the theme of economic 
nationalism played a prominent role in the late Presidential campaign of the Democratic 
party, and economic nationalism was the preeminent issue in the recent Canadian 
election.  If economic nationalism can prove relatively potent in a time of prosperity and 
growth, surely it can become a decisive force if there is any wind of serious economic 
downturn.

<P>

If patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel,  as Samuel Johnson has it, then 
economic nationalism—a mistaken substitute for patriotism—is the first refuge of 
paranoid politicians.  The kind of economic nationalism that resents foreign investment in 
the U.S. is mistaken not only on the facts, but also on the principles of economic 
rationality.

<P>

First of all, Japanese direct investment in the U.S. is not very large.  In fact, 
although you can say with great effect that “Japanese investment in the U.S. has increased 
six-fold since 1980,” the book value of Japanese investment in the U.S. came to only $33 
billion by 1987, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Guess what?  That is 
less than half the level of investment in the U.S. by Great Britain.  When was the last time 
you heard anyone worry about the level of British investment in the U.S.?

<P>

As a proportion of total assets in the U.S.,  foreign ownership is really quite small. 
Take California, a favorite spot for Japanese and other foreign investment, as an example. 
In 1987, total foreign investment in California came to $37.02 billion—about 3 percent of 
the total assessed valuation of all property and assets in the state.  That investment, by the 
way, is credited with creating more than 280,000 jobs in the state, 45 percent of which are 
manufacturing jobs.  Furthermore, in 1986 (the last year for which figures are available), 
foreigners owned only 2 percent of the state’s farmland—922,680 of California’s 47.3 
million agricultural acres.

<P>

To be sure, much of the emotional strength behind the paranoia over Japanese 
ownership comes from the anecdotal tales of Japanese businessmen paying huge sums—
often in cash—for American real estate.  Often, it is true, these buyers are paying far too 
much for American properties, at least by the standards of the American market.  But that 
is exactly the point. Remember that real estate in Japan is frightfully expensive.  Ours is 
comparatively cheap.  Combine that relative circumstance with the strong Yen, and 
suddenly the Japanese real estate rush here doesn’t look so outlandish.

<P>

The fact that Japanese investors are willing to overpay for American assets should, 
in fact, be regarded as good news.  The world presently stands in awe of, and is 
intimidated by, the Asian economies.  And yet it should say a great deal that Asian 
investors are sending substantial amounts of their capital here, rather than investing in 
their own economies.  In fact, the returns on investment are much higher here than in the 
Far East.  If the Asians really are the world’s shrewdest businessmen (a dubious 
proposition) then what does it say for the future of our economy—that they see the U.S. 
as one of the best places to invest their capital?

<P>

But even if it were true that Japanese and other foreign investors were succeeding 
in buying a significant portion of America’s assets, what would it really mean?  In the 
abstract, ownership of an asset is unrelated to the performance of the asset.  Critics 
suggest that foreign ownership of our assets somehow threatens our control of our own 
destiny, or even national security.  But there is no evidence to suggest that Japanese or 
other foreign management would make worse use of assets than American owners.  And 
the outcry against Japanese investment misses a fundamental point:  When an American 
sells an asset to a foreign owner, the American gets cash with which to invest in other 
assets or in creating new assets.  Often in our nation’s history, periods of economic 
growth correspond with net inflows of capital.

<P>

In fact, this one of the most important, yet largely overlooked, lessons about the 
present structure of international finance.  At the beginning of the 1980s, America was 
investing about $100 billion a year overseas—helping in large part to fuel the expansion 
in the Pacific Rim.  When the Reagan Administration cut taxes and improved the after-
tax yield on investment here, Americans not only stopped sending their capital abroad, 
but foreign nations found they could not  compete for their own capital, as it flowed into 
the newly attractive American economy.  The trade deficit that has ensued from all this, 
Milton Friedman has said recently, “is an economic blessing.  It has enabled us to have a 
higher level of investment.”  This circumstance has also led to a wave of tax reductions 
around the world.

<P>

What we have is a case of the shoe being on the other foot.  For decades, American 
investment overseas helped to foster often violent anti-American sentiments that were 
little better than a cover for envy and resentment.  Given the fact that there is no outcry 
against the much larger—and growing—British investment here, it would seem that the 
anti-Asian sentiment is motivated by the worst of reasons:  racism and envy.  Although it 
may be true that there are serious cultural frictions between Japanese investing and 
American business and labor, that is not an economic problem.  It would be regrettable if 
America, the nation dedicated to the proposition that “all men are created equal,”  were to 
act on ethnic frustrations and call it “economic policy.”

<html><head><title>THE CONSERVATISM OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</title><body bgcolor=#ffffff><center><table border=0 width=85%><tr><td><center><h1>The Conservatism of the Declaration of Independence</h1><h5>Remarks given by Dr. Thomas G. West at a dinner for the Board of Directors of the Claremont Institute, May 10, 1996</h5></center>	The Claremont Institute seeks to restore the principles of the American founding to their former position of preeminence in American public life.  Surprisingly, some conservatives have doubts about that project.<p>	The Declaration of Independence states the founding principles in this way:  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<p>	In many conservatives today these words arouse contradictory feelings.  On the one hand they admire the Founding Fathers and therefore respect the Declaration.  On the other hand, they fear that the problem in America today is that we have too much equality, too many rights, and too much democracy.  Liberals, after all, are always talking about how much they care about the rights of women and the poor, how we need more equality, how we must take power out of the elites and put it into the hands of the oppressed.<p>	We at the Claremont Institute do not share the conservative ambivalence about the principles of the Declaration.  We believe that liberty and equality and rights are entirely good, as those terms were understood by our Founders.  A people that is a "good people" (as we called ourselves in the Declaration) cannot have too much of these good things.  The problem today is not that we have too much equality, too much liberty, too many rights.  The problem is that we are well along in a process of abandoning equality properly understood, and liberty and rights properly understood.<p>	I will explain this from three points of view.<p>	First, our liberties are contracting, not expanding.  Anyone in the business world knows this is true of property rights.  What is not as well known is that free speech, freedom of religion, and many other freedoms have also been substantially reduced in the twentieth century, especially in the past twenty-five years.<p>	Second, our liberties are also contracting in the area of government by consent--by elected officials accountable to the people.  Our country is governed less democratically now than it was in 1965.<p>	Third, our liberties are also contracting because for several decades government has been in the business of undermining the conditions of freedom - namely, morality, family, and faith.<p>	Let me give examples to explain in each case how this decline of democracy, equality, and rights is taking place.<p>	Consider free speech.  Conservatives today sometimes complain that we have an excess of free speech.  But let us focus on the one area that the Founders regarded as the most important purpose of free speech: enabling the public to make an informed decision about candidates for election.  In 1971, for the first time in American history, government began to take this right away from a large class of Americans--those who cooperate or consult with candidates for public office.  Such people are permitted to spend no more than $1,000 explaining to the public why their friends deserve to be elected.  This campaign finance act was passed in order to limit the influence of people with money in elections.  The idea behind this law was that since poor people can't afford to publish their views, the wealthy should be severely limited in what they can publish.<p>	What would the Founders have thought of a law punishing people for publishing their views on an election contest?  This is what the Revolution was all about:  government would not be permitted to say who would be permitted to publish and who forbidden.  That had been the law in Old England.  Such laws violate the right to liberty, and they are anti-democratic.  John Adams wrote, "If the press is to be stopped and the people kept in ignorance, we had much better have the first magistrate and senators hereditary."<p>	The result of campaign finance laws is to "stop the press"--to cut down on public information about candidates who are not favored by the established media, the major networks and the leading daily newspapers.  What candidates lose out under our campaign finance laws?  Those who challenge the status quo, who oppose big government,--in many cases, conservatives.<p>	Second example.  America doesn't have too much democracy, as many conservatives believe.  It has too little.  Government by the people has in a significant degree been replaced over the past century, especially in the past thirty years, with government by so-called experts far removed from responsibility to the electorate.  Democracy is not gone, but it is much further eroded than most people are aware.<p>	This has happened in two ways.  One, power has been taken out of the hands of private citizens and local communities, and shifted to more centralized and more remote bodies, such as state and national governments.  Two, within these governments, power has been increasingly shifted away from elected officials (president, governor, legislatures) to unelected officials (bureaucracies, agencies, and courts).<p>	One example.  How did we get wetlands regulation?  As it happens, government got the authority to regulate wetlands without passing any law on the subject.  The relevant portion of the Clean Water Act simply requires permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into the navigable waters" of the U. S.  Obviously, a swamp, a pothole, or a bog is not "navigable." Yet federal agencies, working in tandem with federal courts, have claimed, with a straight face, that "navigable waters" include all the "wetlands" in the U. S.  This now includes, according to one set of federal regulations, land that has standing water on it for as little as 14 days a year, and land that accidentally becomes soaked by irrigation runoff or from undersized or clogged culverts.<p>	This wetlands example illustrates how policy is often formed by officials--courts and agencies--far removed from the people.  This policy process defies not only the Founders' principle of private and local control, but also the Constitution's requirement that we be governed only by laws to which our elected representatives give their consent.  It also illustrates the government's contempt for the property rights of owners, who in some cases have been imprisoned for cleaning up, or building on, land they own.<p>	So much for our rights, and government by consent.<p>	Let us turn now to our third theme, the government's assault on the conditions of freedom--religion, family, and morality.<p>	The Founders believed that although freedom is every man and woman's birthright, a self-governing community that secures freedom is rare.  The Founders were the heirs of two thousand years of European history in which there was little or no protection of individuals rights, and little or no government by the consent of the governed.<p>	In order for men to be able to govern themselves and not abuse their freedom, they need to have the habits and convictions that enable them to behave responsibly.  Madison once wrote, with his typical tough-mindedness, that if men do not have sufficient self-restraint, "Nothing less than the chains of despotism can keep them from destroying and devouring one another."  But where do these moral virtues of moderation and justice come from?  The Founders' answer:  from knowledge of the rights of mankind, but above all from religion, which teaches us to restrain our passions and to respect the rights of others.  Thomas Jefferson--the Founder most outspoken in his doubts about traditional Christianity--was sensible enough to write in his Notes on Virginia that the liberties of a people will no longer be secure if they cease believing that their liberty is the gift of God.<p>	Today's government is in a whole host of ways anti-religious.  When the Supreme Court discusses religion, it uses words like "coercive," "divisive," "danger," and "irrational."  In the name of the Bill of Rights, the Court has banned religion from public schools.  Yet the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights in 1789 also passed a law encouraging the teaching of religion in public schools in the Northwest Territories--the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.<p>	Government's ban on God is particularly striking in light of this fact:  the Declaration of Independence says liberty is our inalienable right only because we are "endowed" with that right by our Creator ("created equal").  Our principles (religious liberty) supposedly require us never to breathe a word to school children about where those principles come from.  But if we refuse to acknowledge that foundation of our principles in "the laws of nature and of nature's God," what do our principles rest on?  If liberty is not the gift of God, it must be the gift of government.  But what government gives, government may take away.  As Jefferson said: without God, liberty will not last.<p>	On the same topic of government hostility to morality and religion, consider the family.  Today, even liberals see that family breakdown is a problem.  It is the direct or indirect cause of the vast majority of violent crime, child abuse, battering and exploitation of women, and much more.<p>	When government changed its policy on welfare in the 1960s, it in effect began to subsidize divorce and single motherhood.  Government's generosity made it possible, for the time in American history, for large numbers of irresponsible women to get no-fault food, housing, cash, medical care, job training, higher education, and more.  The new welfare policies made many males among the working poor a bad bargain for quite a few women who would have married them--and stayed married to them--before the 1960s.<p>	At the same time that government has undermined the family by its perverse economic incentives, it has promoted the separation of sex from love and marriage.  From sex education to legalized abortion, from pregnant unmarried cheerleaders to homosexual rights, from no-fault divorce to free condoms--government sends young men and women the same message:  just do it!  Sex exists for your personal fun and pleasure.  Don't worry about the consequences--if the fetus is inconvenient, kill it; if you would rather bring it to term, we'll pay you to raise it.<p>	Forgotten is the older view: that sex is part of the plan of God and nature for your life; that its noblest use is for the generation of children who will grow up under the daily harmonious guidance of a loving mother and father; that it is a fine thing to send children out into the world, so that they too can have the opportunity to engage in the pursuit of happiness and to polish and perfect their souls, just as the best of their forebears have done from time immemorial.<p>	America's freedoms have eroded, her families are disintegrating, and her women and children are subjected to levels of rape, exploitation, neglect, and abuse that America's Founders would never have tolerated.  We can trace these problems to the abandonment of the principles of the Declaration of Independence by our elites, and increasingly by the people themselves.<p>	The Claremont Institute is devoted to the recovery of this healthy core of the older American tradition.  Let us put our shoulders to the wheel, each of us doing what he can in the common enterprise of restoring "one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."<blockquote><b>Dr. Thomas G.

<h3>Foreword</h3>

<FONT SIZE=2>There are two reasons this booklet
is important.  One, it is immediately useful.  The majority of
Americans who favor restoring prayer to public schools will find
a way here to accomplish it.  It is a way which will pass the
muster of the courts.  It is a way which will be unobjectionable
to all fair-minded citizens.  It is a way that no one can criticize
as un-American.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second reason this booklet is
important is intellectual.  It teaches us about the key to America's
past greatness.  It warns us about the chief threat to America's
greatness today.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One of the all-time best books about
our country is Tocqueville's <I>Democracy in America</I>.  Written
in the 1830s, it explains the unique strength of our democracy
very simply:  In America the &quot;spirit of liberty&quot; and
the &quot;spirit of religion&quot; are intertwined.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Of course, America's founders supported
the separation of church and state.  They enshrined it in the
First Amendment.  There would be no established religion here,
or preference by government to any particular religion.  But the
founders supported religion in general, both in speech and action.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Washington expressed the
consensus of the founders:  &quot;Of all the dispositions and
habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality
are indispensable supports.  In vain would that man claim the
tribute of partiotism, who should labor to subvert these great
pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties
of man and citizens.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for action, it is useful to recall
that Thomas Jefferson supported a bill prescribing penalities
for anyone doing business on the Sabbath.  He did so the very
same year that he wrote Virginia's Bill for Establishing Religious
Freedom, the greatest expression ever of freedom of conscience.
 Whatever any of us may think of blue laws, it is clear that Jefferson-who
also coined the phrase &quot;wall of separation between church
and state&quot;-was not anti-religious in the manner of the ACLU
and its liberal allies today.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The conjunction of the &quot;spirit
of liberty&quot; and &quot;spirit of religion&quot; in America
was a two-way street.  The priests and ministers Tocqueville heard
preaching here were supporters of the rights of man.  They saw
God's will in the American Revolution.  Indeed, historically,
America's churches were the seedbeds of the Revolution.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The veneration of religion by democrats
and of democracy by religious leaders in America was remarkable
to Tocqueville, because in his native France there was bitter
enmity between the Catholic Church and the supporters of democracy.
 The difference was critical to the opposite outcomes of the two
countries' revolutions in the late 18th century.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Harry V. Jaffa's understanding of
American democracy draws less on Tocqueville than on his hero
Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln spoke of an American political religion,
by which he meant reverence for the Constitution as informed by
the Declaration of Independence.  Using biblical language, Lincoln
spoke of the Constitution as a picture of silver surrounding the
Declaration, an apple of gold.  The Constitution supplies a democratic
structure with which we can govern ourselves.  The Declaration
supplies us with the understanding to govern ourselves well.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Professor Jaffa was responsible,
in the 1950s, for reviving the serious study of the Lincoln-Douglas
debates of 1858.  In those debates, Stephen Douglas defended the
Constitution as a procedural, majoritarian document.  It supported
what he called &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;-the idea that the
people in every state and territory of the U.S. have a right to
decide for themselves whether to allow slavery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lincoln understood the Constitution
to contain a moral component supplied by the Declaration.  The
&quot;laws of nature and of nature's God&quot; require that a
government be democratic to be legitimate.  At the same time,
however, they limit what democrats may legitimately choose.  The
power of Lincoln's rhetoric was always to show that extending
the definition of rights to mean the right to do wrong-as in the
right to have slaves-logically undermines the very idea of rights.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, the key to America's greatness
for Tocqueville was a religious spirit that fervently supported
liberty while guiding it clear of license.  For Lincoln it was
the Declaration, which sets forth the doctrine of rights but grounds
it in a doctrine of right.  The common element is the idea of
&quot;liberty under God.&quot;  For Tocqueville it is explicitly
the God of the Old and New Testaments.  For Lincoln it is the
God who is mentioned four times in the Declaration:  &quot;nature's
God&quot; who is the source of laws, the &quot;Creator&quot; who
endows men with rights, the &quot;Supreme Judge of the world&quot;
to whom the writers appeal for guidance, and &quot;divine providence&quot;
on whom free men must rely for protection.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just as &quot;liberty under God&quot;
is the key to America's past, the sundering of liberty from God
is the chief threat to our future.  We can see this threat in
the anti-religious attitudes among our elites that are more reminiscent
of Tocqueville's France than Tocqueville's America.  We can see
this threat in the licentious behavior that has eaten away at
the American family since the 1960s.  Restoring prayer in schools
may be only one step, but we believe it will be an important step
back from the precipice.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This booklet argues that Congress
has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation
allowing voluntary prayer in shcools.  The character of this prayer
would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the
preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions.  This would at once
recall the idea of &quot;liberty under God,&quot; and remind all
Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but
rather the formation of our unparalleled freedoms for two centuries.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We are a religious people,
whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There is no better way to confirm
the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William
O. Douglas, than to take a tour through the state constitutions.
 Forty-six of the fifty stateshave preambles invoking the name
of Almighty God</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
 A joint resolution of the Congress-which would require no more
than simple majorities in both houses-could declare that children
in public schools might lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing
only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is present
in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any
of the other states.  When this resolution is signed by the President-and
it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it-it could
take effect immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that
the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution. 
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected
branches of government, but also would require it, in effect,
to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We submit herewith some examples
of the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental
laws of the states.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Alabama, in order
to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure
the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking
the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and establish
the following Constitution and form of government . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of Arkansas,
grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberty,
and desiring to perpetuate its blessings . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of California,
grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Colorado, with profound
reverence for the Supreme Ruler of the Universe . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging
with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted
them to enjoy a free government . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>[Delaware] Through divine goodness,
all men have by nature the right of worshipping and serving their
Creator according to the dictates of their consciences . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of Maine . . . acknowledging
with grateful hearts the goodness of the Sovereign Ruler of the
Universe . . . and imploring God's aid and direction . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the State of New
Jersey, grateful to Almighty God for the civil and religious liberty
which He hath so long permitted us to enjoy, and looking to Him
for a blessing upon our endeavors to secure and transmit the same
unimpaired to succeeding generations . . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We the people of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, grateful to Almighty God for the blessings of
civil and religious liberty, and humbly invoking his guidance
. . .</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since through Divine Providence we
enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty, we the people
of West Virginia, in and through the provisions of this Constitution,
reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God and seek
diligently to promote, preserve and perpetuate good government
. . . </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This selection should be sufficient
to illustrate both the consistency in the patterns of all the
preambles, and the interesting variations that occur in some of
them.  Who could ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge
that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil and
religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant
reliance upon God to preserve and perpetuate it?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is notable that the state constitutions
have provisions equivalent to the &quot;no establishment&quot;
and &quot;free exercise&quot; clauses of the First Amendment to
the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice
for present purposes is that of California.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion
without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty
of conscience does not excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent
with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From this it is apparent that the
people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees
of religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions
of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that freedom in the same
constitutions.</FONT>
<P>

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>*   *   *   *   *</FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>American constitutions whether federal
or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration
of Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination
of a legal positivism which is simply unable to understand the
relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and
human law on the other.  Yet this relationship was axiomatic for
our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation-that
is to say, a moral duty- to obey the laws, either of our State,
or of the United States, there is only one answer.  It is because
those laws exist &quot;to secure these rights,&quot; rights with
which we have been &quot;endowed by [our] Creator.&quot;  Constitutional
governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights
whose origin is altogether independent of human will, rights which
are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in &quot;the
laws of nature and of nature's God.&quot;  Through the ages many
governments which did not respect the rights of the individual
have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But
the consent of the governed required by our republican constitutions
is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human
person.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Legal positivists deny to the Declaration
any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according
to the United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the
first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this is
not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that all
enabling acts since the Civil War have provided that the state
to be admitted must have a constitution &quot;republican in form&quot;
and that the constitution &quot;not be repugnant to the principles
of the Declaration of Independence.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The United States Constitution, while
guaranteeing to every state of the Union a republican form of
government, does not expressly say what that form is.  But the
Congress, in implementing that guarantee in the case of each new
state added to the Union in the last one hundred and thirty years,
does expressly define that form by the principles of the Declaration
of Independence.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under this mandate from the Congress,
we find these principles affirmed over and over again in the state
constitutions.  Here for example is Alabama.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Article I.  Declaration of Rights
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>That the great, general, and essential
principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and
established, we declare:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sec. 1. Inalienable rights.  That
all men are equally free and independent; that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Declaration of Rights of the
Constitution of the State of California has a similar provision,
which reads: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All people are by nature free and
independent and have inalienable rights.  Among these are enjoying
and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting
property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It can be seen that &quot;endowed
by their Creator&quot; and &quot;by nature&quot; are correlative
terms each implying the other.  It can also be seen that the rights
secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the
United States, are means of implementing antecedent rights whose
origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how
we can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating
in them an understanding of and a reverence for this origin. </FONT>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>MASSACHUSETTS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The end of the institution,
maintenance and administration of government, is to secure the
existence of the body-politic, to protect it, and to furnish the
individuals who compose it, with the power of enjoying in safety
and tranquility their natural rights, and the blessings of life:
 And whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people
have a right to alter the government, and to take measures necessary
for their safety, prosperity and happiness.-The Body-Politic is
formed by a voluntary association of individuals:  It is a social
compact, by which the whole people covenants with each Citizen,
and each Citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed
by certain Laws for the Common good.  It is the duty of the people,
therefore, in framing a Constitution of Government, to provide
for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial
interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man
may, at all times, find his security in them.  WE, therefore,
the people of Massachusetts, acknowledging, with grateful hearts,
the goodness of the Great Legislator of the Universe, in affording
us, in the course of his Providence, an opportunity, deliberately
and peaceably, without fraud, violence or surprise, or entering
into an Original, explicit, and Solemn Compact with each other;
and of forming a New Constitution of Civil Government, for Ourselves
and Posterity; and devoutly imploring His direction in so interesting

or for his religious profession or sentiments; provided he doth
not Disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious
Worship.-</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Part I, Art. III.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;As the happiness of a people,

be generally diffused through a Community, but by the institution
of the public Worship of God, and of public instructions in piety,
religion and morality:  Therefore, to promote their happiness
and to secure the good order and preservation of their government,
the people of this Commonwealth have a right to invest their legislature
shall, from time to time, authorize and require, the several Towns,
Parishes, precincts, and other bodies politic, or religious societies,
to make suitable provision, at their own Expence, for the institution
of Public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance
of public protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality,
in all cases where such provision shall not be made Voluntarily.-And
the people of this Commonwealth have also a right to, and do,
invest their legislature with authority to enjoin upon all the
Subjects an attendance upon the instructions of the public teachers
aforesaid, at stated times and seasons, if there be any on whose
instructions they can Conscientiously and conveniently attend-PROVIDED
notwithstanding, that the several towns, parishes, precincts,
and other bodies politic, or religious societies, shall, at all
times, have the exclusive right of electing their public Teachers,
and of contracting with them for their support and maintenance.-And
all monies paid by the Subject to the Support of public worship,
and of the public teachers aforesaid, shall, if he require it,
be uniformly applied to the support of the public teacher or teachers
of his own religious sect or denomination, provided there be any
on whose instructions he attends: otherwise it may be paid towards
the support of the teacher or teachers of the parish or precinct
in which the said monies are raised-And every denomination of
christians, demeaning themselves peaceably, and as good Subjects
of the Commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of
the Law:  And no subordination of any one sect or denomination
to another shall ever be established by law.&quot;</FONT>

<h1>On the Front Line of the Culture War:</h1>
<h3>Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America</h3>
<b>William A. Donohue</B>
</center>

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center width=85%>

<h3>Preface</h3>

On May 24, 1993, Roberta Achtenberg was confirmed as U.S. 
Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.  
This was a ballyhooed "historic first" of the Clinton era:  
Achtenberg is a homosexual activist.  
<P>

Less than two weeks later, President Clinton scuttled the 
politically-disastrous nomination of his long-time friend and 
political ally Lani Guinier for the nation's top civil rights post.  
More startling to the public was that he had nominated her in the 
first place:  Guinier had built her entire reputation on 
challenging the idea of majority rule, both in elections and in 
legislatures.    
<P>

These events are related, and their connection is related to the 
theme of this booklet.
<P>

What Winston Churchill and others have admired about 
Scouting over the years is that it supports the work of family, 
church, and country, attaching boys' loyalties to—in Churchill's 
words—"Right and Truth, however the winds may blow."  It 
stood against the strange 19th-century philosophical view  that 
winds (or history) is all there is—that right and truth change 
with time and circumstance.  This philosophy, called 
"historicism," animated both German National Socialism and 
Soviet Communism earlier in this century.  In a more benign 
form, it came to roost in American universities and is now 
making inroads in American government.     
<P>

We know this philosophy as moral relativism.  Its adherents 
speak not of morals but of "values," none of which are 
objectively superior to any others.  For instance, one person's 
values may tell them that the best kind of family consists of a 
man and a woman and children.  Others' values may say that the 
best kind of a family consists of a man and five women and 
children, or two men and children, or two women and children 
and a rabbit.  And no one can legitimately hold that any of these is 
superior, except merely subjectively.  Nor can the government 
take a legitimate interest in promoting one arrangment over the 
others.  That would be "legislating morality."  In fact, the 
government should legislate against morality, or against the right 
of private citizens and organizations to make moral distinctions. 
This is the view of Roberta Achtenberg who, in fact, gained 
fame as a San Francisco Supervisor with her heavy-handed 
efforts to force the Boy Scouts to reverse their ban on homo-
sexual Scoutmasters.  And it is the view endorsed by the Clinton 
administration, not only by the fact of Achtenberg's appointment 
to high federal office, but also of Clinton's Interior Department's 
official endorsement of a National Park Service ban on using Boy 
Scout volunteers in America's national parks.
<P>

But homosexuals and atheists (who have also dragged the 
Boy Scouts into court, seeking to outlaw the right of private 
citizens and organizations to make religious distinctions) have a 
big problem:  Most Americans, while not inclined to snoop into 
each others' private lives, believe that sodomy is wrong and 
want to raise their children in that view.  Most Americans, while 
not inclined to talk overly-much about it, believe in God and 
want to raise their children in that view.  And most Americans 
think our country is tops precisely because its principles, based 
on "the laws of nature and of nature's God," support their views 
and their right to raise their children as they see fit.
<P>

And there's the rub.  What the majority thinks of as freedom 
isn't what organized homosexuals and atheists and their modern 
(as opposed to Jeffersonian) liberal supporters think of as 
freedom—namely, freedom from all social constraints.  The 
solution, according to Lani Guinier—whose views President 
Clinton knew perfectly well before he nominated her, and whose 
views he shares, according to her, despite his public denials 
when he cut her loose under fire—is that judges and bureaucrats 
should rule us despite our druthers, according to their 
"enlightened" views.
<P>

Back in the Reagan years, Attorney General Ed Meese became 
embroiled in a remarkable running debate with Supreme Court 
Justice William Brennan, over how judges should decide cases 
involving the Constitution.  Meese said they should look to the 
original meaning of the Constitution and respect majority rule.  
Brennan, referring to the founding era as "a world that is dead 
and gone," explained why he would prohibit the death penalty 
despite its popularity and its explicit authorization in the Fifth 
Amendment:  "On this issue, the death penalty, I hope to 
embody a community striving for human dignity for all. . . ."  
With his use of the personal pronoun, Brennan suggested that 
he, an unelected judge, is better able to "embody the 
community" than Americans' elected representatives.  
<P>

The American Civil Liberties Union—a major player in recent 
attacks on the Boy Scouts, as Bill Donohue recounts in this 
booklet—stood foursquare with Brennan.  In a cover letter to a 
petition calling for Meese's ouster, ACLU Executive Director Ira 
Glasser wrote:  "It is only a very small and special group of 
Americans (less than 1%) who understand the importance of 
fighting to sustain individual freedom."  A friend and I 
responded in a newspaper editorial at the time:  "What 
arrogance!  And what a threat to liberty!"  
<P>

We continued:  Vladimir Lenin once made the argument that 
representative democracy was not really democratic 
at all, because the majority of people in democracies 
do not have the requisite knowledge to vote in their 
own true interests.  Democratic majorities are much 
too concerned with their families, for instance, and 
with obtaining better working conditions and better 
pay, with utilizing their right to start their own 
businesses, etc., ever to vote to abolish private 
property.
<P>

How stupid, said Lenin.  It's a good thing I'm here to 
"embody the community," because the people 
themselves would never vote for their true 
representatives.
<P>

That is how Lenin used to talk, and how communists 
still talk.  And it appears—by his suggestion that we 
should be embodied or represented, for our own 
good, by nine unelected lawyers with life tenure on 
the Supreme Court—that William Brennan considers 
the court to be something like an American Politburo. 
. . .  But if the "liberal" anti-democratic faction 
[represented by Brennan and the ACLU] ever gains 
full control of our government, then we will say, after 
Lincoln, that we would prefer emigrating to Russia, 
where we can take our despotism unalloyed.

<P>
What a goofy world:  Seven years later, Leninists have been 
expelled from the Kremlin and Brennanists have taken over the 
White House.  
<P>

This investigation of recent attacks on the Boy Scouts shows 
us clearly how the enemies of morality and religion operate 
pseudo-democratically, and suggests how to defeat them with 
the real thing.
<P>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<b>Assault on the the Boy Scout Tradition</b>
<P>

"On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and 
country and to obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all 
times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and 
morally straight."  
<P>

For seven decades, the Boy Scout Oath was considered 
wholly unexceptional by almost everyone.  But in the 1980s it 
became the target of homosexuals, atheists and (to a lesser 
degree) feminists. Acting in concert with these groups is the 
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the legal arm of modern 
liberalism.  At stake is whether private organizations that 
support traditional morality are protected by the law against 
assaults by their enemies.  Despite its desire just to be left alone, 
the Boy Scouts of America has found itself on the front line of the 
culture war.
<P>

Scouting was introduced to America in 1910 by its founder, 
Lord Robert Baden-Powell.  In the first articles of incorporation, 
the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) defined its purpose:  "to 
promote, through organization, and cooperation with other 
agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and 
others, to train them in Scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, 
courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods 
which are in common use by Boy Scouts."
<P>

The Scout Oath, which was first published in 1911 in The 
Official Boy Scout Handbook, requires every Scout to obey Scout 
Law.  Scout Law provides that every Scout be trustworthy, loyal, 
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, 
brave, clean and reverent.
<P>

In addition to the Boy Scouts, for boys from 11- to 17-years-
old, there are the Cub Scouts and the Tiger Scouts, which begin 
in the first grade. There is also the Explorers, focusing on 
exploring careers, for young people of both sexes, ages 14 to 20.  
Scout troops are sponsored at the local level by churches, 
schools, and various civic organizations.  
<P>

The BSA has 4.3 million members and 1.1 million adult 
volunteers.  Approximately one-half of all American boys try 
Cub Scouting and about one in five become Boy Scouts.  
Gays, Godless, and Girls Want In
<P>

In 1980 a 17-year-old Scout named Timothy Curran decided 
to take a male date to his senior prom.  The Oakland Tribune 
published a photo of the couple and Curran was called to appear 
before the Boy Scouts' Mount Diablo Council office in Walnut 
Creek, California.  Executive Director Quentin Alexander told 
Curran that he could not continue in scouting, stating that 
"homosexuality and Boy Scouting are not com-patible."   Curran 
sued the Boy Scouts, seeking an injunction to prevent them from 
excluding him from membership and from being a troop leader.  
Curran enlisted the ACLU, which claimed that in barring him 
the BSA violated the "equal public accommodations" section of 
the state Civil Rights Act.  Similar lawsuits have subsequently 
been filed by James Dale and Chuck Merino, homosexual Boy 
Scout leaders in Monmouth, New Jersey and San Diego, 
California, respectively.     
<P>

In 1989 Elliott Welsh agreed to his 6-year-old son Mark's 
request to join the Tiger Cubs.  But when he discovered at a 
recruiting meeting in Burr Ridge, Illinois that Mark would have 
to abide by a religious requirement, he sued the BSA. Two years 
later attorney James Randall, the Anaheim, California father of 
nine-year-old twins, sued the BSA for a similar reason: he 
objected to the Cub Scout Oath for mentioning God.  He was 
assisted by the ACLU.
<P>

In 1991 an eight-year-old Florida girl, Margo Mankes, filed 
suit against the Boy Scouts for excluding her from joining.  
Though the ACLU was not active in her case, it did express 
interest in representing several girls from Quincy, California 
who sought to become Boy Scouts.
<P>

The immediate issue in these cases is whether the BSA can 
continue to function according to its own precepts or will have to 
abide by those of others.  The longer term question is whether 
traditional morality can be sustained in our democracy.  And as 
a corollary:  Can our democracy itself be sustained?    
Boy Scout Thinking on Homosexuality
<P>

At the Timothy Curran-BSA trial, a Scout official testified 
that, from the beginning of the Boy Scouts, "it was clearly 
understood that homosexuality was an immoral behavior and 
had no place in Scouting for youth or leaders."   Lee Sneath, a 
national spokesman for the BSA, explained that "as an 
organization that stresses the values of the family, we believe 
that homosexuals do not provide the proper role model for 
youth membership."
<P>

The idea that homosexuality is wrong did not originate, nor 
will it end, with the Boy Scouts of America.  As political scientist 
Harry V. Jaffa has written:  
<P>
<blockquote>
From ancient—and biblical—times, this practice has 
been regarded by the greatest legislators and 
moralists as a vicious sexual perversion.  It is 
condemned equally by the Old and New Testaments, 
and by Plato in his Laws.  Thomas Jefferson, in a 
criminal code written during the American 
Revolution, made it a felony in the same class as rape.  
In this he only followed the common law. 
Nor is the connection between this idea and the family 
unprecedented or unreasonable:
Mankind as a whole is recognized by its generations, 
like a river which is one and the same while the ever-
renewed cycles of birth and death flow on.  But the 
generations are constituted—and can only be 
constituted—by the acts of generation arising from 
the conjunction of male and female. . . .  Equally with 
rape and incest, homosexuality strikes at the 
authority and dignity of the family.  The distinction 
between a man and a woman is as fundamental as 
any in nature, because it is the very distinction by 
which nature itself is constituted.
</blockquote>
<P>

This philosophical (and common sense) view is of course 
compatible with traditional religious views:  As has been cutely 
(and acutely) noted about the biblical account of creation, God 
made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.  Thus The Official Boy 
Scout Handbook explains the meaning of "morally straight" in the 
Boy Scout Oath in these terms:  "[w]hen you live up to the trust 
of fatherhood your sex life will fit into God's wonderful plan of 
creation.  Fuller understanding of wholesome sex behavior can 
bring you lifelong happiness."
<P>

Practically speaking, of course, the BSA is also concerned 
about pedophilia.  Although most homosexuals may not be 
pedophiles, as BSA spokesman Sneath pointed out, the Scouts 
"provide a natural hunting ground for pedophiles."   Thus the 
BSA has launched an aggressive anti-abuse campaign, and 
guidelines now discourage such traditional practices as skinny-
dipping and forbid boys to sleep in the tent of adults other than a 
parent or guardian.
<P>

Article VIII of the BSA Bylaws states:  "Our membership 
standards have been developed to ensure that we have the best 
possible individuals in our organization, and the enforcement of 
these standards should not be construed to suggest that any 
individual in question is not a decent citizen.  It simply means 
that the individual does not possess the requirements necessary 
for membership in the Boy Scouts of America."  
This policy is comparable to that of the American Lung 
Association, which because of its principles on health probably 
would not want to be represented by smokers.
Judge Sally G. Disco of the Los Angeles County Superior 
Court understood that exclusion of homosexuals was critical to 
the Boy Scout mission:
<P>

<blockquote>
Inclusion of a homosexual Scoutmaster who has 
publicly acknowledged his or her homosexuality 
would either undermine the force of the Boy Scout 
view that homosexuality is immoral and inconsistent 
with the Scout oath and law, or would undermine the 
credibility of the Scoutmaster who attempts to 
communicate that view.   
</blockquote>
<P>

For Judge Disco—whose decision we will say more about 
below—the case against the Boy Scouts hinged on whether 
promoting traditional morality, like promoting public health, is 
protected by the First Amendment.

<h3>Boy Scout Thinking on Atheism</h3>

About 30 percent of all Boy Scouts are sponsored by churches, 
with support coming most heavily from the Church of Latter 
Day Saints, the United Methodist Church and the Roman 
Catholic Church.  This is not surprising:  The BSA promotes 
belief in God and a sense of responsibility to God.  On the other 
hand, it is nonsectarian in its attitude toward religious training.  
Boys are encouraged to respect other religions.  Indeed, God and 
religion are understood so broadly that in practice even 
Buddhists, who do not believe in a Supreme Being, are welcome 
to join.
<P>

Still Elliott Welsh found room to carp.  Of course Welsh is no 
stranger to courtrooms:  In 1970 he achieved notoriety when the 
Supreme Court threw out his three-year prison sentence for 
claiming conscientious objection status to the Vietnam War on 
ethical (as opposed to religious, since he is not religious) 
grounds.  
<P>

At issue in the Welsh-BSA case were the Tiger Cub Promise 
and the Declaration of Religious Principle.  The former consists of 
16 words: "I promise to love God, my family, and my country, 
and to learn about the world."  The latter says in part:  "The Boy 
Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the 
best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God and 
therefore recognizes the religious element in the training of the 
member."  Elliott Welsh characterized this as "bigoted, 
outmoded boilerplate." 
<P>

The burden of proof is on Welsh.  No less than George 
Washington held the opposite view.  He said in his Farewell 
Address:
<P>
<blockquote>
Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to 
political prosperity, religion and morality are 
indispensable supports.  In vain would that man 
claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to 
subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these 
firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. . . .  
Let it simply be asked where is the security for 
property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of 
religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the 
instruments of investigation in the Courts of Justice?  
And let us with caution indulge the supposition that 
morality can be maintained without religion.    
</blockquote>
<P>

Indeed, this view has been held by all of our presidents down 
to the modern day.   It is woven deep in the fabric of our 
national life.  Alexis de Tocqueville observed in 1848:  "An 
American sees in religion the surest guarantee of the stability of 
the State and the safety of individuals."   And Justice William 
O. Douglas in 1952:  
<P>
<blockquote>
We are a religious people whose institutions 
presuppose a Supreme Being.  We guarantee the 
freedom to worship as one chooses.  [We] sponsor an 
attitude on the part of government that shows no 
partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish 
according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal 
of its dogma.  When the state encourages religious 
instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by 
adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian 
needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then 
respects the religious nature of our people and 
accomodates the public service to their spiritual 
needs.  To hold that it may not would be to find in 
the Constitution a requirement that the government 
show a callous indifference to religious groups.  That 
would be preferring those who believe in no religion 
over those who do believe. 
</blockquote>
<P>

The BSA prevailed against Welsh's suit, but not James 
Randall's.  Randall has not only sued the BSA on behalf of his 
sons, but a San Diego Girl Scout troop as well, for denying 6-
year-old Nitzya Cuevas-Macias entrance into meetings for 
refusing to pledge to serve God.
<P>

As we will see below, the issue here is whether Justice 
Douglas's worst case scenario will be enacted into law—whether 
the old liberal idea of freedom of religion will be replaced by the 
modern liberal idea of freedom from religion.  
Boy Scout Thinking on Girl Applicants
<P>

The Boy Scouts don't accept girls for the same reason the 
Girl Scouts don't accept boys.  Blake Lewis of the BSA explained:  
"The emotional, psychological and physical needs of young boys 
are very different in this age group from the needs of young 
girls."   Same sex programs and institutions have been a staple 
of youth organizations for decades.  There is no reason to 
interpret this as discrimination in the pejorative sense of the 
word.  Indeed, as mentioned above, the BSA's Explorers include 
girls.  And women now comprise three percent of Scoutmasters 
nationwide. 
<P>

This wasn't enough for Mark Rubin, the attorney who 
unsuccessfully represented Margo Mankes. "The Scouts are 
training boys to be successful," he said.  "The Girl Scouts' 
purpose is to make women better homemakers.  There is no 
alternative as good as the Boy Scouts."   
<P>

Clearly this is a less serious threat to the BSA, at least for now, 
than the threats from homosexuals and atheists.  So we will not 
belabor it except to point out that there are more reasonable 
alternatives than suing the Boy Scouts to admit girls, e.g., 
working to reform the Girl Scouts or founding a new 
organization for girls.  
<P>

That such an obviously unreasonable route was taken 
indicates an ulterior motive.  

<h3>The Culture War Against the Boy Scouts</h3>

Levi Strauss Company, Bank of America and Wells Fargo 
yanked their donations to the BSA in the summer of 1992 over 
the exclusion of homosexuals.  The United Way of DeKalb 
County, Illinois, has denied funding to the local BSA council, as 
has the United Way of the San Francisco Bay Area, which used 
to donate nearly $500,000.  (Nationwide, the United Way con-
tributes roughly 25 percent of the BSA budget.)  In 1993, the San 
Diego school board voted unanimously to oust the Scouts from 
running school-day programs in the eighth-largest district in the 
nation. 
<P>

In an unusal effort, Lewis S. Albert, the western region  acting 
director of the National Park Service, told his sub-ordinates that 
they should terminate all agreements with the BSA, such as the 
use of Boy Scout volunteers in the parks.  This directive was 
overridden by the Bush administration, which told the National 
Park Service bureaucrats that it was not their business to 
interfere with the policies of private associations like the Boy 
Scouts.  But less than three weeks into the Clinton 
administration, Clinton's Interior Department rescinded the 
Bush override. 

<h3>How does one make sense of this?</h3>

Most Americans have never found the Boy Scouts to be 
anything but commendable.  Recently, however, a very 
influential group has come to find it anachronistic.  More than 
that, they want to force the BSA to change or (as they might say) 
"drag it into the modern world."
<P>
  
The term "new class," as employed by social commentator 
Irving Kristol and others, refers to modern liberals, usually 
educated at America's elite colleges and universities, who work 
in the media, the academy, government, and other non-profit 
sectors of the economy.  Ideologically alienated from 
"bourgeois" society, they are strategically placed—e.g., in New 
York, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, and on the faculties of most 
college campuses, particularly in the humanities, the social 
sciences and law—to undermine the traditional beliefs and way 
of life of the American middle class. This "new class" espouses 
"politically correct" thinking:  the view that any departure from 
the modern liberal agenda is racist, sexist or homophobic, and 
thus beyond the pale in modern society.  Increasingly they resort 
to the courts, in effect criminalizing politically incorrect (i.e., 
traditional or conservative) policies and even speech.
<P>

This tendency to resort to coercion to get their way is the most 
obvious behavioral trait distinguishing modern liberals from their 
classical liberal forbears.  Whereas liberals even a generation ago 
(like Justice William O. Douglas) believed deeply in the Bill of 
Rights and democracy, modern liberals use charges of racism, 
sexism, and homophobia as clubs to stifle free debate and bully 
the majority into submission.
<P>

These are the people who have singled out the Boy Scouts for 
extreme measures.  

<h3>Discriminating Discrimination</h3>

The attackers of the Boy Scouts draw some astounding 
comparisons.  Consider Jon Davidson, Timothy Curran's ACLU 
lawyer:  
<P>
<blockquote>
If the Boy Scouts claimed to espouse anti-Semitism, 
would that excuse exclusion of all Jewish Scout-
masters?  If they stated that they believed that blacks 
were inferior, would they have a 'right' to practice 
discrimination against African-Americans? 
Likewise, Elliott Welsh called the argument that the Boy 
Scouts should be able to exclude the nonreligious "every bit as 
compelling as the argument that because black players were 
excluded from major-league baseball in 1910 they should be 
excluded today."
</blockquote>
<P> 

Let us consider these points one by one. 
<P>

To compare the exclusion of homosexuals to the exclusion of 
Jews and blacks—from any organization—is illogical.  Those 
who object to Jews or blacks joining an organization may not 
rationally assert that what they object to is related to character or 
behavior.  The opposite is true of homosexuals.  To speak of 
homosexuals without addressing sodomy, which is what 
homosexuals do, is as irrational as talking about vegetarians 
without discussing vegetables, which is what vegetarians eat.  It 
is precisely their sodomite behavior that defines homosexuals 
and that the Boy Scouts and the great majority of Americans find 
objectionable. 
<P>

Curran explained his goal as being to secure "the same kind 
of opportunities as everyone else in this country and not be judged 
differently because of whom I love" (emphasis added).   
Understood this way, homosexuality is akin to adultery and 
incest and bestiality.  It is clearly not akin to being black or 
Jewish.
<P>

Nor does the analogy of black ballplayers and atheists work.  
Blacks were excluded from baseball not for what they believed 
or didn't believe, which is related to character and behavior, but 
for their skin color, which is not related to belief or character or 
behavior and which is not therefore a rational category by which 
to discriminate between people.  
<P>

A much more logical analogy to the Boy Scouts' exclusion of 
atheists is the exclusion by Honor Societies of students who don't 
maintain a certain grade point average.  In these cases, the 
exclusion is related to the purpose of the organization.  Not so 
with baseball before Jackie Robinson.  Quite the opposite:  It was 
contrary to the purpose of baseball to exclude talented players 
who could help their teams win games.   
<P>

When asked when discrimination is permissible, Jon 
Davidson answered that it "is only permissible under the 
Constitution when without it the reason for the organization 
would cease to exist."   But this point is in favor of the Boy 
Scouts:  The BSA is a private organization that exists to form 
boys to be "morally straight," "practice wholesome sex 
behavior," and love and serve God and country.  This purpose 
obviously precludes the membership of homosexuals and 
atheists.  
<P>

By seeking in the courts to force homosexuals and atheists on 
the Boy Scouts, its enemies seek to destroy the BSA as now 
constituted.  

<h3>Stands for Diversity? </h3>

Why don't those who are excluded from the Boy Scouts 
establish their own organizations?  Isn't that the American way?  
To found the Gay Scouts or the Godless Scouts of America?  Or 
the Girl Boy Scouts?  No doubt the BSA would only greet such 
news with relief, as its resources could go again to fulfilling its 
mission rather than to paying its attorneys.
<P>

The truth of the matter is that the modern liberal "political-
correctness police" are in the business of limiting choices rather 
than offering more.  What is perverse in their case is that, unlike 
real policemen, they pose and are portrayed by the media as the 
high priests of tolerance and diversity.  For example:  A task 
force of the United Way of the San Francisco Bay Area 
recommended that the BSA "adopt a local policy that is in 
harmony with the social diversity, values and spirit of the Bay 
Area."   Ditto Time magazine:  "What is most troubling in the 
Boy Scouts' new emphasis on privacy is the hint that the group 
serves as a retreat for parents who dislike the diverse and 
tolerant world of today."   
<P>
He, of course, knows that the BSA's interest in privacy 
rights is not new; it extends to its origins in 1910.  As for who 
really supports diversity and tolerance, let's be real:  it is not the 
BSA which is suing gays, the godless and girls, but the latter, 
along with the ACLU, who are suing the BSA.
Culture and Politics
<P>

More than 90 percent of Americans proclaim allegiance to 
God.  A similarly huge majority finds sodomy objectionable.  The 
Boy Scout Oath, law, and mission are highly reflective of what 
most Americans hold dear.  It follows that, to a large extent, the 
BSA's status under the law reflects the status of the American 
majority.  In this way we begin to see the culture war as 
inseparable from current political and constitutional con-
troversies in America. 
<P>

Culture reflects the higher ideas, theological and 
philosophical, that unite society and inform politics.  Moral 
precepts drawn from these higher ideas instruct not only the 
mores of society, but the legal code as well.  "Thou shalt not kill" 
is at once a biblical commandment, an expression of the natural 
law of reason, and a positive or man-made law.  Such integration 
of religion's moral prescriptions with the moral tenets of natural 
and positive law went largely unchallenged until the late 1960s, 
when those who now form America's "new class" became hostile 
to American morality and religion.  
<P>

Today it is no exaggeration to say that America's cultural 
elite—another description of the "new class"—is at war with the 
actual culture.  This was clear during the controversy over the 
NEA-subsidized photography of Robert Mapplethorpe.  
Americans' anger at having their taxes used to create and exhibit 
pornographic and sacreligious art was routinely charac-terized 
by the media, academics and "progressive" politicians as 
censorious in the worst sense of the term.
<P>

The BSA has been targeted by modern liberals precisely 
because it promotes the morality that was offended by 
Mapplethorpe—the morality that upholds marriage and sees the 
family as the primary force for the elevation of character and 
thus culture.  Against this the cultural elite touts moral 
neutrality.  As we have seen, though, this "neutrality" is 
deceptive.  It claims to accept every faith and every creed, but 
tolerates no departure from its own relativism.  And to enforce 
its orthodoxy it supports big and intrusive government—
especially government's least accountable, nonelected branches, 
the courts and the bureaucracy.
<P>

From the perspective of the cultural elite, then, the central 
problem with the BSA is not its penchant for exclusivity, but who 
the BSA excludes.  Indeed, the elite itself seeks to exclude 
traditional morality and religion from American society.  

<h3>The Role and Significance of the ACLU</h3>

Coercion is the means of choice of the cultural elite.  It seeks 
to seize the legal arsenal of the state and impose on society a set 
of rules and regulations that run contrary to existing mores.  
Whether the issue is speech codes on college campuses, creches 
on public property, racial quotas in the workplace, male-only 
clubs or mother-daughter dinners, the coercive thrust of political 
correctness is evident.  Its motto is not "Inclusiveness or Bust," 
but "Inclusiveness or Else."
<P>

Since the rank-and-file that constitute the American public are 
not, like the elite, alienated from the traditional American 
culture—since, in fact, they are resistant to radical social 
change—the elite must work its will from the top down, using 
the club of the law.  And no one knows better how to swing this 
club than the American Civil Liberties Union. 

<h3>A New Understanding of Liberty</h3>

In 1920, ten years after the BSA was founded, Roger Baldwin 
founded the American Civil Liberties Union.  At one level the 
organizations have something in common: they are private, 
draw heavily on volunteers, and promote freedom.  The 
overarching difference is in their understanding of freedom.  Put 
simply, the ACLU promotes rights without duties and the BSA 
promotes the two together.
<P>

In the traditional view, there is no contradiction between 
rights and duties.  Both are needed in a free society.  As political 
scientist Francis Canavan has written,
The basic American ideal, in a phrase that the 
Supreme Court regularly uses, is "ordered liberty"    . 
. . .  It is a liberty that exists within and depends upon 
an order of law, of social institutions, and ultimately 
on moral principles that are widely enough accepted 
that we can say that they represent society's 
consensus. 
<P>

A new idea held by modern liberals is quite different.  
According to it, liberty connotes "a radical individualism that 
rejects all social norms and institutions that the individual has 
not agreed to."   Subscribers to this idea defend the right of 
Nazis (who themselves despise the idea of rights) to march 
through Skokie, Illinois but not the right of Skokians and their 
elected leaders to maintain order and defend the dignity of the 
principles and customs they hold most dear.  Likewise they 
support the right of homosexuals and atheists to invade and 
destroy the Boy Scouts.

<H3>The ACLU and Statism</H3>

ACLU activists and their supporters seek to restructure 
American society using the law as their weapon.  Their contempt 
for traditional America is not new:  the ACLU was named as a 
Communist front in the 1930s by Earl Browder, the general 
secretary of the Communist Party U.S.A.   Roger Baldwin spoke 
cynically of feigning loyalty to America as he was launching the 
organization:  "We want to get a good lot of flags, talk a good 
deal about the Constitution and what our forefathers wanted to 
make of this country, and to show that we are really the folks 
that really stand for the spirit of our institutions."   The ACLU 
became a vociferous supporter of Stalin's rule in the Soviet 
Union.   There was a period between 1940 and the mid-1960s 
when the ACLU moved to the center.  But today it is as radical as 
ever.
<P>

The most direct and lasting way the ACLU impacts American 
culture and politics is by lodging lawsuits against private 
associations like the Boy Scouts.  How does this work?
America is divided into state and society, or into public and 
private spheres.  As the state grows in power, the authority 
exercised by individuals in society declines.  As the public 
sphere grows, the private sphere shrinks.  We are used to 
thinking about this give-and-take in regard to the economy, but 
it operates as well in other areas.
<P>

Private associations such as the family, schools, churches, 
businesses, service clubs, and political parties and organizations 
stand or mediate in society between the individual and the state.  
They facilitate the workings of the free market and democratic 
politics.  They form character and transmit culture.  American 
government has traditionally supported them, to the extent it has 
not just left them alone.  Tyrannical states like the former Soviet 
Union seek to subvert and/or control them.  
<P>
The autonomy of these associations is as important to a 
country's political freedom as the free market is to a country's 
economic prosperity.  As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 
Democracy in America:  "The morals and intelligence of a 
democratic people would be in as much danger as its commerce 
and industry if ever a government wholly usurped the place of 
private associations."   This is the ultimate stake in the culture 
war against groups like the BSA.
<P>

When the ACLU wins a case against one of these private 
associations in court, it crows about gaining a right for some 
individual.  But at the same time it has transferred power from 
the association, thus from American society or the private 
sphere, to the state.  In some cases, when a legitimate right is 
involved, this is warranted, e.g., when the state removes an 
abused child from the custody of its parents.  But such 
interventions should be the extreme exception to the rule.  If they 
become customary, the state has superceded the family, to the 
great detriment—not gain—of liberty as traditionally 
understood.
<P>

This reduction of traditional liberty, and its replacement with 
modern liberalism's quite new brand of liberty, is the ACLU's 
goal.  For instance, it holds the view (with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton) that minor children should have standing in court to sue 
their parents.  This would open the family to the same kind of 
arbitrary regulation by judges to which businesses are now 
subject under affirmative action laws—in the name, of course, of 
the rights of children.    
<P>

The ACLU is driven by an atomistic vision of liberty.  It 
envisions solitary individuals, armed with rights and unen-
cumbered by duties.  This vision doesn't conform with reality.  
When we look at society we do not see solitary individuals.  
Rather we see constellations of people in association—in 
families, tribes, cities, churches, businesses, clubs, etc.  These 
groups arise naturally when people are left alone.    
This explains the great paradox of the ACLU:  its atomistic 
ideal is so unnatural that its realization (if possible) would 
require a great coercive power.  Thus it is that an organization 
devoted solely to individual rights seeks in practice the total 
aggrandizement of the state.

<h3>The ACLU vs. the Family</H3>

The ACLU and its modern liberal supporters do not consider 
any one type of family to be definitive.  They believe that 
children can be raised equally well in any sort of social 
arrangement.  This relativistic approach to marriage and the 
family explains why they believe that homosexuals should be 
Scoutmasters.
<P>

The ACLU objects to laws which proscribe adultery, 
prostitution (including street solicitation), cohabitation and 
polygamy, as well as homosexual marriages.  Its New Jersey 
affiliate has advanced a definition of the family that is so broad 
that it includes halfway houses for recovering alcoholics and 
drug addicts. 
<P>

In 1986 the ACLU became the first organization in the 
country to endorse the legalization of homosexual marriages.  
Among the other rights and benefits it has sought for 
homosexuals are foster parenthood, employee fringe benefits, 
insurance benefits, income tax benefits, survivorship, and other 
economic benefits that accompany the hospitalization of a 
spouse.  And its labors have born fruit:  in 1989 New York's 
highest court held that two homosexual men who had lived 
together for a decade should be considered a family under New 
York City's rent-control regulations.  
<P>

In addition to suing the BSA, the ACLU has gone after Big 
Brothers, whose central aim is to provide fatherless boys with 
appropriate role models.  Naturally, like the Boy Scouts, Big 
Brothers reasons that homosexuals do not fit that description.  
Columnist William Raspberry, for one, has taken the sane 
view that homosexuals "could very well destroy an organization 
like Big Brothers."  He notes that between 1982 and 1987 five Los 
Angeles-area Big Brothers were convicted of sex offenses 
involving boys to whom they were assigned.  He concludes that 
we should "draw the line at accepting gay couples as foster or 
adoptive parents and in positions in which the function of role 
model is primary." 
<P>

For both the Boy Scouts and Big Brothers, as for most 
Americans, children are best raised by a mother and a father.  
This arrangement is natural, moral, healthy, and holds the 
greatest promise for happiness.  Society has a manifest interest in 
promoting it.  Likewise those groups in society that supply role 
models. 
<P>

Modern liberals disagree.  The ACLU has successfully 
challenged laws, like one in Florida, that barred homosexuals 
from adopting children.  In 1992 it persuaded a Surrogate Court 
judge in New York to approve the adoption of a 6-year-old boy 
by the lesbian partner of the child's natural mother.     
Despite such victories, the Supreme Court ruling in Bowers v. 
Hardwick, the decision that failed to recognize sodomy as a 
constitutional right, buttresses claims that homosexuals may be 
excluded from positions as role models because their sodomite 
behavior renders them morally unfit.  As we will explain below, 
however, the courts are ultimately undependable when it comes 
to defending American morality.  

<h3>The ACLU vs. Religion</h3>

Given its atomistic vision of freedom, the ACLU and its 
supporters see the relationship between freedom and religion 
(especially monotheism, the antithesis of atomism) as essentially 
inimical.  Thus they intentionally misread the First Amendment 
as guaranteeing freedom from religion, rather than what it 
plainly says it guarantees and what so many have come to 
America seeking:  freedom of religion.
<P>
To get a sense of how far the ACLU would go in purging 
from society all public expressions of religion, consider the 
following list (it is not exhaustive) of practices the Union has 
opposed as unconstitutional:
<P>

<ul>
<li>the tax exemption of churches and synagogues
<li>creches and menorahs on public property
<li>the maintenance of chaplains by Congress
<li>the maintenance of chaplains by the Armed Services
<li>a city employees' Christmas pageant at a local zoo
<li>all blue law statutes
<li>the singing of "Silent Night" in the classroom
<li>Christian anti-drug groups who perform in public schools
<li>all voucher plans and tuition-tax credits
<li>the inscription "In God We Trust" on coins and postage
<li>government census questions on religious affiliations
<li>municipal funding of a platform to accomodate the Pope     
<li>kosher inspectors on the payroll of Miami Beach
<li>a statue of Jesus underwater off the coast of Key Largo
<li>the word "Christianity" on town seals
<li>prayers said in a huddle before a football game
</ul>

<P>
The ACLU's positions on church and state have become so 
unbending that even "strict separationists" like former board 
member and professed atheist Nat Hentoff have been taken 
aback:  "When I was elected to the national board of the 
American Civil Liberties Union some years ago," he wrote, "I 
thought I would be the most anti-clerical kid on that block."  
Three years later he left with a bad taste in his mouth:  "there are 
members of that board . . . who see the separation of church and 
state as so absolute that not a single religious word must be 
allowed to pass a schoolhouse door."   Yet recall:  the ACLU 
customarily defends the most obscene and profane words, in 
schools and everywhere else.
<P>

One of the major reasons given for suing the BSA for 
excluding atheists concerns Boy Scout meetings in public 
schools.  The latter should not be open, opponents say, to 
promoters of religious faith.  The question arises:  Why should 
young atheists and/or Marxists be allowed to meet after school, 
and not young believers in God and country?  
<P>

In 1984 a "Religious Speech Protection Act" was introduced 
in Congress to ensure students the right to voluntarily engage in 
religious speech.  The ACLU opposed it.  Rev. Barry Lynn of its 
Washington Office warned the House Education and Labor 
Committee that the bill would render it "hard to tell the 
classroom from the Sunday school room."   In the end the bill 
gained a majority but fell eleven votes short of the two-thirds 
majority necessary under the special procedure chosen for 
passage.  
<P>

After considerable negotiation an "Equal Access" bill was 
introduced, requiring that if a school permitted one 
noncurricular and student-initiated (i.e., non-school sponsored) 
meeting to occur before or after school, it could not deny other 
student groups the right to hold similar meetings.  It passed the 
Senate by a vote of 88-11, and won in the House by a margin of 
337-77.  The ACLU's Washington office remained warily neutral.  
This wasn't good enough for the national board, which came out 
squarely against the bill.  It was this decision that led Nat 
Hentoff to charge that the ACLU "has become a relentless 
opponent of student religious groups trying to secure their First 
Amendment rights under the Equal Access Act."   
<P>

Wherever there is a nexus, however indirect, between the 
public sector, however broadly defined, and the promotion of 
religion, however broadly defined, the ACLU and its modern 
liberal supporters swing into action.  The state grows more 
intrusive and Americans' natural and constitutional rights fall by 
the wayside.   

<h3>The Legal Case Against the BSA</h3>

"[T]he Boy Scouts are a public accommodation" according to 
ACLU executive director Ira Glasser.   This is the linchpin of the 
case against the BSA.  
<P>

Of course, none of its enemies charge that the BSA receives 
federal or state tax money.  That would appear to make it 
private.  But, they argue, the BSA receives indirect public 
subsidies from the United Way and the public schools, which 
provide free public space for Scout meetings.  (Indeed, public 
schools sponsor 1.1 million Scouts.)  The fine legal question, then, 
is whether every private organization that is allowed to use 
public facilities free of charge is thereby converted into a public 
accommodation and subjected to government regulation and 
control.

<h3>What is a Public Accommodation? </h3>

The most important federal public accommodations act is 
Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  It prohibits private entities 
from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion or 
national origin if it can reasonably be shown that such 
establishments function as public accommodations.  This has 
come to mean, essentially, that places like restaurants, hotels, 
movie theaters, and establishments covered by the interstate 
commerce laws cannot discriminate on the basis of race.  
Title II uses the terms "place of public accommodation" and 
"place of entertainment."  According to its legislative history, 
these terms should be interpreted as commonly understood.  
Thus organizations that do not have a physical site are not 
covered.  Boy Scout activities do not depend upon or necessarily 
emanate from particular facilities or locations. Meetings typically 
take place at private homes, schools and churches.  Lacking any 
court finding that suggests that an organization can qualify as a 
"place," the Boy Scouts have not been found to fall within the 
framework of Title II.
<P>

State public accommodation statutes cover more classes of 
persons and, more importantly, define public accommodations 
more broadly.  This is especially true in California—the state that 
delivered the ACLU its victory over the Boy Scouts in the case of 
the atheist Randall twins—due to the uniquely worded Unruh 
Act:
<P>
<blockquote>
All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are 
free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, 
color, religion, ancestry, or national origin are entitled 
to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, 
facilities, privileges, or services in all business 
establishments of every kind whatsoever. 
This was the crux of Curran v. Mount Diablo Council of the  Boy 
Scouts of America.  Though the Unruh Act does not mention 
sexual orientation, the California Supreme Court had previously 
interpreted it to prohibit discrimination based upon sexual 
orientation as well as on the categories actually listed. The 
question remaining was whether the BSA constituted a "business 
establishment of [any] kind whatsoever" (a phrase obviously 
much broader than "places of public accom-modation").  The 
trial court ruled that it did not.  The appellate court disagreed 
and reversed.
</blockquote>
<P>

In the preliminary ruling in Curran, Judge Sally Disco 
homilized that to allow the BSA to discriminate against 
homosexuals in the name of "American values" would "send a 
stark message about what the ideals of this country really 
mean."   Nevertheless she ruled against the plaintiff on the 
grounds that the BSA's First Amendment rights took precedence 
over the Unruh Act:  
<P>
<blockquote>
[T]he issue, of course, is not whether the defendant's 
view is correct, or enlightened, or even best 
calculated to achieve the organization's broader 
goals. . . .  The Supreme Court has long recognized a 
right to 'engage in association for the advancement of 
beliefs and ideas.'  The converse, a right not to 
associate, or the right of the group to exclude 
unwanted members, is also recognized. 
</blockquote>
<P>

In overturning Disco's decision, the appellate court acted 
more in accordance with today's judiciary:  it ignored the 
Constitution, relying primarily on a series of cases that had 
interpreted the Unruh Act broadly.  The term "business" meant 
"everything about which one can be employed."  The term 
"establishment" included everything from "fixed locations" to 
"permanent commercial forces or organizations."  And non-
profit organizations had been included.  The BSA was nailed.   
Again:  Outside of California the definition of public 
accommodations is narrower.  In at least four states, courts have 
rejected the idea that membership in an organization in and of 
itself is sufficient to qualify as a "place" for purposes of state 
laws prohibiting discrimination in places of public accom-
modations.  This reasoning was critical in Welsh v. Boy Scouts of 
America. 

<h3>Law and Politics </h3>

The anomaly in the above legal account is the decision of 
Judge Sally Disco:  despite her openly stated opposition to the 
morality of the Boy Scout Oath, she ruled according to the 
Constitution.  It is far more common today for judges to rule 
according to their personal view of what the outcome of a case 
should be.  
<P>

This is no secret.  Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, the 
very model of a modern judge to modern liberals, said the 
following in a major public speech at Georgetown University in 
the fall of 1985:
<P>
<blockquote>
Those who would restrict claims of right to the values 
of 1789 specifically articulated in the Constitution 
turn a blind eye to social progress . . . .  For the genius 
of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it 
might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but 
in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with 
current problems and needs.  What the constitutional 
fundamentals meant to the wisdom of other times 
cannot be their measure to the vision of our time.
</blockquote>
<P>

This reasoning opens the door to that new understanding of 
liberty mentioned above:  not liberty meaning that people are left 
pretty much alone to run their families and their businesses and 
their churches and to participate in other private associations, 
but liberty meaning that government (especially as composed by 
judges and bureaucrats) is left pretty much alone to regulate the 
private sector, according to the politically correct opinion of the 
day.  The converse of this is a new understanding of limited 
government:  not limited government meaning that the 
executive, legislative and judicial branches must stick to the 
powers assigned them in the Constitution, but meaning that the 
American majority must be limited in what it can do by elite 
opinion, operating again through the bureaucracy and the 
courts.  
<P>

Just how far modern liberals have departed from the 
principles of democracy has been pointed out by political 
scientist Thomas G. West:
<P>
<blockquote>
A view of judging that allows justices to consult their 
personal views of "American justice and fairness," in 
complete opposition to the majority, and without 
recurring to the Constitution except as a starting 
point, is nothing more than a return to the state of 
things that existed prior to the emergence of 
democracy in the modern world . . . .  In the medieval 
world, so-called experts unelected by the people—
kings, priests, and hereditary aristocrats—ruled on 
behalf of the majority because the majority could not 
be trusted to rule itself.   
</blockquote>
<P>

Understood in this light, recent attacks on the Boy Scouts 
have little to do with the law and everything to do with politics.  
The same will be true of the outcome of the culture war.  
The battle to defend the Boy Scouts will continue in the 
courts.  But if left on its own there the battle will eventually be 
lost, given the trend in the law schools and among judges to 
dismiss the Constitution and the principle of majority rule.  The 
battle must be won politically if it will be won at all.  

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h3>Defending the Boy Scouts and America</h3>

Let us recap what is happening:  Powerful groups in America 
are attacking the Boy Scouts of America, primarily because it 
teaches boys to believe in God and to follow a moral code that 
prohibits sodomy.  Strangely, these groups launch this attack in 
the name of rights.  
<P>

These rights aren't the natural rights in the Declaration of 
Independence, which were not open-ended and which clearly 
did not include an unnatural right to sodomy.  Nor are they 
constitutional rights:  As Judge Disco saw with regard to 
homosexuals, and Nat Hentoff with regard to atheists, the 
Constitution is plainly on the side of the Boy Scouts.  In fact, to 
modern liberals, in Justice Brennan's memorable phrase, natural 
rights and constitutional rights are relics of "a world that is dead 
and gone."  The rights in whose name they attack the Boy Scouts 
are new and different.  
<P>

As most Americans are by now aware, modern liberal judges 
have transformed the constitutional and statutory prohibitions 
against unequal protection of the laws based on race into a 
mandate for unequal protection of the laws based on race, i.e., 
affirmative action.  Fewer Americans are yet aware that this 
arbitrary designation of special rights and privileges is now the 
rule rather than the exception in most areas of American life.  
That is, the rights promoted by modern liberals and widely 
enforced by the courts are special rights that attach not equally to 
people as people, but unequally to people as members of special 
groups.

<h3>Does the Majority Have Rights?</h3>

Consider this ironic sidenote:  The ACLU has itself been 
found guilty of violating the very California statute under which 
it sued the Boy Scouts:  In 1987, it was forced to pay damages to 
Richard Long, who was arbitrarily ejected from a public meeting 
of the ACLU when he was identified as an off-duty police 
officer.   The moral is clear:  Because Mr. Long was not a 
member of a special group with special rights—whether 
criminals, atheists, homosexuals, or a racial or ethnic minority—
he was judged by these "civil libertarians" to have no rights.
Just as members of the majority like Mr. Long have no rights, 
the majority as a whole is deemed to have no rights under the 
modern liberal dispensation.  It is now customary for judges to 
tell American majorities that they can't do as they wish, whether 
it is putting convicted murderers to death or keeping 
pornography out of their communities or putting their kids in 
organizations which exclude homosexuals and atheists.
The culture war is being waged in the courts because it can 
not be won through elections.  It is anti-majoritarian.  It is a 
powerful elite minority against the large and increasingly 
powerless middle class.

<h3>Does the Majority Rule?</h3>

In the 1980s, ACLU activist and New York University law 
professor Sylvia A. Law succinctly captured the modern liberal 
vision of liberty.  It is regrettable, she wrote, that "the 
public/private distinction persists in constitutional doctrine" 
because in reality "the distinction between public and private is 
not sharp; it may indeed have no coherent meaning."   This is 
perfectly illustrative of what the culture war means politically.  It 
is also hogwash.  
<P>

In the American Constitution the distinction between public 
and private is very sharp and very coherent.  Government is set 
up to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness from threats foreign and domestic.  That the 
government may not become such a threat, it is limited in what it 
can do.  Within those limits, and through the institutions into 
which government is divided, the majority rules.  This 
arrangement provides for an immense private sector which has 
been the key to Americans' unprecedented personal freedom 
and unmatched prosperity for over 200 years.
<P>

It is important to remember that despite recent and even 
future setbacks, American morality and constitutional rights can 
still be defended.  This is true for a very simple reason:  The 
courts can not continue denying the constitutional rights of the 
majority without the support (whether active or passive) of the 
elective branches of government.  The so-called culture war can 
still be won by electing leaders at the local, state and national 
levels who support the traditional family, uphold freedom of 
religion, believe in limited government, and will appoint judges 
who respect majority opinion and the Constitution.
<P>

"If civil liberties are ever destroyed in this country," Midge 
Decter has written, "it won't be by boys taking oaths but rather 
by people intent on stretching the delicate and complex social 
fabric of this free society beyond its breaking point."   The BSA 
is a pawn in the culture war.  But it represents perfectly what 
modern liberals want to destroy and what Americans stand to 
gain, or save, by defending it.  
<P>

As Winston Churchill suggested in our epigraph, the Boy 
Scouts teach boys "to stand up faithfully for Right and Truth, 
however the winds may blow."  That is what Americans are 
called to do now, for the Boy Scouts and for the best in our 
tradition that the Boy Scouts uphold—the right and true laws of 
nature and of nature's God, the charter of our liberty.

<H3>Editor's Note</H3>

<P>
<I>State and local governmental regulations are increasing daily throughout the country.  These regulations often challenge traditional understandings of the institution of private property.  While it is argued that these regulations will defend something identified as in the wider interest of the public, this is not always the result.  Frequently, the property rights of some private person or entity are violated.

<P>
We today tend to look at situations like this as a straightforward contest between the public and the private, between the larger good and the selfish good.  Surely when we all gain something, the interest of only one person ought not to stand in the way.

<P>
This is the common view, but it misses something. It misses the public, as well as the private, purposes for which private property is rightly considered fundamental and unalienable. These purposes resound from the Founding of our country and from the greatest documents in it. 

<P>
In our time, the right of private property is violated in blatant ways and upon a huge scale. Bureaucratic red tape hampers nearly every activity and binds nearly every enterprise.  Officials interfere, and obstacles arise, wherever people seek to use their land productively. The effect of this is to raise costs--for example, the cost of housing--to unprecedented and unaffordable levels in many parts of the country.  

<P>
This does not affect a few people; it affects millions, millions who are not now property owners and who face insuperable obstacles to becoming property owners.  Because of this, we suffer a degradation in the quality of our lives, in our ability to be self-sufficient and therefore self-reliant citizens, in our ability to provide equal opportunity to all our people.  We violate something much more important than efficiency and good economics.  We violate the highest principles of our country.  We do not provide liberty and justice for all.

<P>
In the following article, Tom West restates the ideas behind property rights as they emanate from our Founding.</I>

<P>
The debate over the meaning of the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment will continue to miss the point, until it addresses the <I>political</I> importance of the right to property.  The right to private property was central to the founding of America.  The Founders believed that it occupied a vital place in the system of free government they built.  In our time the right to property is widely misunderstood, above all by scholars who do not share the vision of justice that animated the American Constitution.

<P>
Contrary to a common belief, the right to property meant, to the Founders, something better and higher than a protection for established wealth. It was an instrument to defend common people from the power of the establishment.  It was an instrument to protect the security of their own labor and the property it generated.  And above all it was a shield for real merit, wherever it might be found, among the rich or the poor. 

<P>
For anyone familiar with the terms of the colonial debate with Britain during the 1760s and '70s, the omission of property from the Declaration's list of inalienable rights is surprising.  The dispute between Britain and America leading up to the Revolution began with property:  parliament had passed laws "imposing taxes on us without our consent," as the Declaration says.  When the Americans of the founding era listed the rights of man, the usual triad was life, liberty, and property.  Boston's <I>Rights of the Colonists</I> (1772) was typical:  Among the natural rights of the colonists are these:  First, a right to <I>life</I>; secondly to <I>liberty</I>; thirdly to <I>property</I>.1

<P>
We can only guess at Jefferson's and the Congress's silence on the right to property.  Jefferson may have thought that the dignity of the occasion was best served by omitting the low subject of money in the new nation's statement of principle, leaving it implicit in the right to liberty.

<P>
One common misconception can be dismissed easily.  Jefferson did not omit the right to property from the Declaration because he regarded it as less than a fundamental right, as some have said.2  Jefferson was a firm adherent of that right, which he regarded as a part of the right to liberty.  In 1774 he wrote:

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>Still less let it be proposed that our properties within our own territories shall be taxed or regulated by any power on earth but our own.  The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time:  the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.3</I>
</blockquote>

<P>
Jefferson held this view throughout his life. Forty-two years later he wrote:  

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.4</I>
</blockquote>

<P>
Today the subject of property rights makes people wary about the founding.  Protecting property, it might seem, amounts to protecting the right of the wealthy to domineer over the poor.  Does the Founders' view of equality end up cementing in place an invidious class structure?

<P>
On the contrary, the Founders thought the right to property, properly defined, was a <I>protection</I> to the poor.  To be sure, the right protects anyone who already has wealth.  But equally important, in their view, is the protection of the right to <I>acquire</I> property.  The right to property means that those who have no wealth as yet may keep the property they earn.  The Virginia Declaration of Rights names, among the rights of all human beings, "the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property...."

<P>
In the Founders' world, the laws of old Europe, and to some extent even American law, favored established wealth and made it difficult for the poor to become wealthy by their own effort.  Talent and ambition everywhere had to defer to family and arbitrary privilege.

<P>
Under colonial law, the property rights of the wealthy were superior to those of the poor.  "The older claimant's usage [of his land] would be elevated to the level of a property right and a more recent claimant would have to use his land so as not to interfere with the older right."5  Ownership of property "conferred on an owner the power to prevent any use of his neighbor's property that conflicted with his own quiet enjoyment."  This right of established property could be and actually was sometimes used to prevent development of land adjacent to a wealthy man's land.  

<P>
By the nineteenth century it had become clear that, "because this conception of ownership necessarily circumscribed the right of others to develop their land," it was inappropriate to American society and a violation of the rights of the poor.  The older conception of property derived from medieval times, when the law protected the English gentry from competition from upstart artisans and manufacturers.  Feudal law treated existing property relations as rightful and permanent.  The rich were supposed to stay rich, and the poor to stay poor.  Therefore "the anti-developmental doctrines of the [old] common law ...clashed with the spirit of economic improvement."  In the years following the Revolution, "the idea of property underwent a fundamental transformation--from a static agrarian conception entitling an owner to undisturbed enjoyment, to a dynamic, instrumental, and more abstract view of property that emphasized the newly paramount virtues of productive use and development."6

<P>
Under the old common law, for example, it was difficult to build a dam or mill on any public river.  A mill owner could be sued for damages if he obstructed the flow of water, even temporarily, in the operation of the mill.  That rule began to change in the early 1800s.  One judge who held in favor of a mill owner observed that the old common law maxim--"use your own property in such a way that you do not injure another's"--"must be taken and construed with an eye to the natural rights of all."7  He meant the natural right, as stated in the Virginia Bill of Rights, of "<I>acquiring</I>...property."

<P>
Eventually the Founders achieved their goal.  Established wealth that was passed on from one generation of the same family to another gradually disappeared in America.  Money and positions circulated rapidly, as the efforts and luck of each succeeding generation determined their place in society.  Children of the poor frequently rose to wealth, and children of the wealthy often fell back into the mass of those neither rich nor poor.  Irish and Italian, Jewish and Oriental immigrants, who arrived without money or status, and who were often disliked by Americans already living here, produced children and grandchildren whose wealth now surpasses the average wealth of Anglo-Saxon protestants.  Unlike old Europe, the American rich and poor did not develop "class consciousness."  Historically, the poor and middle class have not looked on the rich with destructive envy, but with the confidence that one day they themselves or their children may also be wealthy.

<P>
The trend of twentieth-century law has been toward a return to the feudal approach.  Those who are already well off often support government regulation that makes it difficult for the poor to develop their properties.  Environmental regulation, for example, is often used by existing homeowners to establish barriers to the building of new houses, in order to limit the traffic and pollution that come from new residents.  Government licensing requirements protect those who already own taxicabs from competition from those who would like to drive cabs but cannot afford the medallions.  Zoning laws typically forbid the poor (who cannot afford to buy buildings in commercial areas) from using their apartments and homes for productive purposes.  Big business often opposed President Reagan's deregulation efforts in the 1980s because regulation hobbles would-be competitors.  The latter cannot afford the expensive lawyers and lobbyists that enable long-established businesses to shape regulation to their interests or otherwise survive in the regulatory environment.8

<P>
The danger in such developments is not primarily that the poor remain poor.  Poverty is a condition that people can live with.  A decent and happy existence does not require great wealth.  The greater danger by far is the threat to liberty itself.  Tocqueville anticipated this danger: 

<blockquote>
<P>
<I>[The despotic government of the future] covers the whole of social life with a network of petty, complicated rules that are both minute and uniform....  It does not break men's will, but softens, bends, and guides it; it seldom enjoins, but often inhibits action; it does not destroy anything, but prevents much being born; it is not at all tyrannical, but it hinders, restrains, enervates, stifles, and stultifies so much that in the end each nation is no more than a flock of timid and hard-working animals with the government as its shepherd.9</I></blockquote>

<P>
The protection of the right to acquire property was but one aspect of a larger American purpose:  to make honors correspond as closely as possible to real natural differences among human beings.  Just as the fighter with a chin prevails, and should prevail, in boxing, so those of real merit and ability would face no legal obstacle to thriving in a country that protects the rights of individuals.  Far from lowering the standards of public life, freedom allows true merit to shine.  In the old world, merit too often remained sunk in the obscurity of the low origin of its possessor.<BR><BR><BR>

<H2>The Politics of Dependence</H2>

<P>
To understand the Founders' view of property rights and the rights of mankind generally, consider in contrast a common view of today, according to which human rights are no longer based on human nature.  Franklin Roosevelt called for a "Second Bill of Rights," which included "the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation," "the right of every family to a decent home," "the right to adequate medical care," "the right to a good education," etc.10  For Roosevelt, this call may have been somewhat rhetorical.  His legislative program, at any rate, made no serious attempt to implement such "rights."  More recently, however, Laurence Tribe, a leading liberal constitutional law theorist, plausibly suggests that current legal developments point toward "a constitutional right to a decent level of affirmative governmental protection in...health and housing, work and schooling."11

<P>
Jennifer Nedelsky, a recent scholar who is frank enough to be an explicit critic of the Founders, would replace the natural rights of Madison and the Founders with "human autonomy," which in her understanding not only accepts but fosters dependency on government.  Nedelsky argues, persuasively, that constitutional scholars have been unwilling to face the fact that the new view of rights requires the abandonment of the natural rights theory of the Founders:

<blockquote><P>
<I>The egalitarian vision [of today's liberals] is practically a reversal of this founding conception:  whether the inequality of property is the result of liberty or not, it stands in the way of liberty and justice for all.  </I></blockquote>

<P>
For only the abolition of inequality by forcible redistribution of property can achieve this vision of justice:

<blockquote><P>
<I>[D]ependence is no longer the antithesis of autonomy, but a precondition in the relationships...which provide the security, education, nurturing, and support that make the development of autonomy possible.12</I></blockquote>

<P>
What Nedelsky means is brought out in <I>Harris v. McRae</I>, a Supreme Court case dealing with the right to abortion.  In that decision the Court ruled that the government was not constitutionally obliged to pay for free abortions.  The dissenters from that decision asked, What good is such a right for a poor woman who cannot afford to pay for an abortion?  Justice Brennan wrote:

<blockquote><P>
<I>The Hyde Amendment's denial of public funds for medically necessary abortions plainly intrudes upon this constitutionally protected decision, for both by design and in effect it serves to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children that they would otherwise elect not to have.</I></blockquote>

<P>
Thurgood Marshall's dissent agreed:

<blockquote><P>
<I>If...a funded abortion is unavailable, [poor women] must resort to back-alley butchers, attempt to induce an abortion themselves by crude and dangerous methods, or suffer the serious medical consequences of attempting to carry the fetus to term....  [L]egal abortion is not a significant option for such women.13</I></blockquote>

<P>
In other words, if government fails to fund a right, one cannot be said to have the right.  Extending the argument beyond abortion, it might be asked:  how can one be said to have a right to life if one is too poor to afford a doctor?  What good is a right to pursue happiness without government-funded education from kindergarten to post-graduate work?  How can one pursue happiness if one prefers not to work and ends up poor?  This way of thinking about rights culminates, as Nedelsky openly admits, in the demand for a redistribution of wealth so that all possess sufficient property to secure their "autonomy."  In this view, the only way human rights can be secured is by socialism, or at least by the constant seizure of wealth from those who produce it.  Had the Brennan-Marshall view prevailed on the Court, it would have become unconstitutional in principle to cut back on any aspect of the welfare state.  In fact, it would have given the Supreme Court the constitutional authority to mandate indefinite expansion of government programs redistributing the entire wealth of the nation.

<P>
The Supreme Court majority in the Harris decision, says Nedelsky, understood that if there are basic rights that can be enjoyed only with state economic support, we have prepared the way for unlimited incursions on property.14 If every person has a right to plenty, whether he works or not, then necessarily those who work must support those who do not. 

<P>
Nedelsky regrets that the Court failed to repudiate what she calls the "negative liberty" of the Founders.  The Court actually came within one vote of doing so in this case.

<P>
In the new conception of rights, liberty requires much more--and much less--than protection against being injured by others. It requires affirmative action, positive aid from those who have wealth to those who do not.  At the extreme, one scholar claims a global human right to subsistence and basic material needs, which wealthy nations ought to pay for.15  John Rawls has given a sophisticated argument in support of the position that those in need have a moral right to some of the possessions of those who are well off.16  

<P>
On the basis of Rawlsian ideology, today's courts routinely force businesses and governments to pay injured individuals even when they are not responsible for the injury.  In one typical example, a small business was held legally liable for the injury suffered by a car thief, when he smashed up the car he had stolen in an accident that admittedly resulted from his own negligence.  These developments in the law have arisen from the courts' rejection of the individual moral responsibility on which the older understanding of rights rests.17

<P>
In this new view, rights are no longer derived from human nature.  Instead, a new ideal of human autonomy, in which man is liberated from the restraints and guidance of nature, holds sway.  This human autonomy, far from being something that human beings possess by nature, can only be secured on the basis of the conquest of nature by human will.  Rights do not come from man's natural gifts.  They come from an assessment of the current state of society, with a view to maximizing each person's liberation from natural limits.  Rights come from an ideal of human autonomy created by the human will.  The realization of that ideal requires that those who have intelligence, ambition, sobriety, wealth, education, etc., be compelled to support those who do not have the same talents or fortunes.  Rights derive not from what one has in common with other human beings (the same human nature), but from what makes oneself inferior to others--"victimization."

<P>
The rights of human nature, as the Founders saw it, are based on what man is and has by nature--his life, his liberty, and his ability to acquire property and pursue happiness.  For the Founders, a "right to decent housing"--let alone a "right to recreation"--would be nearly unintelligible.  A natural right, to repeat, is a just claim against someone who would deprive a person of <I>what is naturally his own</I>.  No one possesses by nature food, learning, and free access to medical care.  No one possesses by nature the kind of autonomy demanded by Nedelsky.  The lack of such things does not create a rightful claim against others to provide them with food, medicine, free education, or "autonomy."  It does nothing more than leave each person free to provide such needs for himself.  But one <I>is</I> obliged by nature to leave other people alone in their reasonable pursuit of health, education, and property.

<P>
The presumption of the Founders is that normal human beings are capable of taking care of themselves, if only the artificial weight of hereditary privilege and legal restrictions--the legacy of medieval times--is removed.  "The political philosophy behind limited government affirms that nature is more important than nurture:  that humans have a fixed nature enabling them to overcome a background of poverty and deprivation."18

<P>
Just as people have the <I>nature</I> to provide for their own well-being, so they also face the <I>necessity</I> of making <I>themselves</I> good. The Declaration says we have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  It does not say we have a right to happiness.  Unlike life and liberty, happiness is not something we possess by nature.  We cannot claim it as a right whenever we are miserable.  Likewise, there is a right to acquire and possess property, but no right to be wealthy.  Everyone has the capacity to <I>acquire</I> wealth and <I>pursue</I> happiness, just as everyone has the capacity to live, be free, and worship God.  To possess a right, even to exercise it, does not guarantee that it will lead to the end desired.  Happiness is earned by talent and effort, or enjoyed unbought through grace or good fortune.

<P>
All human beings by nature do possess life, liberty, the ability to pursue happiness, the ability to acquire property, and a mind that forms opinions by reason and conviction.  These natural possessions, the "property" we all own by nature, are the principal rights of man.  Madison, writing several years later about property, said:

<blockquote><P>
<I>In its larger and juster meaning, it [property] embraces everything to which a man may attach a value and have a right; and which leaves to everyone else the like advantage....

<P>
In the latter sense, a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them. 

<P>
He has a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them. 

<P>
He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them. 

<P>
In a word, as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.19</I></blockquote><BR><BR>

<H2>A Return to True Human Rights</H2>

<P>
We conclude that contemporary legal and intellectual trends
<OL>
<LI>Restrict the right to property in such a way as to prevent the poor from developing their property so as to acquire more property; and 
<LI>Treat the poor as unable to acquire wealth by their own efforts, as victims.</OL>

<P>
These two trends reinforce each other.  When we place obstacles in front of the ambitious poor, the claim that the poor are a permanent underclass becomes more plausible.  When we teach young poor people that the cause of their poverty is victimization, not absence of responsibility and work or laws that limit acquisition by the poor, we discourage the effort that it would take to overcome that poverty.

<P>
The changes we have discussed here have real consequences.  The lives of a generation of children have been blighted, and a new generation is growing up in some places in America without even the memory of the older vision of a society based on real equality of opportunity.  Consider this bitter letter responding to a newspaper article on crime committed against children in Detroit:

<blockquote><P>
<I>Detroit's children who are being victimized by crime (page one, Dec. 12) suffer from a lack of moral courage in their parents and leaders. These children are taught that their economic situations are imposed on them from the outside.  If they do not succeed in school, something is wrong with the system.  If they have difficulty getting employment, racism is involved.  If there are no jobs available at the minimum wage, dealing drugs is an acceptable alternative.  Furthermore, they are taught that if there are any solutions to their problems, they will come from city, state, or federal programs.

<P>
The tragedy in Detroit is not just that so many children are being killed and maimed by guns.  The tragedy is that these children are not being allowed to grow up into responsible adults.  Most of them will indeed grow up physically, but they will forever be looking to others as their caretakers.  They will continue to behave as if they have no personal responsibility for the choices they make in their lives, and the cycle of violence and urban decay will continue.

<P>
My family and I moved away from the Detroit area four months ago.  We are happy and relieved to be gone.20</I></blockquote>

<P>
There are remedies for this situation.  Laws that stand in the way of the exercise of the right to acquire property must be removed.  In some cases those laws are unconstitutional violations of the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Supreme Court can say so.  Above all we must teach ourselves once again the lessons we have forgotten. Protecting what is private, what properly is earned by each citizen with the sweat of his own labor, is not selfishness.  It is justice. And from that justice flows a capacity for self-government that makes freedom itself possible. That is the true basis of American democracy. 

<P>
The purpose of that democracy is not wealth.  It is, as the Declaration says, happiness.  We understand happiness to mean, for most practical purposes, the decent way of life lived by the majority of Americans throughout our history.  Family, work, neighborhood, responsibility, excellence--these things are rightly prized by most citizens.  It is government's job to enable citizens to achieve them, in part simply by getting out of the way. 

<P>
Every nation--even the Soviet Union at its peak--has laws that protect the right to hold property, at least for some people. The American Constitution is unique, in that it gives that right to <I>everyone equally</I>.  Above all, the Constitution secures the right to develop and use one's property in order to acquire wealth, without having to beg permission of the established rich or of government bureaucrats.  The new system in America, with its excessive and burdensome regulations, harks back to older and darker days. It locks in place an aristocracy of existing wealth. It builds the natural counterpart of the privileged few--the despairing underclass.

<TITLE>Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership</TITLE>
</head>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<center><table border=0 width=85%><tr><td>

<center>

   <H1>About Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership</H1>

</center>

This is to introduce readers to Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, a new project of 
the Claremont Institute.  The project is headed by Dr. Tim Wheeler, a practicing 
physician (a head and neck specialist) in southern California.  The following will 
explain who we are, why we have launched this project, and what we aim to 
accomplish.  

<H3>The Problem</H3>

The right of Americans "to keep and bear arms" guaranteed in the Second Amendment 
is under attack—now more so than ever before in our nation's history.  In any given 
year, one can expect dozens of bills to be presented in Congress, and hundreds more in 
state capitols around the nation.  All have one thing in common: further restrictions—in 
some cases proposing an outright ban—on the private ownership of firearms.

<P>

One of the most persuasive tactics employed by the gun controllers is the argument that 
guns present a threat to public health.  Accordingly, firearms are increasingly discussed 
by some in the medical community in terms of epidemiology.  Medical journals now 
routinely discuss firearms as if they were a type of dangerous bacteria.

<P>

Because these arguments originate with physicians and appear in respected journals, the 
media pass along their claims as undisputed facts.  They have become as well a central 
part of the strategies used by the ACLU and other anti-Second Amendment activists.  
But these arguments are contrary to the truth:  The idea that firearms are a disease to be 
discussed in pathogenic terms defies common sense.  The truth is that privately-owned 
firearms prevent more crimes and injuries than they cause, and are far more likely to 
serve the public interest than not.  

<H3>The Solution</H3>

Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership—a group of physicians, familiar with the use 
of medical statistics and quantitative analysis—has been formed to serve as an antidote 
to those who are twisting science to serve misguided ideological ends.  It will turn the 
tables on those who would control crime by managing the lives of honest citizens, 
directing attention instead to the means of crime control that is suited to a free people:  
that is to say, controlling crime by controlling (i.e. incarcerating) criminals.  

<P>

DRGO in now mounting a full-fledged assault on the poor medical scholarship—and 
the anti-gun bias behind it—that dominates the medical debate on gun ownership.  We 
have already made some headway in this project, most notably in well publicized 
testimony before Senator Howard Metzenbaum and the Senate Judiciary Committee last 
year (enclosed).  We are proceeding with policy briefings, amicus curiae briefs, and

<Title>Clean Movies: Cleaned Up at the Box Office in 1995</Title>

<center><H2>Clean Movies: Cleaned Up at the <br>Box Office in 1995</H2>
<H3>Some see ‘sleaze doesn't sell' trend</H3>
by Joyce Price, <i>The Washington Times</i></center>
<p>
Seven of the 10 top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, PG or PG-13, indicating they were family oriented.
<p>
"For half [or more] of the films [that grossed the most sales] to qualify 
for more general audiences is pretty encouraging, said James Wall, editor 
of the Christian Century, a historic mainline Protestant journal.
<p>
"The box-office results are a good indication that audiences are looking 
for more peaceful experiences in the theater and that they respond to 
worthwhile films," added Mr. Wall, who has testified on movie content at 
congressional hearings.
<p>
Only three films near the bottom of the top 10 were rated R, meaning 
children under 17 had to be accompanied by an adult to see those 
pictures.
<p>
No films with the NC-17 rating, meaning children under 17 are not 
admitted, were among the top 10 this year, according to Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc., a California entertainment research organization that 
tracks such information.
<p>
"This shows that, for now at least, sleaze doesn't sell and that, over time, 
the movie industry “is moving toward general audiences,” said Doug 
Besharov, a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
<p>
Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and co-host of 
"Sneak Previews," which airs on 244 Public Broadcasting Service 
stations nationwide, put it this way: "Sixty percent of all movies that are 
released are Rated, yet only 30 percent of films in the top 10 and zero 
percent in the top six are R-rated . . . Samuel Goldwyn once said it's 
better to sell four tickets than two. That's common sense that the movie 
industry" is just now beginning to recognize.
<p>
Mr. Medved said the latest top 10 offers more evidence that a “PG-13 is 
an easier rating to sell tickets on than R."
<p>
PG-13 means special guidance is cautioned because material may be 
inappropriate for ages 13 and under; PG means parental guidance is 
suggested; and G, for general audience, means all ages are admitted.
<p>
Jack J. Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, 
argues that movie grosses in 1995 rose or fell on the basis of a film's 
"entertainment value,” not its rating and whether it was or was not a 
family film.
<p>
He said there was no shortage of family films produced this year, but 
there was a "shortage of family audiences." He noted there were "10 to 12 
family films released this year that failed miserably at the box office."
<p>
One of those, he said, was "The Little Princess," which he described as a 
"wonderful, tremendous film" that few went to see. "The Little Princess" 
is about a young girl whose father, a distinguished British gentleman, 
goes off to battle in World War I. The child is enrolled in a private girls' 
academy in New York, where she suffers mistreatment by an abusive 
headmistress.
<P>
"The kind of films people claim they want in the marketplace, they don't 
patronize . . . this constant reference to wanting family films is 
hypocrisy," Mr. Valenti said in an interview.
<P>
The NC-17-rated film "Showgirls" was a box-office flop not because of 
its nudity and sex, Mr. Valenti said, but because it was a "mediocre film 
to begin with" and "the word got out it wasn't a very good movie." 
"Showgirls" depicted the struggles of an ex-prostitute who becomes a Las 
Vegas lap dancer and aspires to be a highly paid stripper.
<P>
Not everyone concerned about the content and quality of movie fare sees 
cause to celebrate this year's list of the biggest grossers.
<P>
Said Ted Baehr, chairman of the Atlanta-based Christian Film and 
Television Commission; which each year makes a thorough analysis of 
hundreds of films in a “report to Hollywood":
<P>
"Last year, 60 percent of the top 10 grossing films met our moral criteria. 
This year, it will be 40 percent with the list as it now exists. In other 
words, we've slipped . . . it's been a lousy year for movies."
<P>
Movies in last year's top 10 included “The Lion King,” rated G, and 
"Forrest Gump," rated PG-13, which both have grossed more than $310 
million. “Batman Forever,” this year's biggest box office smash, has 
grossed $184 million to date.
<P>
Mr. Baehr said “Hollywood was clearly aiming at children" when it 
produced films such as "Batman Forever," "Ace Ventura: When Nature 
Calls" (No. 5) and "Casper" (No. 6). But he does not view those pictures 
as true family entertainment and describes "Ace,” "Casper,” and 
"Waterworld" (No. 9) as "irresponsible."
<P>
Of Jim Carrey's latest "Ace Ventura” detective comedy, Mr. Baehr said: 
“We do not consider it to be a moral movie. It's racist and 
promasturbation, pro-sex and probuggery."
<P>
In “Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls,” Mr. Carrey goes to Africa in 
search of a great white bat. There he encounters a tribe whose members 
spit or release other bodily fluids on people to show their appreciation.
<P>
"It's clear Hollywood knows it has to broaden" its horizons and make 
more films that will attract youngsters, he said. But many of these films 
feature "covert immorality" and take "philosophical positions most 
conservatives can’t accept."
<P>
Mr. Baehr charged that the movie industry is "cutting back on [true] 
family films."
<P>
“If they make this a trend,” they can anticipate a drop in attendance, he 
said. He added this is already being reflected in the smaller revenues that 
have been generated by this year's top 10 compared with last year's.
<P>
"People want films you can take the family to,” Mr. Baehr said.
<P>
Mr. Valenti denied there is a conspiracy afoot in the movie industry, as 
Mr. Baehr suggests. "Eighty to 85 percent of all films made in Hollywood 
are put together by independent producers, who are fiercely competitive,” 
he said.
<P>
John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., agreed. "These 
things go in cycles. Certainly, there is no premeditated plan to make a lot 
of kids pictures,” he said.
<P>
As for the films that grossed the most this year, he said, "I don't think 
you'd call 'Batman Forever' a family picture. And 'Ace Ventura' is a little 
gross. There are some questionable scenes."
<P>
Mr. Wall offered this assessment of “Batman Forever": "It's a rather dark 
film, but I don't object to it very strongly. 'Apollo 13' [No. 2] was well 
done, one of the finest inspirational films for people of all ages."
<P>
Those interviewed had little enthusiasm for the movie “Pocahantas.” Mr. 
Wall called it "adequate," while Mr. Baehr labeled it “New Age" and 
"annoying."
<P>
Mr. Medved said he "didn't like the film's political correctness."

<blockquote>
<P>
(Washington D.C., October 30, 1996) -- Empower America's Chief Economist, Lawrence A. 
Hunter released the following statement on the state of the American economy in response to 
today's report on third-quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP):
<P>
"Is the economy better off today than it was four years ago?  Clearly not.  Today, the Commerce 
Department reported that the economy was growing at a paltry 2.2 percent annual rate in the 
third quarter after correcting for inflation.  Four years ago at this time, the economy was growing 
at a respectable 3 percent.  And, in the fourth quarter of 1992, real, inflation-adjusted economic 
growth leapt forward at 4.3 percent.  One must look long and hard for any economist who 
expects the economy to grow faster than 2.5 percent in the upcoming fourth quarter.
<P>
"This pessimistic assessment of the economy is reinforced by a report on declining wages issued 
earlier this week by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC).  The JEC report, which 
is based on a release of data by the nonpartisan Bureau of Labor Statistic (BLS), points out that 
inflation-adjusted ("real") median weekly earnings declined between the third quarters of 1995 
and 1996.  The current level of real median weekly earnings is below their level four years ago of 
$493 in the third quarter of 1992.
<P>
"Best economy in 30 years?  Hardly.  The truth is, we are experiencing the slowest economic 
expansion in more than 100 years."
<P>

<center><h2>Empower America's Chief Economist Warns,</h2>
<h3>Todays' GDP Numbers are a "Statistical Blip"</h3></center><p>
(Washington D.C., August 1, 1996) -- We shouldn't pop the corks on the champagne quite yet over today's reported 4.2 percent second quarter increase in GDP.  The fizz will quickly go out of these numbers as American workers realize that they do not mean an end to the treadmill economy we have been experiencing since the end of the 1980's<p>
<i>Empower America's</i> Chief Economist Lawrence Hunter said, "The American people, to whom GDP statistics are a mere abstraction, will take little solace in this report because this statistical blip in the GDP numbers is not translating into rising real wages.  During the same time period covered by this GDP report, second quarter 1996, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that usual weekly earnings of workers are at their lowest level in three years."<p>
Even before today's report was made public, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, made it clear that the expected strong second quarter report was an aberration, both by his words and by the Fed's deeds.  Greenspan said he fully expected economic growth to fall back to its more typical anemic norm of  two-something expansion in the second half of the year.  Confirmation that the Fed does not take the second quarter blip seriously comes from the fact that it has refrained from raising interest rates as one would expect if the central bank were taking this aberrant report as indicative that the economy was anywhere near this strong.<p>
"Today's report also is consistent with the expectation that this preliminary 4.2 percent increase may well be revised downward in the months to come.  First quarter GDP, which originally was reported to have increased 2.8 percent, was revised downward by almost one third in today's report, to 2.0 percent," Hunter said.<p>

<center><h2>BENNETT CRITICIZES McCURRY<br> 
AND WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY </center></h2>

<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p><i>July 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.</i><p>
  Today, Empower America co-director and former Bush "drug czar" William J. Bennett released the following statement:
<p>
"Yesterday we learned from interviews with Secret Service agents (released by a House committee) that background investigations on White House employees found that more than 40 had used drugs; a few dozen showed drug usage had been within the last five years; and that among those few dozen people were individuals who had used cocaine, crack cocaine and hallucinogens.  We learned, too, that the Secret Service initially rejected White House passes to an unspecified number of White House employees because they were considered a security risk -- a recommendation which apparently was unacceptable to the Clinton administration.  Instead, the administration opted for a far more lenient policy -- a twice-per-year surprise drug test.  These are very disturbing revelations -- but ones which do not seem to trouble the Clinton administration at all.
<p>
I have also read the transcripts of Mike McCurry's July 17th press briefing in which he stated that "of course" he used illegal drugs during the 1970s.  What exactly did Mr. McCurry mean by "of course"?  That every young person used drugs in the 1970s?  Or that it was no big deal?  Why didn't Mr. McCurry show any regret for having used illegal drugs?  Mr. McCurry is wrong on all counts -- and he should admit that he was wrong.        
<p>
These revelations by Secret Service agents, combined with Mr. McCurry's comments are, I think, emblematic of the Clinton administration's cavalier and indifferent attitude toward illegal drug use.  The Clinton administration doesn't seem to care about this issue.  They seem unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  And this nation is now paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's indifference, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.      
<p>
Mr. McCurry's comments are of course not helpful.  But neither are they surprising.  After all, President Clinton's record on fighting illegal drug use is abysmal.  It is worth pointing out that this is not a partisan opinion.  Democratic Senator Joe Biden has been a strong critic of the administration's anti-drug efforts.  And it was Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel who said this about the Clinton administration:  "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."
<p>
Consider the record under Bill Clinton's watch: drug use among high school seniors has risen steadily since he took office.  The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana has almost doubled.  Methamphetamine emergency room cases are up over 300 percent.  LSD use has reached the highest rate since record-keeping started in 1975.  Drug-related emergency room admissions are at record levels.  And these trends have occurred after real progress was made against drug use in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.    
<p>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.  The Clinton administration suffers from moral diffidence on this issue.  Policy follows attitude.  In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but he said, "I didn't like it.  I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."  
<p>
Then there is President Clinton's former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who had been one of this administration's most vocal voices on drugs and who had favorable words about drug legalization.  And of course now we have Mr. McCurry's comments. 
<p>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale" or an attitude of "of course I used illegal drugs."
<p>
I realize that Mr. McCurry, a skilled press secretary, was simply reflecting the attitude of the President and his administration.  But I would be interested in the answer to two questions:  first, what does General Barry McCaffrey think about Mr. McCurry's comments and the underlying attitude they expressed?  And second, does President Clinton have any objection if a person who has used cocaine, crack cocaine or hallucinogenic drugs during the past five years is working in his administration?  Is there any kind of recent (pre-White House) drug use or drug activity that would disqualify somebody from joining the Clinton administration?  Perhaps the president could clarify what his policy is on these matters.       

<p>
On the issue of fighting illegal drugs -- like so many other issues of national importance -- the American people deserve better from their president."

NEW LEADERSHIP </h3></center>

<P><hr size=3 width=50%>
<P>





<i>May 6, 1996, Washington, D.C. </i>
<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors, Empower America Co-Directors William J. Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber today officially announced the appointment of Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer.  Weisel has served as acting Chairman since the Fall of 1995. 
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman, and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, one of the nation's leading securities firms.  Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery's annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million.  Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and served in the past as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. Ski Team.
<p>
Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream."  Kemp went on, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works.  He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success.  His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
William Bennett said, "Thom Weisel is wonderfully accomplished in a whole range of pursuits.  His tenure with us has brought needed stability and energy to Empower America."  
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice.  Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited Making Government Work: A Conservative Agenda for the States, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977.  In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.  
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick, and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo -- an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense, and time-honored values.  He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics.  We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Former Empower America Board Chairman Steve Forbes will remain an active member of the Board.  Forbes said of Empower America's new leadership, "I am glad to see Empower America in the capable hands of Thom Weisel and Tex Lezar.  I look forward to working closely with both of them as an Empower America Board member."  William Dal Col, Empower America's former president, will be working with Forbes while continuing informally to advise Empower America. 
<p>
Under the leadership of Weisel and Lezar, as well as the Co-Directors, Empower America plans a very aggressive, focused policy agenda for the remainder of 1996.  
<p>
<UL>
<LI>On the economic front, Empower America will expand its efforts to promote a dynamic, pro-growth, pro-family, single-rate tax system based on the recommendations of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which Jack Kemp chaired for Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich.  Additionally, Empower America will promote a plan gradually and responsibly to privatize our Social Security system, while honoring our obligation to those who have paid into the system and must be protected. <p>
<LI>Empower America is strongly supporting an urban renaissance agenda focusing on legislation proposed by members of Congress such as Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Abraham of Michigan, Senator Mack of Florida, Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington D.C.<p>
<LI>Empower America will continue to make the broader argument for the need to restore decency and civility to American life.  It will continue its ongoing campaign in the area of popular culture, including the content of television and music.  It will also continue to address the issues of crime, drugs, educational choice, and adoption.  In addition, Empower America will begin systematically to address issues dealing with judicial activism and legal reform.
<p>
<LI>In international affairs, Empower America will continue its advocacy of an American foreign policy based on U.S. national interests and which reflects the need for the U.S. to exercise effective and prudent international leadership.  The support for the expansion and consolidation of new democracies, the restoration of an honest and sound money policy for America and the world, and furtherance of free- and open- global trade arrangements are of principal concern.  Empower America supports a strong national security posture and the development and deployment of a national missile defense system.

<center><h3>EMPOWER AMERICA'S WILLIAM BENNETT AND JACK KEMP
&quot;CORRECT THE RECORD&quot; WITH NEW STUDY ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION</h3></center>

<center><h4><i>Kemp and Bennett call assertions made in the GOP Presidential 
primarie regarding the impact of legal immigration &quot;naive, 
short-sighted, and now -- factually incorrect.&quot;</i></center></h4>
<P><hr size=3 width=50%>
<P>

(Washington, DC; February 28, 1996)  Empower America co-directors William J. 
Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study today which refutes many recent 
assertions against legal immigration policy in America.  The study comes as 
immigration is becoming an increasingly contentious issue in the race for the 
GOP presidential nomination.  Bennett and Kemp said, &quot;Certainly we must put 
an end to illegal immigration.  But that message cannot be mixed up with our 
view toward legal immigration, which has been, and continues to be, a net gain 
<tt></tt>for America.&quot;<p>

Through research conducted over a period of many months, visits to high 
technology companies, background interviews with government officials, and 
never before presented data, researcher Stuart Anderson has found, &quot;The entry of 
foreign-born engineers, scientists, and other highly skilled individuals provides 
extraordinary benefits to the United States and should be facilitated, rather than 
indered, by new restrictions.&quot;<p>

The Senate Judiciary Committee is considering legislation by Senator Alan 
Simpson (R-WY) to sharply restrict American companies' ability to hire foreign-
born skilled employees.  Moreover, in March, the U.S. House of Representatives 
will vote on the largest reduction in legal immigration in nearly 70 years.  Said 
Bennett and Kemp, &quot;The study gives evidence that both measures are ill-
conceived and ultimately counterproductive.&quot;<p>


Among the study's key findings:
<ul>
<li>	There is no evidence that foreign-born scientists and engineers increase 
unemployment or undercut the wages of the native-born.<p>

<li>	There is no evidence that employment-based immigration weakens 
companies' commitment to U.S. education or to training for their workforce.  
American companies annually donate $2.5 billion to schools and colleges, and 
spend $210 billion annually on workforce training.<p>

<li>	Key employees and even founders of high tech companies enter the country 
as refugees and family-sponsored immigrants, as well as employment-based 
immigrants.<p>

<li> 	The study concludes, &quot;New restrictions on employment-based visas -- and 
immigration more generally -- will drive more companies to locate research 
and development offshore ... and will lead to less innovation, a less dynamic 
economy, and fewer jobs produced in the cutting edge industries of 
tomorrow.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Jack Kemp said, &quot;We have got to understand that we are getting some of the best 
and brightest minds from all over the world to invest their talents in America's 
economy.  We are becoming more competitive and more prosperous and, as the 
study shows, we aren't displacing or devaluing American workers in the 
process.&quot<p>  

William Bennett added, &quot;We have seen too much anti-immigration rhetoric in 
our public discourse and in our Republican-led Congress -- and unfortunately, it 
has become a centerpiece of Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign.  It's time to 
remind Americans -- and the Republican Party especially -- that legal 
immigration helps, not hurts, America.  While there is no question that American 
society has experienced serious moral decay over the last thirty years, pinning 
the blame on immigrants for our problems is a dodge and distraction.  And it 
happens to be entirely wrong.  One can make a strong argument that many new 
immigrants have been corrupted by those degraded aspects of our culture, not 
causes of it.&quot;<p>

</h3><P>October 27, 1995</center><P>Contact: Christian Pinkston, (202) 452-8200, x223<P><hr size=3 width=50%><P>Washington D.C.--Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> today congratulated House and Senate Republicans on their historic achievement in passing budget plans that will reduce the burden of government in the lives of the nation's citizens and improve incentives for savings, investment and families.  Kemp urged congressional leaders to move quickly on a House-Senate package that strengthens these incentives and called on them to seek an accord with the Clinton administration.  Such an agreement, he emphasized, can be accomplished without compromising the integrity of the plan's objectives.
 <p>
"Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and the entire Republican congressional leadership deserve great credit for their masterful job in bringing off this achievement," Kemp said.  "But none of this will matter unless Congress and the White House can find a way to resolve their differences.  This legislation is too important to the nation to be sacrificed in a fit of partisan acrimony and bickering.
                                                                                             <P>
"I would hope that Republicans in Congress and the Democratic Administration recognize that both have a lot at stake in reaching a successful conclusion.  Each should carefully evaluate options that are available.  For example, if the final package has the right mix of incentives, including a substantial capital gains tax cut with inflation indexing, there is no reason the American economy should not experience substantially higher growth with lower inflation.  In that case, the Administration's economic assumptions, though more optimistic than those of Congress, are within the range of consensus forecasts and would be entirely plausible.  The higher growth projections would mean substantially increased revenue estimates, easing the path to budget balance.
<P>
"At the same time, I would urge my former colleagues to tread very carefully before reducing the inflation adjustment for federal benefits and income tax liability.  Several economists have testified to Congress suggesting that the consumer price index overstates inflation.  However, others contend that the CPI has substantially under reported inflation over the past two decades.  It would be unconscionable to require sacrifice from the nation's retirees and taxpayers on the basis of a theoretical economic argument that has yet to be resolved.
<P>
"I would also add that, in my opinion, it is imperative that Congress go all the way toward fundamental change by following up this legislation with approval of the Abraham-Lieberman enterprise zone act. While I applaud the reconciliation bill for cutting taxes for working families and businesses, I believe there is one essential ingredient missing:  a provision to create jobs and opportunity for people who live in America's economically-distressed urban and rural communities.  The Abraham-Lieberman "Enhanced Enterprise Zones Act of 1995" would accomplish this goal by providing tax incentives to work, save, and invest in the over 100 urban and rural pockets of poverty across this Nation.  This legislation is the type of affirmative "effort" for which our party has been known for throughout history--from Lincoln to Reagan.  Furthermore, Republican-led efforts to combat the plight of poverty and unemployment in our inner-cities would begin the needed process of racial and ethnic reconciliation and give hope and opportunity to all people."    <P>

WASHINGTON, DC -- With a warning that trashy daytime talk-shows on television are debasing our aulture and harming America's children, <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joe Lieberman today launched a campaign to rid the airwaves of <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">sordid programs</a>.  Bennett, co-director of Empower America, and Lieberman, Democrat from Connecticut, say they will work together and with other concerned citizens to put pressure on those who produce and own daytime television talk shows to get rid of the licentious material that characterizes many of such programs today. To illustrate their point about the condition of daytime television talk shows, Bennett and Lieberman aired a series of clips culled only from shows that aired Monday and Tuesday of this week.
<P>Bennett and Lieberman are not calling for legislation or any govemment censorship of daytime television talk shows. They are calling on the producers and owners of the programs to recognize their responsibility to Amencan society and children by setting higher standards for the programs' content. They are also calling on parents to exercise their respons bllity to simply turn the programs off. Bennett and Lieberman said that hundreds of thousands of young children, and up to a million or more teenagers watch daytime television talk shows on a daily basis.
<P><a href="pr1026a.html">Bennett</a> and <a href="pr1026b.html">Lieberman</a> said the number of trashy talk shows has increased in recent
months, while the behavior exhibited on the shows has sharply declined. They argue that
exposing children, teenagers and even adults to hours of such programming on a daily basis has, over time, a deteriorating effect on the civility of American society, and becomes one                                                                   
more contributing factor to the host of serious problems facing our country today.

	<i>Announcing A Public Campaign Against
	Select Day-Time Television Talk Shows</i><P>
	October 26, 1995<P><hr width="35%"></center><P>


First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman.  Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea.  It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure -- public pressure -- on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<P>
Earlier this year, <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Senator Lieberman</a> joined <a href="/empower/pr1026d.html">C. DeLores Tucker</a> of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc.  Today, we turn our attention to television.  Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television -- the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas.  Most of the criticisms are justified.  But this is not the worst of it.  The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified.  In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.  
<P>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment.  But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<P>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics.  The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men -- well, you get the idea.    
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about.  We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee.  The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency.  They are at the bottom of the television barrel.  Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it.  So here we are.    
<P>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed -- "Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote; and to petition men and women of good will -- producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers -- to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<P>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs?  In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust.  Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality?  Do the sponsors think not?  If so, why not?  
<P>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.  What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid.  This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift.  We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.  
<P>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about.  So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine.  We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.      
<P>
Let me conclude with a personal note.  Joe Lieberman is a Jew.  I am a Catholic.  Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image.  And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves.  Finally, what we are talking about is human dignity, the dignity of God's greatest creation -- and whether or not we still believe in it.

When I joined with <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026.html">Delores Tucker</a> to speak out against the vile rap music that Time Warner was helping to produce, I was trying to give voice to the thousands of people I represent in Connecticut who are angry about the degradation of our culture and <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html"> the messages</a> the media is sending to our children.
<P>
The people I talk to in Connecticut are part of a revolution that is beginning throughout the country, <i>a movement that might be called the revolt of the revolted</I>. A growing number of Americans are sickened by the morass of sex, vulgarity and violence that increasingly dominates our electronic media; and they are disgusted by what they see as the entertainment industry's abandonment of basic standards of decency, as if anything goes. The result is <i>an increasingily debased culture that rejects, rather than retlects the basic values that most Americans share</i>.
<P>
This anger is felt most deeply by parents. I can't tell you how many mothers and fathers I've talked with who <i>look at the media not as a source of information or entertainment, but as a threat to the well-being o f their children</I>. These parents feel like they are locked in a struggle with powerful forces outside of their control to 'shape their children's values, a struggle; they feel they are losing.
<P>
Bill Bennett and I are back today to focus attention on one of the worst parts of America's entertainment culture -- the daytime television talk shows. There are more than 20 nationally syndicated talk programs on the air this fall, many of which can be seen here in the Washington area, as this chart displays. Afl er watching a number of these shows, and-learning more about the behavior of their hosts and producers, <i>it is clear that talk is indeed cheap, and too often demeaning, exploitative, perverted, divisive, or, at best, amoral</i>.
<P>
Those are strong words, but it is difficult to exaggerate the willingness of some of these shows to parade any and every pathology and dysfunction into our living rooms. The nation caught a glimpse of what these shows are about last March, when a guest on the "Jenny Jones" was set up to meet a gay secret admirer, and responded by killing that admirer with a shotgun. To show you just how extreme these programs are, in a few minutes we will display a videotape showing some typical segments.
<P>
For now I would call your attention to the article from Electroriic Media that we have made available. This diary of a 20-day period during the February sweeps documents how sex saturates these programs, the more bizarre the better. Just look at some of the titles; "I Use Sex to Get What I Want"; "Sex Caught on Tape"; "Mom's Dating a Boy Toy" and "Get Bigger Breasts or Else?'.
<P>
As you will see, there's good reason why many people call these shows pornographic: during the February sweeps, viewers were treated to at least five different shows that focused heavily on porn: among them, "Rolanda" showcased porn stars reuriniting with their first loves; "Jenny Jones" had men confronting their girlfriends who want to be porn stars; and "Richard Bey" pitted "Housewives vs. Strippers."
<P>
Why should we be so concerned about the content of these shows? One of the most compelling reasons is that millions of children and voung teens are watching trashy talk TV on a daily basis. In fact, according to one report, children aged 2 to 11 comprise six percent of the national viewing audience for talk shows, which translates to 650,000 kids alone regularly watching "Ricki Lake," one of the worst offenders.
<P>
There is no real scientific evidence available yet documenting the impact these shows have on young viewers. But a number of psychologists, child development specialists and media experts have voiced serious concern about the dangers posed by these shows. The constant confrontations and emotional violence children see on talk shows teach them a perverse way to solve personal problems, and suggests to them that is the way normal adults behave. Also, because of the powerful appeal of the sexual messages being sent to young viewers, these shows have enormous potential to act as the worst kind of sex educators.
<P>
But the impact of these programs extends far beyond children. Trashy TV talk shows are wildly distorting our perceptions of what are normal and acceptable forms of behavior, adding to the alreadv overloaded cultural dictionary that is helping. in Pat Alovnihan's words. to define desiancy down. The fixation these shows have with the dysfunctional, and the way in which those pathologies are treated, is having a "destructive" effect on the nation's mental health, according to mental health professionals Jeanne Heaton and Nona Wilson, the authors of "Tuning in Trouble." The "driveby pyschology" dispensed by so-called experts and the hosts themselves serves to mislead people into believing that serious mental health problems can be cured with platitudes and the psychobabble that is so commonplace on talk TV.
<P>
The proliferation of perversion on daytime television is affecting our entire society by the example it sets, pushing the envelope of civility and morality in a wav that drags the rest of the culture down with it. It is a vicious circle, fueled by the competition among talk show hosts to be the most sensational, and one with no apparent end in sight.
<P>
We do not want to demonize any one show, to overstate their influence, or to argue that these programs are destroying America as we know it. What we do want to get across is that taken as a whole, and combined with the obscene gangsta rap music kids are listening to, the hyperviolent videogames they're playing, as well as other television shows and movies, these talk shows are surely contributing to the loss of values, and the moral decay that so many Americans are concerned about. 
<P>
Much as we did with Time Warner's involvement with Interscope records, we are launching this campaign today to impress upon the major companies who are producing the bulk of the daytime talk show the damage trash TV talk is doing, and to call on them to exercise the greater responsibility. These corporations [include] a number of communications titans, including Gannett Newspapers, Paramount, Fox, Time Warner, CBS, Columbia-TriStar Studios, and the Tribune Company.
<P>
As we have said many times before, <i>we are not calling for censorship, simply better citizenship</I>. We want to remind these producers that they are members of a larger community, to which they have certain obligations. We also want to remind them- that because of their stature and their power their decisions carry weight. They can and should do-better, and that is our appeal.
<P>                                                                                 <P>

<h2>Press Conference Statement by C DeLores Tucker<br>
Chair, National Political Congress of Black Women, Inc.</h2><P>
<i>October 26, 1995</i><P>
<br width=50% size=3></center><P>

I regret that a long standing engagement prevents me from joining <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Joe Lieberman</a> this morning at this timely and necessary press conference. However, I am proud to join with them in focusing on other segments of the entertainment industry that is constantly poisoning the cultural environment of our society. <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">Mindless television</a> shows that target young audiences are corrupting our culture and doing great harm to our children. I believe that it is time to confront the performers and companies that produce these shows. In our campaign against Time-Warner's involvement in the production and distribution of Gangsta Rap music to children we did not get results until Bill Bennett and I confronted the executives of Time-Warner. It is time now to confront those responsible for these culturally corrupt television shows.
          <P>
If we are to restore a measure of decency to the cultural mainstream of our society we must expand our efforts to the area of television. Those who produce and air these degrading and denigrating shows need to be made aware of what they are doing to the youth of America.
<P>
I look forward to working with Sen. Lieberman and Dr. Bennett and in this on-going public campaign.

<Center><i>Bennett and Lieberman petition producers to dispense with the grotesque and perverse subject
matter of some day-time television talk shows.</i></center>
<P>
(Washington D.C.; October 25, 1995) On the heels of their successful campaign against violently obscene music lyrics, Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) will hold a Washington <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">press conference</a> at 10:00am tomorrow to launch a new phase in their campaign against the cultural decomposition to which the entertainment industry is contributing. Specifically, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman will target certain day-time television talk shows which repeatedly focus on sordid subject matter, petitioning producers to acknowledge their responsibilities toward their viewers, both children and the general public, rather than just the profits they may stand to gain from them. Once again, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman are not calling for content censorship but corporate citizenship.
<P>
Daytime television talk show producers will meet this weekend in New York City for the "Talk Summit" to discuss program content.

<B><FONT SIZE = 4>SOLDIER OF THE SOUL <BA></FONT></B>
<P></center>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2><blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Kemp’s remarks were delivered on November 19, 1996 at the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe's Annual Dinner in New York, where he received an award named in memory of the distinguished humanitarian, Mr. Raoul Wallenberg.  Mr. Kemp was introduced by Rabbi Simcha Lyons.<BA></blockquote></blockquote></center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
Thank you very much for this award in the name of Raoul Wallenberg, a great hero of mine.  In September of 1981 I had the honor of working with Congressman Tom Lantos to pass legislation granting honorary U.S. citizenship to this courageous "soldier of the soul."  And thank you to the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe, for whose work in the causes of education and human rights -- and in so many other endeavors to promote liberty throughout the world --  I hold a profound regard.
<P>
In 1899, Emile Zola, in his famous outcry against the anti-semitism manifest in the French Army's conspiracy to convict Captain Dreyfus of treason, spoke to the inevitable triumph of truth over prejudice when he said, "truth is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."  At the time, the French people were polarized over the controversy which presented them with a moral choice between the life of one man and the reputation of the French Army.  
<P>
As America approaches the turn of the next century, we face many similar controversies -- controversies which challenge us to make a moral choice between political expediency and the inalienable right to liberty.  Fortified by the memory of our great heritage and what is occurring at breakneck speed in the world, we can now proclaim, with equal conviction: "Democracy is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."   But the task of preserving and advancing this democratic evolution will take truth-tellers, seekers of justice, men and women of honor and courage willing to act on their convictions.  
v
It will take men and women such as Raoul Wallenberg and people like you who form this great Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe.
<P>
 Historically, every form of government or societal structure that refused to recognize the basic human right of freedom has failed.  Whether it be the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt, the persecution of the Christians in Rome, the oppression of the peasant class by the aristocracy in pre-revolutionary France, the lack of just representation for the American colonies by the British monarchy, the evil of slavery in pre-Civil War America, the abuse of labor in industrial England, the comprehensive manipulation and subjugation of people by the socialist systems of Eastern and Central Europe and in Asia, or the monstrous evil of apartheid in South Africa -- tyranny infallibly authors its own epitaph.   The oppressed are driven to the point of revolt.  The system collapses internally, unable to supply the hope, motivation and freedom that promotes the general welfare of a people and a nation and which responds to the Jewish and Christian ideal of freedom as an inalienable, God-given right of all people everywhere and always.
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had the historical honor of being a victim of both Nazi and Communist tyranny.  I say an honor because this persecution is the mark of a  Godly man, of a liberal man in the classical sense.  For there is only one truth, but many lies; one charity, but many forms of envy and selfishness.  To stand up for what is good, right and true often, attracts enemies from very different directions.
<P>
The world is in a similar situation today, with democracy and freedom being attacked from different angles.
<P>
Democracy is on the march, and on the surface, appears to have unstoppable momentum.  Just yesterday, Romania celebrated the triumphal election of anti-Communist Emil Constantinescu as President -- a fact which, in Constantinescu's own words, signifies that "Romania comes back now to the great concert of a democratic Europe."  In the Freedom House survey, more than half the people of the world live in countries that are democratic or somewhat democratic.  In economic terms, the worldwide trend toward democracy is even stronger.  More than 93 percent of the world's trade  comes from democratic and partly democratic countries.  (Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1989 and 1996.)  As a matter of economic and industrial output, communism and dictatorship barely exist, and where their production is rising -- Vietnam, China -- it is only because regimes are falling all over themselves to "open up to the outside" and establish economic and trade liberalization.
v
But there are threats to political and economic freedom, to democracy, from without and within.  They are not as violent, purposive, or determined as the enemies Raoul Wallenberg fought, and we may thank God for it.  But they are serious and important, and if they are more corrosive than aggressive in nature, they may nevertheless poison our civilization if left unchecked.
<P>
One is the threat foreseen by Alexis de Tocqueville more than 150 years ago.  Tocqueville called this the velvet tyranny of mindless, numbing bureaucracy.  It would not outlaw religion, but it would sap the human spirit, and set up a new pseudo-religion, the worship of the state, in place of churches and synagogues.  It would not brazenly abolish private property, but it would smother property -- and, what is equally important, human initiative -- in a well-meaning but deadly array of taxes, regulations, and stipulations.
<P>
Lincoln summed up the animating spirit of Tocqueville's velvet tyranny when he described the spirit of slavery in America -- and we may regard it as chilling that the terms would have such a resemblance.  Lincoln called this the idea of "you plant the grain, you make the bread, and I'll eat it."  Lincoln went on to say that we must not rest until this "artificial weight is lifted from the shoulders of all mankind."
<P>
In the affairs of the world that Wallenberg cared so deeply about, the force of velvet tyranny is most visible, and certainly most important, in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  On the one hand, these countries have enjoyed a miraculous transformation.  On the other hand, they have endured a decline in industrial production and gross output for which it is difficult to find a parallel.  Russian, Polish, Czech, and Hungarian output dropped by more than 50 percent in real terms over five years -- a record that puts our "Great Depression" to shame.
<P>
History teaches that this kind of economic implosion often hastens tyranny, whether it be tyranny of the far left or the far right.  The rise of Nazi Germany was preceded by the Weimar Republic's tragedy of runaway inflation in the '20s followed by democratically-elected Henrich Brunning's economics of austerity in the early '30s.  This precipitated Brunning's abolishment of the Reichstag and thus a coalition government in 1933, led by Adolph Hitler.  And Soviet Communism grew out of the state-directed industrial capitalism in Russia during the confusion of World War I.
<P>
The response of the West to today's economic threat to democracy has not been encouraging.  For more than five years, going back to the Houston Summit, the United States and the West have been presented with one of the great opportunities for creative statesmanship in human history.  Instead of seizing it, as we did under Harry Truman, General Marshall, and Western Unification, we have turned it over to the International Monetary Fund.
<P>
Today, the top Russian tax rate is close to 70 percent on income from labor, and what little money a Russian worker is left with after this is taxed through high value-added, excise, and other consumption taxes.  The same is true, by the way, in Hungary, Poland, the Ukraine, and the rest of Eastern Europe.  The tax rate on some types of labor and business activity is over 90 percent.
<P>
No wonder wages today are less than 38 percent of Russia's entire economy -- a situation which has driven one of the most talented peoples in the world underground.  Again, the pattern is nearly identical in Hungary and other countries.  (In OECD countries, wages typically account for more than 60 percent of national income.)  The people who have done some of the best reporting on the true Russian tax burden, a newsletter called Emerging Markets Watch down in Washington, have managed to cull these data out of the ridiculously secret IMF memoranda and staff reports that go by top officials there every few weeks.  But it is only by months and years of tireless digging that they've been able to uncover what should be public knowledge -- how the U.S. and the West are spending, or rather mis-spending, the billions in annual "aid" to Eastern Europe.
<P>
Somehow, the IMF and the West -- which should be leading a sweeping Russian tax, monetary and trade reform -- remain numb to the urgency of bringing economic growth to the new democracies.  Do you know that two years ago, the IMF insisted that Russia increase its taxes by 4.1 percent of GDP in one year?  To put this in perspective, both the Bush and Clinton tax increases that attracted such displeasure in the U.S. in the last five years were less than 1 percent of GDP, and these at least were not piled on the back of a crippled economy.
<P>
This is not a partisan issue.  It goes back to the Bush administration, when we encouraged the same mind-numbing austerity as is being applied to Russia, Hungary, and Poland today through the IMF's conditionality agreements and Article IV process.  In 1993, I joined with the late Ed Muskie, George Soros, Senator Joe Lieberman, and a group of nearly three dozen other leading Americans of both parties to urge the president to take the fate of Russia out of the hands of the inept and incapable economists at the IMF and devise a serious, direct program of Western aid and trade to bring economic growth to the emerging democracies of Central and East Europe.
<P>
The post-Cold-War peace must not become another Versailles settlement of pain and austerity.  America and the West must see that they cannot afford to send the common reply, "it isn't our concern."   We must dedicate ourselves to the opposite spirit, the spirit of liberal optimism and open trade with the East.  And we must resolve to include Eastern Europe and Russia at the table.
<P>
I am reminded of a famous cartoon from Wallenberg's time, in which Russia, Germany, and Hungary were at the front end of a ship that was rapidly taking in water.  The ship was labeled, "The World Monetary Crisis," and the year was about 1927, as the first signs of protectionism and deflation were making themselves felt.  In the back of the ship were three men labeled France, Britain, and the United States.  They watched with interest and a little bit of sympathy as the men bailed furiously in front.   But they were not concerned.  "Awful leak," said one of them.  "Yes, awful," said another.  "Thank goodness it's not in our end of the boat."
<P>
Today, democracy is doing much better, but the burden on us is that much higher.  We have a tremendous opportunity to secure the fruits of the Cold War victory: to build a stable and prosperous Eastern and Central Europe; to guard Russia from a new form of tyranny -- economic tyranny.  
<P>
 Indeed, we are bound by the awesome responsibility that comes with our own freedom to guard the rightful freedom of all people.  
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had a profound understanding of this moral imperative.  He refused to accept the awful conclusion that we needn't be concerned about others, or that there is "nothing we can do."  He did not believe the unpragmatic counsel that we can ignore the front of the boat because it isn't our end.   His life was an incarnate assertion of the equal and opposite imperative -- the democratic imperative, the assertion of Rabbi Hillel, the New Testament, and Hebrew Scripture, that we are our brother's keeper, and our neighbor's brother.
<P>
As President Reagan said during the Rose Garden ceremony conferring honorary American citizenship upon Wallenberg:  " . . a man makes at least a start on understanding the meaning of human life when he plants shade trees under which he will never sit.  Raoul Wallenberg is just such a man.  He nurtured the lives of those he never knew at the risk of his own."  What better example to look to as we challenge ourselves to respond to the needs of a changing world -- to plant the trees of shade, succor and democratic successes under which we might never sit, but which will surely shelter our children and grandchildren in the 21st century.  Let us resolve not that it be an American Century per se -- but a Democratic Century for all.

<B><FONT SIZE = 4> REMARKS BEFORE THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB <BA></FONT></B>
<P>
by William J. Bennett 
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2>Given on November 18, 1996 <BA></center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
Now that the political season is over, let's talk about some other matters which are arguably as important -- indeed, I would argue that they are more important -- than the matters raised in the recent political debate.  Last week the National Commission on Civic Renewal was announced.  The executive director is Bill Galston, formerly Bill Clinton's domestic policy adviser, and a very able man.  The Commission is co-chaired by Sam Nunn and me, and it will address issues of civic trust; our morale and national mood; the fraying social fabric; and moral decline.
<P>
Today I would like to give you my take on this -- where we are, where I think we, the American people, need to go, and what's missing in our public conversation.  Let me say at the outset that I believe that in a fundamental way, many of our conversations are missing the mark.
<P>
Here's a question to start with -- a question which implicitly runs throughout my talk and one which is, I think, an interesting question for our time: why, when we have so much material wealth, are Americans so cynical, so distressed, so angry with each other, so untrusting, so ticked off about so many things?  Why, when for so many things are so good, do we feel so bad?
<P>
The evidence is all around us: the whining and the complaining; the explosion in recent years in the use of Prozac; and alcohol abuse and drug use.   The Commission takes as its fundamental data a dramatic national increase in rudeness; in incivility; in litigiousness; in the growing belief that we are all victims; in the frequency of visits to psychiatrists; in the increased amount of suicide, particularly among the young; and in increased complaints about stress.  
<P>
Earlier this month an American Automobile Association survey showed that aggressive driving cases involving death or injury are on a record pace in 1996, and incidents of violent "highway hooliganism" have increased 50 percent from 1990 through 1995.  And last week a survey of high-achieving students revealed that among many of these high school students stress, drugs and thoughts of death fill their lives.  This is a report from out youngest people in this, the most successful country in the history of the world.
<P>
Well, judging from mountains of interviews and stories from the political debate that we just concluded, many in politics still give an answer to this question that has economics at its base.  You know the litany -- and we've had a whole lot of it in the last couple of years: "economic stagnation," "flat wages," the "American Dream" is getting further and further out of reach, that sort of thing.  But is that diagnosis correct?  I don't think so.
<P>
I don't think the objective material and economic facts can explain what I'm talking about, because while it's obvious that economic things are far from perfect, the fact remains that we are the most affluent and materially prosperous people in the history of civilization.  As Robert Samuelson puts it, "By objective standards, the last half century of our national life has been hugely successful.  We have achieved unprecedented prosperity and personal freedom.  We are healthier, work at less exhausting jobs and live longer than ever."
<P>
But it seems we don't feel so great about it.  Did you know, for example, that the average American now consumes twice as many goods and services as in 1950?  Or that the poorest fifth of the current population consumes more than the average family did in 1955?  In a wonderful introductory essay for the 75th anniversary issue of Forbes magazine, James Michaels put it this way:
<P>
"When you're my age you don't have to ask: Are Americans really materially better off than they were in the recent past?  Those of us born in the 1920s and with vivid memories of the Depression simply know how much better things are today.  The improvement is implicit in almost our every memory, every experience.  Even for comfortable middle-class people life was much more difficult and insecure in the 1920s than it is today.  If he was fortunate enough to have central heating (less than one-third of the population in 1920 did), middle-class Dad had to pull himself from bed at 4 a.m. on cold winter mornings to unbank the furnace and shovel coal; if he overslept, the pipes froze.  But he usually didn't have to rake leaves or shovel snow.  Not in the 1930s.  That was done by shabby, humble men who knocked at the back door mornings, asking for a warm meal in return for doing chores."
<P>
Michaels goes on to say this:  "In 1921... the typical American workweek was 60 hours, and many people worked longer...  [A woman] worked a lot more than 60 hours in her home.  Leisure-time industry scarcely existed because few people had leisure.  For more than half the population, the family toilet was a hole in the backyard with a shack built over it.....  Senior citizens?  We called them old folks, and they were old in their 50s; if they were lucky, one of their kids had a spare room for them, maybe in the attic.  Life expectancy was about 54 years, which was just as well because there were few pensions beyond what the gold watch might bring at a pawnshop."       
<P>
My point is this: while people natter about economics, and it almost consumes many political debates, what I am talking about is not about economics.  It's about whether we can survive prosperity.  Now prosperity and wealth are certainly far preferable to poverty.  But can the human spirit survive it?  The problem is not prosperity per se; the problem is in making prosperity the object of our loves, the object of our heart's and soul's desire, thereby displacing other things.  In this connection think of Saint Augustine, who has the concept called ordo amorum, the "order of the loves."  I think that very often, for very many of us, we have the order wrong.
<P>
Now, if people want to be unhappy and angry and upset and sad, there certainly are plenty of things to be unhappy and sad and angry about.  While America is the most powerful, affluent, and envied nation in the world -- in many ways justifiably so -- America also leads the industrialized world in rates of murder; violent crime; juvenile violent crime; imprisonment; divorce; abortion; sexually-transmitted diseases; single-parent households; teen suicide; cocaine consumption; per capita consumption of all drugs; pornography production and pornography consumption.  I am told that California itself leads the entire world in pornography production.  And that's only a partial list.  Now these are serious matters, worthy of serious concern.  But these are not -- I think we can fairly say -- matters that are the consequences of an economic deprivation.  The root cause lies elsewhere.
<P>
Let me digress for a moment.  I do not want to be misunderstood; I don't mean to sound like a Jeremiah one-note.  There is genuine good news in America, and much of it is about things other than economics.  We have seen huge social advances when it comes to women and minorities; opportunity and equality have been extended to those who were once denied them.  We have witnessed extraordinary advances in medicine, in science and in technology in recent times.  Life expectancy has increased more than 20 years during the last six decades.  Studies show that if a person finishes high school, gets married and reaches the age of twenty before having a first child, the odds are less than 1 in 10 that that person will be in poverty.  The American system works: finish high school, get a job, don't get pregnant or get someone pregnant before you finish high school, and you can make it in America.  And of course, last but not least, America prevailed in the "long, twilight struggle" against communism.
<P>
Let me give you some more specific and more recent good news: we have seen what many people thought could not occur: a downturn in crime in New York and Houston -- almost a 40 percent decline in violent crime in New York (which accounts for a lot of the total crime decline in the nation as a whole).  We have seen effective welfare programs in several states across the country.  I must confess I was delighted that my beloved Western Canon of literature has now made it to Hollywood.  Jane Austen is an enormous movie success.  Now it turns out three Henry James novels are coming to the screen.  Can Anna Karenina be far behind?  We are seeing the popularity of shows on the radio and some on television that lift up the human spirit.  We are seeing a flattening out or decrease in some social indicators -- abortion, divorce, crime.  Maybe this will just flatten out at a high plateau.  Or maybe we will see a further decline.
<P>
We are seeing an emerging consensus on the importance of the "values" debate.  As Bill Galston says, 10 or even 5 years ago we would have been arguing about basic facts and basic premises.  That's not the case now.  People understand the importance of values, understand the importance of families.  For men, programs like Promise Keepers are an extraordinary event in American life.  For young women, for girls, my wife's program, Best Friends, is a tremendous success here in the District of Columbia and in other places.  This is extraordinarily important and extraordinarily hopeful.
<P>
Our popular culture campaign involving Joe Lieberman, Sam Nunn and DeLores Tucker, has had success.  People were actually willing to listen and to change some of what is on TV and what is marketed in music.  I think what we are seeing in America today, in many places, is the virus creating its own antibodies.  We are seeing people fighting back with their best, with their eyes and their sights and their standards raised.  And that is very important and very encouraging.
<P>
But the troubles we have remain our troubles; they manifestly have to do not with the pocket book, not with economics, but with the human heart, the human heart at odds with itself. 
It seems to me that almost all contemporary political campaigns miss the mark in terms of what most ails America.  The concerns which the two campaigns most sought to address were economic: things like wage stagnation, fear that our children will not have as much materially as we do, and how do we increase wealth creation.  Making a bigger pie is a fine thing to do.  We should do it, and I am for it.  But it is not everything.  Nor is it even the most important thing. 
<P>
More than ever before -- and thanks largely to affluence, to mass marketing, to television, to the nature of our political discourse, and I say this knowingly, as a Republican, thanks to the unbridled and omnipresent market, to capitalism, we are constantly pushing our children and adults to buy things which they don't need.  We are pushing goods and the idea of life as having things and having experiences.  We are making desires into needs, and as a result we are not living at the center.  We are misreading the essential human condition.  Because if we actually are moral and spiritual beings -- which a lot of us say we are -- then we ought to act in ways which are consonant with that fact, that reality.  But too often, we aren't doing that -- officially, politically, publicly, privately.  We are not living, or advertising, or talking, or even making public policy, as if we are what we profess ourselves to be.  I know often I'm not.  And maybe you're not.  Maybe a lot of us aren't.  And I think that explains, in large part, the cynicism, the anger, the drift, and the deep and pervasive sadness.
<P>
Let me conclude and then open this up to discussion.  And in conclusion, let me borrow briefly from three people who are a lot smarter than I am.  In doing a philosopher's exercise like this, I thought it was advisable for me to draw on people who thought these things through a lot longer and better than I did.  See if you think they hit it closer than what we here in Beltway Central have been obsessing about for so long.
<P>
First Walker Percy, my favorite contemporary novelist.  When asked about what issue most concerned him about the future of America, Percy said this: "Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom ... gradually subside into decay through default and is defeated, not by the Communist movement ... but from within by weariness, by boredom, by cynicism, by greed, and in the end, by helplessness before its great problems."
<P>
Second, the great and prophetic Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had this to say: "In the United States the difficulties are not a Minotaur or a dragon -- not imprisonment, not hard labor, death, government harassment and censorship -- but cupidity, boredom, sloppiness, indifference." About the West, Solzhenitsyn said this simple, straightforward sentence: "the spiritual axis of life has grown dim."
 <P>
And finally, Scottish author John Buchan, writing a half-century ago, described the "coming of a too garish age, when life would be lived in the glare of neon lamps and the spirit would find no solitude."  Here is what Buchan wrote about his nightmare world:
<P>
"In such a world everyone would have leisure.  But everyone would be restless, for there would be no spiritual discipline in life...  It would be a feverish, bustling world, self-satisfied and yet malcontent, and under the mask of a riotous life there would be death at the heart.  In the perpetual hurry of life there would be no change of quiet for the soul...  in such a bagman's paradise, where life would be rationalised and padded with every material comfort, there would be little satisfaction for the immortal part of man."
<P>
This sounds right to me.  I'd love to know how it sounds to you.  Thank you very much. 
<P>
<P><HR>
<center><b>QUESTION-AND-ANSWER</B></center> 
<p>
<B>Question:</B>  How will the new Bennett-Nunn commission actually address moral decline -- through studies, surveys, academic papers, hearings, recommendations for legislative actions, exhortations and speeches?  How will you address moral decline?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</b>  All the above (laughter).  It's a commission.  The Commission members are an exceedingly interesting group: Richard Land from the Southern Baptist Convention is one member, and Henry Louis Gates from Harvard is another member, so that gives you a sense of the ideological spread of the group.  I don't want to presume ideology on the part of anybody, but I have a sense there may be differences of opinion between those two, as with others of us.  It will be interesting to tape the conversation.  And the meetings, I believe, are open to the press, so we welcome members of the press to come.
<P>
We'll have witnesses.  We will hear from people about problems and about solutions.  We very much want to profile what works, what's effective.  We want to see programs that address some of the hardest issues in American life and are finding a way to ameliorate them, if not always solve them.  If there are grounds for this anger and this lack of trust and this grousing that seems to be so increasingly prevalent, we want to know what it is.  But if there are grounds for others, as St. Paul says, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, we'll think on those things, too.  And so we will want to do both.
<P>
What Bill Galston has stressed -- and one of the reasons I so much admire Bill Galston and was so sorry to see him leave the Clinton White House -- was that he doesn't think we should speak on these things until we have established an absolutely unassailable factual basis for anything we have to say.  And so I think we will have a solid empirical basis for talking about these things.  These are difficult concepts, and some people might say, what is all this about trust and sadness and all that?   Well, we're going to get a hard empirical basis for it, so people who need that sort of thing to believe it -- who need to touch something before they believe it's there -- will be satisfied.  There will be a lot of social science, I will admit.  You know what one person called social science?  The elaborate demonstration of the obvious by methods that are obscure (laughter.)  
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The National Endowment for the Humanities, at the beginning of the Clinton administration, launched a national conversation on what it means to be an American.  Little has been heard from that since.  Isn't this similar to that you are doing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  No, you'll hear from us (laughter).  I don't know what happened to that conversation.  They may still be building toward it.  They may still be footnoting it.  I don't know what happened to the National Endowment for the Humanities conversation.
<P>
I don't think there are too few conversations in American political life.  I don't think anybody can go through campaign season and say, you know, we're not talking enough about politics.  It's that I don't think we have a sufficient number of conversations that are focused on things that I think we ought to focus on.  And what I was trying to do today -- and what we will try to do in the Commission, I think -- is to bring some other kinds of things into the conversation, some of the most important things are not getting talked about.
<P>
<B>Question</B>:  Perhaps you answered your own question, perhaps wealth is at the core of our hollowness.  In short, do we have too much of a good thing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, the philosophers worried about this.  Again, I don't think prosperity per se is the problem, I don't think wealth per se is the problem.  I think the problem is, as I read some of these other people whom I've quoted, is when the pursuit of these things leads to the displacement of other things.  It's when they become the idol, the actual object of the pursuit, rather than simply a way in which one lives.
<P>
Look, one of my arguments with the market is that it makes people think their desires are needs.  And this is a very, very important distinction.  When I was chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the first budget we did -- I remember submitting to Congress a huge document -- talking about the "needs" of the humanities community.  Well, as I read through the "needs" of the humanities community, these weren't needs, these were desires.  It's important to make the distinction.  They said, "we need summer seminars in warm climates." (Laughter.)  Well, they wanted summer seminars in warm climates, and I understand that.  Other people get summer seminars in warm climates; why shouldn't professors?  By the way, we took it away from them and gave it to elementary and high school teachers because I thought they were more deserving of summer seminars in warm climates.  But there was the substitution of the word "need" for what was actually the desire.
<P>
Maybe the smartest thing ever said about this was by Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, "Human desires grow with the means of their gratification."  And I think that just turns out to be a truth of human nature.  One of the ironies of this tremendously successful commercial machine which we have made in this country is that we now regard deprivation relatively much higher than we used to.  It's at a much higher threshold.  Consider what people have now and what they regard as deprivation.  The machine is constantly trying to transmute desires into needs, so that we think of those things in that way, and we ratchet ever higher and pursue it ever the more.
<P>
So, unbridled capitalism is a problem.  It may not be a problem for production and for expansion of the economic pie, but it's a problem for human beings.  It's a problem for that whole dimension of things we call the realm of values and human relationships, because it distorts things.
<P>
The other thing to keep in mind is that with the interest in selling, people have now decided to sell by way of philosophy.  You just don't sell a beer or sell a cigar or sell a piece of furniture; you sell a style of life and a philosophy of life.  Now, this is a free country and anybody can practice philosophy.  But when the young are around and are listening, they may take it seriously in the absence of the real stuff.
<P>
For example, when I was growing up I remember the commercial from the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.  It made a tremendous impact on me, and maybe on other people.  It said, "You only go around once in life, so grab for all the gusto you can."  Now Schlitz produces pretty good beer.  I still buy it occasionally.  But I don't buy the philosophy.  How much of that philosophy is getting across?  Now Schlitz might make good beer, but where did they do their philosophy?  How do they know you only go around once in life?  (Laughter.)  I mean, is that part of the brewing process?  This was not a claim about beer.  And if you spend time with undergraduates, you spend time in high school and you talk to young people about life, and what the Good Life is, you will find that what you're hearing very often -- not all the time but very often -- is an echo and a translation through their own internal systems of what they are picking up from the most successful and omnipresent marketing and philosopher's machine ever invented: television.  Television is telling people what to think, and what to believe, and what to feel, and what to buy. And that creates a different view of the world.
<P>
Again, it's a free country.  I'm not even in favor of the v-chip.  I don't want government regulating television; I don't want government legislating about the content of television. I think these are matters best left to individuals.  But what we can't say, it seems to me, is these matters have no consequence; or that television has no consequence; or that advertising has no consequence; or that a relentless market has no consequence.  These things have an enormous consequence.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  More Americans are regular church-goers than in any other developed country. Are you saying that somehow religious organizations are failing to stimulate this spiritual renewal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, I guess I am.  I've looked into this, because it's a very interesting fact, the number of Americans who go to church. The question is what goes on there, what are the consequences, what's the carryover, and what's the impact?
<P>
Maybe the more interesting thing is to see the shift in church-going, the shift from some of the old established Protestant sects, for example, to some of the newer, more evangelical ones. That seems to be a more interesting, a more revealing direction.  Also, there is still an increase, I think, in registrations in the Catholic Church.
<P>
This is the country which in many ways is the nicest, the most generous, the most considerate, the most sensitive to the needs of people in the world and its citizens.  And yet the kinds of things that go on every day in America, cited in my litany, suggest that we're of two minds on this. I don't think that going to church does it any more. I think that for a lot of us -- and again, I put myself in this group, I don't exempt myself from the charges -- I think that sometimes all it amounts to is going to church.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think America's cultural decline is irreversible? And what nation would you point to as historic precedent for such an about-face?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, there is none. There is no precedent. I've found lately -- we've spent a lot of time talking to cultural anthropologists and historians, trying to find a precedent for this. There are so many things going on in America that are unprecedented.  For example, I was reading a book the other day in which Lawrence Stone, formerly at Princeton (I don't know where he is now), points out that we are in entirely uncharted territory in this country in terms of the disintegration of the family.  There has been a relentless assault on marriage as the central cementing institution of society; it has been going on for decades now, and in its place we see the substitution of the idea of individual self-fulfillment with or without commitment.  This is unprecedented, certainly in the West, and we don't know where this goes.
<P>
Nobody's ever done this before; nobody's ever tried to sustain a society with this level of familial disintegration, and we're not sure whether we can or not. I think that the familial disintegration is a corollary of the larger point here -- that is, the focus and the order of the loves.  Because if you regard yourself as, let's say, a moral and spiritual being on the one hand -- and I'm not saying you have to -- but if you say you do, or if on the other hand you're a "Schlitzian" and you believe you only go around once in life and you should grab for all the gusto you can -- well, one thing you can't say is it doesn't matter which you believe.  Because if you believe one or believe the other -- or if you have a foot in both camps, which a lot of us do -- it makes an enormous difference.
<P>
There is no precedent for the United States in so many ways.  I do not think there's any example that's even close.  We could look to Britain, I suppose, in the 19th Century.  Some historians have suggested that you had a kind of revival occurring which changed things.
<P>
If it happens, it will happen on our own terms by our own people. Regeneration comes from within, I'm pretty sure of that.  And the things I cited as grounds for hope I think are very, very important, because if you go through that list -- if you go through Best Friends, if you go through Promise Keepers, if you go through the successful programs in drug treatment, or the successful welfare programs -- I think you find that there's a common basis to many of them. There's something that they are all share, and that is they all tend to raise people sights up, they tend to lift people up, to look beyond where they've been looking. If you want the quick version of my speech, it is that country Western song, "Lookin' for Love in all the Wrong Places."  
<P>
Marvin Olasky has taught us, I think, in this whole discussion of contemporary charity and compassion, that if you're looking at welfare problems, people who have been on welfare generation after generation, if you're looking at people with serious drug problems, alcohol problems, this requires a refocusing of one's life.  It's not simply a matter of getting a job, or getting a message from the government.  It's a matter of refocusing your life, and refocusing your life requires more than the kind of fooling around with the details, messing with the details of bureaucracies and incentives.  I'm for welfare reform, but unless we offer something to people by way of other agencies or institutions for them to focus on, they will fall back. That's why I think the role of churches is so crucial in this whole welfare debate, and indeed beyond the welfare debate.
<P>
But there are people -- I should say this in fairness to some pretty sophisticated literature out there -- there are people who think we are going through a great spiritual reawakening right now in this country.  I don't see it.  There are people who say we are going through it.  It would be nice if it occurred -- provided it was American in tone, provided it was open and tolerant and not vindictive, not authoritarian -- then it would be a good thing. But I'm not sure I see it.  I see all the signs, the interest of people in religion.  I see the New York Times Best Sellers list, and all the books on religion.  I see movies getting quasi-religious. The latest thing in Hollywood seems to me, from what I can tell, is objective immortality. They can't quite say we have souls yet but you may -- you're to be measured by the impact you have on other people's lives.
<P>
It may also be the case, as demographers have pointed out, that this is not a religious revival, this is simply the yuppies turning 50 and getting nervous (laughter.)  After putting the nation through granola and jogging and marijuana and weight machines, they are now going to make us pray because they're approaching 60.  Maybe so.  I don't know for sure.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Does the gap between the richest Americans and the poorest Americans likely affect public discontent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  I think it's very troubling to Americans to see the gap between an overclass and an underclass, to take both ends increase and increase dramatically.  We've got what people have called "cognitive stratification" to a degree we have never had before.  It's always better to be smart, and it's always better to be well-educated, and it's always better to have an economic base.  But the gap now widens because the sheer value of an education; the sheer value of intelligence matters more, in today's complicated world, than it ever did.
<P>
So yes, I think that's troubling.  But the other side of that is the good news.  The other side of that is a society in which we now find that if you play by certain basic minimal rules -- if you graduate from high school, get a job, keep your nose clean, don't have a child before you get out of high school -- the odds that you will succeed in American society increase dramatically.  But you need to observe certain basic rules.
<P>
The problem is -- and I think now there's a lot of agreement among social scientists who have studied poverty -- that poverty is behavioral in nature,  And that's not a different malady -- except when a malady hits the poor, it knocks them out.  When a malady hits the wealthy suburbs, they can absorb it.  I remember when I was "drug czar" and we went to Hollywood and talked about the drug problem.  The people in Hollywood told me that they were not doing drugs any more.  Out in Hollywood, whenever somebody gets a drug problem, they go to the Betty Ford Clinic and they're fine.  Well, when it hits Beverly Hills, people had the money and resources to be able to do that.  But when it hit Watts, it knocked Watts on its ear.  How bad is the earthquake?  Well, how strong is the foundation of the building in which you live?
<P>
It's never good to be poor, it's never good to be without material resources.  But the resources I'm talking about are perhaps the ones that are missing the most across the board, and they raise the question as to whether this country, and the things for which it stands, the hopes it has for itself and its children, can continue without some fairly significant change.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think Bob Dole made a serious mistake in his campaign by stressing the 15-percent tax cut?  What moral and ethical issues should have he raised, beyond just calling President Clinton immoral?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, he did more than that.  If you just stand there and say "You're immoral," that's not persuasive, it's not a very good argument, it's not persuasive when one needs to make one's case.  But as I said during the campaign, I think issues of public character and public trust are central to public confidence.
<P>
Look, one of the things that distressed me -- I don't want to make this a political talk -- is that 55 or 60 percent of the people in exit polls said that they didn't have the trust in the president, that they didn't think he was a trustworthy person.  Mario Cuomo said, well, if that's what they thought of Clinton, then what did they think of Dole, if Clinton got elected?  Well, I guess in some ways less, in terms of electability.  But that's not good, that's the point I would make.
<P>
It's perfectly fine to talk about a 15-percent tax cut if that's what you truly believe is essential to the well-being of the country and will spark an economic recovery.  I have no objection to it.  Other things can be talked about and were talked about -- the drug problem, the education problem.  But let me make two points: first, we could be more explicit and talk about real-life issues in ways that are broader than we usually talk about it.  For example, talk about education not just about SAT scores, but talk about education as the architecture of the soul, which is how we used to talk about it, and which why I think many schools are so successful and others are not.  Some schools address students as moral and spiritual beings, and that makes a difference.  I think that helps, when it's done by people who genuinely care for the children.
<P>
We can talk about welfare as life-refocusing effort.  And we can talk about crime as arising not from what I think the usual root-cause argument is but, as we argue in Body Count, the root cause of most crime is moral poverty, kids who are not taught the difference between right and wrong at an early age.  When I traveled as drug czar and talked to wardens and police chiefs and judges, this is what we heard over and over again: nobody's teaching these kids the basics of right and wrong.  Now that's an interesting way to talk about crime, and we could do that.
<P>
Now sure, we could all broaden and deepen our debates in this way.  But at the end of the day, it's not a matter of saying to politicians, "Take all this stuff about the soul and right and wrong and put all that into your political speeches and your political debates."  The point is about the limits of politics itself.  We can't get where we need to get by politics.  The secularization of so much of what matters to us has become so complete that we think of politics as the vehicle of national self-recovery.  And it is not.
<P>
Samuel Johnson said, in his great lines, "How small of all that human hearts endure, That part which laws or kings can cause or cure."  And I think that's right.  But we have now, unwittingly, created a situation in which people are unhappy and so the government needs to do something about it, the president needs to do something about it.  Of course, they can't do something about those things which laws or kings can't cause or cure.  And so we have gotten into a cycle of frustration and unhappiness.
<P>
It is the limits of politics.  It is not as if I'm saying we need to step forward and transform American politics and get into all these things more explicitly.  Politics is a very limited activity, if you think of men and women in the ways that I have been talking about.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  As the story goes, when Bob Dole queried you about interest in running for vice president, you suggested Jack Kemp.  Why didn't you want to run?  Is that because of the limitations of politics?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Because of the limitations of politics, plus my own.  And I thought Dole-Kemp would be a better ticket.  I thought it would have more lift than Dole-Bennett.  And there were other reasons.  Yeah, I thought Dole-Kemp was a good idea, and that was my recommendation.
<P>
I did not grow up in the soil of politics.  A thought that has occurred to me recently that to run for president in our time one needs to be obsessed with running for president, and I do not have that, I don't seek it.  I don't come from that soil.  I don't think this is something I will do.  And my relationship with campaigns has always been a little bumptious, a little difficult.  It's never a smooth fit.  So, yeah, I made that recommendation in good conscience, and I thought it was the best call at the time.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think the world of the Internet is helping to form caring communities by linking people beyond their geographic boundaries, or isolating them from person-to-person contact?  If the latter, what as a society can we do about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>   I don't know.  I'm no expert on the Internet.  But I'll tell you it seems to me to be a very mixed blessing.  I read that chilling New York Times story.  It was about a little town in Minnesota and about this network on the Internet on a topic I don't want to get into -- one of the worst and most grisly aspects of American life.  The Internet has made it possible for lots of really horrible things to happen, and it's made it possible for lots of obviously wonderful things to happen.  Here, again, the technology outruns or outpaces the ability to legislate against it, to regulate it, to keep control of it.  What's important are internal constraints, a sense of responsibility, a sense of involvement, participation on the part of parents and others.  I don't know where this is going to lead, but we are going to have a big debate on this.  It's a very mixed blessing indeed.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  California voters recently passed Proposition 209 which ends affirmative action and racial and gender preferences in government and public education.  Do you back this as a national improvement?  And do you believe this would be appropriate for federal hiring programs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Yes, I was a supporter of Prop. 209 and went out there a few times, campaigned for it.  And I think it is one of the more interesting consequences of the elections.  It does not end affirmative action.  What it ends is preference by race or gender in hiring and in college admissions and so on.  And I think that's right.  I think finally there is only one way to live in this society, which is to lift the burdens of discrimination from the shoulders of every man, woman, and child in the country, and to have a level playing field, and to give opportunity where opportunity hasn't been given before.  And I think this is the way to go.
<P>
Yes, I would like to see it on the federal level.  And I am very encouraged, as I think other Americas should be, by the results of the recent election in which when those redistricted districts were redistricted once more, and black members of Congress, incumbents who were now running in majority white districts, were still elected.  It was encouraging for this reason: it shows that the American people, the vast majority of them, can look past race and want to look past race.  And I would hope that Proposition 209 will be given a sympathetic hearing across the country and a full discussion.  I hope that this issue, like so many other important issues, doesn't get decided for us by the courts.  The courts must enter if they think it appropriate.   But these are vital issues of democracy, and people must be encouraged and invited to speak.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The rise of dual-income families explains some of the affluence you describe.  Is there an antidote that would give parents more time with their children to impart values?  What do you propose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  It really all depends. Some people say that two parents have to work to keep body and soul together.  Sometimes that's true.  Sometimes two parents work to keep the boat together -- you know, the boat for the summer vacation.  You pay your money, you take your choice.
<P>
The two statistics I am still trying to get together are the one that says people, the average American adult, has very little time to spend with his family and with his children because of the demands of work with the statistic that tells us the average American adult watches 21 hours of television a week.  Now, it seems to me that if it's as easy as that we can just answer what people ought to do: turn off the TV -- at least during the week -- and check the homework or something.  But this is a matter of people's priorities.  As I've said, it's a free country and people can do what they want.  But every parent -- and I'm a parent -- knows that how you spend your time and where you spend your time has consequences for your children.
<P>
Years ago there was this nice idea of quality time.  "Quality time" is all you need.  Well, maybe there's something true about quality time, but you don't know when it is, and you've got to log a lot of quantity time in order to get the right quality time, because you can't say to your son, "This is our time, buddy.  We're together now for two hours -- what's on your mind?"  It may turn out there isn't anything on his mind.  Then there's some other time he wants it, and it's nice if you were there as opposed to not being there.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How to you feel about your regular appearances on CNN's "Late Edition" with Mario Cuomo?  Is there any convergence of liberal and conservative ideas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Oh yeah.  I think he would agree with a lot of this.  Yes, we had some good moments.  One of the reasons I like Governor Cuomo is he's a liberal and he's not embarrassed to be a liberal.  He and Paul Wellstone, you know, "Here we are, we are liberals, we can do no other."  I don't agree with them, but I admire their guts, because it's two versus everybody in the Republican Party, and virtually everybody in the Democratic Party.  Today liberal is an epithet, and people run from it.  You know, if you call somebody a conservative they say, "Thank you, come to dinner."  But if you call somebody a liberal, they say, "Not me" -- unless you're Paul Wellstone or Mario Cuomo.  So I admire that.
<P>
The other things is we have somewhat similar backgrounds -- two New York Catholics -- although he has pushed that a bit far.  During one of the CNN shows I answered, then he answered, and then he said to Frank Sesno, "What you had in our two answers is the respective perspectives of the Dominicans and the Jesuits."  And that's not good TV.  That is not good talking-head journalism (laughter).  Thank you.<br>

Dear Friend:
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to give you information about <I><B>Empower America</B></I> and our ongoing internship program. 
<P>
<B><I>Empower America</I></B> is a conservative non-profit grass-roots advocacy organization.  We were founded on three main principles which include the beliefs of democratic capitalism, economic growth through entrepreneurship, job creation, lower taxes, sound money, less government regulation, and developing new approaches to cultural and social issues.
<P>
We conduct extensive research into public policy and laws that are being made in Congress.  With this valuable information, we then take positions on the issues.  At that point, we begin to educate our membership on the details of the current policy topic and our positions, and encourage them to become involved in the political process.  We have worked on such issues as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Welfare and Healthcare reform, the California School Choice Initiative and the Washington "Three Strikes Your Out" initiative, to name a few.
<P>
The internship program consists of "hands on" working experience with a leading national grass-roots organization.  We also invite leaders from the political community to participate in our internship program's speakers series which focuses on current government and political issues of the day.  Educational tours of federal and historical buildings will be provided, as well.  This is an exciting, interesting, and educational internship for any college student.
<P>
If you have any questions, or would like to apply, please contact me at (202) 452-8200 or write me at:

<P>
<br>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">JACK KEMP<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
Jack Kemp currently is on leave
of absence as co-director of Empower America, a public policy
and advocacy organization he co-founded in 1993 with William Bennett,
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. Empower America is
dedicated to three founding principles: expanding freedom and
democratic capitalism; promoting policies to expand economic growth
and entrepreneurship for our nation; and advancing social policies
which empower people, not government bureaucracies.<BR>
<P>
Prior to founding Empower America,
Mr. Kemp served for four years as Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, and proved to be one of our nation's most innovative
leaders in that role. He was the first and strongest advocate
of Enterprise Zones to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation
in urban America and of expanding homeownership among the poor
through resident management and ownership of public housing.<BR>
<P>
 In March, 1995, Senator Bob Dole
and Speaker Newt Gingrich put Jack Kemp at the center of the tax
and economic debate for the `96 campaign by naming him chairman
of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to
study how major restructuring of our tax code can help unleash
the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, grow the economy without
inflation and create opportunity for people to escape poverty.
<BR>
<P>
 Before his appointment to the Cabinet,
Mr. Kemp represented the Buffalo area and Western New York for
18 years in the United States House of Representatives from 1971
to 1989.  He served for seven years in the Republican Leadership
as Chairman of the House Republican Leadership Conference.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
 Jack Kemp came to Congress after
13 years as a professional football quarterback.  He was captain
of the San Diego Chargers from 1960 to 1962 and also of the Buffalo
Bills, the team he helped lead to the American Football League
championship in 1964 and 1965 when he was named the league's most
valuable player. He also co-founded the AFL Players Association
and was five times elected president.<BR>
<P>
 Mr. Kemp, born and raised in Los
Angeles, is married to the former Joanne Main of Fillmore, California.
 Both Jack and Joanne are graduates of Occidental College. They
have four children, Jeffrey, Jennifer, Judith and James, eleven
grandchildren, and reside in Bethesda, Maryland.<BR>

<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="/empower/ea2.jpe" align="left" alt="Jeane J. Kirkpatrick"</CENTER>


	Scholar, diplomat, syndicated columnist, political scientist, Jeane Kirkpatrick is one of America's few true experts on world politics and international affairs.  Kirkpatrick speaks and writes with clarity and sophistication about the politics of many issues, areas, countries, and organizations.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick's first hand experience in the United Nations and as a member of the U.S. Cabinet and National Security Council gives her an unusual understanding of the dynamics of global politics.  A lifetime of study gives her analyses unusual depth and breadth.  She knows world leaders personally and understands them in their institutions.

	<P>During her years as United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and as a member of Ronald Reagan's cabinet, Jeane Kirkpatrick had a remarkable impact in the United States and in the world body.  Her stature has not diminished since she left that office.  Her strong voice and keen mind, her analyses and opinions are sought on a wide range of international and geopolitical questions.

	<P>Today, Dr. Kirkpatrick is Leaving Professor at Georgetown University, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Co-Director of Empower America, and author of a syndicated column on world affairs.

	<P>She is the author of seven books, several monographs and a large number of substantial articles on American political issues and foreign policy that appear in such journals as Commentary, Foreign Affairs, and The National Interest.

	<P>Her most recent book, The Withering Away of the Totalitarian State, describes the collapse of Communism and the end of the Cold War.  Other books include Legitimacy and Force (two volumes), Dictatorships and Double Standards, The Reagan Phenomenon, The New Presidential Elite, a pace-making study of American presidential nominating politics, Dismantling the Parties, Political Woman, a trail-blazing study of women in public life, and a book-length study of the Peronist movement in Argentina, Leader and Vanguard in Mass Society:  A Study of Peronist Argentina.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick has lectured extensively in the United States and abroad.  She has also participated in programs of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) and the Department of State in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America.

	<P>A noted academic, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick holds undergraduate degrees from Stephens College and Barnard College, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University.  She has studied at the University of Paris.  Dr. Kirkpatrick has been awarded more than a dozen honorary doctor degrees including degrees form the University of Michigan, Georgetown University, St. John's University, the Hebrew University (Jerusalem), and Tel Aviv University.  She has received research grants from a number of leading foundations.  

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick was awarded the Medal of Freedom (the highest civilian award given by the U.S. government), and the French Prize Politique for political courage.  She is also the recipient of the award of the Commonwealth Fund, the Gold Medal, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Hubert H. Humphrey Award of the American Political Science Association, the Gold Medal of the Nicholas Society, the Christian A. Herter Award of the Boston World Affairs Association, the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award, the Humanitarian Award of B'nai B'rith, the Defender of Jerusalem Award, and, most recently, a second Distinguished Public Service Medal awarded in December 1992 (the highest civilian award given by the Department of Defense).

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick has been active in professional organizations, including the American and International Political Science Associations, and she has served as a board member on numerous academic, public affairs, and public service organizations.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick was born in Duncan, Oklahoma.  She is married to Dr. Evron M. Kirkpatrick.  They have three grown sons.  In addition to English, she speaks French and Spanish and travels widely.

<H1>Effective environmentalism uses a new shade of green</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>GALLATIN GATEWAY, MONT.--  Last week, 17 federal judges gathered at the Gallatin Gateway Inn.  This inn, the last of its kind, was built by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad to attract tourists en route to Yellowstone National Park.  The judges met to hear policy analysts explain a new environmentalism.  </P>

<P>Gallatin Gateway is a perfect setting for meetings.  It's on the geographic margins between Yellowstone National Park and Montana's &quot;Big Sky&quot; country, and on the cultural margins between the new and the old West.</P>

<P>The lecturers were diverse, but a coherent new vision emerged from their training and their shared desire to protect the environment while respecting other values.  The unifying theme was the rejection of top-down, command and control environmentalism.  All favored more flexible, decentralized approaches.  Guest lecturers came from academic institutions, such as the <A HREF="http://www.puaf.umd.edu/Faculty-Staff/nelson.html">University of Maryland</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cc.colorado.edu">Colorado College</A>, and the private sector, like <A HREF="http://www.battelle.org">Battelle Institute</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot">Thoreau Institute</A>.  </P>

<P>The first speaker, Lynn Scarlett, Vice President for Research at the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> and a Board Member at the <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/gallatin">Gallatin Institute</A>, set the tone for the conference.  She introduced a &quot;new environmentalism&quot;.  This new shade of green emphasizes the importance of incentives and the imperatives of dispersed information.  The value of market coordination and decentralized decision making is critical to guiding environmental reform.  </P>

<P>Ms. Scarlett led the judges through multiple cases of toxins and pollutants like NOXs, VOCs, and SO2.  For that churning cauldron of sludge, she sees no grand &quot;solutions&quot; to environmental woes -- only trade-offs.  The hundreds of pages in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments will not contain &quot;the answer&quot;.  Instead, she claimed, complex and confusing regulations contain the ingredients for error and confrontation.</P>

<P>She described a recent example where <A HREF="http://www.hispanic.org/coors.htm">Adolph Coors Company</A> in Golden, Colo. voluntarily conducted a self-audit of its environmental impact.  The 17-month audit which cost Coors $1.5 million discovered previously unknown emissions in the brewing process.  These emissions were not covered by environmental regulations but far exceeded all of the company's other emissions.  When Coors disclosed this information as a step to obtain permits (which would have been required if environmental quality were the goal), the Colorado Department of Health and the Environment fined Coors more than $1 million for their troubles.  The message of these incentives was perverse: don't be a good citizen -- hide, don't divulge.</P>

<P>This story tells us a lesson.  Antagonistic environmental regulators stifle voluntary cooperation for environmental ends.  Nearly half of the companies recently surveyed by Price Waterhouse expressed reluctance to conduct self-audits because they feared possible punishment.  Slapping fines on firms that investigate their environmental impact, at their own expense and initiative, will effectively deter environmentally sound business practices.  Poorly designed regulatory schemes thwart environmental gains.</P>

<P>Voluntary activities like Coors' clearly foster environmental quality.  Since 1988, Coors has lightened its bottles, cans, and packing by 21% and reduced its contribution to landfills by 850,000 tons.  In 1994 alone, Coors re-used 964,359 tons of packaging materials.  And they saved money in the process.  As the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD">President's Council on Sustainable Development</A> recently reported, &quot;Pollution is waste, waste is inefficient, and inefficiency is expensive.&quot;</P>

<P>Coors' environmental innovations came in spite of the punitive orientation of state and federal agencies.  Lynn Scarlett reminds us of the critical importance of incentive compatible environmental enforcement.  Coors' observation that &quot;voluntary initiatives are more effective than mandated actions because they create flexible solutions, foster innovation and promote collaboration rather than adversarial relationships&quot; merits the close attention of reformers.</P>

<P>Another speaker at the conference, Felix Romero, told a compelling story about old values of the West.  His story takes us just down the road from Golden, Colo. to a small village of <A HREF="http://www.rmii.com/slv/sanluis/sanluis.htm">San Luis</A>, Colo.  A Spanish land grant dating from the Mexican-American war settlement of 1848, the community owned the valley land in common until the Taylor Ranch cleared title for the land in the 1970s.  With the loss of community property, San Luis' livelihood is threatened by ecological degradation upstream on the Taylor Ranch and by the increasing pressures on what little land they retain.  To remedy this, the La Sierra Foundation of San Luis is attempting to buy the ranch and return property rights to the community.</P>

<P>The new West is one of protected spotted owls, subdivisions, and clashing values.  Each of these forces combine to threaten the rich heritage of Mr. Romero's community.  A strong and sustainable future demands that our &quot;new environmentalism&quot; finds a place for their traditions and practices.  The alternative is subdivided ecosystems, clearcut mountainsides, and dislocated farmers.</P>

<P>The conference brought disparate yet coherent voices to federal judges concerned with environmental values and legal traditions.  The speakers advocated a new paradigm, a different shade of green.  They emphasized property rights, market processes, and responsible liberty as key components of an effective environmentalism.</P>

<P>The judges realize that their role is to interpret the law, not to champion innovative policy changes.  They recognize the need for political entrepreneurs, people with the intellects and statures of U.S. Sens. like <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/senator/bond.html">Kit Bond</A> or <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~bradley/">Bill Bradley</A>.  Such leaders can encourage opportunities for harmonizing our environmental and economic goals.  They would find great support from the many Americans who value environmental quality, responsible liberty, and modest prosperity.</P>

<H1>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>

<P>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>

<P>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.
</P>

<P>
Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>

<P>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>

<P>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle.  
</P>

<P>
Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P>

<P>
A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>

<P>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.
</P>

<P>
If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.
</P>

<H1>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P>
<P>
A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P>
Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.  
</P>
<P>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.  
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P>
Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P>

<H1>Environmentalism Needs A Free Press</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The First Amendment of the Constitution safeguards that most essential feature of democracy: the liberty to communicate ideas and advocate alternatives to the status quo.  It protects freedom of the press, speech, assembly, and religion.  It guarantees our right to complain to and about the government.  
</P>
<P>
Environmental advocates use these freedoms to champion reform.  <A HREF="http://www.greenpeace.org/">Greenpeace </A> has taken the right to assemble to an artform in their protests and demonstrations.  The litigious <A HREF="http://www.nrdc.org/nrdc">Natural Resources Defense Council</A> and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund flourish with lawsuits against lethargic or misguided government agencies.  The paganism of <A HREF="http://envirolink.org/orgs/ef/">Earth First!</A> depends on freedom of religious expression.  Vibrant environmentalism requires free press and free speech.
</P>
<P>
But environmental advocacy prompts censorship by government agencies and private interests.  On the "left coast" this fall, two Eugene <CITE>Register-Guard</CITE> employees were arrested and their notebook, comeras, and film confiscated after the <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/">US Forest Service</A> closed the Warner Creek salvage timber sale site amid vocal protests by environmentalists.  According to managing editor Jim Godbold, "We think the issues raised by the arrest and confiscation of our material at Warner Creek are serious enough injuries to the First Amendment that they deserve to be heard in a federal courtroom."
</P>

<P>
The Forest Service is notoriously heavy-handed with its censorship, manipulation, and denial of information.  USFS forester Jeff DeBonis created <A HREF="http://www.afseee.org/">AFSEEE</A> (The Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics) in response to repeated Forest Service suppression of information.
</P>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service</A> likewise censors and impedes outside investigations.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> recounts obstruction, inexplicable omissions, and other chicanery on the part of the Park Service.  It took a court order to force the Yellowstone Institute, an "independent" organization chaired by the then-president of <A HREF="http://www.montana.edu/">Montana State University</A>, to add this challenging book to the visitor centers' publications.  Those advantaged by the status quo colluded to hide it.
</P>

<P>
Honest assessments are difficult to come by because, as Chase says, "The usual fate of whistleblowers kept many officials silent, and the threat of losing their prerogative to study in Yellowstone frequently inhibited university scholars."  That's exactly what happened to Professors John and Frank Craighead.  Before their highly critical research could be completed, the world's grizzly experts' Yellowstone cabin, with all their data, mysteriously burned down.
</P>

<P>
The need to protect whistleblowers is not limited to public lands agencies.  In June of 1996 the Supreme Court ruled, in a case involving landfill user fees, that independent government contractors, like government employees, are "protected under the First Amendment from retaliatory action" for failing to follow the agency's "party line".  According to Justice O'Conner, "[The threat of retaliation against contractors] may chill speech on matters of public concern by those who, because of their dealings with the government, are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work."  Threats to environmental whistleblowers are widespread.
</P>

<P>
Take the case of Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu/">Washington State University</A>.  After he testified against expanding the subsidies of the Columbia Basin Project, State Senator Tub Hansen reportedly met with the dean of the School of Agriculture to have Whittlesey's tenured position eliminated.  When that failed, Hansen then tried to make Whittlesey's salary as a line item in the state budget so it could be eliminated in committee.  Speaking truth to power is hazardous duty.
</P>

<P>
In popular press, we can also see political interests shackling free speech.  <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A> environmental reporter Keith Schneider was among the most prominent writers to be removed from his post for honest reporting.  He bucked the envrionmentalist orthodoxy by writing about trade-offs to environmental regulations and cleanup, and quickly found himself out of work.
</P>

<P>
And then there is Gregg Easterbrook, author of <CITE>A Moment on the Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism</CITE>.  He notes that his personal popularity plummetted after publishing the book:  "My book was blistered by enviro lobbies....  Wham!  I had hit the Al Gore glass ceiling."
</P>

<P>
Another "green-listed" author was Tom Wicker, a <CITE>New York Times</CITE> columnist.  Last February, John Flicker, head of the <A HREF="http://www.audubon.org/audubon/">National Audubon Society</A>, demanded that Wicker's article be pulled from the Society's <CITE> Audubon</CITE> magazine because it criticized the Clinton Administration.
</P>

<P>
Protecting First Amendment rights empowers environmental reform.  When federal agencies control information, abuses of authority often follow.  Environmental orthodoxy and bureaucratic expediency often trump honest and free reporting.  
</P>

<P>
If the environmental movement is to motivate innovative and scientifically sound reform, we must encourage dissenters to speak and be vigilant in keeping government agencies from controlling information.  
</P>

<P>
The alternative is to quietly slip towards an Orwellian nightmare with government as the "Ministry of Truth".  Too melodramatic?  Take a look the California EPA's recent "record retention policy":
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>Please dispose of all documents... [electronic mail] messages and other communications prepared during the course of policy formulation which contain other policy proposals not adopted or reflected in the final decision.</CODE>

<H1>A Green Campaign Speech for a Better Environment</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>
<P>
Some day, a politician will offer reforms harmonizing environmental quality with responsible liberty and modest prosperity. This niche in our political ecology is vacant. Incentives to fill it have been weak.
</P>
<P>
This, however, is rapidly changing. Republican representative Sherwood Boehlert of NY said, "There were some valuable lessons learned by some who ignored environmental policy at their own peril." Celinda Lake, a Democrat pollster, explained in the past election, "the environment played a very important role". The incumbents who were defeated came from suburban and upscale districts. She notes: "The environment played a very heavy role in those districts."
</P>
<P>
But the candidates haven't yet caught up to the electorate. Democrats prefer "Nanny State" solutions to community conservation. Al Gore's learning curve for effective, efficient, and equitable environmental policy seems as flat as a pre-Galileo Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, despite their 1994 "revolution", favor the exploiters and extractors. Dole was linked to ethanol-subsidy addict Archer Daniels Midland. Congress members including Helen Chenoweth and Tom DeLay bulldozed their favored corporate interests over environmental values. And Jack Kemp couldn't even pronounce the E.P.A.
</P>
<P>
Both parties are beholden to entrenched special interests. It seems elephants can't forget to plunder, and asses can't learn new ways.
</P>
<P>
Ross Perot's Reform Party doesn't even mention the environment. The upstart "Green Party" even with Ralph Nader, America's most famous professional agitator, won only 2.4% of California's vote. And <A HREF="http://www.lp.org/">Libertarian Party</A> candidate Harry Browne did great on Internet polls, with a landslide in Cyber-America. But, like Perot, Browne's platform ignored environmental topics.
</P>
<P>
Here is a green campaign speech, available to all candidates. It's provided to candidates from all parties. Longer versions are available in FREE's "Green Blueprint for America," and a shorter version is found in "The Candidate's Guide to Environmental Issues" by Joe Bast of the <A HREF="http://www.heartland.org/">Heartland Institute</A>.

	<TD><P>
"I believe in protecting the environment. I believe in conservation and preservation, in parks and wilderness, in using, enjoying, and stewarding our natural environment. We all have a duty to make this world a safer and cleaner place.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our progress in improving the environment. Since the first Earth Day, air is cleaner, water is cleaner, and many animals are rebounding. Lead emissions have virtually disappeared and water quality, especially in the Great Lakes, has greatly improved. The bald eagle and peregrine falcon have made dramatic recoveries.
</P>

<P>
"We can do better still. Problems of disappearing habitat, ineffective regulations, and new pollution require innovative policy tools. The easy solutions have already been implemented. Next, we must address insensitive and inefficient public lands management, unnecessarily high regulatory costs, and unintended consequences of environemental mandates. We need a new environmentalism for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"My environmental vision sees a safer and cleaner world. Its foundation is sound science rather than hysteria. Citizens are demanding policies that deliver the biggest "bang for the buck." Policies that fail to respect people's liberty and property will fail. We must, however, recognize that, at times, rights conflict. Is my clean air worth your job? My cheap power, your salmon? We can't avoid such trade-offs. Here are seven principles that will help us wisely and fairly achieve a better environment.
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
"<B>1. Demand sound science:</B><DD> Too often, crisis entrepreneurs create hysteria in order to drive their policies and increase their own budgets. Peer-reviewed science is critical to reform.
<DT>
"<B>2. Prioritize risks:</B> <DD>Our resources are limited, so we must get the most for our money. Cost-benefits analysis can help prioritize risk and first address the greatest risk to our health and to our environment. We want the most environmental benefit for the least cost.
<DT>"<B>3. Decentralize decision-making:</B> <DD>Command-and-control, one-size-fits-all, centralized planning falsely assumes that all communities are identical. This approach stifles creativity and wastes scarce resources. Distant bureaucrats can't manage local environments with sensitivity or efficiency. Letting locals make decisions encourages innovation, learning, and responsibility. But locals must recognize regional and national interests.
<DT>"<B>4. Carefully privatize some public assets:</B> <DD>Commodities should be produced by private interests who anticipate and respond to market signals. Amenitites should be preserved and made available by public trusts. The federal government should monitor and conduct research, not manage and redistribute to the well-organized. Bureaucracies tend to foster waste, corruption, and short-term political calculus.
<DT>"<B>5. Respect property rights:</B> <DD>The Constitution requires due compensation when government takes or restricts private owners' property. When government is used as an engine of plunder, the plundered usually react. Unjust environmental policies build enemies of those whose cooperation is vital, like farmers, ranchers, and forest owners.
<DT>"<B>6. Hold polluters accountable:</B> <DD>Courts can and should hold polluters responsible for the damage they cause. Let them scramble to find appropriate technology.
<DT>"<B>7. Promote prosperity:</B> <DD>Demand for environmental quality is like that for BMWs, foreign travel, and gourmet food; it increases with education and income.
</DL></P>
<P>"The American public is committed to environmental quality. We've made much progress in that direction. To do more, we need to promote prosperity, secure property rights, and responsible freedom. These are values worthy of America's heritage and a bridge to a greener future. Thank you for your vote next Tuesday."

This special issue of FREE Perspectives is focused on "managing the commons."  
<BR>This anticipates FREE's upcoming book of the same name, published 
<BR>by Indiana University Press.  Co-contributing editors John A. Baden and 
<BR>Douglas S. Noonan bring the classic literature on the "tragedy of the commons" <BR>together with recent insights to the theory and practice of managing the commons.  <BR>The book builds upon the twenty years of scholarship that has evolved since <BR>Garrett Hardin and John Baden originally produced Managing the Commons in 1977.  
<BR>Look for the second edition of Managing the Commons in 1997.</B></I>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT"  Vspace= 8 HSPACE=12 WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=151 ALT="John Baden" SRC= "/free/Images/John.gif"> The <I>Tragedy of the Commons</I>  is probably the world's best-known commentary on the political economy of natural resources.  
<BR>Garrett Hardin, its author, linked ecology and economics, our environment and our institutions.  The key insight is straightforward and profound:  tragedy strikes the commons when self interest andsocial interest diverge.  For example, without social constraints, a strictly self-interested rancher would overgraze his cows on the commons at the expense of the community.  A 
fundamental problem of social organization is to design effective, efficient, 
and resistent constraints.  It's a never-ending task.
<P>
The logic of the commons is evident throughout the world.  Ocean fisheries, 
national parks, and ground water are examples of commons.  Overexploited 
fisheries exemplify this tragedy of the commons.  Similarly, congestion in 
national parks arises from individuals taking advantage of unmanaged 
(and underpriced) access, even when the optimal number of visitors is 
much lower.  Highway rush hours also display classic symptoms of the 
commons tragedy.
<P>
Recent discussions have turned to more esoteric examples of commons.  
Computer processing capacity may be a commons for network users.  Users 
will demand processor energy because the cost to them is negligible, but 
too many individual requests will overload the system.  The national 
budget is a commons of sorts, where individual interest groups vie for 
greater benefits, even if it's over-allocated and we are running a deficit.  
Opportunistic politicians view government as an engine of plunder.  They 
see elections as struggles for the levers that control the flow.
<P>
Managing the commons is a persistent and pervasive challenge because: 
(1) implementing long-enduring management institutions is difficult, and 
(2) continual innovation leads appropriators to new common-resource 
pools.  Innovative technologies and entrepreurial ingenuity create new 
resources and make previously marginal ones profitable.  In avert to the 
tragedy, management institutions must evolve around the newborn 
resources.
<P>
One particularly complex, abstract, and problematic commons involves 
biological-evolutionary resources.  Consider the human capacity to resist 
disease.  Mankind's increasing resistance to environmental pathogens is a 
very valuable resource to society as a whole.  For instance, as a gene pool 
evolves a resistance to smallpox, its members benefit immensely.  The 
biological process of developing resistance, however, necessarily remains 
at least one step behind the pathogen.  The resistance is reactive.  This 
means that individuals are frequently adversely affected by the 
beginnings of epidemics before resistances are developed.  When 
individuals become infected by a life-threatening pathogen, their rational 
alternative is medical technology.  Today we seek "magic bullets" in the 
form of antibiotics.  
<P>
But this individual benefit imposes social costs.  The use of some antibiotics 
and anti-malarial drugs cause pathogens to evolve in a very short period 
of time.   The pathogens respond with ever-greater resistance; their 
version of armor.  Eventually, they can pose a growing threat.  Our 
resistances and drugs are considerably less effective against the "super-
pathogens".  Like ranchers putting too many cows out to pasture, the 
common "resistance" of society is degraded as some individuals benefit.
<P>
Another example of the "biological-evolutionary resource" commons 
relates to agricultural pesticides.  Spraying DDT in small quantities once 
had remarkable success.  Insects, however, have notoriously short 
reproductive cycles.  This allows micro-evolution to quickly reduce the 
usefulness of DDT and other pesticides.  Thus, in a very, very short period 
of time, increasing dosages were required to achieve constant results.
<P>
The pesticide-resistant bugs reflect a commons logic.  Any farmer can 
benefit in the short term from spraying.  But pesticides eventually create 
super-pests.  This divergence in interests, between the individual and 
society, is the key to the tragedy of the commons.
<P>
Bio-engineering increasingly poses another example of a new commons.  
Genetically altered crops like corn and cotton have been bred with 
resistance to pests, a resistance that could save farmers billions of dollars 
in crop losses each year.  But bio-engineered crops, like pesticides, may 
hasten the evolution of super-pests.  The emerging science of "resistance 
management" aims to optimize yield from these crops by diluting super-
pests with "unresistant" pests and other techniques.  It remains to be seen 
if the science of behavioral ecology and the restraint of farmers are 
sufficient to avert another potential tragedy.
<P>
The biological-evolutionary weakness of mankind's predators is a tricky 
common-pool resource.  Biological dynamics imply that the attributes of 
mankind's biotic enemies always change while our technology always lags.  
Often, the benefits of self-restraint, of not using high doses of antibiotics or 
pesticides, would be gained by future generations.  It is naturally very 
difficult to design institutions that value the varied and unknowable 
interests of the distant future.
<P>
This issue of <CITE>FREE Perspectives</CITE> introduces classic and new problems of 
"managing the commons". First, <A HREF="/free/FP/TragedyCommons.html">Hardin</A> and <A HREF="/free/FP/EconomicsEcologyExchange.html">Robert Taylor</A> each introduce 
the nature of the commons.  Following that are thoughts from the <A HREF="/free/FP/ViewfromAirlie.html"><CITE>View 
from Airlie</CITE></A>, a ground-breaking examination of <A HREF="/free/FP/ConservationPerformance.html">community-based 
conservation</A>.  They discuss the relationship between the community and 
public-owned resources.  <A HREF="/free/FP/NationalisationofLand.html">Matt Ridley</A> also examines the importance of 
secure property rights and the pathologies of state-encroachment on 
property.  Lastly, <A HREF="/free/FP/CostsofInnovation.html">Douglas Noonan</A> explores the role of entrepreneurs as both a 
trigger of and a solution to the "tragedy of the commons" in fisheries.  In sum, these essays clarify the dangers of the unmanaged commons and offer insight into some possible solutions. <center><img WIDTH=231 HEIGHT=163 src="Cows.gif"></center>

<H1>Wolf and Man in Montana</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden

<p>
<P><CODE>DATELINE:  ENTERPRISE RANCH, GALLATIN VALLEY, MONTANA</CODE></P>

<P>Our ranch lies in the northern reaches of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.  Calving has started, lambing will shortly follow, and soon we'll put the livestock out to range.  And wolves have just arrived in Yellowstone Park.</P>

<P>In Montana, and in Idaho as well, few issues are more complex and emotional than those concerning wolves.  For three generations people vilified, mythologized, and killed wolves.  More recently, many environmentalists, myself included, have sought to restore this ancient predator to Yellowstone Park and wilderness areas.  Returning the wolf replaces an important part of the ecological tapestry that humanity has unwoven.  But, given people's divergent values, it is not surprising that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) recent reintroduction of the gray wolf has fostered great fears and extravagant hopes.  </P>

<P>The controversy surrounding reintroduction is demonstrated by the 170,000 public comments received on the project's Environmental Impact Statement.  Lawsuits opposing reintroduction have been filed by the Mountain States Legal Foundation and the American Farm Bureau Federation.  They indicate significant rural resistance despite widespread public support. </P>

<P>But wolves are already returning to Montana.  Seventy five arrived naturally, migrating from the Canadian Rockies.  Like glaciers of the last ice age, they are slowly expanding southward.  They are drawn by the dramatic increases in ungulate populations, primarily elk and deer, created by clear-cutting in public and private forests.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service's decade-long effort to reintroduce 100 wolves into the Greater Yellowstone area and central Idaho (which contains the largest unroaded wilderness in the lower 48 states) accelerates a process well underway.  </P>

<P>Wildlife biologists consider wolves one of the easiest species to manage.  Established wolf packs stay in well defined and fiercely guarded territories.  Thus they have low population densities and are easily located.  Wolves are also afraid of new things and tend to avoid them.  And if there is any doubt about who holds the upper hand in human-wolf coexistence, we might remember that wolves, once one of the most broadly distributed large mammals in North America, have been exterminated wherever they competed with man.  A decade ago, only remnant populations existed in wilderness areas or at the sufferance of humanity.  </P>

<P>With careful management, humans and wolves can coexist.  Even with 75 wolves in northwestern Montana, only two cow calves were killed last year.  None were killed in 1993.  Like members of religious groups, wolves learn what is appropriate to eat.  At Nine Mile Ranch near Missoula, wolves live with livestock and deer.  The trick is to keep them from learning to eat livestock.  At Nine Mile, radio collars allow researchers to monitor the animals' locations.  If a wolf kills livestock its punishment is swift and harsh:  It is shot with a tranquilizer gun and transported far away.  The trauma usually dissuades the wolf from future livestock predation.  Second offenses are punished by death, lest a problem animal teach others the joys of beefsteak and lamb chops. </P>

<P>The trials of Nine Mile Ranch hold another important lesson:  Coexistence requires experience, intensive management, and ongoing effort.  Reintroducing wolves is not a magical, effortless restoration of fairy tale ecosystems.  Yes, wolves will restore some balance to an ecosystem burdened by destructive numbers of deer, elk, and buffalo.  Without predators and Indian hunting, these animals are over browsing the land and eroding its beauty, diversity and health.  Nevertheless, wolves bring difficulties of their own.  </P>

<P>In spite of biologists' confidence in their ability to manage wolves and environmentalists' enthusiasm, ranchers and residents in the reintroduction areas have legitimate fears.  Wolves pose both a practical and a symbolic threat.  They do attack livestock and pets.  They also represent a shift in control of Western lands orchestrated from Washington, DC.  In short, people fear that the costs of this exercise in nostalgic ecotopianism are unfairly concentrated on their families, their stock, and their land values.   </P>

<P>Nor are their fears groundless.  On January 30, a few days after the release of the first 25 wolves, a dead wolf and a dead calf appeared.  The wolf was shot after eating the calf.  But this was no surprise, the Fish and Wildlife Service's environmental impact statement predicted wolves will kill several dozen cows and sheep each year, and several hundred elk and deer.</P>

<P>To address some of these concerns, Defenders of Wildlife, a national environmental group, has created a fund to compensate ranchers whose stock is killed by wolves.  But these funds are neither limitless nor eternal.  They do not cover lost pets, reduced opportunities for hunting, or the hurt associated with losing an animal to the brutal rending of a wolf pack.  To minimize these effects, ranchers should be free to shoot problem wolves and otherwise deter them from developing a taste for cattle and sheep. </P>

<P>Restoring wolves is a worthy project that reflects well on our evolving sensitivity to nature.  We are now wealthy and educated enough to afford such magnanimity.  But it will be hard.  Pretending these problems away is irresponsible.  It is also poor environmental policy to ignore ecological realities.</P>

<H2>Resource Politics Miss the Forest for the Trees</H2>

<P>As appearing in <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com"><CITE>The Wall Street Journal</CITE></A></P>

<P>By John Baden and Pete Geddes</P>

<P>BOZEMAN, MONT.-  Snow is still ten feet deep on the Spanish Peaks just south of town, but summer is coming to the Gallatin Valley.  Greening fields and the sudden emergence of kayaks and mountain bikes tells us the annual crush of tourists will soon arrive in the region's national parks and forests. </P>

<P>Recreation is serious business in Montana. Locals aren't pleased with the U.S. Forest Service's latest proposal to sell timber in Bozeman's backyard.  The Forest Service plans to sell 4.7 million board feet of timber from the Gallatin National Forest, which borders Yellowstone National Park.  If the sale goes forward, approximately 1,175 18-wheelers full of dead trees will roll down Hyalite Canyon, one of the most heavily used recreation areas in the state. </P>

<P>The Forest Service first tried to offer this sale in 1990.  Planning proceeded until a 1995 judicial injunction stopped it.  But the Forest Service offered the sale again under a legal provision called the Salvage Rider, an amendment to the 1996 budget designed to speed the harvest of dead trees.  The Salvage Rider insulates sales like this one from citizen appeals and mandates the Forest Service offer almost 5 billion board feet of &quot;salvage&quot; timber this year.</P>

<P>The Hyalite sale exemplifies how Congress misses opportunities to harmonize sound economics with ecological values.  Freshman Republicans, who claim to favor markets over bureaucracies, instead require command-and-control agencies to mandate flows of commodities.  The laws treat Forest Service officials as if they are commissars of a socialized factory producing trees.  And Democrats offer nothing more constructive than the standard orthodoxy of &quot;improved&quot; regulation and oversight.</P>

<P>The Gallatin National Forest is one of the nation's premier recreation areas.  The Hyalite sale faces massive local opposition over aesthetic, economic and ecological concerns. As in typical, this sale will cost taxpayers far more than the timber is worth; even the agency's creative accounting describes the sale's profitability as &quot;marginal.&quot;</P>

<P>Increasingly, the highest economic use of national forests lies in recreation rather than commodity production.  In the Gallatin National Forest according forest economist Randal O'Toole, of the Oregon-based <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~rot">Thoreau Institute</A>, it costs taxpayers $50,000 per year to maintain a single timber-related job.  Mr O'Toole found that the recreation industry directly employed 1,200 people; timber jobs only 50.  By requiring the Forest Service to sell goods at far below their true costs, Congress undermines the region's natural transition from a commodity-based to service- and information-based economy.  What's more, government &quot;dumping&quot; of cheap timber makes the market unpredictable for private-sector commodity suppliers, reducing their incentive to manage land responsibly.</P>

<P>Such policies represent the last gasps of Progressive Era resource management identified with Teddy Roosevelt.  His well intentioned but naive idea that benevolent centralized bureaucracies would protect the nation's natural resources and provide a measure of economic stability has proved a failure.  </P>

<P>In 1905 Roosevelt's boxing buddy, Gifford Pinchot, created the Forest Service to protect vast tracts of Western lands.  The agency developed the image as a tough white-hat in a still untamed region.  Pinchot promised efficient, responsive and scientific management; the agency still poses as the model of bureaucratic efficiency.  But over the next 90 years the Forest Service mutated from a small, idealistic bureau of scientific managers into a growth-addicted agency intent on protecting and perpetuating its own budget and power.  Well intentioned and hardworking professionals are caught in a pressure cooker of conflicting values: central planning, changing social values, strict environmental regulations, new ecological science and an increasingly amenity-based Western economy.</P>

<P>In today's West the irony of the Progressive legacy is starkly clear.  Remote bureaucrats, allied with subsidized production interests, establishh mandates both insensitive to local values and insulated from market processes.  The results devastate both communities and ecosystems.  Meanwhile, Western senators and representatives, addicted to subsidies,  perpetuate the myth that the region is a land of rugged individualists.</P>

<P>It's time for the Forest Service to abandon its role as a producer of commodities.  Instead, the agency should focus its considerable expertise on the protection of wilderness and wildlife and the promotion of recreation and research in national forests.  Commodity production is best left to the private sector.   Rethinking Progressive Era approaches to natural resource management challenges politicians of all stripes.  Successful reforms must encourage harmony between ecology, sound economics and responsible liberty. These intellectual foundations are well established.  The politician who builds on them will earn the mantle of conservationist, in the best tradition of TR.  </P>

<H1>Lessons in a Supermarket</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden and Ramona Marotz-Baden

<p>
     Bozeman, Montana, a town with 30,000 people, contains a
modest supermarket that offers valuable lessons.  This store has
tens of thousands of items of various sizes and brands, generic
labels, and bulk products.  Competition for the consumer's dollar
occurs among this and other stores, brands within the store, and
different products within individual brands.

<p>
     Among the stores in Bozeman, as elsewhere, the shopkeepers
compete in offering differing mixes of service and economy.  Each
grocer seeks to attract and satisfy consumers holding varying
degrees of wealth, economic sophistication, nutritional
knowledge, and body-type preference associated with differing
food groups.

<p>
     Competition responds to differing consumer preferences for
health, economy, convenience, and vanity.  In these stores we see
people as diverse as ranchers who survived the dust bowls of the
1930s, refugees of the counter-culture of the 1960s who look like
they are in a time warp, Park City blondes from Dallas summering
at Big Sky, and neo-Spartan hedonists of all ages who bounce
among Montana's ski slopes, white-water rivers, and mountain
trails.  We find them all in Albertson's at the University Mall.

<p>
     Individuals representing all of these types shop cheek to
jowl, sample ice cream and fajita strips in the aisles, and
peacefully shuffle through the check-out lines at the supermarket
located between the Bonanza Steak House and Yogi's Vegetarian
Bakery.  Stores and suppliers who fail to satisfy are passed by
in favor of those who offer more attractive products.

<p>
     In this setting offered by a free and open market system,
each can satisfy his wants without imposing his preferences on
others.  In this manner, diversity, freedom of choice, and
innovations are all encouraged.  In this imperfect world, we can
hardly ask for anything more.  Yet, there is another huge
advantage we normally take entirely for granted.

<p>
     Surely the store in the mall provides a model for
efficiently responding to diverse and rapidly changing
preferences.  But this efficiency, marvelous though it is, is
only the minor miracle.  The benefits of harmonious interaction
fostered by market exchange in accordance with the rule of
willing consent is the greater benefit.

<p>
     Market exchange, subject to willing participation by fullfacultied 
individuals, permits people with radically differing
views to peacefully coexist.  In Bozeman there are a substantial
number of hard-core vegetarians.  They can shop peacefully and
amicably with rancher and logger meat-eaters who consume
vegetables only as a concession to their health.

<p>
     Bozeman is also a national center for teetotaling SeventhDay 
Adventists.  The supermarket accommodates their preference
for nonalcoholic wine, and they shop harmoniously with those
whose nightly ritual includes a bottle of French wine.  This
peaceful interaction occurs only because all transactions are
voluntary.  Imagine the uproar if the decisions to permit the
selling of wine were determined in the political arena!

<p>
     Nearly all analysts who have seriously studied the free
market agree that the market promotes efficiency, diversity, and
innovations which respond to consumers' changing preferences.
Few, however, appreciate the degree to which private property
rights and free exchange foster harmony and peace.  This set of
social arrangements renounces coercion as a means for making
choices.  These arrangements enable people who feel strongly
about such issues as vegetarianism or prohibition to coexist
constructively with people holding antithetical views.

<p>
     What if the stocking of a grocery store were determined
politically?  Think of the fights between vegetarians and meateaters; 
the teetotalers and those who enjoy wine with dinner; the
granola organics who argue against pesticides and the farmers who
find chemicals useful; the populists who are strongly opposed to
corporate agriculture and those with an interest in these firms;
employed mothers who want the stores open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, and fundamentalists who believe they should be
closed on Sunday.

<p>
     Fortunately, most of these decisions have been kept out of
the political arena.  People make decisions and exercise their
consciences instead of imposing their preferences by using the
force of law.  Peace, progress, and efficiency are the
predictable results of a free market economy.

<H1>Taking the Folly Out of the Act</H1>
<P>
by John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan
</P>

<P> 	Whether we're trying to save species or specie, decisions are based on information and incentives.  Regulations that generate poor incentives simply won't work.  Good intentions are not enough.</P>

<P>	Congress tried to protect endangered species via the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  Prior to 1973, landowners could freely use their land, even if endangered species habitat was harmed.  This was a problem.  Lawmakers saw prohibition of such activities as the answer.  It wasn't.  </P>

<P>	While well intentioned, the ESA produces many unintended and adverse consequences. The Act empowers the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control private lands harboring endangered species without compensation.  Even the Armed Forces during wartime cannot do this.  The Third Amendment of our Bill of Rights protects us from being forced to shelter soldiers by requiring the military to pay its way.  Landowners get compensated when Green Berets invade, but not when spotted owls do.</P>

<P>	Forcing landowners to maintain habitat has made endangered species the enemy of landowners.  Landowners fear the liability of owning endangered species habitat; its use may be restricted without any compensation.  Today's ESA encourages people to modify habitat.  Biologists consult with landowners to find ways to make their land inhospitable.  Ironically, the ESA's mandate to protect habitat often encourages landowners to repel endangered species.</P>

<P>	We have real and tragic examples across America.  Cone's Folly is an illustrative case.  In the 1930s Ben Cone, Sr. purchased 7,200 acres of land in North Carolina.  His friends called it &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; for it was deforested.  With careful sylvaculture by Ben Cone, Sr., and later Ben Cone, Jr., the &quot;folly&quot; became a well managed forest.  Fish, game, and non-game critters became abundant.  </P>

<P>	They actively managed for wildlife with frequent controlled burns and carefully managed small timber sales.  Their stands of rare long leaf pines were ideal for much wildlife.  Cone's stewardship attracted many songbirds, deer, quail, wild turkey, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.  </P>

<P>	In 1991, the ESA required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to halt Cone's management of the 1,560 acres of property inhabited by 29 of the rare woodpeckers.  Cone lost rights to cut and sell the timber on nearly two-and-half square miles of his land, drastically reducing its value.  He received no compensation and must still pay taxes for timberland unharvestable while woodpecker habitat.  The woodpeckers he once liked became a multi-million dollar liability.   </P>

<P>	Cone now clearcuts around the woodpecker haven.  This prevents them from infecting more of his property.  And neighboring landowners have rushed to do likewise before their land also becomes suitable for woodpeckers.  </P>

<P>	The chart shows how the Act dramatically changed Cone's harvesting practices after 1991.  Cone reduced the rotation of harvest from 80 years to 40 years, thereby eliminating the old stands that attract the woodpeckers.  </P>

<P> [see chart data as appearing in <CITE>Different Drummer</CITE>]</P>

<P>	The ESA has given the woodpeckers a temporary safe haven.  It will eventually rot or burn, the woodpeckers will move, and Cone will regain control.</P>

<P>	Ironically, the ESA has given &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; a whole new meaning.  Ben Cone's folly was to take such good care of the land that the ESA stripped much of the value from more than a fifth of his property.</P>

<P>	&quot;Cone's Folly&quot; is one of the many cases demonstrating the importance of incentives to habitat protection.  &quot;Takings&quot; produce predictable but unintended consequences.  When landowners who harbor endangered species face stiff penalties for doing so, they minimize suitable habitat.  Those of us who care about endangered species want landowners to favor the creatures and eagerly provide habitat.  Can this be achieved by government coercion and &quot;takings&quot;?  At what cost?  Are there better ways?</P>

<P>	Compensating landowners for the costs of maintaining suitable habitats for species like the red-cockaded woodpecker and spotted owl removes some costs of doing so.  If regulations are stable and agencies forced to face the costs of their actions they will seek more efficient protection.  </P>

<P>	Tax breaks for habitat motivates landowners to provide it.  And many species already have interest groups advocating their protection.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the North American Wild Sheep Foundation protect two formerly threatened species.  Furthermore, information would improve as wildlife biologists would find entrepreneurial niches consulting landowners on how to create, rather than avoid, suitable habitat.  </P>

<P>	Landowners, like the habitat they own, are diverse.  There are huge untapped opportunities for improving and protecting habitat.  We might not expect ranchers to welcome wolves or timber companies to embrace beavers.  But beavers don't eat livestock, and wolves don't eat trees.  Plum Creek Timber Co. agreed and found dens for wolves.  As a reward, the Defenders of Wildlife paid them a cash bounty.  Defenders of Wildlife benefits when wolves find dens, the wolves most certainly benefit, and Plum Creek benefits from publicity and cash awards.  </P>

<P>	With positive incentives we can harmonize prosperity and environmental diversity.  This must be the foundation of any successful reform of the ESA.  Otherwise we risk more counterproductive policies which condemn both landowners and rare species. </P>

<H2>Al Gore's Newest Horror Story</H2>

<P>As appearing in <CITE>The American Enterprise</CITE>, July/August issue.</P>

<P>By John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan</P>



<P><CITE><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> </CITE>  portrays a frightening world where synthetic chemicals assault our fertility, intelligence, and survival.  But instead of delivering substance, it capitalizes on hype.  It hit bookstores just in time for Earth Day and on the heels of the National Academy of Sciences' investigation of synthetic estrogens.  Thanks to the big behind-the-scenes boost given to the book by Fenton Communications-the same PR firm that ginned up the 1989 Alar-on-apples scare-the book received coverage in nearly all national media, and backing from hip cultural figures like Robert Redford.  </P>

<P>The book's message is dramatic, urgent, and personal:  In a terrible &quot;Faustian bargain,&quot; we have bought technological progress at the price of the environment, the well-being of our children, and perhaps even our survival.  Touted as a &quot;scientific detective story,&quot; the book combines suspenseful narrative and apocalyptic overtones into a real page-turner.  Ambiguous prophecies of &quot;fates worse than extinction,&quot; of terrible forces that are &quot;slow, invisible, and indirect,&quot; are bandied about darkly.</P>

<P>The villains are chemical manufacturers and profiteering corporations.  Synthetic chemicals, the authors say, are disrupting human hormones and causing widespread developmental abnormalities.  The authors suggest that synthetic chemicals could potentially be responsible for nearly every prominent social ill.  Poverty, educational breakdown, crime, homosecuality, deteriorating family life-these may all be the fault of corporations like DuPont and Dow Corning.</P>

<P>Actually, hormones disruptors are poorly understood, and there is no conclusive evidence linking developmental problems and environmental chemicals.  The science behind <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>  is also unorthodox.  It indicts causality and other basic tools of the scientific method that have been used to challenge envirnomental claims.  Indeed, it rejects the scientific method itself as Enlightenment arrogance.  That kind of thinking, the book argues, is what got us into this mess in the first place.  A new wave of thinking, &quot;eco-epidemiology,&quot; is now required.</P>

<P>This brings to mind the debate over global warming.  Problems in human reproduction and development, like climate change, can only be reliably observed over long periods of time.  Links between plastic lining in beer cans and illiteracy are about as tenuous as links between chlorofluorocarbons and the 1996 blizzard in New England.  But the authors are very clever.  They display short-term tragedies and augur long-term catastrophes.  So none of their claims can be disproved in the near future.  </P>

<P>The marketing appeal of the synthetic chemical scare far surpasses that of global warming alarmists.  It is racy and anecdotal:  Synthetic chemicals affect our sexuality; they are so prevalent no one can escape them.  Painful, personal experiences pile up.  One couple's dreams of a family are ruined by DES, another sees their children's future spoiled by DDT, a third is rendered infertile by declining sperm counts.  Al Gore, who wrote the introduction for this book, invokes children three times.</P>

<P>Fortunately, <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>  will not become the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  Reputable responders trash the book for all manner of scientific and logical flaws.  And after repeated wolf-calling, the public has become more jaded and cynical about predictions of ecological catastrophe. </P>

<H2>Flying Blind or Running Scared?</H2>

<P>As appearing in <A HREF="http://www.LibertySoft.com/liberty"><CITE>Liberty Magazine</CITE></A></P>

<P>By John A. Baden and Douglas S. Noonan</P>

<P>	In its foreward, Vice President Al Gore announces that <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> &quot;raises compelling and urgent questions that must be answered.&quot;  The book has been promoted as the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>, Rachel Carson's 1962 book that spawned much of the environmental movement.  More likely, it marks the end of an era of gullibility, hysteria, and crisis entrepreneurship.  Unlike Al Gore, intellectually honest environmentalists demand factual and logically consistent foundations for reform.  Hype and rhetoric are becoming pass&eacute;.</P>

<P>	The book was written by Theo Colborn, John Peterson Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski, two zoologists and a journalist.  Their &quot;scientific detective story&quot; - provocatively subtitled &quot;Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, And Survival?&quot; - alleges that synthetic chemicals (found in PVC pipes, Tupperware, Tide, etc.) disrupt hormones.  These hormonal disruptors are responsible for all manner of ecological, psychological, and social ills, they claim, ranging from domestic violence to &quot;lesbian&quot; seagulls.  The cure?  Ban them.</P>

<P>	The book's timing was perfect.  The National Academy of Sciences had just convened to discuss hormone disruptors.  It arrived on bookshelves just in time for April 22, Earth Day - and just as Congress was being taken to task over environmental issues.  It had a sexy title, a fetus on the cover, and a dramatic detective story inside.  It was, and is, a PR masterpiece.</P>

<P>	Yet it's flopping.  It has been thoroughly trashed by the <A HREF="http://www.nyt.com">New York Times</A>, <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</A>, <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com">Los Angeles Times</A>, Washington Post, and Washington Times for all manner of flaws, including panic-mongering, junk science, and poor writing.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> falls into a trap common to conventional environmentalism:  it ignores trade-offs.  Abandoning the 100,000-plus chemicals that play a role in the 45% of the world's economic activity would be extraordinarily costly.  The authors demand &quot;eliminating the use and release of hazardous compounds,&quot; setting standards to protect those most vulnerable, reducing the numbers of chemicals on the market and in given products, using only easily detectable and well-understood chemicals, and phasing out synthetic chemical manufacture.  Such &quot;broad government action&quot; doesn't come cheap.  Mandatory monitoring and disclosure laws for chemical manufacturers, water companies, grocers, and distributors will ultimately impose sizable costs on consumers.</P>

<P>	Implementing <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>'s recommendations would close off many valuable opportunities.  Immense benefits to food production and delivery systems would be lost.  The benefits of plastics, medical drugs, and synthetics would cease to be available.  According to Dr. Lorenz Rhomberg of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, &quot;a crash program of [hormone disruptor] control and cleanup will divert precious resources from other pressing environmental problems.  This could divert regulatory and research attention away from other, true causes of breast cancer, birth defects, and wildlife toxicity.&quot;  These lost opportunitites would be costly indeed.</P>

<P>	Costs alone do not invalidate a policy option, of course.  The costs and benefits of any policy must be acknowledged and reconciled.  We know that reckless proliferation of synthetic chemicals may bring reproductive ruin to affected wildlife.  Conversely, a ban may bring unbearable costs to economies and ecosystems worldwide.  Competing interests must be reconciled.  But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> fails to do this.</P>

<P>	Except once.  The authors do make an exception to their absolutist position when they acknowledge that breast-feeding is a primary source of contamination.  Breast-feeding &quot;exposes infants to disturbing levels of chemical contaminants ... levels ten to forty times greater than the daily exposure of an adult.&quot;  </P>

<P>	So the prime culprit in &quot;stealing our future&quot; is the sacred practice of breast-feeding.  It is easy, trendy, and politically correct to recommend organically growing one's own foods, avoiding animal fats, and giving babies unpainted toys.  It is not acceptable to bash breast-feeding.  In a rare instance of prudence, the authors write, &quot;We know too little to judge how the undeniable benefits of breast-feeding balance against the risks of transferring hormonally active contaminants.  While we have great concern, it is premature to advise women against breast-feeding.&quot;  The authors would do well to consider trade-offs in all their recommendations.</P>

<H3>Pseudoscience and Pseudo-Rights</H3>

<P>	Sifting through the morass of conjecture, innuendo, and propaganda in <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is nearly impossible.  Its backwards methodologies and hysterical biases betray what might be valuable evidence.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> rejects classic ideals of scientific proof for failing to address the alleged hormonal threat.  Out with hypothesizing explanations for observations; in with &quot;eco-epidemiology.&quot; The weight of the evidence now depends on &quot;value judgments&quot; such as &quot;how much risk we are willing to entertain.&quot;  Of course, value judgments can't be disproven.  They are sovereign decrees, not testable hypotheses.</P>

<P>	Colborn, a leader in &quot;eco-epidemiology,&quot; tells us that chemicals, unlike people, must be judged guilty until proven innocent.  Basic logic dictates that one cannot prove a negative.  Unicorns may well frolic in the forest.  We cannot disprove that possibility, because someone can always claim we haven't looked hard enough.  Conversely, we could readily prove it if we saw them.</P>

<P>	Similarly, a presumption of chemical guilt places the burden of proof on chemical manufacturers, even though proving that their chemicals don't disrupt hormones is logically and technically impossible.  One could always claim that the manufacturer hasn't looked hard enough.  No harm to the first generation doesn't prove no harm to the second, or third, or tenth.  The infinite combination of varying chemicals, circumstances, and levels of susceptibility render the task absurd.</P>

<P>	Colborn, Dumanoski, and Myers also offer a declaration of inviolable rights, starting with &quot;children have a right to be born chemical-free.&quot;  This epitomizes the book's irresponsible and naive rhetoric.  They authors do not identify who has the responsibility for guaranteeing those rights.  The judicial system is responsible for ensuring a right to due process.  Who can have responsibility for &quot;chemical-free births?&quot;</P>

<P>	To be born free from synthetic chemicals, the authors tell us, requires that mothers are themselves free from chemicals.  This requires &quot;that women minimize the consumption of animal fat from birth until the end of their childbearing years.&quot;  They must also avoid exposure to plastics, pesticides, and detergents.  Little girls playing with painted or plastic toys as infants, the authors note, may be violating their future children's right to chemical-free nativity.  </P>

<P>	Obviously, this &quot;right&quot; is for bumper stickers, not serious analysis.</P>

<P>	Another unequivocal right advocated in <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is the &quot;right to know&quot;what chemicals are in one's food, water, and other consumer goods.  This is echoed by Al Gore, who writes, &quot;All of us have the right to know and the obligation to learn.&quot;  </P>

<P>	In practical terms, this &quot;right to know&quot; is an exceedingly expensive entitlement.  Its costs would first be brone by chemical manufacturers and distributors.  The costs would then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher price tags and burdensome instruction manuals detailing the biochemistry of lettuce and businesswear.</P>

<P>	The authors want us to pay for this right by imposing a duty on manufacturers and distributors, because they have deeper pockets.  In this, they neglect the superior power of market forces.  With proper incentives, competition - not mandated disclosure laws and high transaction costs - will drive the market to satisfy customer preferences.  If the consumers really want to know, they can purchase that knowledge like they purchase organic lettuce.  And lettuce producers will find ways to communicate that knowledge flexibly, effectively, and inexpensively via certification.  The market rewards those who please customers.</P>

<P>	To be fair, there is one useful prescriptive message of <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>: the admonition that we move beyond &quot;the cancer paradigm&quot;.  Too much research has been driven by the cancer scare of the 1970s, the War on Cancer, and hype over cancer rates.  In a way, our past experience with cancer helps explain why this book takes such a hysterical tone.  The politics of funding research pushes money toward trendy scares.  The mysterious role of natural and synthetic estrogens in the development of animals and humans does needs explaining, and a prudent, cautious, and scientific response to the important questions of <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> is definitely in order.  A &quot;War on Synthetic Chemicals&quot; is most definitely not - but the success of the War on Cancer, in attracting funding if not in curing cancer, speaks volumes about why Colborn and company might call for one.  </P>

<H3>Flying Blinded</H3>

<P>	Modern chemistry has brought benefits to society too numerous to list.  But this better living has had its costs.  </P>

<P>	DDT and CFCs prove that not all good things go together.   When DDT first arrived, Paul M&uuml;ller won the Nobel Prize for his seemingly miraculous chemical compound.  As Silent Spring and recent history have shown, DDT is not unambiguously wondrous.  It carries severe consequences for much wildlife and some humans.  Chlorofluorocarbons, similarly, were heralded as &quot;one of the safest substances ever invented.&quot;  Half a century passed before CFCs were blamed for imperiling life on this planet.</P>

<P>	So technological progress, while beneficial, is neither free nor without risks.  Colborn, Dumanoski, and Myers take this observation much farther.  They find civilization plunging arrogantly into the future with &quot;dangerous ignorance&quot; and risky &quot;hubris&quot;.  The risks and realities of progress have always existed, they admit, but the scale of mankind's impact now encompasses the entire Earth.  The stakes have become too high.  The risks and trade-offs of advancement are now intolerable.</P>

<P>	<CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> claims that we are, in essence, &quot;flying blind&quot; towards our destiny.  What do we do when we see a dark, nebulous shape ahead?  Will we race through it, hoping it is a cloud and not a mountainside?  Will we slow down?  Or will we &quot;land the plane as quickly as possible&quot;?  The technophobic authors embrace the last option.  Phase-outs, bans on new chemicals, and safer ways to &quot;meet basic human needs&quot; are &quot;the only way to opt out of the experiment.&quot;  </P>

<P>	We are flying blind to the future, and the authors want off the plane as soon as possible. They long for an idyllic past, when synthetic chemicals didn't exist and mankind only satisfied its basic needs.  But renouncing modernity and stifling progress will mean taking away most of the twentieth century's benefits.  It takes a much more convincing argument than <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> to cajole a full plane to land, just because someone with a window seat sees a cloud and feels some turbulence.  Responsible analysts and policy makers will advocate policies based on sound science and the broad interests of the citizenry, not the machinations of crisis entrepreneurs.</P>
