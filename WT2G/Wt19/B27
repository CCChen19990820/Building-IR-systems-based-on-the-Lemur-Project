<title>Two Cheers For the House Medicare Plan -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TWO CHEERS FOR THE HOUSE MEDICARE PLAN</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 428<br>
September 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The House Medicare reform plan represents a bold step toward the structural changes needed in the program. With some modifications, legislation based on this plan could create a new Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care.
<P>
	The House plan, like legislation recently sponsored in the Senate by Judd Gregg (R-NH), would take some modest steps to reform traditional Medicare while giving seniors the alternative of taking a specified amount of financial assistance and applying it to the purchase of a private plan. Under this alternative, the elderly would be in the driver's seat:  Plans would have compete to be chosen. If a plan did not give good service and value for money, seniors could switch to another during an annual open season.
<p>
	The House plan would set up a system somewhat like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The FEHBP covers over 9 million federal workers, including Members of Congress, as well as dependents and retirees. It allows enrollees, once a year, to choose from a wide range of health plans which contain a variety of benefits. These plans compete vigorously to be chosen by enrollees. Since the government pays a percentage of the premiums for FEHBP plans, enrollees save money by picking wisely; and they receive plenty of information from consumer groups, as well as employee and retiree groups, to help them do so. 
<p>
	 The House plan would allow the elderly to remain in traditional Medicare if they wish, but it would make important changes in this part of the program. First, it would maintain Part B premiums at 31.5 percent of total Part B costs, rather than allow them to fall under current law to 25 percent. Second, it would phase out the taxpayer subsidy of Part B premiums entirely for upper income seniors (over $75,000 for singles, $125,000 for couples). Third, it would permit the government to reward seniors who report waste, fraud, and abuse. And fourth, through a "lookback" provision, it would effectively put the traditional program on a fixed budget.
<p>
	<b>Reduced Subsidies.</b> These are welcome changes in the traditional Medicare program, but Congress should go further. Part B of Medicare, which covers principally physician services, is a heavily subsidized voluntary program unconnected to the Part A hospital program financed through payroll taxes. That subsidy should be cut even deeper than the House proposes. The typical enrollee should pay at least 50 percent of the program's cost (the level originally set in 1965), and the threshold for phasing out the subsidy entirely should be lower, perhaps $50,000 for singles and $100,000 for couples. Moreover, the plan would not raise the traditional program's deductibles, which have fallen sharply in real terms over the years. For Part B the deductible is just $100, which encourages excessive use of medical care. This deductible should be at least doubled.
<P>
	<b>Choices for Seniors.</b> The heart of the House plan, however, is a set of provisions that would give seniors the right to pick a private health plan, including a catastrophic plan with a medical savings account (MSA), with the government making a contribution to that plan based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors. This option, to be called Medicare Plus, would create a structure much like the FEHBP. Like federal retirees, seniors choosing this option would know that private plans had to meet certain conditions to be permitted to market to the elderly. These conditions would include solvency requirements and consumer protection standards. And these plans could not turn down sicker applicants during the annual open season when plans are selected.
<p>
	Still, some features of Medicare Plus do raise concerns. Examples: <P>

<b>Price Controls.</b> While the lookback provision would set a firm budget for the traditional program, the plan unfortunately would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the failed approach of price controls to try to keep within that budget. It would be better to combine payment changes with increases in deductibles and copayments.
<P>
<b>Standardized Benefits.</b> One requirement on private plans is that they must offer a benefit package at least equal to that of the traditional Medicare program. But this means that a senior normally would face higher costs if he wanted a plan with some benefits not now in Medicare, such as a drug benefit, because he could not substitute that new benefit for an existing one of less value to him. Under the FEHBP, federal workers and retirees have a range of alternative benefits beyond a very small core of required benefits. In restructuring Medicare, Congress should adopt a similar approach. Plans under Medicare Plus not only should be required to contain a small core of benefits (including catastrophic protection not now in the Medicare package), but also should be permitted to offer a wide range of optional additional benefits. This would allow the elderly to pick the packages that are best for them.
<P>
<b>Rigid Copayments.</b> The House proposal appears to require Medicare Plus plans to contain deductibles and copayments no higher than the traditional Medicare program's. This would be a serious mistake and would be financially harmful to the elderly. Competing private plans should be allowed to offer different combinations of deductibles, copayments, and premium prices, as well as varieties of MSAs. Seniors, not Congress, should be allowed to decide which combination is the best value.
<p>
<b>No Level Playing Field.</b> Another concern is that the playing field might not be level between private plans and traditional Medicare. If private plans are to be required to provide consumer information and be solvent, the traditional program should be required to meet the same standards and provide the same consumer information. Seniors should have all the information they need to choose wisely between traditional Medicare and Medicare Plus.
<p>
	These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall, the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement. Moreover, by giving seniors the right to choose private plans in roughly the same way that federal workers and retirees routinely do, the proposal would introduce into Medicare the dynamics of the FEHBP:  costs kept down by competing private plans that must give the best value for money to the patient.

<center><h2>Debt Ceiling Politics:<br>
Economists and Investors React</h2></center>
<hr>
<center>[ <a href="#quotes">Skip Introduction</a> ]</center> <P><i>As congressional Republicans move toward passing a federal budget that cuts spending and taxes and balances the budget by 2002, Clinton administration officials warn of a government default if there is any delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling.  Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has warned that a debt limit "crisis" could "interrupt Government operations,... generate uncertainty in the domestic and international securities markets, and increase the Government's cost of borrowing."  And White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta has accused congressional Republicans of "playing with fire" by rattling the financial markets with the specter of default.  But  financial markets look at the future, not the present.  In fact, leading investors and economists seem to be more concerned about the failure to bring federal spending under control than they are about temporary non-payment of debts.</i><P>

<h3><center>WHAT ABOUT</a> 
A "TRAIN WRECK"?</h3></center>
<ul>
"It would be tragic if delaying payments of interest and/or principal on U.S. Treasury obligations is needed to compel our Administration and Congress to achieve an agreement to balance the Federal budget.  The implications of even temporarily delaying these payments are broad, important, and profound.
<P>
However, let's not allow fears of temporary "market instability" to serve as an excuse for equivocating on spending cuts and entitlement reform.  Markets look at the future, not the present.  Despite widespread predictions that the Dow would drop "hundreds of points" at the onset of the Gulf War, it rose over a hundred points the first hour after bombing began.  The markets focused on the solution to the problem, not the bombing.  If the so-called train wreck occurs, the markets will focus on the eventual outcome.  If the markets believe the chaos will finally lead to decisive action, they will rise.  If the markets believe decisive action will not be forthcoming, they will decline.  Whatever the expectations, they will overwhelm disruptions  caused by the delay of these payments.  If decisive action is the end result, there will be no "black mark" on treasury securities; rather, lower government borrowing costs will be the result for years to come.
<P>
Be assured, we are not advocating the so-called train wreck.  Paying interest when due and principal at maturity on its securities is about as inviolate a commitment of the U.S. government as there can be.  As serious and deep as our differences are on how to achieve a balanced budget, they are clearly bridgeable.  An agreement which balances the budget and achieves long term entitlement reform is within our reach as a nation.  The true question is whether it is within the reach of our political leaders.  While such agreement should be achievable without default, from a financial market standpoint, the costs our economy will bear from a temporary default are less than the costs we now bear from the uncertainties about our budget outlook.  The costs of our political leaders failing to produce deficit reduction are greater than those of failing temporarily to pay interest and /or principal on U.S. Treasury securities.
<P>
Let us do neither.  Stop the nonsense and rhetoric.  Sit down and solve this thing for the good of America.  Now."</ul>

<ul>"...As for payments to U.S. debt holders, a potential default will be no more than a bump along the road to a balanced budget.  In 1987 and 1990, the government hit against the debt ceiling, and we heard the same apocalyptic rhetoric we hear today.  In 1985, as Congress and the Reagan administration were busy erecting the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings guillotine, the debt ceiling was reached, and default loomed.  Relying on a number of technical fixes, the Treasury Department was able to forestall actual default, but the uncertainty lasted more than a month.  Did the market implode?  Far from it:  Stocks actually staged a rally taking the S&P index to its then-all-time high.  There's a lesson in that earlier experience that holds true today:  The value of the debt investors buy depends on the dynamism of the U.S. economy -- not the fate of the U.S. government." -- <i>Wall Street Journal 10/13/95</i>

<ul>"Tying the statutory debt ceiling legislation to a major fiscal policy initiative is not new.  Of course, everybody knows that any technical 'default' or disruption would be the result of the game of political chicken rather than questionable economic soundness.  That is precisely why its impact on financial markets would be temporary and costless.  Presently, the pattern of moderate economic growth, vastly improving inflation fundamentals and the expectation that the Fed will lower its funds rate target to ease the restrictive stance of monetary policy, set the stage for further declines in interest rates.
<P>
Any disruption in the Treasury's auction schedule or delay in interest payments would not influence these fundamental determinants of lower interest rates.  The last time the debt ceiling legislation become embroiled in the fiscal debate -- in fall 1990-- financial markets were nonplused by the political game-playing, and interest rates declined continuously.  Financial markets reward credibility and responsibility of policymakers, both monetary and fiscal.  Is it possible that a 'default related' disruption would actually accelerate the decline in rates -- providing net long-run savings to taxpayers -- by raising the perceived probability of a quicker enactment of fiscal reform"?

<ul>"If Congress, or the American public is looking for an honest assessment of how the financial markets will react to this Budget Showdown, they need only review recent history of the world currency markets.  Increasingly, over the last few years, the currency markets have been acting as the world's credit-market-Cop.  The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of Congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S.'s credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the Crime Bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks.

<ul>"'Train Wreck'?  What Train Wreck?  Seriously, as President Reagan told Budget Director James Miller in 1986, 'Let's shut down the government and see if any one notices.'  In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes.  They are not worried about the government's short-term borrowing needs.  If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now.  Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue.  Tax policy makes the world go around.  Lower taxes mean lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices.  Higher taxes mean the reverse.  Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried.  Not only would that be bad news for the economy and the financial markets, it would also be bad news for Republicans.

The systemic factors have to do with Congress's acting on the behalves of Americans' failure to control spending.

<ul>"I am confident that no default will occur even if the debt limit is not raised before November 15.  The Treasury and the Federal Reserve have many ways of preventing this from occurring.  Moreover, investors are sophisticated and know that even if a technical default occurs they will still be paid all that is due them shortly.  And even in a worse case scenario, in which a technical default raises borrowing costs slightly, this will be more than offset by the reduction in borrowing costs that will result from shrinking government spending and balancing the federal budget.  For these reasons, Congress should not allow the Clinton Administration's scare tactics to derail the first real effort in 25 years to get the budget under control."

<ul>"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and short-lived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reductions, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

<h2>A People's Budget</h2>
<P>
By <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Eisenach">Jeffrey A. Eisenach</a></center><p>
<P>




	Congress is in trouble again.  Recent polls show people are less and less satisfied with its performance.  Indeed, according to a recent survey, only 35 percent of Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its job.
<p>
	Liberals would have us believe the problem stems from Republican efforts to "go too far" or "cut too much."  As ABC anchorman Peter Jennings put it, they believe the November election was nothing more than a  "temper tantrum."  People didn't really know what they were doing on November 8, the theory goes, and the more they now read about "draconian" cuts, the more they come to realize that balancing the budget, cutting Federal spending and -- worst of all -- getting some of their money back in the form of tax cuts, was just a childish fantasy.
<p>
	But a closer look at voter's attitudes leaves no doubt it's liberals who are fantasizing.   Many Americans who are dissatisfied with Congress say they want more cut from federal spending, not less.  Republicans may be in trouble, but if so it's because they are moving too slowly, cutting too little, compromising too much.  Republican Members went back to their districts for the August recess expecting to hear angry constituents complaining about program cuts.  Instead, they were told to keep at it; even on the contentious issue of Medicare, Members found most voters agreeing that the system needs major reform before it bankrupts the government.
<p>
	Managing their new majority is no picnic for the Republican leadership.  True, a majority of House Republicans are freshmen and sophomores, most of whom understand voters' want dramatic change.  But  four out of ten Republican Congressmen have been in Congress for six years or more, long enough to have a big stake in the status quo.  And while House Speaker Newt Gingrich wisely appointed a number of younger members to chair important committees and subcommittees, 57 of the 101 chairmen have been in Congress for ten years or more.
<p>
	And then there's the Senate, where the average age among Republicans is 58, and the average Congressional tenure (counting time in the House for those who served there first) is 10.2 years.  Virtually all of the leading Senate "moderates" are also old bulls -- Senators Cohen, Chafee, Jeffords and Hatfield have, between them,  served in Congress for 95 years!
<p>
	In <i>The People's Budget</I>, a recently released book I co-authored with former Perot pollster Frank Luntz and three others, we started out by asking what kind of Federal government Americans thought they were getting when they voted to end 40 years of Democratic rule. The answer:  They wanted to shrink the government in Washington by at least 25 percent, and most wanted it cut by fully one-third.
<p>
	Importantly, people were not necessarily anti-government -- just anti-Washington.  They wanted power sent back to them:  To the people, to local governments, and to the states.
<p>
	With that in mind, we designed a complete budget of the U.S. government, a budget that shrinks Federal spending as a proportion of the gross domestic product from its current level of more than 21 percent down to 15.7 percent, precisely the one-third cut most people said they wanted.  We do it by getting the Federal government completely out of areas where most people don't think it belongs (education, welfare, roads and sewers, etc.), by getting serious about cutting corporate welfare and other special interest spending, and by moving quickly to replace the obsolete Medicare program with a market-oriented system that will guarantee better care for the elderly at a much lower cost.
<p>
	All of this is possible with no smoke and mirrors.  We used the same conservative economic assumptions applied by the Congressional Budget Office, and didn't even count the savings in interest on the debt that would result from balancing the budget over seven years.
<p>
	By shrinking Washington's budget, our proposal would increase the family budget -- eliminating most Federal excise taxes (e.g. on gasoline, telephones and tobacco) and cutting income taxes 22 percent beyond what Republicans are now proposing.
<p>
	Most members of the Republican leadership support this kind of serious downsizing.  Speaker Gingrich has called our plan "a blue-print for replacing the welfare state," and Budget Committee Chairman Kasich even wrote the foreword for the book.  On the Democratic side, some members, like Mississippi Congressman Mike Parker, are to the right of many Republicans in supporting real change.  There just aren't enough of them.
<p>
	All the data suggests the voters are still where they were on November 8, looking for a Congress that will pass a "people's budget" that dramatically shrinks the government in Washington.  But the evidence is mounting that it's going to take one more election -- now barely a year away -- to reinforce the revolutionary troops voters sent to Congress last November.

<h2>A Budget for the People</h2>
<P>
By <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Luntz">Frank Luntz</a></center><p>
<P>

	Public opinion research -- polling -- is one of the critical devices by which the political class comes to know the hopes and dreams, the fears and concerns of the electorate. Although much maligned, it is, as Ben Wattenberg noted, one of America's three unique contributions to the practice of democracy.

<p>	As Congress begins the daunting task of balancing the Federal budget, what are the American people saying about the budget in dozens of national surveys and dozens of focus groups in all regions of the country?  They offer a single, definitive conclusion:  The American people consider the dramatic reduction and restructuring of the government in Washington to be far more than a fiscal necessity; they consider it a moral imperative.
<p>
	The imperative is to cut spending, not balance the budget. This is an important distinction.  The budget deficit is, to be sure, a symptom of Washington's lack of fiscal discipline. But most Americans do not regard eliminating the deficit per se to be an urgent priority.
<p>
	When people seek to explain why American society seems to be crumbling about them, they point fingers at Washington.  The Federal budget is not merely wasteful -- the public estimates that about 50 cents of every dollar goes up in smoke -- it is often injurious to the health of our nation.
<p>
	The electorate takes a collective look around and sees what 30 years of bloated budgets in Washington has built -- high rise ghettos, consigning the poor to live in cesspools of crime and drugs -- and it thinks, "not with my tax dollars you don't."  They see Washington subsidizing illegitimacy in the inner city and vile artistic contempt for religion in the comfortable suburbs, and they say, "this is wrong."
<p>
	Eighty percent of the American public thinks that declining individual morality and the breakup of the family presage a crisis that will be the dominant political issue into the new millennium.  What voters want is for the government in Washington to stop spending money that is destructive to American civilization.
<p>
	When we ask the public what they are looking for from Washington, they emphasize four key elements:  accountability, responsibility, simplicity, and common sense.
<p>
<UL><LI>Accountability to hold their politicians answerable for what they say and what they do. Accountability to hold the programs liable for what is promised.
<P>
<li>Responsibility, that involves sending programs back home because you can hold your Representatives more beholden when you can touch them and feel them, which you can do in local government but you can't do in Washington.
<P>
<LI>Simplicity, that involves everything from the tax structure to all the various programs that do the same thing over and over and over again in a bureaucratic maze.
<P>
<li>Common sense, to recognize that programs delivered into the South Bronx will not be the same type of programs that you would deliver in South Dakota. They want each line in the budget to pass this simple test:  Does it move us toward or away from a healthy society of high moral character -- would I impose it on my family and neighborhood?
</ul><p>
	These are the four elements voters want to see in the Federal budget currently being written in the House and Senate.  They are less interested in how much needs to be cut to balance the budget than they are that the government stop spending money on things it cannot do well.
<p>
	The new majority in Congress should craft a budget that the American people, and not Washington policy wonks and lobbyists, want. That is why I co-authored a new book, <i>The People's Budget: A Common Sense Plan for Shrinking the Government in Washington</i>, which we believe is the budget the American people would write for the federal government.
<p>
	Among the main features of this people's budget:
<p>
	The responsibility for designing, running and paying for state and local programs should be returned to the states and localities, where it belongs -- and where people can hold elected officials more accountable for producing results.
<p>
	This would allow the government in Washington to be nearly one-third smaller, as a percentage of GDP, than it is today -- down from 22 percent to around 15 percent of GDP.
<p>
	Taxes would be reduced, giving people the funds to take care of themselves and their families, and giving states and localities the tax base they would need to take on their new responsibilities.
<p>
	Medicare would begin the transformation from a 1960s "command and control" bureaucracy to a 1990s system of consumer choice.
<p>
	The Federal budget would be balanced, and the debt would begin to shrink rapidly relative to the size of the economy.  With Medicare saved from bankruptcy and the budget deficit finally eliminated, the foundation would have been created to deal with the looming crisis in Social Security.
<p>
	Although many pollsters like to discuss their methodologies with reverent and obscure scientific-sounding terms, what we do is not rocket science -- indeed it is much more an art than any kind of science. There is no great mystery to what the American people want from their political leaders at this junction in our history.  They want hope, and they hope that we can arrest the decline of our society's character by arresting and then reversing the growth in our government.

<h3>
<b>SENATE WELFARE REFORM BILL<br> 
FORGETS ILLEGITIMACY, ANALYSTS SAY<br></b></b>   
<p></h3><br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUG. 29, 1995 --</b> The main welfare-reform bill the Senate will consider when Congress returns from recess all but ignores the most important reform issue -- illegitimacy -- according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cbrief18.html">study released today</a> by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
The bill proposed by the Senate's Republican leadership contains only one of eight anti-illegitimacy provisions that are part of a bill sponsored by Sens. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and John Ashcroft, R-Mo., according to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a>,  Heritage senior policy analyst for welfare and family issues.
<p>
"For weeks liberal Republicans have fought behind the scenes to prevent other lawmakers from even mentioning the harmful effects of illegitimacy. Now the Senate leadership bill finally mentions those harmful effects on society, but it does not take steps to curb them," Rector says. He believes the Senate leadership should adopt all the Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft provisions. These include: 
<p><ul>
<LI>Requiring states to set voluntary 10-year goals for lower levels of illegitimacy and to draw up plans for reducing out-of-wedlock births.
<p>
<li>A federal bonus to states that are successful in reducing illegitimacy -- providing that abortion rates have not also increased.
<p>
<LI>Setting aside funds for abstinence education.
<p>
<LI>Providing a tax credit up to $500 for married couples with children with earned income between $8,000 and $26,000 where at least one spouse works.
<p>
<LI>Requiring mothers to establish paternity for children born after January 1996 in order to obtain future Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits.
<p>
<LI>Stop providing federal cash benefits to girls under 18 years old who have children out of wedlock.
<p>
<LI>Stop providing additional federal aid to women who have more children while enrolled in AFDC. States would be able to use their own funding if they choose.
<p>
</ul>
In a related study, two former policy analysts in the Bush administration's Office of Population Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agree that abstinence training should be part of the welfare-reform package.
<p>
According to <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1051.html">Joseph J. Piccione and Robert A. Scholle</a>, The Preventing Sexual Involvement (PSI) abstinence program conducted by Emory University faculty members is a perfect example of what the government can do to prevent illegitimacy.
<p>
A scientific study of PSI showed adolescents who went through the program were significantly less likely to initiate sexual activity than similar adolescents in a control group. In fact, non-program eighth-grade students were five times more likely to begin sexual activity during the school year than program students.
<p>
Piccione and Scholle recommend policy-makers:
<p><ul>
<li>Make abstinence counseling a part of comprehensive family planning.
<p>
<li>Give abstinence programs the same funding status as state and federally funded contraception programs.
<p>
<li>Promote adoption counseling where pregnancy has already occurred.
</ul>
<p>
"Abstinence programs must be part of a whole, unambiguous cultural message that promotes responsibility in all facets of life, including the sexual. Abstinence is the hallmark of responsibility. This message must be directed at both sexes and at all ages," they say.
<p>

<h2> Thousands Virtually Join Aspen Summit </h2>
</center> 
<p>

The leaders of Cyberspace gathered for the Aspen Summit '95 broke new ground today by simultaneously carrying on conversations face-to-face and on-line. The discussion among two hundred leading Cyberspace thinkers meeting at the Ritz-Carlton in Aspen, Colo., was carried to thousands on the Internet. 
<p>

"What we're doing in Aspen is trying to turn all the hype and cyberbabble into cybersense. While we brought leading  thinkers together in Aspen to work an a clear vision, we also involved the Cyberspace community itself,"  said <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Eisenach">Jeffrey A. Eisenach</a>, president of The Progress & Freedom Foundation which is hosting Aspen Summit '95.
<p>
On-line moderators posted real-time bulletins about the discussion in Aspen on the Aspen Summit '95 Homepage, while those logged onto the page posted comments that were shared with the participants back in Aspen. The Homepage received 6,032 hits during the days proceedings.
<p>
Monday was the first day of the two day Summit, and the Homepage will be in use again Tuesday 11:00 am to 7:00 pm EST.  To access the Homepage type: <a href="http://aspen.pff.org">http://aspen.pff.org</a>
<p>
"What we saw today in Aspen and on the Homepage was that the issues of how information technology is going  to change America are not confined to either the political right or left. People from diverse backgrounds are coming together to define a vision for what America can achieve in the Knowledge Age," said <b>Jay Keyworth, </b> chairman of the Foundation.

Tomorrow the Summit will continue with sessions on the Marketplace and Role of Government.  Among the 26 lead discussants will be: <b>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle </b>  (D-SD), <b> <a href="http://www.house.gov/ehlers/welcome.html">Congressman Vernon Ehlers </a></b>(R-MI), <b> Alvin Toffler</b>, author of <i>Creating a New Civilization</i>, and <b>John Gage </b>of  Sun Microsystems.

The Progress and Freedom Foundation is a non partisan research and educational organization dedicated to creating a  positive vision  of the future founded in the historic principles of the American idea.

<h2>"Aspen summit to explore cyberspace"</h2>
By Price Colman
<p>
<b>Conference designed to draft manifesto on sole technology will play in future society</b>
</center>
<p>
On the surface, the Ritz-Carlton in Aspen and Independence Hall in Philadelphia have little in common.  That could change if organizers of what's billed as "Aspen Summit:  Cyberspace and the American Dream II" see their vision become reality.  
<p> 
The Progress and Freedom Foundation, a Washington, D.C, - based think tank that is hosting the conference, has attracted a collection of America's brainest visionaries to Aspen with a plan in mind.  It hopes to draft a manifesto that will guide American society as it begins to probe the frontiers of cyberspace.  
<p>
"What we're trying to do is bring together those who see the potential of technology to work through what the future is going to be like,"  said Richard F. O'Donnell, spokesman for the foundation.  "We want to chart a path to show change can be good if we're smart.  If we think through where we're going, we can end up at better place than where we are today."
<p>
It's an ambitious mission, and the Progress and Freedom Foundation has lined up a panel of participants with intellectual clout.  
<p>
The participants inclued John Perry Barlow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Steward Brand of The Well and Whole Earth Catalog fame, Phill Burgess of the Center for the New West, Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings, television and telecommunications visionary George Gilder, Microsoft genius Nathan Myhrvold, Bell Labs genius Arno Penzias and author and futurist Alvin Toffler.  
<p>
Sponsors of the summit include the Denver-based <a href="http://www.commerce.com/cnw/">Center for the New West</a>, a think tank financed primarily by U.S. West, Microsoft, the Reason Foundation, Intel, AT&T and BellSouth.
<p>
Participation in the summit won't be limited to big companies or famed Ph.Ds.  Anyone with a properly, equipped personal computer, or access to one, will be able to express views at this meeting of the minds aimed at drafting the operating principles of a new democratic digitocracy.
<p>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation has established a World Wide Web site --- <a href="http://aspen.pff.org">http://aspen.pff.org</a> -- permitting online participation in the four topics that will be featured at the summit.  The topics are the nature of property and freedom, the essence of community, the way of the marketplace and the role of government.
<p>
"The proceedings are going to be posted live real-time on the Net," said O'Donnell.  "People in cyberspace will be able to post comments about what's happening."
<p>
The Web site is operational now and accepting comments.
<p>
The Progress and Freedom Foundation may be best known for its sponsorship of the weekly cable television show Progress Report, co-hosted by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and for sponsoring the college course "Renewing American Civilization" that Gingrich taught.
<p>
But there's no partisan political agenda for the conference, O'Donnell emphasized.  
<p>
"We don't believe politically the left-right debate exists anymore," O'Donnell said.  "We think that debate is obsolete.  Americans no longer believe government has the answers.   We're trying to find a new paradigm.  We're kind of all over the map, just because we're trying to abandon the left-right debate."
<p>
As for the issue of why host such a conference in Aspen, O'Donnell offered a simple explanation.  "We wanted to do two things:  Get people away from daily routines to come and think," he said.  "The other thing is, Aspen's a great place to be in August."

<title>Press Release: Abolish DOT, Return to States</title>

<h3><b>DOT DUTIES CAN BE HANDLED BY<br>
 STATES, BUSINESSES, ANALYSTS SAY<br></h3></b>
<p><br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUGUST 16, 1995  --</b> Congress should abolish the<a href="http://www.dot.gov/"> Department of Transportation (DOT) </a>and return its functions -- including the federal highway program, Amtrak, Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) -- to state and local governments or privatize them, according to a Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>
"Federal involvement in transportation on land, sea and air has become costly, bureaucratic and inflexible, operating in a fashion that preserves privileges of businesses, civil servants, congressional committees and unions that benefit financially from the status quo," say Dr. Ronald Utt, a Heritage visiting fellow, and Wendell Cox, director of state policy and legislation for the American Legislative Exchange Council, authors of the study.
<p>
As an example, Utt and Cox cite DOT's highway program, which "Congress originally intended to be a federally assisted state program to which more and more federal mandates and money have been added, making it a state-assisted federal program." As a result, "a $30 billion program with a 15-year projected time for completion has incurred costs of more than $300 billion and is now 30 years behind schedule."
<p>
Closing DOT and decentralizing or privatizing its mostly commercial functions would build upon "fundamental transportation reforms that began with President Carter and carried over into the early Reagan administration" but stalled under George Bush and Bill Clinton, say Utt, former Reagan administration "privatization czar," and Cox.
<p>
The analysts recommend that the $20 billion Highway Trust Fund -- now used to pay for highway construction, urban mass transit subsidies, advanced transportation systems research and numerous other activities -- be abolished, and revenues from the 18.5 cents-per-gallon federal fuel tax that finance the fund become a block grant. Under such a scheme, each state would be free to distribute the funds among a variety of transportation purposes that best suit its needs, according to Utt and Cox.
<p>
Also, a new Interstate Transportation Safety Office would assume safety regulation duties now managed separately by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), FAA and FTA.
<p>
 Utt and Cox recommend that Amtrak be terminated and its assets transferred to a new eight-state "Northeast Corridor Compact," which would seek creative ways to continue rail passenger service in the region. "Popular long-haul passenger routes should be privatized separately to take advantage of their tourism potential," say Utt and Cox.
<p>
The FAA would be split into three parts. "The air-traffic control system should be reorganized as an independent government corporation funded by user fees and ultimately privatized," the analysts say. Airport improvement would be restored to state and local governments along with the taxes and fees to fund the program.
<p>
Highway construction and maintenance would become state duties, while costly and burdensome federal labor and environmental mandates on construction projects receiving federal funds would end under the Heritage plan. A new federal highway cooperation office would be established to "bring together state officials to deal with issues of coordination among the states where needed."
<p>
Also, authority over the U.S. Coast Guard would be shifted to the Justice Department, while the Maritime Administration, with its $700 million-worth of Depression-era federal shipping subsidies, would be terminated.
<p>
Taken together in a DOT-closure measure, transportation deregulation would be to the "considerable benefit of America's consumers, workers and businesses," say Utt and Cox.

<h3><b>ABOLISH COMMERCE,<br>
 DON'T CREATE NEW TRADE DEPARTMENT, ANALYST SAYS</h3></b><p>
<br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUGUST 14, 1995 --</b> Congress should move forward with plans to abolish the U.S. Department of Commerce, but it should resist the temptation to create another Cabinet-level agency to handle international trade, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today. He called proposals to eliminate Commerce, while adding a new Department of International Trade, "a shell game."
<p>
Instead of playing this game, Commerce's legitimate duties in the trade area should be transferred to the Treasury Department, says economist <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/cobb.htm"> Joe Cobb.</a>
<p>
"The Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, and 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet or sub-Cabinet departments," Cobb says. "Commerce cannot be reinvented. The department should be abolished. Its obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated. Its duplicative programs should be transferred to other departments. And its commercial activities should be privatized or closed," he says.
<p>
Creating a new Department of International Trade, which would include the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), as has been suggested by Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., and others, not only would be contrary to the goal of reducing government, but could harm U.S. trade interests, Cobb says. "It would diminish the USTR's effectiveness as a tough negotiator that speaks directly for the president in dealing with foreign governments," Cobb says. 
<p>
Transferring Commerce's trade programs to the <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/homepage.html">Treasury Department</a>, Cobb says, would put them under "the government's principal officer for international economic policy," the Secretary of the Treasury.
<p>
On shutting down the Commerce Department itself, Cobb recommends that the department's inspector general be used to perform "the core of the transition work," that would either abolish outright, transfer to other agencies or privatize all of Commerce's more than 100 programs. Those programs create, according to the General Accounting Office, "a complex web of divided authorities" that shares "missions with at least 71 [other] federal departments, agencies and offices." 
<p>
Indeed, most of Commerce's activities, he says, "have little or nothing to do with its purported mission, which is encouraging the nation's international trade."
<p>
Among Cobb's detailed recommendations for abolishing Commerce:
<ul>
<li>Close the Economic Development Administration, U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, Minority Business Development Agency, Travel and Tourism Administration, Office of Technology Policy, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and National Telecommunications and Information Administration;
<p>
<li>Transfer to other government offices the International Trade Administration, Bureau of Export Administration, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;
<p>
<li>Privatize the National Technical Information Service and Patent and Trademark Office; and 
<p>
<li>Consolidate as a new, independent agency a combination of the Bureau of Census, the Economics and Statistics Administration and other federal statistical agencies.
</ul>	
<p>
"A Cabinet department reporting directly to the president of the United States ought to have a clearly defined mission and not continue year after year to function simply as an organization chart, tying together a loose collection of agencies," Cobb says.

<h2> Washington Leaders in On-Line Cyberspace Summit  </h2>
</center>
<p>

<b> Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle </B> (D-N.D.) and GOP presidential candidates <b>
Senator Richard Lugar </b> (R-Ind.) and <b> Lamar Alexander </b> are among those joining in an on-line discussion on the Internet in the run-up to this weekend's Aspen Summit '95.
<p>
 Both the Internet forum and the Summit itself are examining the nature of the Big Change happening in America as information technology transforms notions of property, freedom and community,along with the workings of the marketplace and the government.  Four on-line discussion groups at the Aspen Summit '95 Homepage (http://aspen.pff.org) are underway, with both leaders and citizens engaging in debate.
<p>
"We're bringing the leadership of Cyberspace together to develop a set of principles to guide us toward a better future in the Knowledge Age.  The on-line forums allow citizens to engage in a discourse withtheir leadership about where America is headed," said <b>Jeffrey A. Eisenach </b>, president of the Progress & Freedom Foundation, which is hosting the Aspen Summit '95.
<p>
Other leaders who have posted comments on the Homepage include <b> Representative Chris Cox</b> (R-Calif), who is active in the issue of freedom of speech on the Internet;  <b> Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr.</b>, the publisher who may seek the GOP presidential nomination, and <b> Senator Larry Pressler</b>, chariman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
<p>
On August 21 and 22, hundreds of people will gather in Aspen, Colo. for the Aspen Summit '95, which will continue the discussion begun on the Summit Homepage.  During the two days of the conference, live posting will occur on the Homepage, and comments left by those logging on will become part of the conference discussion.
<p>
"The Summit is about describing a path that will get us from here to there -- to life after the Big Change.  We need to think abouthow to get through this transformation of American life, and to our future," said 
<b> Michael Vlahos</b>, senior fellow at the Foundation who will be conference moderator.
<p>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a non-partisan research and educational organization dedicated to creating a positive vision of the future founded in the historic principles of the American idea.

<h3><b>1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT SOLVES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROBLEMS, ANALYST SAYS</b></h3>
Congress Never Sanctioned "Affirmative Discrimination"<br>
<p> 	
</center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, AUGUST 7, 1995</b> -- If Congress wants to assure all Americans  equal treatment under the law on the job, all it has to do is enforce the original intent of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which "clearly forbids employment discrimination against either sex and against any racial or ethnic group,"  according to a former legal counsel for President Bush.<p>
	As part of this effort, lawmakers should forbid federal courts and regulatory agencies from imposing or encouraging race or sex-based "affirmative action" quotas or preferences, which are "alien to the fundamental principles of Title VII," says Nelson Lund, an associate professor at George Mason University School of Law writing in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/cbrief17.html"> Heritage Foundation special report</a> to Congress. 
<p>	"Congress never sanctioned the discriminatory conduct that now occurs routinely in the American workplace under the rubric of 'affirmative action,'" says Lund. "In fact, group-based employment preferences are incompatible with the ideal of equal opportunity that every federal employment statute has claimed to advance." Rather, the system of  race-based preferences now in place was imposed by unelected federal regulators and rogue judges who took it upon themselves to interpret the "color-blindness" of Title VII in a perverse manner that developed into the very opposite of color-blindness. 
<p>	But it is not enough for Congress to proclaim now that it meant what it said 31 years ago. Congress should also prohibit "backdoor quotas" that discriminate through terms like "diversity," "inclusiveness," and "multiculturalism," according to Lund. "The existing cast of bureaucrats and corporate affirmative action officers should be forbidden from repackaging the same old surreptitious racial quotas under some new rubric like 'socially disadvantaged background,'" he says. "Any legislation adopted by Congress must contain airtight legislative language that closes the door to the use of new euphemisms and new rationales for discrimination," he says.
<P>	Legitimate affirmative action programs that promote equal opportunity without relying upon or encouraging the use of race or sex-based quotas or preferences should be allowed to continue. This would ensure that "minorities and women are not excluded from employment opportunities by managers' prejudices, stereotypes, or inappropriate recruiting habits," Lund says.
<p>	Congressional action is needed, Lund says, because of President Clinton's recent decision to "strongly reaffirm the federal government's long-standing and thoroughly discredited approach" to affirmative action. That approach is easy to sum up, he says: "Proclaim a fervid opposition to discrimination, but practice a policy of discriminatory preferences and favoritism for selected groups."
<p>	Clinton's position is also contrary to that of the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), a think tank that has been supportive of the administration in the past but which recently suggested phasing out affirmative action programs in federal hiring and contracting, and making it voluntary throughout the private sector, except on college campuses. 
<p>	Yet, the Clinton approach has caused immense public controversy and outcry against affirmative action. For example, Lund cites federal court decisions holding, that:
<ul>
<li>	 A county agency could deny a promotion to a male and instead promote a less qualified female as part of an affirmative action plan requiring that 36.4 percent (the court-determined percentage of women in the county workforce) of the county's highway maintenance crews be female. This, "despite the utterly obvious fact that women are less likely than men to seek jobs involving heavy physical labor."
<li>	 A fire department could deny a promotion to a white firefighter who received the highest score on a competitive exam and instead promote a black firefighter with a lower score. 
<li>	 A university sociology department could discriminate against male applicants for teaching positions because sociology has to be "considered a traditionally segregated field" as long as half the nation's population is women but only 34 percent of the sociology doctorates are awarded to women.
</ul><p>	Passage of legislation to put an end to such applications of the law "would extend the principle of equal treatment under the law to the more than 94 million American employees now covered by the 1964 Civil Rights Act," Lund says. "There is no longer any need nor justification for compromise, incremental changes or further temporizing" on the affirmative action issue.

<h3>
<b>CLEANING UP SUPERFUND MEANS<br> 
COMPLETE OVERHAUL, ANALYST SAYS<br></b></b>   
States Should be Given More Control<br>
<p></h3><br>
</center><b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUG. 4, 1995  --</b>  As Congress prepares to reauthorize the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act (CERCLA), popularly known as "Superfund," it must correct fundamental flaws and not merely tinker with the statute, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.  
<p>
"Reform should address the core elements of the Superfund structure that fuel litigation, slow cleanups, raise costs and, most important, encourage the cleanup of sites that pose little risk to human health and safety, and divert scarce economic resources from sites that may pose real dangers," according to Environmental Policy Analyst <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/shanahan.htm">John Shanahan</a>.
<p>
Created by the Carter administration in 1980 to clean up the nation's worst hazardous waste sites, the Superfund program "has spent between $20 billion and $30 billion and has failed to clean up more than a small fraction of these sites," Shanahan says. "Even the Clinton administration admits the program does not work."
<p>
 Shanahan says Congress must make the following changes in the Superfund law:
<ul>
<li>Establish priorities for which hazardous waste sites pose the greatest risk to human health and clean up those sites first. "According to the Office of Technology Assessment, the listing of most Superfund sites is based on hypothetical rather than actual or likely future risks," Shanahan says. "The Superfund law aims at cleaning up spilled chemicals, regardless of  whether  these pose an immediate danger. The result: Money and effort have been squandered that could have been used elsewhere to save more lives."  
<p>
<li>Stop requiring waste sites to be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what the location. "Polluted soil at industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a level that makes it essentially clean enough to eat," said Shanahan. "An industrial park does not need to be as pristine as a playground. Once again, priorities must be established so public safety is maximized, while scarce resources are not wasted." 
<p>
<li>Get rid of Superfund's liability scheme, which is "designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste," even if the "responsible" person or party had only a tiny part in creating the waste problem, or disposed of waste in a manner that was legal at the time but which became illegal under the Superfund law, Shanahan says. In practice, this often means a firm with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created by someone else. "Naturally, any person or institution identified as a polluter has a strong incentive to show that others are liable as well, in order to spread the costs among more parties. Litigation is virtually assured," which consumes enormous amounts of time and money, delaying cleanup of hundreds of sites. Instead, Shanahan says, "Reform would make clear that liability is proportional to a party's contribution to the level of pollution at a waste site."
<p>
<li>Make hazardous waste cleanup a local, instead of a federal responsibility. "Unlike most all other major environmental laws, responsibility for Superfund is not delegated to the states. Yet, hazardous waste sites, are at their core, a local problem. State and local officials are far more accountable for local risks under their control than are distant federal officials," Shanahan says. "Authority for cleanup of hazardous waste sites should be turned over to the states -- with the necessary funding. To qualify for funds, states should be required to prioritize sites and expenditures based on real risks." 
</ul>
<p>
In addition to these reforms, Shanahan says the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> should retain emergency cleanup capacity. "The EPA is both experienced and relatively efficient at emergency responses to truly hazardous waste problems. Therefore, it should maintain this capacity, with states deciding whether a site constitutes an emergency. Costs would be recovered from the state or the party responsible for polluting the site," he says.

<title> Press Release: Privatizing Adoption -- Heritage</title>

<h3>WELFARE REFORM SHOULD INCLUDE<BR>
PRIVATIZING ADOPTION, ANALYST SAYS</h3>
<p></center><BR>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</B>
<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, AUG. 2, 1995 --</b> The only way for nearly half a million foster children to become available to more than 2 million couples who would like to adopt them is for states to take adoption away from the public welfare bureaucracy and give it back to the private sector, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>
"The $10 billion-per-year foster-care and adoption system in this country has become a major obstacle keeping thousands of children from being united with loving parents," says Heritage FitzGerald Senior Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, a former family therapist and clinical psychologist, in a paper released today.  "The anti-adoption bias of the current public-sector welfare bureaucracy has resulted in an adoption process with too many built-in obstacles. These obstacles feed children into the foster-care system and keep them there, ensuring a larger clientele for public agencies, at a staggering emotional cost," he says. 
<p>
Yet, Fagan says, "Adoption benefits all involved. It increases the emotional, physical and cognitive capacities of children, and increases the life chances of the biological mother." What's more, if adoption is made quicker and easier, it will ease the burden America will feel by 2012, when a 50 percent out-of-wedlock birthrate is expected to vastly increase the number of abused and neglected children. "Serious welfare reform, therefore, must include serious adoption reform," Fagan believes.
<p>
Fagan says private adoption services are more efficient and effective than state agencies. "They are accountable to boards of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations can be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve." For these and other reasons, Fagan believes "The quickest, simplest solution is for states, which have primary responsibility for regulating adoption, to place the job of finding suitable parents in the hands of private adoption services. Both state and federal lawmakers can work in tandem to facilitate this process," he says.
<p>
While significant, Fagan says the tax credit for adoptive parents recently passed by the House of Representatives as part of its welfare-reform bill will not lead to a major increase in adoption unless the almost insurmountable barriers to adoption erected by the social service bureaucracy are removed. 
<p>
He says, for example, that a significant part of the reason only 1 percent of women choose adoption as a solution to their unwanted pregnancies is lack of information. "Some 40 percent of pregnancy counselors don't even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients; another 40 percent provide incomplete or inaccurate information about adoption," Fagan says. Yet, when adoption is mentioned, 38 percent choose it rather than alternatives like abortion.
<p>
Race is another barrier/bias in the adoption system, Fagan says. Even though a higher proportion of black than white children are available to adopt, and even though many white parents would like to adopt black children, the welfare bureaucracy is dedicated to a policy of "race matching," which delays adoption for years, and many times prevents black children from ever being placed in a loving home. This phenomenon occurs in the other direction as well, though not as often. As a result, "black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes." 
<p>
To fix these and other problems, Fagan suggests a number of reforms, the majority of which must take place at the state level. For example, besides privatizing all adoption services, he says states should:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li>Enact a strict 12-month timeline for working out the long-term parental status of any child in foster care.
<p>
<li>Separate the responsibility for protecting children from convicted abusive parents from that of preserving parental rights for families that can be helped. "Professionals should not be trapped between simultaneous demands to reunite every family and to protect every child. When these duties are separated, both goals are better served," Fagan says.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the removal of a child from foster parents willing to adopt him or her, except when the child is being returned to its legal parents.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, Fagan says Congress should: 	
<ul>
<p>
<li>Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 to help pay the substantial one-time costs incurred by adoptive parents. 
<p>
<li>Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal aid to provide timely and accurate adoption information to all mothers who give birth out of wedlock.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay placement of a child in foster care or adoption.
</ul>
<p>
Fagan's views are movingly reinforced in the latest issue of Policy Review, Heritage's quarterly journal, by "John," a baseball-loving 10-year-old who has been waiting almost his entire life for a family: "I'm all wrapped up in programs, what I need is a mom." John is quoted in an <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">article written by Conna Craig</a>, a former foster child and president of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Institute for Children.
<p>
"The problem," Craig says, "is a system that gives child welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted kids in state care, an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal and regulatory barriers, and a culture of victimization that places the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their children." State social-service agencies are neither rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes, nor penalized for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time, Craig says.
<p>
"As one foster child put it: 'Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having a mom and dad," she says.

<h3>BUDGET CUTS WILL END AMERICA'S<br>
 GLOBAL POWER, ANALYST SAYS</b><br>
B-2, NMD Funding Lauded</center>
</h3><p>
<br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
WASHINGTON, AUGUST 1, 1995 --</b> "America's days as a global military power capable of defending its worldwide interests will be numbered" if Congress goes along with Clinton administration defense budget cuts, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>
"If the president and Congress do not change course on defense budget policy, the result will be forces smaller than those needed to execute national strategy, a collapse of the strategy itself, and ultimately the exposure of America's vital national interests to foreign threats," says Baker Spring, Heritage's senior defense analyst.
<p>
"No amount of rationalization can cover up this cold, hard fact. New technologies will not save America from this disastrous outcome. Nor will new strategies that downplay threats to American interests," says Spring.
<p>
Spring says both the Clinton administration and Congress are at fault since there is only a $9.6 billion difference in total spending between their respective seven-year defense plans. "For all intents and purposes, the two are roughly the same," says Spring. "Both budget plans would reach the year 2002 with military spending levels that are less than 60 percent of what they were in 1985," he says.
<p>
Spring says Congress should establish a congressional staff study on how best to close the gap between projected defense budgets and actual national security requirements. The study group should be appointed by the chairmen of the Senate and House defense committees, and function like a similar 1985 body that produced a report on military reorganization.
<p>
The study's starting point ought to be that current military spending plans will result in Defense Department underfunding of at least $110 billion in a five-year period, compared to what would be required to pay for the force structure envisioned by the Clinton administration in its 1993 Bottom-Up Review (BUR), Spring says.
<p>
With the shortfall, U.S. military forces will have to be reduced even more than now planned, with the Army going from 10 to eight active divisions, the Air Force from 20 tactical fighter wings to 15, the Navy to 300 ships from 346, including only nine carriers rather than 12, and with only 140,000 active Marines, compared to 174,000.
<p>
So much military muscle will be cut that by the turn of the century the United States "will not have enough power to fight a major regional conflict like the Persian Gulf War without abandoning its security commitments elsewhere in the world," Spring says.
<p>
As an example, Spring cites the Air Force's deployment of 10 tactical fighter wings during the Persian Gulf War. Due to maintenance and backup needs, at least one-third of a wing is needed in reserve for each full wing in combat. This means putting just 10 wings in a future Gulf War would tie up the entire 15 wing Air Force of 2002, according to Spring. He says the same disturbing force calculus would apply to the Army and the Navy.
<p>
The weak U.S. military posture will also force America's allies to reassess their commitments to regional-based defense alliances, probably beginning with NATO, Spring says. "Under these circumstances, an independent European nuclear force, with Germany's direct involvement, is not out of the question," according to Spring. Japan could also be expected to either re-arm and fend for itself, or seek to play stronger regional powers like China and Russia against each other.
<p>
Finally, U.S. access to the international trade that undergirds much of America's economic prosperity would be seriously threatened, including the nation's access to critically needed petroleum supplies. "Two world wars in this century should have taught Americans that drastically scaling back our regional defense commitments is a dangerous thing to do," says Spring.
<p>
In related Heritage papers released today, Thomas Moore, Heritage's deputy director of foreign policy and defense studies, finds at least some encouragement in the Senate Armed Services Committee defense authorization bill, which will soon be considered by the full Senate.
<p>
The Senate bill would put the nation on course for building Theater Missile Defenses against short-range regional missile threats and a National Missile Defense (NMD) to protect the U.S. homeland against long-range strategic ballistic missiles. The bill also includes start-up funds for an anti-cruise missile defense.
<p>
Moore says proponents should expect and vigorously oppose efforts to drop the nearly $500 million in NMD funding increases included in the bill by the Senate Armed Services panel.
<p>
In a second related paper, Spring argues that the $356 million included in the Senate defense bill to pay for dismantling the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons should be used instead to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber production line open.
<p>
According to the General Accounting Office, these funds "have been used by individuals and institutions in the former Soviet states working to create new weapons of mass destruction." Funds would be better spent on the B-2, which is virtually invisible to enemy radar and thus will be able to project American power around the world from continental U.S. bases, Spring says.
<p>
Twenty B-2 bombers have already been paid for, but the Senate bill lacks a provision included in the House defense bill for spending $553 million to keep the aircraft's production line open for another 20 planes.
<p>
With the $356 million fund shift to the B-2, the Senate then can make up the remaining $188 million difference with the House by shifting non-appropriate funds supporting the Atlanta Olympic Games, weather reconnaissance, the Defense Business Management University, counter-drug surveillance activities and land mine clearing assistance, Spring says.

ideas on a global scale,&quot; said Edwin J. Feulner Jr., Heritage
Foundation president. He said many people are now &quot;going
around&quot; the traditional print and broadcast media for political
information and find the Internet a convenient way to access information
that hasn't been through &quot;the filtering process of the mainstream
media.&quot;
<P>
 The Heritage Web site -- part of the broader Town Hall Internet
community -- will offer browsers the latest in full-text searching
using a &quot;key word&quot; or phrase.
<P>
 The Web site's official opening will be held at 11 a.m. at the
Capitol Hill Club, 300 First St., S.E. Town Hall is owned jointly
by Heritage and National Review. On hand for the opening will
be Feulner, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and National
Review Editor John O'Sullivan.

<b>FRIST DEMONSTRATES HOMPAGE, WELCOMES<br>
"TOWN HALL" TO INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY</b>
</center>
<p>
 U. S. Senator Bill Frist today welcomed the conservative movement to the information superhighway, and demonstrated his homepage at a Capitol Hill event to kick off the Heritage Foundation's Town Hall Internet community. Town Hall will provide Internet users with a link to conservative organizations and publications. Frist was the first Republican in Congress to have a homepage on the World Wide Web, and spearheaded an effort to bring the World Wide Web into the United States Senate.
<p>
"As a physician, I used technology every day to save the lives of my patients, and now as a Senator, I'm using technology every day to keep in touch with my constituents," Frist said. "It is imperative that our government be accessible through the World Wide Web, which is expected to have more than 100 million users within the next few years. With Town Hall and active participation by elected officials, the Internet can allow citizens to not only learn about, but become a part of the conservative movement."
<p>
In February, Frist asked the Senate Rules Committee to provide the Senate with access to the World Wide Web. Earlier this month, the Committee approved Frist's request. Senator Frist's homepage on the Internet includes his biography, Congressional Record statements, press releases, office information, and links to other government and non-political organizations.

<center><h2>Bob Dole: Biography</h2></center><p>
<hr><br>
Recognized as one of our nation's foremost political figures, Senator Bob Dole has a
distinguished of public service that has made a difference for America.

As a wounded and decorated combat veteran of World War II, Bob Dole grew up on the
plain of western Kansas.  This common sense conservative from America's heartland
has unparalleled experience as the present Senate Majority Leader and having been Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, a candidate for President, his party's nominee for Vice President, a member of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Republican Party, a state legislator, and a county attomey.

LEADERSHIP<p>

President Reagan said of Senator Dole that 'His title of Leader is not just a job title, it's a
description of the man." President Bush went on to call Senator Dole "a great Republican
Leader, as great as any in the past." Bob Dole is only one of 15 Americans ever to serve
as Senate Majority Leader, and his first stint in that position in the mid-1980s won
national praise.  The <i>Congrestional Ouarrerly</i> cited Senator Dole as having "proved a
point that badly needed proving at the time.  The Senate could be led."

Senator Dole's effectiveness as a consensus-builder and his commitment to both deficit
reduction and economic growth have eamed him accolades from his peers -- Republicans,
Independents, and Democrats alike.  On issue after issue, Senator Dole is a statesman
who has made his mark.  A survey conducted by the <i>Des Moines Register</i> concluded that
Senator Dole is "easily [America's] most influential maker of farm policy." Senator Dole
has earned national praise for his leadership on behalf of the disadvantaged and
Americans with disabilities, and for his mastery of foreign affairs.

SACRIFICE<p>

During World War II, Bob Dole was a platoon leader in the legendy Tenth Mountain Division in Italy.  He was gravely wounded on the battlefield in 1945 and twice decorated
for heroic achievement.  His decorations include two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star
with Oak leaf Cluster.

FAMILY<p>

Senator Dole was born in Russell, Kansas, and is married to Elizabeth Hanford Dole,
President of the American Red Cross.  Senator Dole also has a daughter, Robin, who
resides in Washington, DC.

<title>Pete Wilson: Biography</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Pete Wilson: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
As Governor of California since 1991, Pete Wilson has not only led his state through tough times, but has achieved fundamental change that has attracted attention from around the nation.
<P>
Throughout his career, Pete Wilson has shown the optimism, confidence,
vision, and courage to make change and to lead.
<P>
Governor Wilson has enacted what <I>The San Francisco Chronicle</I> called "some of the boldest welfare reforms in the nation" to promote work and encourage individual responsibility."
<P>
He was the first governor in the nation to sign a "Three Strikes and You're Out" bill into law. He also sponsored and signed California's "One Strike" law, one of the toughest laws in the country targeting rapists and child molesters.  And Pete Wilson was
 the first governor in a quarter-century to enforce California's death penalty.
<P>
Governor Wilson is the national leader in the drive to stop illegal immigration. He was a leading proponent in the successful campaign to pass Proposition 187, an initiative to cut off taxpayer-supported services to illegal immigrants.
<P>
Pete Wilson has achieved all this despite a first term that saw natural disasters -- including floods, earthquakes and wildfires -- a prolonged recession, severe cutbacks in California's aerospace industry and painful military base closings.
<P>
But then, Pete Wilson has never shied away from a challenge.
<P>
Pete Wilson has born August 23, 1933, in Lake Forest, Illinois, and raised in Missouri, where he excelled as a student and an athlete. He attended Yale University on a Naval ROTC scholarship and served three years as a Marine Corps infantry officer before

going on to earn a law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.
<P>
Elected to the California Assembly in 1966, the same year that Ronald Reagan was first elected governor, Pete Wilson went on to serve as the highly effective Mayor of San Diego for more than a decade. He amended the city charter to make public safety the 
first and most important responsibility of city government and increased the number of
police officers patrolling San Diego's streets.
<P>
As a United States Senator, Pete Wilson's fiscal conservatism earned him the Watchdog of the Treasury Award every year when he was in Washington. And his toughness was proven yet again when, recovering from a burst appendix, he was wheeled into the Senate
 on a gurney to cast a tie-breaking vote for deficit reduction.
<P>
As Governor of California, Governor Wilson has made the tough choices necessary to keep state spending  $18 billion below the level projected four years earlier and to actually reduce the state's General Fund budget from one year to the next, for the firs
t time since World War II.  He also trimmed the state bureaucracy to its lowest level, as a percentage of state population, since Ronald Reagan was governor.
<P>
To improve California's jobs climate, Governor Wilson reformed the state's notoriously corrupt and job-killing workers' compensation system -- reforms that have cut rates by more than 30 percent.  He enacted job-creating tax incentives equal to a 10 perce
nt cut in the corporate and business income tax, and is now pursuing a 15 percent tax cut for every business and individual in the state.
<P>
In 1994, Governor Wilson was overwhelmingly re-elected by the voters, who gave him more votes than any other governor in California history.  
<P>
During his re-election campaign, <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> broke a 24-year tradition of neutrality in gubernatorial races to endorse Governor Wilson for re-election saying: "Wilson is a firm, hands-on administrator ... [who] is taking on the state
bureaucracy and streamlining government."
<P>
<I>The San Francisco Chronicle</I> also endorsed him noting that "Wilson's effectiveness, industry, persistence and toughness under fire have been tested and proven in the cauldron of a painful and gloomy period of California history."
<P>
In his second Inaugural Address, Governor Wilson described his vision for a better California as a place "where work is respected and rewarded, where every right is balanced by responsibility, and where freedom thrives and opportunity burns bright."
<P>
The Governor lives in suburban Sacramento with his wife, Gayle, and enjoys reading history and cheering for the San Diego Chargers.

<title>Senator Arlen Spector: Biography</title>
</head>                         
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Senator Arlen Specter: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
U.S. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania declared his candidacy for
President of the United States on March 30, 1995. That announcement
followed a whirlwind 100 days of exploratory travels that drew enthusiastic
support across the country, along with organizational and fundraising
triumphs.<p>
Sen. Specter is a fiscal/economic conservative and social libertarian, in
the spirit of his former Senate colleague Barry Goldwater, who said
government should stay out of our pocketbooks, off our backs and out of our
bedrooms. Sen. Specter introduced legislation in March 1995 to replace the
nation's Byzantine income tax system with a simple 20 percent flat tax on
businesses and individuals. His plan would spur economic growth, increase
fairness and compliance and save taxpayers billions of dollars and hours.
Sen. Specter is pressing to remove the anti-abortion plank from the
national platform.<p>
Sen. Specter chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He also
chairs the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human
Services and Education, which oversees all federal health and education
spending. He has introduced several bills that emphasize preventive health
care and cost cutting without new bureaucracy.<p>
Sen. Specter began his public service career as Assistant District Attorney
of Philadelphia, winning the first national conviction of labor racketeers.
He quickly earned a reputation as a tough and effective prosecutor, which
led to an appointment in 1964 as assistant counsel to the Warren Commission
to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy. He is credited with
a major role in the investigation.<p>
His legal achievements led to his election as District Attorney of
Philadelphia in 1965, the first election of a Republican in more than 18
years, and re-election in 1969 by more than 100,000 votes. During his two
consecutive terms, he helped to restore death penalty statutes in
Pennsylvania, worked to improve prison conditions and prosecuted consumer
fraud cases. He fought relentlessly to convict corrupt public officials,
rapists and hardened criminals.<p>
Arlen Specter was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980. He has established
himself as a legislative leader on crime, drugs and terrorism, and is the
only candidate with hands-on crime-fighting experience. He has introduced
several bills to limit the endless appeals in capital cases, to make the
death penalty a meaningful deterrent. His Armed Career Criminal Act, signed
into law in 1984 and expanded in the 1986, makes it a federal offense with
a mandatory 15 years to life sentence for a career criminal found in
possession of a firearm. This law has been especially effective against
major drug dealers. Sen. Specter also crafted the Terrorist Prosecution
Act, a tough anti-terrorism bill, and wrote legislation creating the
independent CIA Inspector General, the only reform legislation to emerge
from the Iran-Contra affair.<p>
Arlen Specter was born to immigrant parents in Wichita, Kansas, on Feb. 12,
1930, and grew up in the small town of Russell. After graduating Phi Beta
Kappa from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951, he served stateside in
the Air Force Office of Special Investigations for two years during the
Korean War. He graduated in 1956 from Yale Law School where he was an
editor of the law journal.<p>
Sen. Specter lives in Philadelphia with his wife, Philadelphia Councilwoman
Joan Specter. They have two sons, Shanin and Stephen, and a granddaughter,
Silvi Specter.<p>

<title>Congressman Robert Dornan's Biography</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Robert K. Dornan Biograohy</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
U.S. Congressman Robert K. Dornan, from Garden Grove, California, now serving in his
eighth term, represents California's 46th Congressional District.  Located in Orange County south
of Los Angeles, the District is comprised of all or parts of the cities of Anaheim, Santa Ana,
Garden Grove, Tustin, Irvine, Stanton, Orange, Fountain Valley and Fullerton.<p>
<h2>Congressional Duties</h2><p>
Congressman Dornan represented California's 27th District beach cities in Los Angeles
County from January 1977 to January 1983.  In 1984, he was elected from California's 38th
District in central Orange County.  Much of the 38th was reapportioned into the 46th District in
1992.<p>
Because of his background in national security, Dornan was chosen to serve on the Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence.  He also serves on the Armed Services Committee where he has
championed such vital defense projects as funding for the B- I and B-2 bombers, the F/A- 18 fighter and
the V-22 tiltrotor, development of effective ground combat identification systems, and maintaining proper
levels of Guard and reserve forces.  As the Defense Department downsizes in the post Cold War era,
Dornan has worked to assist those U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen who will be released from duty.  His
proposal to assist discharged service members gain teacher certification will help integrate former militarypersonnel into the civilian economy and also help raise the quality of American education by tapping into the vast human resources and expertise of U.S. armed forces personnel.<p>
Dornan was a member of the former Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control
where he was involved in formulating U.S. policy to fight the war on illegal drugs.  He is an active
supporter of the new "Weed and Seed" program that is designed to "weed out" criminals in drug-infested areas and plant the seeds of economic and educational opportunity.  As a result of Dornan's efforts, an area of Santa Ana, California, has been designated as a "Weed and Seed Pilot Program."<p>
Dornan's other congressional duties include memberships on the Human Rights Caucus, Grace
Commission Caucus, Empowerment Caucus and Hispanic Caucus.  He is a permanent observer to the
Geneva Arms Control Negotiations.  During 1989 and '90, Dornan chaired the Republican Study
Committee.  He continues to sit on the RSC Executive Committee and chair its foreign affairs and
defense task force.  He is co-chairman of the Republican POW/MIA Task Force.  He is a member of
congressional task forces on Tax Policy and Job Opportunities, Welfare Reform, the Strategic Defense
Initiative, Civil Rights, and Terrorism.<p>
 Dornan is honorary president of the American Chapter of the International Committee for a
Free Vietnam.<p>
<h2>Personal</h2><p>
Congressman Dornan, a Roman Catholic, was born in New York City on April 3,
1933, to Harry and Mickey McFadden Dornan.  He married the former Sallie Hansen of Santa
Monica, California, on April 16, 1955.  They have five children: Robin Mary, Robert Jr.,
Theresa Ann, Mark, and Kathleen Regina.  The Dornans have nine grandchildren.<p>
<h2>Professional Experience</h2><p>
After graduating from Loyola High School in Los Angeles in 1950 and attending Loyola
University until 1953, Congressman Dornan, at age 19, volunteered for service in the United States Air
Force.  Upon earning his silver wings, he served as a peacetime fighter pilot with the world's first
supersonic jet fighter wing.  In 1958, Dornan left active duty and joined the California Air National Guard
as a fighter pilot and then the U.S. Air Force Reserve as a rescue and seaplane pilot and an intelligence
officer, achieving the rank of captain.  He survived two jet fighter emergency parachute ejections as well
as two "dead stick" forced landings (F- 1 00 jet fighter and H- 1 3 solo helicopter).<p>
Dornan has piloted virtually every aircraft in the U. S. military arsenal including the B-1, U-2 and
the SR-71 "Blackbird" as well as the Israeli "Kfir," the British "Tornado," "Harrier" and "Hawk," and the
French "Mirage." He completed his service in the Reserve in May 1975.<p>
Dornan produced and hosted radio and television public affairs shows in Los Angeles
from 1965 to 1976.  In 1968 and 1969, he was awarded Emmys.<p>
Throughout the 1960s, Dornan was active in domestic civil rights activities.  He marched
with Rev.  Martin L. King, Jr., in August 1963.  In addition, in 1970, on his television program
"The Robert K. Dornan Show," he originated the POW/MIA bracelet as worn by more than 5
million Americans and, in 1979, the Prisoner of Conscience bracelet worn for Soviet Jewish and
Christian dissidents.<p>
 Dornan was president of the American Space Frontier Political Action Committee from
1983 to 1988.<p>
<h2>Awards and Honors</h2><p>
In recent years, Congressman Dornan has been recognized for his efforts to spur economic
growth by working to reduce taxes and government spending.  For example, the National Tax
Limitation Committee rated him 100 percent for his record of fiscal responsibility and the
National Taxpayers Union ranked the congressman as one of the 30 most frugal members of the
House.  Dornan has also received the Golden Bull-dog Award from the Watchdogs of the Treasury
and the Jefferson Award from Citizens for a Sound Economy.<p>
In addition, Dornan received the Spirit of Enterprise Award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the Guardian of Small Business Award from the National Federation of Independent Business, the SoundDollar Award from the Free Congress Foundation, the Thomas Jefferson Award from the Food
Distribution Industry, the National Leadership Award from the American Security Council, and an award
of appreciation from the Disabled American Veterans.<p>
<h2>Memberships</h2><p>
Congressman Dornan is a member of the Air Force Association, American Legion, American He-
licopter Society, AMVETS, Association of Former Intelligence Officers, Association of Naval Aviation,
Knights of Columbus, Los Angeles Philanthropic Society, National Guard Association of California, Navy
League, and the Reserve Officers Association.<p>
<h2>Political</h2><p>
On December 17,1985, Congressman Dornan became the first member of Congress to
endorse for president then Vice President George Bush.  He seconded the nomination of Bush
for President at the New Orleans Republican National Convention on August 17, 1988.  During
the 1988 campaign, he campaigned in more states (34) than any other of Bush's surrogate
speakers.  In 1992, Congressman Dornan was again national co-chairman and California vice
chairman of the Bush for President campaign.<p>

<title>Richard Lugar: Biography</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Richard Lugar: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Senator, Farm Manager, Educator, Mayor, Entrepreneur, School Board Member,
Naval Officer, Rhodes Scholar, Valedictorian, Runner, Grandfather, Father,
Husband...Statesman.<p>
Richard Green Lugar-a fifth generation Hoosier-is the senior United States
Senator from Indiana. The former two-term mayor of Indianapolis was elected
to the Senate in 1976, and re-elected in 1982 and 1988.<p>
Surveys have shown that Lugar is the most popular public figure in Indiana;
he shattered all statewide election records in his last campaign, capturing
the most total votes, 1,430,525, greatest plurality, 761,737, highest
percentage, 68.1, and most counties, 91 of 92.<p>
<h2>National Leader in Agriculture, Nutrition, Forestry</h2><p>
While known as a valued national spokesman for U.S. interests in
international debate, Lugar is the highest ranking Republican official in
agricultural matters, as senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
Lugar often worked on his father's Marion County farm as a boy and
continues to actively manage the cultivation of its 604 acres of corn,
soybeans and trees.<p>
<h2>Outstanding Legislator</h2><p>
During his third Senate term, Lugar became the fourth person ever named
"Outstanding Legislator" by the American Political Science Association.
In addition to noting bills successfully authored by Lugar, the award
recognized his ability to extend his influence on policy and public opinion
beyond traditional limits of parliamentary debate. For example, Lugar is
credited with helping generate crucial political and public support for
U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf War by leading the national debate
with several bold policy statements-prodding the public, (Congress and the
Bush Administration) to action.<p>
<h2>Democracy's Advocate</h2><p>
During the 99th Congress (1985,'86), Lugar served as chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, restoring its power and eminence. In 1986,
Lugar entered the crucible of the Philippines presidential election, where
he recognized Corazon Aquino as the legitimate winner and spotlighted the
corrupt activities of supporters of former President Ferdinanci Marcos
ultimately convincing President Reagan to back Aquino.<p>
In 1993, Lugar was named to the prestigious Intelligence Committee by
Senate leadership recognition of the value of his involvement in nearly all
aspects of U.S. national security.<p>
As a Navy ensign in the late 1950's, Lugar served in the highly sensitive
position of naval intelligence briefer. He rose at 2:30 am, memorized
overnight intelligence reports from around the globe and summarized them
verbally for the Navy chief, CIA director and others. Lugar also briefed
President Eisenhower in the White House.<p>
Starting in 1991, Lugar and Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, of Georgia,
forged an effective bipartisan alliance aimed at prompt dismantlement and
conversion of the post-Cold War Soviet nuclear stockpile.<p>
<h2>International Trade Adds Hoosier Jobs</h2><p>
Lugar also promotes U.S. political, diplomatic and military leadership in
world affairs as a critical factor in domestic politics. Hailing from a
state which ranks among the very top exporters per capita, Lugar advocates
the expansion of global trade. He has sponsored trade conferences in
Indiana, and encourages foreign leaders to buy Indiana products.<p>
<h2>Progressive Mayor of Major City</h2><p>
As the former mayor of Indianapolis and president of the National League of
Cities (1970-'71), Lugar is an expert in economic development, housing and
other urban issues. As the chief executive of his hometown from 1968-'75,
Lugar revolutionized the very form and function of the nation's 12th
largest metropolitan government by unifying Indianapolis' downtown and
urban neighborhoods with surrounding suburban communities.<p>
Lugar is a running enthusiast who promotes health and nutrition programs.
As Roll Call Magazine stated: "Lugar is more than fast. He is in remarkable
overall physical condition, as tough as the limestone for which his state
is famous."<p>
<h2>The Fiscal Conservative</h2><p>
In Congress, Lugar supports the pro-growth policies of low taxes and tight
purse strings; he is an advocate of a balanced budget amendment and line
item veto. Lugar is known by his colleagues for discipline and fiscal
prudence, having maintained a 98 percent voting attendance records and
having voluntarily returned more than $2.4 million in office funds.<p>

<h2>Biographical Chronology</h2><p>
Dick Lugar was born April 4, 1932 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He graduated
first in his class with straight A's, both at Shortridge High School and
Denison University, in Ohio. Lugar was co-president of the student
government at Denison with his future wife, Charlene Smeltzer. They married
September 8, 1956 and have four sons and six grandchildren.<p>
Charlene has established an endowment fund for fighting birth defects and
infant deaths, in part through prenatal care provided aboard the
"Mom-mobile," which tours urban neighborhoods. She has said that her goal
is "to make Indiana the safest place in the world to have a baby."<p>
Dick Lugar graduated from Denison in 1954, then became a Rhodes Scholar in
Pembroke College at Oxford University. Next he volunteered for active duty
in the Navy, in which he served three years and four months. In 1960, Lugar
returned from the Pentagon to Indiana to help manage his family's farm and
food machinery firm, Thomas L. Green & Company. Founded by his grandfather,
the small manufacturing concern on Indianapolis' near west side celebrated
its 100th anniversary in 1993.<p>
Dick Lugar succeeded in his first run for public office when he won a seat
on the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners. Lugar then defied
odds-makers in 1967, winning the first of two mayoral terms. In 1976 Lugar
won a seat in the U.S. Senate, after an unsuccessful bid two years earlier.
After his reelection in 1982, he was elected to the Senate Leadership as
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In 1985, the
Republican caucus picked him to be chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee. Lugar was named the co-chairman of the Arms Control Observer
Group in 1985, and was appointed to the Intelligence Committee and
Congressional Reform Committee in 1993.<p>

THOUGHTS FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD ON DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT
<P>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee.  I was pleased to accept your invitation to discuss some corporate approaches to organization and downsizing and their possible relevance to the federal government.  I believe I do have a somewhat unusual perspective on this issue, having spent roughly 20 years in the corporate world.
<P>
I am pleased to be back in these chambers.  As a young member of the Congress during the 1960s, I had the opportunity to serve on this Committee when it was known as the Government Operations Committee.  At the beginning of my tenure, the government we oversaw was much smaller and simpler than the complex and overwhelming behemoth that so many of you in this Congress have pledged to reform.
<P>
With your permission, I thought what I would do this afternoon would be to merely summarize some of the concepts in my prepared text, which all of you have received in advance, and then allow the maximum amount of time for questions.
<P>
If my memory serves me correctly, one of the issues of my time in Congress was whether or not to close a dairy at the U.S. Naval Academy.  That example may be good for a laugh today, but those who tried to sell off the dairy were accused of not understanding the importance of a captive milk supply for the Midshipmen.  Heaven forbid that the Naval Academy would have to buy milk from the private sector like everyone else.
<P>
While that may seem like a trivial example compared with the sacred cows that must be challenged today if you are to balance the budget by 2002, the fact remains that the federal government is one of the few institutions that still thinks itself able to afford the luxury of sentimentality at taxpayers' expense.  Businesses eventually cannot afford to hold on to activities, people, practices, divisions or subsidiaries that have become not central to the core business, outmoded, inefficient or a financial drain on the rest of the company.  Rather, they have to figure out what they should and should not be doing and then take decisive action to get their financial affairs in order.  If they fail to do so, they die.
<P>
When taking over a troubled company, a knowledgeable CEO checks his or her "teeth to tail" ratio, as they say in the military.  It involves undertaking a thorough review of the company's assets and resources and then promptly divesting those that are not central to the future success of the institution.  This forces the company to focus on its "core" business and to avoid wasting manpower, time and money on ventures that are secondary to what is vital to the long-term health and success of the company.
<P>
A good example of a corporation recently undergoing such a top-to-bottom restructuring is Sears, Roebuck and Company.  Sears in recent years decided to move from a widely diversified company to a company focused on its core businesses.  During this restructuring it closed a hundred unprofitable stores, took Dean-Witter, Discover, Allstate Corporation, PMI, and S.P.S. public, sold off unneeded assets and even disposed of the famed Sear Tower in Chicago.  Some of the cash raised from these sales was used to buy out thousands of middle managers, and the rest was plowed back in to strengthen its basic businesses.
<P>
One of the most painful and visible aspects of their restructuring was the decision to close Sears' catalog division--the business on which Sears was built.  The truth is that the catalog division was unprofitable and a drain on the company's main businesses.  As difficult as it was, however, this break with the past told Sears stockholders that management was serious about fundamentally restructuring the company and putting it on a path for growth.
<P>
The experience at Sears, and the experiences at hundreds of other companies, including two I helped to downsize--G.D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company, and General Instrument Corporation, an electronics company--can provide valuable lessons on how to and how not to downsize and overhaul the federal government.  There is no one formula for successfully reorganizing a major corporation or the federal government, beyond the fact that it requires making tough, serious decisions, and it is often easier for someone from outside the institution who understands that this is his or her assignment to do it than it is for an insider.  Also, not surprisingly, it is best done by someone who knows how to do it.
<P>

<B> Define The "Core" Business</B>
<P>
As overseers of the federal government, an institution which, for the sake of discussion, is arguably in Chapter XI, Members of Congress will need to treat the job of restructuring it in the same urgent, tough-minded manner so many corporations around the country are now doing.  The goal must be to earn back the confidence of the taxpayers, who are the real stockholders of the federal government.  This does not mean simply "patching," as management guru Peter Drucker has characterized Vice President Gore and his associates of doing.  The reason National Performance Review (NPR) efforts have received so little public attention, said Drucker, is that:
<P>

"In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway.  They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own--without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards."(1)

<P>
Certainly the NPR is a worthwhile effort -- a good idea.  But, much more is needed.  Techniques such as Total Quality Management, procurement reforms, or streamlining middle management will improve government, but they will only affect the problems in government programs at the margins.  Well-intended corporate managers have used the same sort of techniques and still failed or suffered.  It is vital that many of these things be done, but only after one has decided and dealt with the more central issues of what businesses to be in.
<P>
The first task is to decide what the core business is.  Once this decision is made, then everything else is secondary.  For the federal government, the four basic departments -- State, Defense, Justice, and Treasury -- have a solid basis for existence.  The other departments were either more narrowly based, were an afterthought, or both.  Some had utility when they were established, but no longer do.  Others, in my view, probably did not have a need to be at the Cabinet level even when they were first established.  A number of them were recommended and created less for organizational reasons and more to gain favor with a particular interest group.  Once one has determined the core functions to be performed by the federal government, all other activities should be scrutinized for elimination, downsizing, reorganization, movement to state and local governments or privatization.
<P>
I begin with the conviction that the first place activities should be undertaken is with the individual citizens and private organizations; next, if government must be involved, by local governments, state governments, and only last by the federal government.  In the past, this was not a workable principle in some instances because of the issue of civil rights, even though in theory it was compelling and rational.  It was clear that if some activities were left to local or state government or to individuals there would not be appropriate protection against discrimination.  Given the many civil rights laws on the books today and the progress that has been made, it is no longer the problem it was in earlier periods.  Today government services are being delivered to minorities in a nondiscriminatory manner.
<P>
My conviction is that as overseers of the federal government, Congress ought to use federal solutions only as a last resort.  The question must be asked whether a problem is truly a federal responsibility, or can it better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, by local governments, or state governments.  I understand how difficult this is in Washington, DC, given the fact that all the institutional pressures seem to run the other direction.  But I'm reminded of a sage warning former Missouri Congressman Tom Curates once said, "Public money drives out private money."  And it does.

<P>
<B> Cut Sharply and Rapidly</B>
<P>
I read an article recently which set out some useful advice on downsizing from CEO Al Dunlap, who apparently did a skillful and swift job of restructuring Scott Paper Co.  On downsizing, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Do it once, do it severely, and get it over with.  When a company says it is going to restructure over the next three years it won't happen . . . Don't do it!  You paralyze the company."(2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is sound advice for the Congress as it undertakes the massive task of balancing the federal budget by the year 2002.  Cut severely and rapidly.  Don't wait.  Whatever it is you do the odds are overwhelming that you should have done more, rather than less, and that you should have done it sooner, rather than later.  There are so many pressures in Washington, D.C., to keep the status quo, that the most frequent mistake is to make too few changes or to cut too little.  If in fact one cuts too much, which is very rare -- indeed probably unprecedented -- it is easy to add back.  But, once you cut and then find you have to go back and cut again, it is harmful to an organization.  Do it once.  Do it well.  Don't under do it.  And then let people get back to work.  Don't try to cut the dog's tail off one inch at a time, hoping it won't hurt as much.
<P>
And, a caution.  After the reductions have been accomplished, don't turn your head for a second or you will find the waste moving right back in.  It is inevitable that it will happen, and fast, unless the overseers are vigilant.  As the saying goes, "If you're coasting, you're going down hill."
<P>
Although the balanced budget plan drafted by the House Budget Committee is remarkable in its specificity and scope, in my view it ignores the principle of "cutting decisively and rapidly," in that it proposes phasing out some programs and agencies over a period of three to five years.  If a program or agency is outmoded and inefficient, phasing out its funding over a period of time will not make it less so.  For instance, I agree with those who propose to eliminate taxpayer funding for Amtrak, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and dozens of other programs that are not, or are at least no longer, appropriate federal responsibilities.  But why inflict on these programs the "death of a thousand cuts."
<P>
If Amtrak, for example, should be given the flexibility and the challenge to compete in the private sector, then why can't it be done sooner, say over the next 12 months, rather than over the next five years?  My advice is to sever public ties with much greater speed.
<P>
The Small Business Administration continues to dodge reform.  It was not even ten years old during my freshman term, yet, in a 1963 article on pork barrel spending, Life magazine exposed the SBA as a new "device for soaking up money and getting rid of it."  Based upon its early track record, we should have had the good judgment to close down the SBA decades ago.  I hope that this Congress will have the courage to act this year.  It is never to be desired, but given the current budget situation, good intentions and throwing money at problems hoping some of it will stick and do some good is unacceptable.

<P>
<B> Downsize</B>
<P>
I also recommend that Congress move swiftly to cut management and get personnel costs under control.  It is guaranteed that there are more managers and more staff in the federal government than are needed.  In less than seven months, Scott Paper eliminated 11,200 people, one-third of the work force.  The company cut 71 percent of the headquarters staff, 50 percent of management, and 20 percent of the hourly employees.  They discovered they really weren't needed.
<P>
Another example is G.D. Searle & Co., where I served from 1977 to 1985.  There we reduced the centralized corporate activities down to about 20 percent of their prior size, divested some 30 to 35 businesses, sold a variety of assets, downsized the company to close to 65 percent of its prior employee base, with the not surprising result that it worked better, earned more, and investors and owners moved the stock from about $12 a share to $50 to $60 a share.
<P>
So too at General Instrument Corporation where I served from 1990 to 1993.  There we divested five or six businesses, sold a number of assets, downsized and focused on the core business, and dramatically reduced the size of corporate headquarters, with the result that the investors and owners of the company moved the stock from below $15 a share to $50 a share.
<P>
There are hundreds of companies that are doing the same thing.  Some do it after they should have, others do it ahead of the curve.  Some wait too long, and they suffer and die.  Clearly the U.S. government is well behind the curve.
<P>
No doubt the federal government suffers even more waste on a percentage basis throughout the bureaucracy than even poorly run companies.  According to the NPR, the federal government has over 280,000 persons formally classified as "supervisors, managers, and executives, all of whom perform control functions, costing billions of dollars."  "At times," reports the NPR, "the federal government's management control system resembles a theater of the absurd."3    To make the point, if one used the Scott Paper model on downsizing as a guide, theoretically some 140,000 of these managers could be cut immediately, saving taxpayers billions of dollars.  For example, I see fewer and fewer companies where every manager has a special assistant or two.  But in government, it seems even special assistants have assistants.  Don't get me wrong.  I used to be one and I used to have one or two.  And I suspect many of you do.  Indeed, some are needed.  But, the revolution in information technology has changed the way work can be done so that excessive layering of organizations can be avoided.
<P>
<B> Reordering the Flow Chart</B>
<P>
There are a variety of ways to merge federal agencies and departments, and certainly no one way is perfect.  For example, over 20 years ago, Richard Nixon and the Ash Commission recommended that there be four basic areas:  defense, foreign policy, the economic, and domestic.  One can find powerful reasons for either merging or terminating many of the newer departments.  Some of their functions will, or course, need to continue, but certainly much of the overhead is not necessary.
<P>
While I have no special insight as to which is the preferred way to reorganize our government, I am persuaded that probably one-half to two-thirds of the non-central departments are no longer needed in their current form.  For example, the Republican proposal to close down the 93-year-old Department of Commerce seems reasonable to me.  It lacks a clear sense of mission and the fact that it duplicates the work of dozens of other departments and agencies is a sign that taxpayers could do without it in its present form.  The same could likely be said for others of the newer departments, such as Energy, HUD, Education, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Appalachian Regional Commission and EDA.  For example, the veterans were served before the VA was made a Cabinet rank department, as they should have been.  And they can be well-served, possibly better served, if it were to move out of the Cabinet and have some of its functions turned over to the private sector.

<P>
<B> Don't Micromanage</B>
<P>
There is no one perfect organizational arrangement.  The right people can make a poor organizational structure work well, and wrong people will assure that the best possible organizational arrangement will work poorly.  People are the key.  That is why the delays in the Presidential appointment process have been so damaging.  In many cases, cabinet and sub-cabinet posts have not been filled until after a non-trivial fraction of their entire term is over.
<P>
An important rule for a corporate board is to avoid trying to micromanage the CEO and the company.  Boards need to give management the direction to be sure, but also the freedom to run the company in the most effective and profitable way they see fit, and then hold them accountable.  One of the problems in government, and something that contributes to waste and mismanagement of the Executive branch.  My recollection from my days in the Executive branch is that Congress imposes so many restrictions, requirements, and requests on the Executive branch, no one of which is debilitating, but in the aggregate are like the threads the Lilliputians used to prevent Gulliver from moving.  This was certainly a problem at the Pentagon and I suspect still is, because of the blizzard of requests for studies and the directives and rules generated by the multiplicity of Congressional committees and subcommittees.  I want to commend you for taking steps to reduce the number of committees and subcommittees earlier this year.  It was a good start.
<P>
However, smaller government is an unachievable goal if Congress continues to try to tell the Executive branch when to turn right, turn left, speed up, or slow down.  What Congress needs to do is tell the Executive branch generally the direction to go, where the sides of the road are, and what the speed limit is.  Then Congress should stand back, oversee, and evaluate the administration on how well they do it, and if necessary calibrate the directions or change the drivers.  Too many hands on the steering wheel will put the truck in the ditch.

<P>
<B> Big Government and Big Business</B>
<P>
Anytime anyone proposes a change, there will be opposition and concern.  Change is not easy for people.  However, the fact that there is opposition and concern about proposed changes does not mean that the changes are undesirable.  Indeed change in both people and organizational assignment can bring in fresh thinking and approaches.  Certainly the entire country has seen the fresh breeze blowing through the Congress since the changes earlier this year.  It is refreshing, as even a number of my friends from the new Minority agree.
<P>
In Washington, D.C., change is a particular problem for several reasons.  Any change in the Executive branch tends to result in changes in people and organizational structure.  The effect is that it makes life less certain for people in the bureaucracy, which not surprisingly they resist.  It also makes life difficult for those they deal with -- Washington lawyers and lobbyists.  These folks have invested many, many years in the relationships and knowledge they have achieved, which, for them, is the coin of the realm.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that they often become the earliest and most effective opponents of change.  This is not because they think the change is unwise or unnecessary, but because they could lose their investment in the people and the structure as currently arranged.  They would have to start over again developing such relationships and knowledge.  This is certainly not a reason not to change.
<P>
Further, any change proposed in the Executive branch tends to result in difficulties for Congressional committees in that jurisdictions of committees can be affected.  There will be winners and losers.  Therefore, the predictable result of any proposed change tends to be that some Members of the Congress oppose it.  Here again, it is not a reason not to change.
<P>
It is important not to lose sight of the reality that Washington, D.C. is arranged in a way that only large companies are able to hire the lawyers, lobbyists, and representatives necessary to effectively interact with the Executive branch of the federal government and the Legislative branch to their advantage.  Only large companies have the resources to stay the course while the Executive departments and agencies study and delay decisions on matters that directly affect them.  Indeed, that is a competitive advantage large companies have -- they have the resources and they have the staying power.  Big businesses have the institutional capability to effectively interact with big government.  That is not true of small businesses.  Dealing with the federal government can suck the very life out of small companies that have to compete with big businesses in trying to avoid having government unintentionally take actions that are harmful to them.
<P>

<B> A Thought for Congress</B>
<P>
Thirty years ago, I testified before the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress.  One of my recommendations was to terminate the practice whereby Members of the House and Senate frequently announce federal grants, contracts and projects in their states and districts.  It didn't happen.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I said then:
<P>
" . . . to encourage or assist Members (of Congress) in making initial announcements of Federal grants, projects, and particularly Federal contracts, leaves at least a shadow of a question as to whether or not the contract or project was awarded solely, as it should have been, on factors such as cost, performance, and national interest.  I would think that a procurement officer or Corps of Engineers' official, for example, who based his decisions on needs, cost, and performance, would not be pleased to see Members' announcements of these contracts or projects leaving the impression that they may have influenced his decision."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

I suggest that government likely would shrink if Members ended this policy and thereby eliminated the incentive to have the federal government become involved in so many activities that belong in the private sector or in state or local government.  In short, implementing that recommendation would help.  As long as this practice remains, the incentive will be upside down and more and more activities are likely to move toward Washington, D.C.

<P>
<B> Privatization Insures Accountability</B>
<P>
"Corporacy" is a term relating to the private sector, meaning corporate "bureaucrats running corporations for their own good and the shareholder be damned."  Fortunately, and not surprisingly, the competitive marketplace punishes companies that become "corporacies."  Indeed, the most valuable thing that exists in business and in the non-governmental sector is the opportunity to fail.  And fear of failure focuses the mind.  Government programs are effectively insulated from the rigors of the marketplace and therefore are denied the possibility of failure.  The task for government is to find some substitutes or proxies for the possibility of failure -- for the "bottom line" -- in business.  One approach would be to have more "sunset" provisions to force legislative review after a period of years.  While not always appropriate, one other essential way of bringing this  level of accountability to the delivering of services is privatization.
<P>
Some thirty years ago, Nobel Prize Economist Milton Friedman told me that the best way of curing the problems of waste and inefficiency in the U.S. Postal System, then the Post Office Department, was to amend the law so it would no longer be a monopoly, and thereby would be forced to compete.  He was correct.  I have questions about some of the so-called "government-owned" corporations.  One effect can be to insulate such an activity from being accountable to either the marketplace or to Congress.  And, everyone needs to be accountable to someone.  The U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak are two examples.  Still other so-called government corporations, such as the Legal Services Corporation, aren't really corporations.  All the word "corporation" in the their title does is befuddle and confuse.
<P>
Certainly a number of these activities should be cut loose from taxpayers' purse and allowed the privilege of competing in the marketplace.  Competition is what brings out the best in people and organizations.  As the saying goes, "it is your enemies who make you strong."  I am attracted to the idea of divestiture or privatization of a number of government-owned enterprises such as the Air Traffic Control System, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, the Government Printing Office, public housing, defense stockpiles, and unneeded federal buildings and real estate.  I have no view as to whether it might make sense to make some of these activities "corporatized" government agencies as an interim step toward full divestiture.  In some cases, such a step might be useful in getting the some enterprise's books in order, providing time to inventory their assets, and in preparation for selling them off to people who know how to run such activities.
<P>

<B> Asset Sales</B>
<P>
I have trouble understanding why the federal government should be borrowing over $200 billion per year to cover its deficit when it is sitting on billions worth of assets that could and should be sold to the private sector to raise cash and which would then be forced to operate on a more cost-effective basis.  As the Dunlap article points out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Inside every corporation is the biggest bank one is ever going to find -- its own assets.  My philosophy is, before you go looking for outside funding, look inside first at what you don't need.  We sold S.D. Warren, a paper subsidiary, for $1.6 billion.  It was a fine company but I believe you can't be in two capital intensive businesses and do well at both.  We sold other operations and have another $1 billion of assets on the block.  We are on track to be debt-free in 1995.  All this from a company that was heavily in debt, whose bonds weren't investment grade, when I arrived."
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some twenty years ago, I chaired the Property Review Board in the Nixon Administration, which supervised the review of literally hundreds of federal real properties for movement to their highest and best use outside of government.  The resistance in both the Executive and Legislative branches was enormous.  That opportunity is still there and, given the current budget situation, must be seized.
<P>
Unfortunately, I am told that for the past decade or so, asset sales have been seen as somewhat of a gimmick here in Washington, D.C.  It is not a gimmick in the business world and need not be seen as such in government.  The goal of such sales is to use unneeded or under-utilized assets to reduce liabilities and to free up funds to be focused on more important needs.  This is a business-like strategy I believe the U.S. Government could usefully adopt.  I understand that the Majority's balanced budget plan does target a number of assets for sale to the private sector such as the Power Marketing Administration, the Helium Program, and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation.
<P>
That would be a start, but there are billions of dollars in assets which could still be tapped to reduce government's borrowing.  For example, the Heritage Foundation, in its very useful study, has suggested selling the government's $150 billion portfolio of direct loans to the secondary market.  This is an idea that could generate as much as $100 billion in cash.  Such steps could save taxpayers billions in future interest payments as well as have the advantage of moving such assets out of the government and into the more productive private sector.
<P>

<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
As the Congress goes about the business of putting meat on the bones of the balanced budget plan passed last month, it will have to make tough decisions.  I recognize the difficulty of that task, having served here in the House.  But I've learned that the decisions that are made every day in the corporate world are sometimes even more difficult, because the very survival of a company can be at stake.  The choices you make affect people with real careers, mortgages, and families to raise, to be sure.  But since you oversee an enterprise facing bankruptcy, you can have confidence that the decisions you make, however tough, can help to restore the long-term health of the government, our economy, and our country.
<P>
I thank you for this opportunity to share these thoughts, and I would be happy to entertain questions.

<blockquote>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
<P>
It is a pleasure to address this Committee on a subject which
has wrought enormous devastation on large parts of American society.
It has been well documented that during the last 15 years, American
society has experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.
Almost every social pathology got worse, and many got much worse.
But during this pedod--specifically from 1979 to 1992--there
was one area where we made significant progress: curbing drug
use. Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of
drugtaking which began in 1993 and continues to get worse.
<P>
The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural
shift. During the late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was
widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun
or mere selfindulgence.  But by the late 1970s and throughout
the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use became impossible
to deny, it became increasingly -- and far more accurately --
seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.
<P>
Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even
the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.
Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many
states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies. As a result,
overall drug use went down. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s,
casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty percent. Between
1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declilied by almost eighty
percent. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.
<P>
But last year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.
 Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise. According
to the latest study from the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, one in four students has used illegal drugs
before reaching high school; among 8th graders, 13 percent say
they have smoked marijuana in the last year ~ double the rate
of 1991; and over 40 percent of all 10th graders and nearly 50
percent of all 12th graders have used some illicit drug, induding
LSD, inhalants, stimulants, barbiturates, and cocaine and crack.
<P>
And hospital emergencyroom visits -- dominated by aging, inner
city drug addicts -- have increased to the highest number ever.
Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to
new levels.
<P>
In the words of the Michigan study's principal investigator, Lloyd
D. Johnston, the drug trend is &quot;a problem that is getting
worse at a fairly rapid pace,&quot; and is being abetted by a
dedine in peer disapproval and a general softening of teenagers'
attitudes towards drugs.
<P>
These findings are part of a disturbing pattern, in a series of
studies which have documented a sharp rise in drug use. This increase
in drug use<B> should</B> have mobilized the federal government
to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the
law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens. Instead,
the Clinton administration has abdicated its responsibility. The
Clinton administration has been AWOL in the war on drugs. It has
said or done little to encourage those fighting the good fight
and has proposed fundatientally misguided policies. Indeed, it
has shown much more interest in the baseball strike than in the
devastation of the young by drugs. Consider the record:
<UL>
<LI>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office
of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80 percent.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Soon after assuming of fice, Attorney General Janet Reno announced
that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for
drug trafficking and related federal crimes. Her focus? She is
engaged in a neverending search for the &quot;root causes&quot;
of crime and drug use.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for
a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions
of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the PBI, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and other federal agencies. It is to the United States
Congress's credit that this proposal was largely rejected.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100
drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut
in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs
from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment
strategy that will do little to target hardcore users.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Last year, the Clinton Administration directed the US. Military
to stop providing radar tracking of cocaine trafficker aircraft
to Colombia and Peru.  Congress again had to reverse this senseless
policy directive.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This week, for the first time in history, the nation's drug
control strategy was introduced without the participation of the
president.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>If present trends continue, by 1996 the Clinton Administration
will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern
American history.</I> And let me reiterate: this will have occurred
after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent
between <TT>1979 </TT>(the peak) and <TT>1992, </TT>and a reduction
of almost <TT>80 </TT>percent in cocaine use between <TT>1985
</TT>(the peak for cocaine) and <TT>1992.</TT>
<P>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.
The Clinton admir istration suffers from moral torpor on this
issue. Policy follows attitude. In 1991, when asked about his
past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never &quot;broken
any drug law.&quot; A year later, he admitted that when he was
in England, he had experimented with marijuana but &quot;I didn't
like it. I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again.&quot; Later,
when asked whether he would inhale if he had it to do over again,
he answered, to laughter: &quot;Sure, if I could. I tried before.&quot;
<P>
Keep in mind, too, that former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
has been the administration's most prominent voice on drugs during
the last two years. Throughout her tenure, Dr. Elders had favorable
words to say about drug legalization. And apparently her dismissal
had nothing to do with her irresponsible and outspoken views on
drug policy.
<P>
These statements&#151;as well as massive policy failures&#151;are
significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals
they send. One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic
to occur in the first plate was the collapse of institutional
authority. Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it
stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who served as
President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that &quot;cocaine is
probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread
use.&quot; Today such institutional collapse is echoed in some
segments of the public Just yesterday a Baltimore grand jury recommended
that marijuana be &quot;decriminalized&quot; and that other drugs,
such as cocaine and heroin, be distributed to addicts by doctors.
It's time for all of us to reread <I>A Brave New World.</I>
<P>
Government officials, through legislation and public discourse,
can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts. In a free society,
few things matter more than speaking about the right things in
the right way&#151;and making moral common sense the touchstone
of social policy.
<P>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her &quot;Just
Say No&quot; campaign. But it turns out that &quot;Just Say No&quot;
is far more effective than &quot;I didn't inhale.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first
two years of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless
poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations. But
today, on one of the issues that disproportionately harms the
poor&#151;that is wiping out many of the children of the poor&#151;he
and his administration have demonstrated indifference.
<P>
That being said, the question remains: where do we go from here?
During the question and answer time, I expect to get into some
spedfics of an effective drug strategy. But here, briefly, is
a framework for what I think would work based on my experience
in the Bush administration.
<P>
If we mean to renew our efforts in the fight against drugs, the
federal government needs to do a number of things. They include
allowing communities to choose their own antidrug priorities by
combining federal antidrug support with that from states and localities;
putting the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal
drugs from abroad, and giving the military control over the entire
interdiction process. We need to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocainesource countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine, and require the Attorney
General first to identify all major drug trafficking organizations
known to be operating in the U.S. and then to create a plan to
dismantle them. In short, there is a lot which the federal government
ought to be doing which it is not now doing.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by making an obvious but often
overlooked point: success in the drug war depends above all on
the efforts of parents and schools and churches and police chiefs
and judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush's
&quot;drug czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made
a point to go where the problem was the worst and to visit and
to learn from the people who made things better. I saw, as just
one example, Reuben Greenberg's heroic efforts in Charleston,
South Carolina, where he cut the crime rate to its lowest point
since the 1950s. I went to public housing projects and innercity
schools and drug treatment programs; I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies. The
people I visited and people all over the country are doing great
work. Ant that work will surely go on. But they deserve to have
the federal government meet its responsibilities, too. And right
now, that's not happening.  It's a disgrace.

<title> THE FORGOTTEN CRISIS: S. 1120, WELFARE REFORM, AND ILLEGITIMACY -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>THE FORGOTTEN CRISIS: S. 1120, WELFARE REFORM, AND ILLEGITIMACY</h3></i>
<p>
By Robert Rector <br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Committee Brief No. 18<br>	
August 18, 1995<br></center>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
	The Work, Family and Community Welfare Replacement Act, a legislative proposal by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and John Ashcroft (R-MO), contained eight provisions to address the crisis of rising illegitimacy. President Clinton and the Democratic leadership in the Senate are silent on addressing this issue. S. 1120, the Republican leadership bill, contains only one of these provisions:  findings about the ill effects of illegitimacy on society. (1) The remaining seven provisions to reduce illegitimacy which, though part of the Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal, should be included in S. 1120 are:
<P><ol>
<li><b>Voluntary State Goals and Plans.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal required states to set numerical goals for their illegitimacy ratios for the next ten years. (The illegitimacy ratio is the ratio of out-of-wedlock births to total births within the state.) States also were required to develop plans to reduce illegitimacy, setting their own goals with no penalty if the goals were not met.
<p>
	The intention of the goals and state plans was to focus public attention on the explosive growth in illegitimacy. Liberal Republicans and Democrats in Congress have rejected this approach.
<p>
<li><b>The Illegitimacy Ratio Bonus Mechanism.</b> This provision would increase the amount of a state's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) block grant if the state reduced its illegitimate birth ratio without an increase in its abortion rate.
<p>
	The National Right to Life Committee accepted this provision, while pro-abortion groups objected to it. It was excluded from S. 1120.
<p>
<li><b>Abstinence Education.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal set aside additional funds for abstinence education. 
<p>
	 S. 1120 is silent on this subject.
<p>
<li><b>Pro-Marriage Tax Credit.</b> Welfare punishes marriage and rewards illegitimacy. The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal attempted to offset partially the anti-marriage effects of welfare by creating a refundable pro-marriage tax credit. The credit would be available only to married couples with children where at least one spouse was employed. It would have a maximum value of $500 and would be available to families with earned income between $8,000 and $26,000.
<p>
	S. 1120 contains no pro-marriage provisions.
<p>
<li><b>Paternity Requirement.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal required that mothers establish paternity in order to obtain future AFDC benefits. The bill stipulated that to obtain federal cash assistance for a child born after January 1996, the mother would have to establish paternity. States would be free to exempt 25 percent of the relevant mothers from this requirement. In addition, mothers of newborn children who have not yet established paternity but were cooperating by providing father's name, address, and other identifying information could receive cash aid for the first six months of the child's life while the paternity process was being completed.
<p>
	S. 1120 is silent on this issue.
<p>
<li><b>No Cash to Unwed Teenagers.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal prohibited federal funds from being used for cash aid to girls under 18 who had children out of wedlock. States would be free to use their own funds to give cash aid to this group if they wished. 
<p>
	 S. 1120 merely permits states to restrict cash benefits to unwed teenage mothers; this provision is, at best, redundant since under a block grant a state has full authority to set eligibility. Thus, the bill offers little or nothing specifically to combat illegitimacy and actually may limit state efforts (see below).
<p>
<li><B>Family Cap.</B> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal prohibited the use of federal funds to give increased cash aid to women who have additional children while already enrolled in AFDC. States would be able to use their own funds to increase benefits if they chose. 
<p>
	 By contrast, S. 1120 permits, but does not require, states to establish a family cap. Like the leadership's family cap on teenage mothers, this is redundant under a block grant. Moreover, states can obtain a waiver to implement the family cap under current law, so S. 1120 offers no real change from the status quo.
</ul><p>


<b>Provisions on Teenagers Residing at Home</b>
<p>
	S. 1120 states that for an unmarried teen mother to receive cash aid, she must reside in a supervised setting or with her parents or with an adult relative. This provision is virtually copied from the Clinton plan. The problem with it is that some 60 percent to 70 percent of teenage mothers on AFDC already reside with adult relatives. The bill simply replicates the status quo and calls it reform. Even worse, in many cases, the adult parent is the problem:  the adult parent of the teenage mother herself is most likely a single mother who had a child out of wedlock and became dependent on AFDC. Now the teenage daughter is repeating her mother's pattern by having a child out of wedlock and applying for welfare.
<p>
	This provision of S. 1120 would perpetuate and intensify multi-generational welfare dependence. To have any positive impact, it at least should be amended to provide that teenage mothers can receive cash aid only if they reside with adult relatives who themselves do not have a history of AFDC dependence. Otherwise the teenage mother should receive only non-cash aid or should be required to reside in a closely supervised group setting.
<p>

<b>Excluding Marriage From the State Performance Standards</b>
<p>
	There is a pervasive anti-marriage tone to the entire Senate leadership bill when compared with the House-passed H.R. 4. 
<p>
	 For example, H.R. 4 allows states full credit for reductions in caseload which occur because AFDC mothers have married and left the welfare rolls. Both H.R. 4 and the Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal create a broad performance criterion to measure a state's success by its "caseload reduction."  States receive credit for caseload reductions that occur because of a decrease in out-of-wedlock births, because of an increase in marriage, or because of an increase employment of single mothers.
<p>
	This broad pro-marriage emphasis in H.R. 4 has been replaced with a narrow focus on employing single mothers under S. 1120. For example, under H.R. 4 a state is given equal credit if an AFDC mother gets off welfare through marriage or by getting a job. But under the leadership bill, the state receives credit only if the single mother obtains a job. The anti-marriage bias of S. 1120 can be corrected, in part, by replacing the narrow performance measure, with its emphasis on exits through employment, (2) with the broader measure of caseload reduction used in the House bill.
<p>

<b>Leadership Bill May Limit State Actions to Reduce Illegitimacy</b>
<p>
	Under the leadership bill, states have the authority, if they wish, to establish a family cap or to restrict cash aid to unmarried mothers under age 18. As noted, these provisions are redundant since, under the block grant, the states can set their own standards of eligibility. In fact, inserting these provisions into the block grant easily could be interpreted by the courts as a restriction barring a state from taking more forceful action against illegitimacy. For example, the S. 1120 provision allowing states to restrict cash aid to unwed mothers under age 18 might be interpreted as barring a state government from restricting aid to never-married mothers aged 18 and 19. The leadership provision, as worded, may create an entitlement to aid for never-married mothers over age 18. Legal aid offices certainly will argue that it does. To avoid this problem, the provision at least should be clarified to assert that no restriction on stronger state policies to reduce illegitimacy is intended.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
	The Clinton and Senate leadership positions on marriage and illegitimacy currently are virtually identical. Both would have the effect of preserving a welfare system that actually promotes illegitimacy and destroys marriage, while making reforms that only tinker around the edges of current law.

<blockquote>
<P>
A year ago, when I announced that I would not seek the republican presidential nomination, I had hoped that the broad field of candidates in the GOP would produce a clear consensus on how the next Republican president would usher America into the 21st century.  Americans had gone to the polls in 1994 and rejected special-interest politics.  By electing the new Republican majority to Congress, voters sent a clear and loud signal that they wanted its leaders to stop clinging to the past and begin moving America forward again.
<P> 
Unfortunately, since that landmark election, we Republicans have seemed unable to escape our old conventional wisdom.  The dialogue within my party has focused on patching up a hopelessly flawed tax code, and even that discussion is hamstrung by our self-defeating preoccupation with the federal budget deficit. 
<P>
<B>Deeper Maladies</B> 
<P>
It is not that deficits don't matter, they emphatically do--in the same way that a high fever matters.  Both are symptoms of much deeper maladies.  In the case of deficits, the real malady is the anemic rate of growth in the economy and a political system that has lost the ability to set national priorities.  It is not enough just to say that government is too big and that it overspends.  The problem is that the economy isn't growing fast enough to accommodate the level of spending produced through the democratic process. 
<P>
In a recent essay on this page ("Recipe for Growth," April 11), Felix Rohatyn suggested that the first step toward reviving robust economic growth is to forge an entente between the parties, centered on an agreement that increasing economic growth is our nation's highest and first priority.  I agree.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if both parties were debating how to double the rate of economic growth rather than seeing who can get the most tax credits and targeted tax cuts into the existing Internal Revenue Code? 
<P>
Mr. Rohatyn offers the following suggestion to the Democratic Party:  Stop using the federal tax system to redistribute income from the "haves" to the "have nots."  He appeals to his fellow Democrats to shift their focus to growing the economy so that the "have nots" have more. 
<P>
To Republicans, I humbly suggest that we make it possible for Democrats to give up their quest for redistribution of income and wealth by our acceptance of an appropriate role for government in financing those public goods and services necessary to secure a social safety net below which no American would be allowed to fall.  Equally important, we must agree on rebuilding a ladder of hope and opportunity that all our people can climb to reach their full potential.
<P>
The huge government bureaucracy we now confront was created over the last 60 years with good intentions, but with a redistributionist philosophy that led to counterproductive results.  In the face of this reality, we Republicans make a serious mistake when we try to economize first on social programs.  It allows us to be characterized as putting the "cart" of fiscal austerity before the "horse" of rapid economic growth. 
<P>
Yes, a number of programs need to be eliminated, many need to be restructured, and there are a multitude of things government does that it should not be doing.  But determining which programs to cut or eliminate or restructure should be undertaken within the context of determining what is the proper role of government and how government should fulfill that role. 
<P>
So, if I were advising the next president, I would recommend that he not ask Congress to fiddle with, adjust or patch up the current tax code.  Any attempt to fix it up around the edges will only reopen old partisan wounds and invite groups with vested interests in the current system to swarm the halls of Congress.  Let's not patch the current tax system, let's replace it. 
<P>
It should come as no surprise that, as co-author of the Kemp-Roth tax rate reduction plan around which Ronald Reagan built his economic growth agenda, I would support proposals to cut income tax rates across the board.  In my opinion, however, any tax bill the new president sends to Congress must be enacted within the first 100 days of his new administration so that the key congressional committees can clear the decks for the historic task of writing a new system from scratch.  A more drawn-out process of tinkering with "down payments," such as tax credits and targeted tax cuts, will drain too much energy from the new congress and in all likelihood will lead again to an inconclusive result.  Such tinkering might even prevent the necessary restructuring of the tax system. 
<P>
The real way for the new president to make a down payment on tax reform and get the economy growing rapidly again would be by issuing two complementary executive orders.  First, the president should instruct the Treasury secretary to index against inflation the treatment of capital gains, retroactively as well as prospectively.  This action would instantly remove the tax liabilities on several trillion dollars worth of capital assets--mostly farm and real property but also including considerable financial assets held long term--that are purely the result of inflation and are not real capital gains at all.  While there remains a partisan dispute over the treatment of genuine capital gains, there has been broad bipartisan agreement that inflated gains should not be taxed. 
<P>
Second, the new president should instruct the Treasury secretary to stabilize the dollar value of the nation's gold reserves, say within a $30 band, as a critical first step toward restoring sound money to America.  This action would reinstate the dollar/gold link that was broken in 1971, which led to the most severe run of inflation in our nation's history.
<P>
The new president would find significant support for this move both in Congress and at the Fed.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated repeatedly that he places a high value on gold as an indicator of inflation expectations.  This move would pave the way for Congress to enact Sen. Connie Mack's (R., Fla.) complimentary legislation establishing price-level stability as the Federal reserve's sole objective and requiring the Fed to establish explicit indicators by which to achieve this objective. 
<P>
Restoring the dollar/gold link is the surest proven method of taking the risk out of the dollar and all other government debt.  It has long been my belief that it will never be possible to balance the federal budget without some kind of dollar/gold link.  For every percentage point that interest rates fall, the federal government would have more than $50 billion a year in interest outlays on its current $5.1 trillion national debt.  That means we could save $1 trillion in debt-service costs during the next decade by refinancing the national debt at the much lower interest rates that would result when the risk of inflation was removed from the dollar. 
<P>
The lower interest rates--eventually as low as 3% on 30-year bonds and 4% on 30-year mortgages--also would foster a dramatic increase in private-sector capital formation.  Economists in both parties, supply-siders and demand-siders alike, agree that the living standards of wage earners can only rise with the kind of productivity increases that accompany rapid capital formation and lower long-term interest rates. 
<P>
<h4>Bipartisan Reorganization</h4> 
<P>
These two executive orders would create the kind of economic environment that would permit a genuine bipartisan reorganization of the responsibilities we entrust to the federal government.  Even the most liberal Democrats will acknowledge in private that many political tasks would be more efficiently handled at the state and local levels.  These Democrats strike a responsive chord with the electorate, though, when they argue against devolution of power in the current environment of economic anxiety and wage stagnation.  If Republicans continue to offer Democrats an inviting target, they will leap at the political advantage of resisting changes and derailing needed reforms in the name of protecting ordinary Americans against "extremist" Republicans. 
<P>
But if we consider the legitimate interests of all Americans, even those left behind, there is no reason why, with a suitable transition, we can't move steadily toward a low, single-rate, simplified tax system, as recommended by the Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which I was privileged to chair. 
<P>
The world "reform" is hardly sufficient to describe the work cut out for us.  In my 25 years in national politics, with rare exceptions, we have had one reform after another that has left us in worse shape than before.  We now have an opportunity for a one-in-a-lifetime reorganization of our federal government that is too obvious and important to be ignored.  History will not forgive us if we do.  As Ronald Reagan said, "If not us, who?  If not now, when?"

<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the 1970's, the Kerner Commission report sparked a national debate with its assessment of America as two cities, one black and one white, permanently divided into two almost irreconcilable classes.  While the divide which the Kerner Commission exposed was, in so far as it goes, a real and significant problem for the nation, the Commission's diagnosis was, in our opinion, wrong.  America is not divided into two classes based on race; it is divided into two economies.   
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our nation's macro economy is a democratic-capitalist economy, based on private property and rewards for productive human activity.  However, we also have a concurrent, micro economy that is almost a Third-World socialist welfare state that places barriers and impediments to productive human activity. This fact has become increasingly clear over the past two decades, and nowhere is it better illustrated than in our nation's capital, Washington, D.C.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In Washington, dire financial problems coupled with one of the highest marginal income tax rates in the country and a consequent middle class exodus have only emphasized the dichotomy between two coexisting economies:  a democratic capitalist, market-oriented, entrepreneurial economy which rewards work, investment, saving and productivity; and a second near-socialist economy which, though set up with noble intentions, places barriers to productive human and social activity and has a virtual absence of economic incentive. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1960, the population of the District has declined by 25 percent, as both black and white residents have escaped the burden of high taxes coupled with poor quality services and education.  This development simply compounds other economic and social problems in the capital city.    
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The reality is, the system in the District is in a crisis.  The capital city is in danger of falling victim to the inertia of the status quo.  And politically expedient, short-term solutions, while they may temporarily slow the decline in the capital's struggling economy, will not fix the underlying problem.   But in keeping with our national spirit of indomitable optimism, we view this crisis as an opportunity -- an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans, blacks and whites, conservatives and liberals, in both public and private sectors to work together to demonstrate incontrovertibly that freedom and free enterprise solutions work.
At this critical juncture in the District's history, the finger-pointing and acrimony over who's at fault for the various problems must end.  Virtually all parties, the Congress and the D.C. government, have had a hand in allowing the problems to escalate to this serious level.  And likewise, we must together find ways to heal and rebuild the District into a shining city on a hill for the rest of the world to see and emulate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Spending cuts and fiscal restraint must be an integral part of any plan to relieve the current financial burden and restore credibility to the nation's capital.  But we believe the most important step is for the District government and Congress to fully embrace the proposal to reinvigorate the District announced last month by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.  Ms. Norton has introduced the D.C. Economic Recovery Act, also known as a progressive flat tax plan, which will create much needed jobs, expand the tax base and serve as a great enticement to middle-class families to come back home to Washington.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Her plan, which would tax all individuals at a single, low rate with generous deductions for families would take low-income families off the tax rolls and at the same time promote working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship -- all things of which the District is desperately in need.  Most of all, a zero capital gains tax on people and businesses in the city would attract both capital and people back into the city and would allow low- and middle- income people the access to the capital necessary to start their version of the American dream.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle praised Representative Norton for her proposal.  In fact, one of the only reservations to surface was a fear that the District, which has a history of tax increases, would raise local rates to take advantage of the increase in after-tax income that Norton's bill would provide to the middle class taxpayer.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The obvious answer to that concern is to introduce a plan for the District's local tax system that would mirror the federal system proposed by Norton.  In other words, not only would D.C. residents and businesses have a low single tax rate at the federal level, they would also have a low single rate at the local level.  The result of the complementary plans would create a flood of capital and credit into the District which would dramatically expand the tax base, easily raise more revenues than the current systems and help attract the middle class back into the District.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The out-lying suburbs in Virginia and Maryland, contrary to their fears, would also feel a positive impact from the District's recovery.  They must realize that economics in a free-market system is not a zero-sum game.  Economic activity in the area will pick up, more people will buy homes, create jobs, and consume goods and services.  Economic vitality will not stop at the borders of the District of Columbia, it will inevitably spill over. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The necessary reforms, including a thorough review of the fundamental structure of D.C. home rule, if undertaken with reason and given time and resources, will transform the District to the thriving capital city we all envision, attracting new residents and families rather than forcing them away.  Congress, the mayor, the council, the control board, local businesses, D.C. residents, and the outlying suburbs all have an important role to play in Washington's transformation, but all parties must lay aside previously held biases or ill-feelings for past transgressions or failings.  All stake-holders in the District's revitalization, including the president of the United States, must come together to begin forging a vision for the future of the District of Columbia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Despite sharp political and philosophical division, consensus can be reached on a way to obtain full representation for D.C. residents, improve management and oversight and increase revenues.  Unless the core issues that affect the city's foundation are honestly addressed, the underpinnings of Home Rule will remain tenuous.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The budget and management problems faced by the city are not unique.  Washington is not the first city to require outside assistance to help resolve a complicated fiscal dilemma.  Other jurisdictions have met the challenge.  For a multitude of reasons, the District has not.  However, rather than assign blame, the prudent course of action is simply to keep the pressure on.  Somewhere amid the mire and misery is a diamond of a city, yearning to be uncovered so that it can shine as an example for others to follow.

<center><h2>A Pro-Growth Compromise</h2> 
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>November 19, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
<blockquote>
We live in an extraordinary era -- when two former mortal enemies throughout half of 
this century can meet in cooperation hundreds of miles overhead.  If American astronauts 
and Russian cosmonauts can forge a partnership in space, surely the leaders of the 
preeminent institution in the history of the world can do at least as well on <i>terra 
firma</i>.  And they <i>can</i>.  The current impasse between Congress and the White 
House can be broken with a pro-growth tax policy which will allow both sides to declare 
a win.  It is no secret that the holdup between President Clinton and the Republican 
Congressional leadership has been over whose economic model would be used in passing 
a budget.  The White House preferred their own Office of Management and Budgets', 
which paints a moderately rosy picture of the economy over the next seven years, while 
the Congressional leadership favored the more non-partisan Congressional Budget 
Office's bleaker outlook which required bigger cuts and more fiscal restraint in order to 
get the budget in balance by 2002. 
<P> 
Up until the president vetoed the Budget Reconciliation yesterday (?), the Republican 
leadership was bound to hold fast to the economic assumptions of the Congressional 
Budget Office.  The arduous process of reconciling the budget disallowed any adjustment 
to CBO's predictions on economic growth without starting the long budget process over 
again at square one.  In other words, if the GOP had blinked in their negotiations with the 
president last week, they would have placed the entire year's work on the reconciliation in 
jeopardy.  Now that the budget has been vetoed by the president, it can be altered without 
the cumbersome rules governing the reconciliation. 
<P> 
The problems last week came when the president understandably tried to negotiate with 
the GOP on their budget language attached to the Continuing Resolution, which would 
have averted the partial governmental shutdown.  But, due to the importance of passing 
the reconciliation on Friday, the GOP had no room to compromise.  Even a non-binding 
compromise at that point would have undermined the hard-fought cuts, passed in large 
part due to the GOP's freshman class, and thus threatened final passage on the budget.  
And not only were the long term benefits of a balanced budget and restrained spending at 
stake, the real crown jewels of the budget, which are the pro-growth, pro-family tax cuts 
from the Contract With America, were at risk. 
<P> 
Furthermore, the GOP would have been ill-advised to break their promise to balance the 
budget made during the electoral sweep of 1994.  Therefore, they still cannot venture 
away from the CBO numbers or their budget will be labeled as a deficit building 
proposal.   
<P> 
Now that the budget is back in the hands of Congress and can be revised, there is an 
obvious solution to the stalemate which will save the Republican's balanced budget while 
still giving the President some elbow room on spending restraints he can live with.  And 
most importantly of all, this solution will afford the American economy the opportunity 
to grow and flourish during the next seven years -- which is a benefit neither of the 
current proposals have yet to promise. 
<P> 
Congress has been using CBO's very conservative growth predictions which were 
calculated in April of this year.  Again, because they started the process with these 
numbers, they could not change them mid-stream without beginning the entire process 
from scratch.  Since CBO updates its predictions throughout the year, there already exists 
a considerably more optimistic set of assumptions approved in August.  Congress can 
now alter its baseline predictions for the budget to the new CBO numbers and have a lot 
of room to negotiate without losing their "balance".  The CBO's January 1996 numbers 
are expected to be even more positive. 
<P> 
The August CBO numbers give Congress $29 billion dollars more to work with in the 
first two years, and this does not account for the additional amount made available with 
next January's adjustment.  This will theoretically be more than enough room to give the 
president his measure of "victory" in the form of more spending on education, Medicare, 
and other programs near and dear to his heart.  Better yet, it could also leave enough 
money to pay for, in my view, the Contract With America's most important provision -- 
the indexation of capital gains.  Clearly a win for both sides of this standoff and certainly 
a win for the American electorate. 
<P> 
Moreover, if the GOP can reach an agreement on the balanced budget that includes the 
indexation on capital gains they will have won a double victory for the American people.  
For, while the CBO and the OMB consider the indexation as a net cost due to their 
mostly static model, in actuality, indexation on capital gains will provide a boon to the 
economy and, subsequently, an increase in federal revenue.   
<P> 
It works like this:  (1) high tax rates discourage entrepreneurship and investment which, 
in turn, prohibits growth in the national economy; (2) without indexation, the already 
high capital gains tax rate is effectively escalated, leaving entrepreneurs to pay taxes on 
inflated gains; (3) indexation of capital gains would result in a lower effective tax rate 
than a straight cut in the tax rate itself would (assuming a 3% real rate of return, the 
current CPI rate of about 3% carries a real tax rate of 56%--even reducing the nominal 
rate to 19.5% with no indexing would mean a real capital gains rate of nearly 40% at 
current rates of inflation.); (4) therefore, instituting the indexation on capital gains would 
remove or diminish existing barriers to entrepreneurship and investment and thereby free 
up capital in the economy.  This would create a more efficient and liquid capital market, 
drawing capital to low-income and high-risk entrepreneurial ventures. 
<P> 
The president and Congress must reach an agreement soon.  The American people will 
not stand for an on-going stalemate.  None of the parties involved, though, will concede 
defeat on one of the most watched budget debates in our history.  President Clinton, 
Speaker Gingrich, Senator Dole, and their ranks must move quickly to take advantage of 
this unique opportunity to both balance the budget and spur tremendous economic growth 
as we enter the twenty-first century.

<title>Transforming the Welfare Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>Transforming the Welfare Debate</h2>
<b>William J. Bennett & Peter Wehner</b></center>
<hr>
<p>
The welfare reform debate of the past two years will soon crystallize into a vote.  The Senate is scheduled to begin floor debate on a finalized welfare reform proposal in early August; the date for a final vote is not yet known.  Even less clear, however, is what that proposal will be. 
<p>
There are two competing Republican welfare reform plans under consideration.  The first, sponsored by Finance Committee Chairman Bob Packwood, has undergone several changes within the past month.  At this writing, it converts several welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) into five separate block grants which would be turned over to the states, along with the responsibility of managing and administering poverty-fighting programs with this funding.  
<p>
Although it is a clear improvement over the current system, the Packwood bill has several significant shortcomings.  It promises devolution of resources and authority to state governments to enable them to enact innovative reforms.  But in reality, it saddles them with the most stifling and inflexible mandates in the current JOBS federal workfare program.   Even the Senate Democrats' welfare bill drops the JOBS program, which is widely regarded as heavily bureaucratized and ineffective.  Moreover, the Packwood bill places oversight of the states' use of block grants in the most bureaucratized agencies.  Most importantly, there are no serious measures to decrease illegitimacy, despite the obvious link between out-of-wedlock births and long-term welfare dependency.  
<p>
A competing bill was recently introduced by Senators Gramm, Ashcroft and Faircloth, and is rapidly gaining support. We consider this legislation, the "Work, Family and Community Welfare Reform Act," to be the best welfare reform legislation we have seen.  
<p>
The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill is politically and intellectually significant, and it reflects the extraordinary shift that has taken place in the debate over welfare. It is significant that today nobody -- nobody -- is willing to defend the current welfare system.  And for good reason:  it is a complete wreck.  After thirty years, we have finally reached a consensus that much of the anti-poverty strategy of the 60's and 70's has been a terrible failure.  Poverty today is more widespread, more deeply entrenched and more pathological than it was three decades, and $5 trillion, ago. 
<p>
There are several important components of the Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill.    This legislation ends welfare as an entitlement and turns it over to the states, those "laboratories of democracy," to enable them to enact radical and innovative reforms, tailored to the needs and circumstances of their citizens.  It removes the meddlesome presence of the biggest federal bureaucracies from the administration of poverty programs.  It encourages adoption, one of the most important and overlooked issues in the realm of contemporary social policy.  And it recognizes that illegitimacy is the driving force behind welfare dependency, and takes steps to counteract the increase in out-of-wedlock births by ending cash payments to unwed teen mothers and eliminating the increase in cash handouts to welfare beneficiaries who have additional children out of wedlock.  
<p>
By the end of the decade, according to the most reliable projections, 40 percent of all American births and 80 percent of minority births will be out-of-wedlock.  These numbers have frightening social implications.  Welfare may not cause illegitimacy, but it does make it economically viable.  Welfare is illegitimacy's life-support system.
<p>
The good news is that we are reaching agreement on an important moral principle:  having children out-of-wedlock is wrong -- not simply economically unwise for the individuals involved, or a financial burden on society, but morally wrong.  The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill is consistent with that principle.  
<p>
Another important component of this welfare bill would enable the states to contract with private institutions, including religious institutions, that run successful poverty-fighting programs.  In historian Marvin Olasky's exhaustive study of poverty-fighting in the United States, he concluded that the most effective poverty-fighting programs are those that are challenging, personal, and often, spiritual -- the exact antithesis of the bureaucratic, impersonal entitlement that is welfare "as we know it." 
<p>
Conservatives shouldn't pretend that welfare reform of this magnitude will not involve some dislocation and hardship.  But the current system -- designed, built and maintained by the architects of contemporary liberalism -- is exacting a far higher human cost.  Unless a principled and fundamentally different alternative is put into place, the body count will continue to rise.  So we have an obligation to act boldly and responsibly.
<p>
The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill is far-reaching, intelligent and humane.  It is intelligent because it focuses on the underlying causes of long-term poverty and welfare dependency:  illegitimacy and family breakdown.  And it is humane because many more people will live far better lives by scrapping a failed system that subsidizes out-of-wedlock births.  The case for ending welfare is to promote policies which will help ameliorate the social pathologies and human misery that engulfs much of urban America.  The Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth bill will go a long way towards doing just that.  
<p>
There is one provision with which we do not agree:  denying assistance to legal immigrants, regardless of their circumstances.  We simply think that this is the wrong way to go.  But all things considered, this is still the best bill in the Senate.  It injects moral common sense into this debate.  
<p>
At this point the Gramm-Ashcroft-Faircloth legislation faces stiff opposition from some members of the Senate Republican Leadership (who favor Packwood's proposal) and Senate Democrats.  But its appeal is growing, as is its number of cosponsors.  Its passage would have several important consequences.  First, given its greater similarity to the welfare reform bill passed by the House of Representatives, the chances for achieving consensus with House delegates during the House-Senate conference will be far greater.  
<p>
Second, it will force President Clinton to make a clear choice.  There will be a lot of pressure for the President to make good on his promise to "end welfare as we know it" and sign the legislation.   If he vetoes it, he will have reneged on his promise, sabotaged the most significant welfare reforms in the American history, and perpetuated the status quo -- a political, if not a policy, victory for the Republican party.
<p>
Our current welfare system is the most pernicious set of government programs of the past three decades.  We have lost large parts of an entire generation because of the human wreckage left in its wake.  This bill will begin to undo some of the damage.  For that reason, we believe it merits support.

<TITLE> Support the Defend America Act </TITLE>
</HEAD>
May 21, 1996
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
Dear Member of Congress:
<blockquote>
<p>
We are writing to urge your support for a vital piece of legislation that is expected to come to a vote on the House floor later this week -- the "Defend America Act of 1996" (H.R. 3144).  The Defend America Act would make it U.S. policy to build, by 2003, a national missile defense that would protect all Americans against the threat of accidental or limited ballistic missile attack.
<p>
Today, dozens of countries have or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction.  These include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, to name a few.  Incredibly, America still has no defense against this threat.  Even a single missile launched at our nation -- whether deliberately or by accident -- would have tragic consequences, and, if it were armed with a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, the results would be catastrophic.
<p>
Fortunately, there is no need to perpetuate American vulnerability to this threat.  The technology exists today to move forward with a limited ballistic missile defense that is able to protect Americans in all 50 states -- and to do so at an affordable cost.  The Defend America Act would make it clear that Americans will no longer remain hostage to unlawful states and the decisions of their unpredictable rulers.
<p>
The Clinton Administration still refuses to take our vulnerability to a missile attack seriously.  The Administration has said it does not foresee missile threats to the United States emerging in the next 15 years.  They ignore the still formidable Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and place an historically unwarranted faith in the intelligence community's ability to recognize Third World missile threats in a timely manner -- before they materialize.  Our underestimation of the scope and magnitude of Iraq's missile program prior to the Gulf War is proof enough of this.  The Spratt amendment to H.R. 3144 would perpetuate the Administration's "go slow" approach to missile defense and ensure that America remains undefended well into the next century.  It should be voted down.
<P>
The United States is working with Israel to provide that country with defense against ballistic missile attack.  Commenting recently on this, Secretary of Defense William Perry noted that this defensive program "should, therefore, be stabilizing on the one hand.  On the other hand, it should reduce any incentive of any country to launch a missile because they would see it would be ineffective."  Empower America agrees and notes that an effective missile defense would also deter attacks on the United States. 
<P>
It is crucial to ensure that all Americans have the protection they deserve against threats to their security.  But today, Americans have no protection against ballistic missile attack.  We therefore urge you, in the strongest terms, to vote for the Defend America Act.  
<P><BR>
Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Vin Weber

<title>Letter to Strom Thurmond re: ABM Treaty and SDI</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
August 1, 1995
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
The Honorable Strom Thurmond<br>
United States Senate<br>
Washington, DC  20510<br>
<p>
Dear Chairman Thurmond:
<p>
We are really pleased that you are addressing the most important issue in defense policy for our times:  the capacity of America to defend itself.  As you and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have determined, our nation needs a ballistic missile defense program.  For most of our history, what George Washington described as "our blessed location" made us invulnerable to attack by hostile nations.  But because technology overcame the security of location, we are no longer invulnerable.  Today, we lack the capacity to defend ourselves against ballistic missiles.  But most Americans do not yet understand our vulnerability to attacks by ballistic missiles.  Most Americans do not yet understand that for the first time in our history, when we speak of defense, we must now include our capacity to defend our country.
<p>
It dismays us, then, that instead of focusing on our current needs, opponents of ballistic missile defense worry about outdated arms control treaties with countries that no longer exist.  They argue that moving to develop needed defenses and modifying the ABM Treaty will jeopardize the possibility of Russian ratification of the START II Treaty.  American security should not be sacrificed in a vain effort to preserve the ABM Treaty.  The ABM Treaty, designed for a bipolar world, always had dubious value.  It is now wholly outdated.  It's only relevance to the contemporary world is not how it influences the START II Treaty, whose ratification by Russia, in any case, is uncertain irrespective of any action on the ABM Treaty.  The only relevance of the ABM Treaty to the contemporary world is to hamper an effective effort to defend America.
<p>
The development of missile defenses today is technologically and economically feasible.  We can speak and act with confidence in the world only when we can defend ourselves.  Our allies, adversaries and friends -- including the Russians -- all understand this.  It is time for the United States to defend the American people.
<p>
Sincerely,<p>
<br>
Jack Kemp<br>
Jeane Kirkpatrick

<title>Letters to Congress from Jack Kemp on the B-2</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
July 31, 1995
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Member of Congress :
<p>
The House of Representatives will soon vote on the FY96 Defense Appropriations Bill.  The vote to continue production of the B-2 bomber is one of several significant national security decisions the House will make this year.  The B-2 bomber is an essential system for current and future defenses for our nation.
<p>
When the B-2 becomes operational in the very near future, the United States will have the unprecedented capability to deliver precision-guided munitions to any point on the globe from the continental United States with the confidence that the aircrew will return safely.  For example, had the B-2 been available in 1987, only one or two B-2s would have conducted the raid on Libya.  Moreover, the need to obtain permission from allies to overfly their territory and the costly and vast network of support and crews that placed hundreds of Americans at risk would have been unnecessary.  Because of the widespread recognition that the B-2 can stop aggressors in their tracks, conventional deterrence will be greatly enhanced.  And as the Heritage Foundation has suggested, in the future, the B-2 will also allow us to effectively attack mobile missile systems, thereby increasing U.S. offensive abilities.
<p>
Thus far, the post-Cold War era has been characterized with promise, opportunity, challenges and dangers.  The United States must have the capability for forceful and independent action and our advanced weapons systems are an essential element of that capacity.  The B-2 represents a significant breakthrough technology that will give us a singular and unparalleled military ability to act.  Systems such as the B-2 are vital to our role in a changing world.  The United States must be strong in order to lead; no one can do it but us.  I urge you to support continued production of the B-2 bomber program
<p>
Sincerely,<p>
<br>
Jack Kemp

<title>Letter to Congress from Jeane Kirkpatrick on SDI-ABM</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
June 13, 1995
<br>
<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Member of Congress:
<p>
The overriding issue in defense policy for our times is the capacity of America to defend itself.  For most of our history, what George Washington described as "our blessed location" made us invulnerable to attack by hostile nations.  We are no longer invulnerable and we are presently without the capacity to defend ourselves against ballistic missiles.
<p>
Today, rogue nations are determined to build weapons of mass destruction and acquire ballistic missile technology which will permit these weapons to be delivered over long distances.  Most Americans do not yet understand our vulnerability to such attacks.  Most Americans do not yet understand that for the first time in our history, when we speak of defense matters, we should be talking about our capacity to defend our territory.
<p>
The Dellums and Spratt amendments to H.R. 1530 are completely inadequate, very shortsighted and extremely outdated.  Neither is worthy of your support.  The one proposes to economize where economy is the least appropriate.  The Dellums cuts will cripple the development of national defense systems.  The other sacrifices American security in a vain effort to preserve the ABM Treaty.  The ABM Treaty, designed for a bipolar world, always had dubious value.  It is now wholly outdated.  It's only relevance to the contemporary world is to hamper an effective effort to defend America.
<p>
The development of missile defenses today is technologically and economically feasible.  We can speak and act with confidence in the world only when we have the capacity to defend ourselves and our adversaries understand this.  It is time for the United States to defend the American people.

<title>Rethinking the American Dream</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Rethinking the American Dream</h2><p>
<i>April 20, 1994</i><p>
<h2>By Phil Gramm</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
I want to thank the Daughters of the American Revolution not just for
inviting me to this beautiful hall to speak to you tonight, but for what
you have done in promoting patriotism and a knowledge of our history in a
country that greatly needs both.<p>
Not far up Constitution Avenue, on the walls of our National Archives are
inscribed the words, "What is past is prologue." In these troubled times,
it is vitally important that Americans know our history, because in the
faith, vision, leadership and courage of those who have gone before, are
the guideposts for solutions to our problems today.<p>
Tonight I want to talk about a subject that was very much on the minds of
the Founding Fathers who met in the First Continental Congress, and that
subject was the American Dream. The idea that America was a unique place in
the world; that you could leave the Old World, come to America and be part
of a new nation; that you could be judged not by your ethnic group or by
who your parents were, but on the basis of your God-given talent and your
effort. This was a revolutionary idea in 1776, and quite frankly it is a
revolutionary idea in 1994.<p>
But it is an idea that took root in America. The American Dream is
something that everyone here has been part of. We don't have much trouble
defining the American Dream, because for most of us, our parents dreamed it
and we lived it. And we don't want it to die in America; we want to save it
here and share it with the world.<p>
A simple event of my childhood brought home to me what the American Dream
was about. I was 8 or 9 years old, and had seen a show on television about
King Arthur and his Court. I was out in the front yard on a sunny afternoon
with my brother and we were doing yard work and, as younger brothers do, I
said, "Don, you know, it would've been great if we had lived in olden
times." And Don said, "Well, what would have been so great about it?" And I
said, "If we lived in olden times, there'd been servants out here pulling
these weeds." And with the great wisdom of an older brother, Don said to
me, "Phil, don't you know, given the kind of people we come from, if we had
lived in olden times, we'd have been the servants."<p>
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but before I was born my
mother decided that I was going to college. I fought it. I failed the 3rd,
7th and 9th grades, but my mother prodded me every step of the way to a
Ph.D. in Economics. Mothers dreams do not die easily in America. May that
always be so.<p>
I'm often criticized in Congress for having "blind faith" in the fairness
of America, and I respond that, "it's not just faith, it's evidence." My
wife's grandfather came to this country from Korea as an indentured laborer
to work in the sugar cane fields in Hawaii. When his son, my wife's father,
retired from that same company, he was the first Asian-American ever to be
an officer of a sugar company in the history of Hawaii. And when first
President Reagan, then President Bush, appointed my wife to be Chairman of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, she oversaw the trading of all
commodities, and all commodity futures in America, including cane sugar.<p>
Now, that is a story of America in action. That is the story of the
fulfillment of one family's American Dream. It's not a story about a very
extraordinary family. It's a story about a very ordinary family in an
extraordinary country. America is not a great and powerful country because
the most brilliant and talented people in the world came to live here.
America is a great and powerful country because it was here that ordinary
people like you and me have had more opportunity and more freedom than any
other people who have ever lived on the face of the planet. And with that
opportunity and that freedom ordinary people like us have been able to do
extraordinary things.<p>
With this backdrop of what the American Dream is about, a dream that people
in America would do better than their parents, and that their children
would do better than they had done, I am very alarmed by recent polling
data, showing that for the first time, Americans do not believe they are
better off than their parents were.<p>
An even more important, startling and frightening revelation occurs when
people are asked, "Do you believe your children are going to do better than
you have done?" By a margin of 2 to 1, Americans now say "No."<p>
Why are the American people so pessimistic about the long term prospects
for our country? First of all, I believe that the American family, the
middle class family in this country, is under great economic stress. In
1950, the typical American family making the average income with two
children sent one out of every $50 it earned to Washington D.C. On April
the 15th of this year, the typical family making the average income with
two children sent one out of every $4 it earned to Washington, D.C. In a
two wage-earner family today over half of the income of the second wage
earner goes to pay family taxes that did not exist in 1950.<p>
How has this happened? It's happened because of the explosion of
government. Government spending adjusted for inflation since 1950 has grown
by 544 percent. The size of government relative to the economy has gone up
42 percent in the last 40 years. If this trend continues, the future is not
going to be very bright for working families.<p>
I think another reason that people are pessimistic is crime. Every morning
when we pick up the newspaper, we see the brutal face of violence in
America. The Justice Department last month projected that in the future
three out of every four Americans will be victimized by violent crime at
some point in their lives. As a measure of violence in America: A boy born
in America in 1974 stands a greater chance of being murdered than a
serviceman in World War II stood of being killed in action.<p>
I think another reason people are pessimistic about the future is the
collapse of American education. And it's not from a lack of money that
American education has collapsed. In 1960, in inflation-adjusted dollars,
we spent $2,035 per student. Today we spend $5,247 per student, higher than
any other developed nation on the planet, and yet our SAT scores have
declined by 80 points in three decades, and America does not rate in the
top 20 in math and science achievement in the world.<p>
But nowhere is the failure of government more evident than in welfare.
Since 1965, when the War on Poverty began, welfare spending has risen 500
percent, after inflation. But what has happened to the number of people on
welfare? It has exploded. In most of our major cities today, the majority
of children are born out of wedlock. Not only is our welfare system not
working, it is generating new dependency and breeding drug use, child abuse
and crime. It threatens the very survival of our culture.<p>
Given the magnitude of these problems, where do we begin to find solutions?
First, if we want to do something about the tax burden on working
Americans, we're going to have to do something about the explosive growth
of government spending. Now, as you can imagine, being the Gramm of
Gramm-Rudman and trying to do the Lord's work in the Devil's city, I'm
often asked, "Well, what magic formula would you use to balance the federal
budget?" much less make it possible to cut taxes on working families. I
could give you a very technical answer, but I want to give you a very
simple but powerful answer.<p>
The day I offered the Reagan Budget in the U.S. House, I was walking down
the steps of the Capitol and a reporter came running up to me and said,
"Congressman Gramm, in a 1,300-page budget how did you decide what programs
ought to be cut and what programs ought to grow?" I thought for a minute
and said, "I'd use the Dicky Flatt test." And not being from Mexia, Texas,
she didn't know Dicky Flatt or the test, so I explained it to her. I said,
"I looked at every program in the Federal budget, and then I tried to think
of some real, honest-to-God, flesh-and-blood person who lives in my
district, and that brought to mind a printer from Mexia named Dicky Flatt.
And I thought about him because he works hard for a living."<p>
Dicky Flatt and his wife were in business then with his Daddy and his Mama,
his brother and brother's wife. They were open 'til 6 o'clock every week-
night, and 'til 5 o'clock on Saturday. And whether you saw Dicky Flatt at
the PTA or the Boy Scouts or the Presbyterian church, try as he did he
never quite got that blue ink off the end of his fingers.<p>
And I said I looked at every program, thought of Dicky Flatt, and asked a
simple question: "Will the benefits to be derived by spending money on this
program be worth taking the money away from Dicky Flatt to pay for it?" And
let me tell you something: There are not a lot of programs that will stand
up to that test. When we apply the Dicky Flatt test, there won't be a
deficit in the federal budget. In fact, when we apply the Dicky Flatt test,
we're going to be able to cut taxes for working families.<p>
Earlier this year, in the budget debate, I offered an amendment that was
viewed as radical by many of my colleagues in the Senate because,
basically, it was a radical amendment. What I proposed to do was to take
the President's spending cuts, drop his add-ons, freeze remaining spending,
and use the resulting savings to increase the dependent child tax exemption
from $2,350 a year to $4,700 a year. And just as I anticipated, Senators
who opposed the amendment got up and said, " Well, Gramm's amendment is
going to cut spending for housing, for education, for nutrition." And so I
responded, "My amendment is not going to cut spending for housing or
education or nutrition. What my amendment is going to do is change who does
the spending. What I'm trying to do is take the money that government is
spending for people on housing, education and nutrition, and let families
spend that money themselves. I know government and I know the family and I
know the difference. And when we start making those changes, we're going to
start lifting the burden on working families and we're going to rebuild our
economy and the American Dream in the process."<p>
I don't claim that I know the solution to the root causes of violent crime
in America. I yield to no one in my desire to find and eliminate the root
causes. We spend billions of dollars a year trying to deal with the root
causes of crime and child abuse in America. But there is one part of this
crime problem that I know how to solve. We do not have to live with the
situation where each morning's newspaper tells of some violent criminal who
has been convicted of five or six major crimes but is out on the streets
again and has just killed somebody's child. I know how to solve that
problem. How? By putting predator criminals in prison and keeping them
there.<p>
Now, people say that it's expensive to put people in prison, and it is. But
if we stopped building prisons like Holiday Inns, it would be cheaper. And
it's a lot cheaper to keep a predator in prison than it is to let him walk
the streets of this country. I am committed to seeing that we get that job
done.<p>
I did not reach the conclusion that we should promote educational choice
quickly. I'm an old school-teacher, I taught economics for 12 years at
Texas A&M University. As I like to say, I have taught the same subject in
Washington for 15 years, but my Aggies were a lot smarter than members of
Congress. But I have reached the conclusion that there is no reform that is
powerful enough to change American education and bring back standards and
quality other than empowering families to decide where their children go to
school.<p>
I remember once in Dallas I was debating a woman from the Department of
Education. I was arguing for local control and for parental choice and I
thought I made what was the telling point of the debate. I said, "You may
know more about education than I do, but I love my children more than you
do." And this woman looked at me and said, "No you don't." And I asked,
"What are their names?" My point is that since parents have the largest
stake, the more control you give them, the better the results are going to
be. For the sake of our children and for the sake of America's future, it's
time to give choice a chance.<p>
I believe that everybody receiving public welfare in America ought to
either work or go to school. I believe that if they did that, they would
earn more than just their welfare check. When my Mama worked in a cotton
mill, she earned more than $17 a week: She earned self-respect, and it made
all the difference. I want to help people in America find the American
Dream by giving them back their self-respect and asking them to get out of
the wagon and help the rest of us pull it. Hasn't the time come to stop
paying welfare mothers to have illegitimate children? Our welfare system
has destroyed the poverty family, promoted dependency, and fostered child
abuse, crime and hopelessness. I say we should throw this system out and
start over again.<p>
Now the real question is, where do we find the courage and the leadership
to do those things? I believe that deep down in our hearts we know that
there are fundamental problems in our country and that we have to make
dramatic changes if we're to preserve the things we love about America. An
America where people do not believe their children are going to do better
than they have done is not the country that I grew up in. Nor is it the
country I want my children and grandchildren to grow up in. But where do we
find the leadership and courage to change it?<p>
A good place to start searching for the answer is to look to our Founding
Fathers. When you look at the problems they faced, they were overwhelming
as compared to ours. When you look at the resources they had to deal with
those problems, they were very meager as compared to ours.<p>
But they had two things, it seems to me, that we don't have enough of
today. They had faith and they had will. They had faith that God did not
set aside this continent for nothing. They had faith that God did not build
a society dedicated to freedom and that God did not raise America as a
beacon of hope for the world, only to let us fail.<p>
And secondly, they had will, the will to act, the will to make the world
over again, the will to risk everything in order to build a country that
would be a model for the world.<p>
In closing, I want to leave you with a quote from George Washington. We
often think of George Washington's gravest moment as coming at Valley
Forge, but it didn't. It took politics to bring Washington's lowest moment.
And it occurred during the period of the Articles of Confederation. So much
sacrifice had been incurred, yet America was floundering because we didn't
have a system that worked. Washington wrote in a letter to Lafayette: "I do
not believe that Providence has done so much for nothing. It has always
been my creed that we should not be left as an awful monument to prove that
mankind was unequal to the task of self-government."<p>
I believe that Washington's creed is as true today as it was then. And if
we have faith, if we are willing to act on that faith, I believe we can
remake America. Now some people will say that's just a dream, and they're
right: It is just a dream, but it's not just any dream, it is the American
Dream. I know you hold that dream in your hearts, and so do I.<p>
Thank you and God bless you.<p>
This was the keynote address delivered to the 103rd Continental Congress of
the Daughters of the American Revolution, April 20, 1994.<p>

<H2>The City and the Crusade</h2><br> 
<h2>by Patrick J. Buchanan</h2><br>
<B><I>Commencement Address for Christendom College<BR>May 6, 1995</I></B><BR>
</CENTER>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that gracious reception.<p>
I confess it is not the kind to which I am accustomed on most college campuses. But it is  truly an honor to be here, at Christendom. Both to congratulate the graduating seniors, and to pay tribute  to this college for standing as a beacon of Faith, Truth and Light amid the encircling gloom of our  troubled civilization.<p> 
A few years ago, in Houston, I gave a speech at the Republican National Convention. As luck  would have it, I spoke just after the irrepressible Alan Keyes, and just before my old boss, the Great  Communicator himself, Ronald Reagan.<p>
Sandwiched between two such speakers, I naturally wondered whether the world would little note or long remember what a once-and-future Crossfire host would say there. <p>
But near the end of my speech, I made a simple observation.<p>
"There is," I said, "a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America...a cultural  war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself." This war, I said, is "about who we are...what we believe...(and) what we stand for as  Americans.<p>
That first night, commentators from David Brinkley to John Chancellor were complimentary.  They said Buchanan had given an excellent speech, an outstanding speech. Sander Vanocur went so far  as to say my speech "was the most skillful attempt to remind the party faithful of the role that ideas have  played in American politics since Eugene McCarthy nominated Adlai Stevenson at the 1960 Democrat  convention." High praise indeed from a commentator who was a friend and admirer of John F. Kennedy.<p>
That night in the overnight tracking polls, George Bush soared 10 points  his best night of  1992. By the time Mr. Bush rose to speak, three nights later, he had closed the gap with Bill Clinton. A  deeply disconsolate New York Times was in mourning; the presidential race had suddenly become a  dead heat.<p>
Then, I began to hear what the poet described as, "dim drums throbbing in the hills half heard."  The Washington Establishment was marching as to war and they were coming after me.<p>
The counterattack began then, and it continues to this day. Why?<p>
Because what we said at Houston went right down the smokestacks of America's cultural elite. As the old saw runs: It is only the truth that hurts.<p>
My antagonists fought back with the customary high-minded and reasoned arguments."Buchanan Declares...Domestic Jihad," read one headline. "What If Ayatollah Buchanan Had His Way?" said another.<p>
A New York Times writer said I was an example of that "reactionary Catholicism," that had driven Mexican General Santa Anna to slaughter Davy Crockett and his friends at the Alamo.<p>
But it was my future colleague, Bob Beckel, who cut to the heart of the matter: "That was the most reactionary speech ever given in a televised convention," Beckel said, "and I believe the devil wrote it." We're making progress. Bob Beckel believes in the Devil.<p>
You know there is not one nasty political name that has ever been invented -that I have not been called. Lately, one of my rivals for the Republican nomination again charged me with calling for a "Holy War." Now, because this is a non-political occasion, that opponent shall remain nameless.<p>
But let me respond to Arlen this way by telling a story about a genuine Holy War long ago.<p>
A thousand years ago, following one of those rare upheavals in the Middle East, the Holy City of Jerusalem was closed to Christian pilgrims.<p>
The Vicar of Christ, Urban II, traveled out from Rome through Christendom, until he came to the French town of Clermont. There he held a council with his bishops. At the council's end, he gave a great sermon to a vast crowd of pilgrims.<p>
The Holy Father called on men of faith and courage to unite in the cause of opening the road to Jerusalem. All who joined this Crusade, the Pope said, must take an oath never to turn back, until they had reached Jerusalem . The Crusaders' oath was signified by a sign of the cross sewn into the shoulders of their tunics.<p>
The first great noblemen to take up the cross was Raymond, Count of Toulouse, followed by Bohemond a Norman prince of Italy. Together, Raymond and Bohemond marched across the Balkans to Byzantium, where their armies rendezvoused under the nervous eye of the Emperor Alexius of Constantinople.<p>
There, Alexius asked the Crusaders to take a second oath.<p>
The Pope's oath had been to God. But the oath of Alexius was to Caesar: All Crusaders must pledge allegiance to him, Alexius said.<p>
Bohemond took this oath. All the other crusading knights did the same, except Raymond of Toulouse.
Raymond hesitated because he wanted to make clear his first allegiance was to the Crusade -- to the oath he had made to God. He told the Emperor he would be his subordinate if the Emperor led the Crusaders in battle -- but he would not be the Emperor's vassal.<p>
So, the Crusaders marched to the borders of Syria, laying siege to, and recapturing, the ancient city of Antioch.  Here Bohemond broke his pledge to Emperor and Pope. He laid claim to Antioch, to establish his own tiny kingdom; then stayed with his army, as Raymond led the Crusade on to Jerusalem.<p>
Raymond captured the Holy City from the Turks. There, his Knight Crusaders offered him the  great title: King of Jerusalem.  But the Count of Toulouse refused: He did not wish to be a crowned king in the city where  Christ had worn a crown of thorns.<p>
Now, modern historians will tell you, in loving detail, of atrocities the crusaders committed; and  there were atrocities. And they ought not to be defended. For among the first things a Catholic learns is  that man is fallen, and human nature is unchangeable.<p>
But there is a theme in the story of Raymond and Bohemond that illustrates a fundamental lesson: Each of us faces this choice in life: We can choose the city. or we can chose the crusade. And it  is far better thing to choose the crusade. That is what we are taught in our Catholic schools to choose  the crusade. Each  of us, to take up the cross.<p>
Now, I can see the headline, when they get wind of this at the Washington Post: "Buchanan  Renews Call for 'Holy War."' But what does it really mean to "choose the crusade" in modern America; and what role do  Catholic schools and colleges play?<p>
Let me tell you what I believe:<p>
In every city in America there are Catholic parishes, Catholic schools and communities of  Catholic families that form around those parishes and schools. When it works the way it ought to, family,  church and school pursue a single, common goal: Raising up each generation to embrace the faith, and to  accept the moral code that allows children to lead good lives, to become strong adults, to merit  salvation. To go all the way to Jerusalem . <p>
That is the goal of a Catholic education: The inculcation of values, the shaping of  conscience, the development of character, the formation of souls. Whether a child is outstanding in  math, a whiz at computers, or a great athlete, these are secondary.<p>
We have a crisis in American education because educators have lost sight of their goal. They  have lost sight of their first purpose: to produce moral men and women whose lives will be an example to  their community, and country, no matter how successful they are in their secular vocations.<p>
And how can we ever again succeed in educating children to become moral men and women if,  in America's public schools, we consciously deny them all religious instruction, and deny them access to  that primary source of morality, God's own word. The Bible is the one book from which they are  expressly not allowed to be taught.<p>
One of the greatest of our Founding Fathers, John Adams, once wrote: "Our Constitution was  made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other." What Adams was saying was that religion and morality are the tap root of the Republic. Cut the tap root, and the Republic dies.<p>
Our struggle, then, is against, those who have been slashing away at that tap root for decades. For if they prevail, our beloved country will perish.<p>
And, the struggle must continue, for the rest of our lives.<p>
In a healthy society, the institutions of culture reinforce the values of family, church, school. The history of the West, the greatest civilization in human history, is the story of centuries of architecture and art, literature and music, that lift up the hearts of men and women and point them toward the Truth. That is what the Cathedral of Chartres does; that is what Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel does; that is what Shakespeare's Henry V  does; that is what Beethoven's 9th Symphony does. All, in their way, are songs of joy, because ultimately they teach the truth that Christ is Risen.<p>
But that is not what Heather Has Two Mommies, does; it is not what that film, The Last Temptation of Christ does; it is not what grunge rock and rap music do; it is not, excuse me, what Roseanne Barr is all about.<p>
When the book Heather Has Two Mommies, glorifying same-sex marriage, was going to be used to instruct First Graders in the schools of New York City, my friend, Mary Cummins, president of a school board in Queens, stopped the sewage at the schoolhouse door.<p>
Mary Cummins is a heroine of the cultural war. She was doing what all good teachers, all good schools do, acting in loco parentis. She was another good mom watching over her kids.<p>
Moms are the front line troops in the cultural war.<p>
She is the one who snaps off the TV set when the filthy show comes on. She is the one down at the school board when Outcome Based Education, or condom distribution, or some absurd new federal mandate on how to teach America's children is being introduced.<p>
And if there is any institution that has always been a trusted friend and partner of conscientious mothers and the families they nurture and hold together, it is the traditional Catholic school.<p>
I know this is so because it was true in my own family. My grandmother put her trust in Holy Trinity, a parochial school in Georgetown after her husband left her with two young sons to raise. My father grew up in what the  social engineers call a "broken home" but he did not grow up in a broken community. His was a Catholic community founded on a Faith could not be broken.<p>
But, when my father was 13, and graduated from Holy Trinity, he was to be sent to McKinley Tech, a public high. Then, one day, two Jesuits arrived at my grandmother's house.<p>
"Mrs. Buchanan," they asked, "Why is young Bill not going to Gonzaga?" "Because," my grandmother replied, "we don't have the money." The Jesuits answered back: "Mrs. Buchanan, we don't want your money; we want your son. <p>
My father would repay that loyalty all his life Indeed, one day very late in my father's life, I went into a Catholic bookstore in Bethesda, to find a copy of the Douey-Rheims version of the Bible, that might somehow have escaped the clutches of the thought police. You  know the type: The religious rewrite men, with the big egos and the tin ears, who are going to improve on the most magnificent prose ever written.<p>
When I came to the counter, the lady recognized me.<p>
"Oh, Mr. Buchanan," she said, "your father was in here just two weeks ago, and he said the most wonderful thing. I said to him 'Isn't it terrible what has happened to our church today, Mr. Buchanan?' And he replied, 'No, Do not be afraid. We have it on the authority of Christ himself: the Rock will not break"' My father's religious beliefs, inculcated in Catholic schools, permeated everything. In my father's household, whatever Mother Church taught, that was it; there was no more debate.<p>
When I was a boy, one of my father's favorite expressions was "Offer it up!" It was an all-purpose phrase that meant, "stop whining and offer up your pain for the suffering souls in Purgatory." Whenever we were hurt, injured or cried, we would hear a loud impatient, "Offer it up!" It was my father's way of saying: Choose the crusade.<p>
Incidentally, "offering it up" was advice I could have used one night when still in my crib back at our house in Georgetown.<p>
My brothers, sisters and I were all instructed on how to pray as soon as we could talk. Even in the crib, I caught on quickly. When my older brothers were still toddlers, on their knees stumbling through the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be--from my playpen would come an impatient, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen!" My parents were elated with these early signs of precocity. They would show off to neighbors the indolent little boy they called "Paddy Joe," who, as they said, "could talk before he could walk." My older brothers, however, were not amused by all this cleverness.<p>
The four of us in those years slept in separate cribs, which were on stilts and rollers and could be maneuvered around the otherwise empty room. To start the crib rolling all we had to do was stand, hold firmly onto one of the horizontal bars, and rock back and forth in the direction we wanted to go. One night, after the older brothers had their prayers interrupted and corrected, yet again, from the playpen, my father heard horrible screams from our room.<p>
Rushing in, he found milk and blood all over my forehead, and glass strewn all over the crib. The perpetrator was at hand. One of my brothers had maneuvered his crib over next to mine, reached in, jerked the milk bottle out of my mouth, and smashed it over my head.<p>
He was telling me, in his own persuasive way, to shut up.  Unfortunately, the lesson never took.  Ask Michael Kinsley.<p> 
A few years ago I wrote that story, and many others, in a book titled "Right From the Beginning." My purpose was to show that the conservatism I embraced was not some abstract philosophical credo. It was not the sort of thing one settles upon after late-night bull sessions with self-absorbed graduate students at Ivy league schools. My conservatism was rooted in habits and dispositions ingrained in me from childhood and engraved on the hearts of millions like me, and, I suspect, like many of you by parents, schools and church.<p>
Aquinas tells us that the virtues are not ideas, they are habits and the greatest of the virtues are not habits of the mind, they are habits of the heart.<p>
The other day Mr. Clinton implicitly conceded this point in his heated speech contending that conservatives and talk radio are somehow responsible for that horrific atrocity in Oklahoma City.<p>
Yes, Mr. President, in one way, you are right: The images that abound in our popular culture what we say on the airwaves, what we depict on our television screens, in our movies houses can help habituate America to violence and can corrupt the soul of our nation.<p>
That is what we have been saying, since Houston, and before.<p>
But, no, it is not the conservative or traditionalist vision that leads to acts of violence. No one is going to go out and stalk the dark streets of the city after watching The Bells of St. Mary's. It is not traditionalism that has led to 4,000 unborn babies done to death every day, to public calls for legalized euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide. It is not traditionalism that has led to the collapse of the American family, where one in three children today are born without a father to go home to.<p>
No, the slow-motion suicide of American society is traceable to a philosophy of self-indulgence, to a New Age Gospel that declares: There are no absolute values in the universe; there are no fixed and objective standards of right and wrong. There is no God. There is no salvation. It all begins here, and it all ends here. Every man lives by his own moral code. So, do your own thing.<p>
And, doing their own thing, our countrymen are creating, in our great cities, a society straight out of Dante's Inferno.<p>
It we do not reject this fatal philosophy, if we do not turn back to the Truth, America will perish. Just as the people of a city where the water supply is contaminated, will sicken and die, so, too, will a nation whose culture has been polluted with falsehoods and filth.<p>
So, how do we win this struggle for the soul of America?<p>
In our Catholic tradition we have many heroes, who can serve as our models. In our history, we have many great souls who have spoken truth to power. We have seen in our own lifetime humble men and women bring down evil empires by giving witness to the truth.<p>
A thousand years after Urban II preached the First Crusade, his successor, John Paul II, brought another crusade to the East. Forty years after Stalin mockingly asked how many divisions does the pope have, the first Polish pope came to an altar set up in a field outside Krakow.<p>
There, he gave the answer for the Holy See. And when from deep inside the Soviet Empire, John Paul II stood in front of hundreds of thousands who had kept the fait h, and said, Sursum Corda, Lift Up Your Hearts, from a dozen captive nations, millions answered in their own hearts, We Have Lifted Them Up to The Lord.<p>
They had kept the Faith. More than any bomb or missile, that is why the walls came tumbling  down, why the Evil Empire collapsed. In the climactic battle of the greatest war ever fought in the history  of Western civilization, not a single shot was fired by the armies of the winning side. Truth, crushed to  earth, rose again as we were told it would rise again.<p>
For my generation, that 70-year Cold War between Western Civilization and Marxist  materialism was our defining crisis and struggle. For your generation, the great crisis is within Western  Civilization. As we sacrificed and saved, and some of our friends fought and died, to win our war to  preserve the body of Western Civilization, it is up to you to save her soul. For the great struggle today is  between the modernist materialism all around us, and the culture and civilization rooted in the permanent  truths of our Faith.<p>
To assure victory in this struggle you must emulate the good people of Poland. Never back down  from the truths you learned from your parents, the truths you have taken in throughout your life, the truths  you have brought to a fine understanding here at Christendom.<p>
Never back down in the biggest things you do; and never back down in the simplest things  you do. Remember that courage, like cowardice, is a habit of the heart. And when the choice comes  down to between the city and the  crusade, take up the cross and lead.  <p>

<h1>Wilson, Jackson swap sound bites<br>
in sparring over affirmative action</h1>
</center>
<br>
By SCOTT THURM<br>
Mercury News Staff Writer<p>
 Call it ''The Pete and Jesse Show.''<p>
   Gov. Pete Wilson and the Rev. Jesse Jackson -- representing 
polar opposites in the national debate over affirmative action 
-- sparred by satellite across two television networks Sunday, 
bringing far more heat than light to the difficult question of 
how America should treat women and minority groups.<p>
   Neither man said much new as they contested the fallout of 
Thursday's decision by the University of California regents to 
abandon considerations of gender, race and ethnicity in 
hiring, promotions and admissions.<p>
   Instead, each seemed to take perverse delight in 
antagonizing the other, all the while trying to score sound 
bites that might be aired on still other news shows.<p>
<h4>"Ethnic cleansing"</h4>
    Jackson called Wilson ''corrupt'' because several regents 
are among his largest campaign contributors. And he accused 
the governor of ''ethnic cleansing'' for pursuing policies 
that studies have shown will reduce the numbers of blacks and 
Hispanics at the university's nine campuses.<p>
   In response, Wilson chided Jackson for ''childish name-
calling'' and accused the civil-rights leader of 
''demagoguery'' in a ''pathetic effort to divert attention 
from the real issue.''<p>
   In fact, each was using the other as a convenient foil 
while addressing different audiences: Wilson is seeking 
support among Republicans for his presidential campaign; 
Jackson wants to rally defenders of civil rights, while 
encouraging speculation about his own presidential ambitions.<p>
<h2>Suited for each other</h2>
    ''No two people in America need each other more now than 
Jesse Jackson and Pete Wilson,'' Sam Popkin, a political 
science professor at the University of California, San Diego 
said last week. ''United they rise, and united they fall.''<p>
Amid the shouting, several Clinton administration officials 
said Sunday they will examine whether the UC system would 
violate federal law by dropping its affirmative-action 
programs.<p>
   Privately, federal officials have said they don't foresee 
any action, because federal law generally permits government 
agencies to use race, gender or ethnicity as a factor in 
hiring, promotion and admission decisions but does not require 
they be considered.<p>
   Wilson made that point on Cable News Network's ''Late 
Edition,'' where he criticized the Clinton administration for 
''shameful threats'' against the university.<p>
<h4>1996 ballot measure</h4>
    In his most sweeping statement to date, Wilson said Sunday 
that as president he would favor eliminating all federal 
programs that consider gender, race or ethnicity for hiring, 
promotions or contracts. Wilson supports a proposed 1996 
ballot measure that would abolish those considerations in 
California.<p>
   As Wilson and Jackson stake out the extremes, President 
Clinton may win favor from the public for his plea last week 
to repair the excesses of affirmative action while maintaining 
efforts to help women and minorities overcome centuries of 
discrimination.<p>
   Even Wilson concedes that discrimination still exists. But 
he claims that affirmative-action programs -- which Wilson 
supported for more than 20 years -- now divide Americans along 
racial and ethnic lines, penalizing whites and stigmatizing 
successful women and minority groups. The United States should 
achieve gender and racial diversity ''on the natural,'' Wilson 
argues, by improving health and education programs for 
everyone.<p>
<h2>Clinton on Jackson's side</h2>
   But Jackson -- and Clinton -- maintain that women and 
minority groups still need a helping hand from government to 
overcome ''glass ceilings and closed doors.'' For example, 
Jackson noted Sunday that Hispanic women with college degrees 
earn less than white men who have never been to college. And 
they contend that critics of affirmative action, like Wilson, 
are trying to divide Americans for selfish political reasons.<p>
It's ''divisive, hurtful and irresponsible,'' said the 
assistant attorney general for civil rights, Deval Patrick, 
who joined Wilson and Jackson on ABC's ''This Week with David 
Brinkley.''<p>

<h2>Alan Keyes: Statement of Purpose</h2>
</center>
<br>
<HR>
<BR>
These days almost everyone acknowledges that the root of most of America's
problems lies in the decline of our nation's moral identity.  Crime,
rampant illegitimacy, the deteriorating environment for education in too
many of our schools, even the cost pressures in our health care system can
be traced to bad actions and habits that result from the decline of respect
for decent values in our society.  Yet when our political leaders address
these issues, most still run away from their fundamental moral dimension.<p>
In a <cite>USA Today</cite> interview, for example, one Republican presidential
aspirant, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, addressed the welfare problem.  He
spoke of the need to put time limits on welfare and to encourage welfare
recipients to work.  He even addressed the issue of orphanages.  Not once
did he mention marriage.  Yet a significant portion of the welfare burden
comes from single, unwed mothers.  For forty years or more, the government
pursued welfare policies that mass-produced fatherless children.  If today
we impose work requirements without promoting marriage, we will turn the
fatherless children into <em>de facto</em> orphans.  Yet Senator Gramm is oblivious
to the need to make promotion of marriage a policy objective.<p>
We can no longer afford to follow leaders for whom the moral challenge this
nation faces is an afterthought, when it ought to be the primary objective
of national policy.  That's why the leaders who want to finesse or run away
from the issue of abortion are not good enough either.  Today the spirit of
violence in our society is so great that our children are literally killing
one another.  What else should we expect in a nation where mothers have been
granted the spurious "right" to kill their offspring at will?  The
mother-child relationship is the wellspring of trust and love in a society.
The paradigm of all peace and security  should be the peace of the unborn
child in the womb.  The pro-abortion doctrine poisons the wellspring.  As
long as our courts sanction murder in the womb, they will be filled with
the consequences of violence in our streets, schools, workplaces and homes.
Politicians who run from the issue of abortion declare by that moral
cowardice their unwillingness to confront the killing spirit of our times.<p>
We need leaders who are willing to confront the moral identify crisis in
our nation, who are able to articulate and discuss the vital questions of
principle that will determine the kind of people we are and want to be.
Yet in domestic affairs, too many of our leaders seem willing to surrender
America's identity without a fight.  That was the real significance of the
obscene haste with which a "lame duck" Congress passed the GATT/WTO
agreement.  Many Americans feel that this agreement grants excessive
authority to an international organization on terms that violate
fundamental American tenets of political legitimacy.  They feel that it
embodies a threat to our national independence and identity.  Yet our
supposed leaders stigmatized such concerns as evidence of "extremism," and
embraced an agreement that bore all the marks of the Clinton
Administration's negotiating incompetence.<p>
Others have criticized the voters of California for demanding, through
Proposition 187, that the integrity of residence and citizenship within our
borders be supported with effective enforcement of the distinctions between
legal and illegal immigration.  They have implied that this demand is
evidence of bigotry, intolerance and racism.  Since when is it racist to
insist that laws, which no one denies our right to make, be enforced
against foreign citizens who violate them?<P>

<h2>Arlen Specter: Political Philosophy</h2> <P>
</center>
I believe the core of the Republican Party, and the essence of American greatness, is respect for
freedom--freedom of the mind as well as the marketplace.  Reverence for the principle of human
freedom must establish the relationship between government and individuals--a relationship that
must be defined by the values of economic conservatism and social libertarianism.<P>
Economic conservatism means a recognition:  that prosperity and opportunity are the products of
free markets, not government bureaucracies or state welfare programs;  that economic growth
comes form low taxes and less government regulation;  and that we cannot continue to mortgage
our children's future with national debt.<P>
Social libertarianism means a recognition:  that human freedom must be spiritual as well as
economic; that our government must respect, absolutely and equally, the religious beliefs of all
Americans; and that the reproductive choices of American women are not a matter for
government intrusion.<P>
The principles of economic conservatism and social libertarianism mean limited government, but
not uncaring or do nothing government.  Consistent with these principles, government does have
a role to play in fighting crime, in expanding access to health care, in improving education and in
promoting economic opportunity--a role that government must play in partnership with the
values established in American homes, communities and places of worship.<P>
America's unique position in the world as its bastion of peace and beacon of freedom demands
the preservation of our nation as a self-reliant economic and military power second to none.<P>

<title>Dornan's Announcement Speech</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Dornan's Announcement Speech</h2><br>
<i>Presidential Announcement, April 13, 1995</i></center>
<br>   
   My fellow citizens of the greatest nation in all of recorded history,
   you know why I come to you today with my wife, Sallie, my beautiful
   family, my sons-in-law, my daughter-in-law, all nine of our
   grandchildren: I come to you humbly as a nine-times elected member of
   the people's house, the House of Representatives, the greatest
   legislative body in the world and, to quote George Washington, 'the
   theater of action'. . . especially given the last hundred and some
   days.<p>   
   This is an awesome quest for any man or any woman, to imagine that you
   could possibly lead a nation of over 264 million people with the added
   responsibility of being the commander-in-chief of what was just months
   ago over 2 million men and women serving in every corner of the world,
   let alone dealing with the title 'leader of the free world.' I don't
   know anyone ever in our history that has the perfect background, or
   even close to the proper background, to aspire to the highest
   executive post in this great land. But the sheer honor and humbling
   spirit of even beginning the quest to lead our nation is an
   opportunity that any American would treasure for the rest of their
   life.<p>   
   I chose this memorial because, like the Vietnam Memorial, it
   represents the commitment of brave men and women far beyond what is
   demanded of us in all other areas of public life, including the chief
   executive's job.<p>   
   I feel the spirit of my mother and father with me here today, and I'm
   dedicating my campaign to all those friends of mine whom I flew with
   in peace time in the happy innocent Eisenhower years who later
   disappeared into the mists of Southeast Asia.<p>   
   Dave Hrdlicka-no remains recovered, a known POW for over five maybe
   six years. He just disappeared in Laos-my best friend in the Air
   Force. Dave was the godfather of my oldest son, Bob, standing in for
   my uncle Jack Haley. Sallie and I, with Sallie holding their oldest
   son during baptism, we were the godparents of Dave's oldest son, David
   Jr., who's now flying with American Airlines with a great Naval
   Aviator career behind him. Dave Hrdlicka's name is on the Xrietnam
   Memorial, as is that of my classmates in pilot training who got their
   wings the same day in 1955 that I did-Bernie Conklin, shot down by a
   MIG while he was flying an old twin-engine EC-47. In the Pentagon
   file, I read his last words-';They've hit our number one engine. It's
   burning. I guess this is it for us." We finally got back Bernie's
   remains, decades later. We never had returned to us the remains of the
   only other redhead in my class; David Allison. I saw his ID
   card-serial number just a few numbers less than mine-returned by Hanoi
   in the Central Intelligence Laboratory in Hawaii-that was it. . . one
   small green plastic card. Then Wayne Fulham, lost on a mission over
   Hanoi, handsomest man I ever saw in an Air Force uniform. When he was
   shot down and the North Vietnamese claimed they operated on him for
   several hours in a Hanoi hospital, they referred to him in their press
   as an all-American Boy. [Bootsie], his widow, just helped in the
   November election to elect one of the new freshmen Congressmen from
   Tennessee.<p>   
   For all of those men and others that I served with, who joined all
   those names on the Vietnam memorial, I dedicate this race. I run also
   for everyone in the military service since right up to Mogadishu and
   those who died on October 3rd and 4th and then again the night of the
   6th when 19 of the finest men that this country could ever produce,
   from 20-year-old Rangers to 36-year old Delta Force commandos, and two
   young 10th Mountain Division troops-Bob Dole's division, the 10th-and
   the greatest helicopter pilots to ever fly, the 160th Special
   Operations Aviation Regiment Special Forces out of Fort Campbell. I
   dedicate myself also to all of those heroes, particularly the two
   Nodal of Honor winners, Randy Shugart, whose dad refused to shake
   Clinton's hand at the White House, and Master Sergeant Gary
   Gordon-they both left beautiful wives. Gary Gordon also left little
   Ian and Brittany behind. These men gave their lives so that others
   would live. It s in scripture, Saint John, 1 S 1 3-"Greater love than
   this no man has."<p>  
   [IMAGE] Warrant Officer Michael Durant, in embracing me at Fort
   Campbell a few days after his return, said, "I owe my life to those
   two men." I promised, "Michael, I'll fight that they get the Medal of
   Honor." They did.<p>   
   On the Medal of Honor, there is only one word- Valor. On this side
   wall of the Law Enforcement Memorial, it quotes the greatest historian
   of the Roman Empire, Tacitus. He said, "In valor there is hope." And
   it is at this memorial and at the Vietnam memorial where we can
   experience hope that America's days are not ending, that our third
   century can be our best, that the American dream can be restored. . .
   rebuilt.<p>   
   Opposite Tacitus' words about valor are the stirring remarks about
   this memorial by of the 41st president of the United States, my friend
   and a decent man, a Navy carrier attack combat pilot, George Bush.
   Listen to what he said just four short years ago when this memorial
   was dedicated. President Bush standing about here told our nation
   this, "Carved on these walls is the story of America, of a continuing
   quest to preserve democracy and decency and to protect a national
   treasure that we call the American Dream.<p>   
   Well, I stand her today because of that American Dream and this
   terrible and tragic conviction that it is disappearing before our
   eyes, that our culture is melting down, that moral decay is rotting
   the heart and the soul of our country, that Abraham Lincoln's worst
   fear for the nation he saved bay be unfolding. He had his only
   inaugural ball in this beautiful treasure of a building {National
   Pension Building} behind us and was dead within a few weeks in the
   morning hours of April 15, 1865.<p>   
   Lincoln said, as a young 38-year-old man to a service club in
   Illinois, that American will never be conquered from without, that no
   despot will ever take a drink out of the Ohio River, that if America
   collapses as a civilization it will be because we destroyed ourselves.
   And I believe right now, a century and half after President Lincoln's
   warning to the United States, that America is poisoning herself, that
   we are destroying this God-blessed nation of ours, and I'm going to
   carry that message of warning to as many states as I can, and make
   sure that my good Republican friends in our primary races, every one
   of them a noble competitor hear and address my concerns. The eight of
   them stand head and shoulders in character and integrity above the
   occupant of the White House, but I want my friends; Bob Dole, our
   World War II hero, Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan and Allen Keyes; my
   governor in California; Lamar Alexander, excellent former governor of
   Tennessee; Dick Lugar, who like me, has a deep interest in foreign
   affairs, and Arlen Specter- I mean- I said Allen Keyes-Arlen Specter,
   who like me wants a flat tax. It's new to him, I've been for it for 27
   years.<p>   
   All these good men, I want them to focus in on the social
   issues tearing our country apart. Yes we have an impending financial
   disaster that we approach at an ever increasing speed. Six trillion
   dollars of debt is absolutely a moral issue, and the debt will reach
   $6 trillion, by anybody's fair analysis before we begin, through a
   painful discipline-probably a 30 year process-to eliminate that debt.<p>   
   The main focus of my announcement will be in New York City, on my 40th
   wedding anniversary, Sallie's birthday, this coming Easter Sunday.
   Before that we will be in that great Granite State with the wonderful
   motto 'Live Free or Die,' New Hampshire, on income tax day, Saturday
   the 1 5th. The Dornan family will visit two places where I will focus
   on moral decay at Exeter and economic collapse at Nashua.<p>   
   But today on Thomas Jefferson's birthday tomorrow Good Friday will be
   a travel day-I am humbled to announce my declaration for the
   Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States of
   America. [applause]<p>   
   Why do we go to New York City in three days? I was baptized in Saint
   Patrick's Cathedral the second month of FDR's first term. My parents
   were married at St. Pat's the June before Black Tuesday, the big Wall
   Street crash of 1929. I love my home town of my birth. I truly was
   born in Harlem-llOth Street. It gives me excellent bragging rights
   with my friends in the Black; Caucus.<p>   
   And I don't mind jumping Sallie's Easter birthday on this day because
   I want to take this opportunity on Thomas Jefferson's birthday, his
   252nd birthday, to read for you a few perfect Jetferson quotes, before
   I briefly discuss our half hearted war on crime, in which not all
   Americans are fully engaged...not by any, measure. Most Americans are
   not in the fight at all We should always turn to our founders and
   framers in times of great change.<p>   
   Thomas Jefferson, born April 13th, 1743, and one of the
   greatest intellects during of our first revolution, any changes I
   think has much to say to us in our current bloodless revolution. Quote
   One: "We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must
   make our election"-meaning choice-';between economy and liberty or
   profusion and servitude. If we run into such debt"-(and we're
   trillions beyond Thomas Jefferson's worst nightmare)- "that we must be
   taxed in our meat, in our drink, in our necessities and our comforts
   and our labors"-that's what we call income tax- "and in our
   amusements" that's what we call an amusement tax-"and our calling and
   our creeds"-that's the effort to drop the tax deduction for religious
   or charitable contributions-"we will have no time to think, no means
   of calling our managers"-the U.S. Congress- "to account, but only be
   glad to obtain sustenance by hiring ourselves"-to the IRS or to the
   Clinton administration-"to rivet the chains on the necks of our fellow
   sufferers"-that of course means us the U.S. taxpayers.<p>   
   "And this tendency of all human governments, a departure from
   principle becoming a precedent till the bulk of society is reduced to
   mere automatons of misery. And the forehorse of this frightful team is
   public debt. And in trainwretchedness and oppression.<p>   
   We finally have the focus of the Grand Old Party on this massive debt,
   on our deficit spending, on oppressive tax increases. America is
   living through such a new day that I not only finally speak proudly of
   my 27 years of support for the concept of a flat tax, but now chairman
   Bill Archer of Ways and Means-(who in 1970 won George Bush's seat in
   the U.S. House)-says ';The flat tax can be a plateau,"-a flat tax
   plateau period-"Until we can turn to a tax on consumption so we can
   abolish the IRS and send almost 11,000 agents if they want to continue
   to serve their country into other pursuits, or preferably into the
   private sector to help create jobs."<p>   
   By finally making drastic changes in our tax collection, we will save
   our citizens billions of dollars in lawyers and tax accountants as
   high as $30 billion. And we can run our government with a consumerism
   tax, where the rich will pay more because they garner unto themselves
   more goods, more services, more products. And with our poor-we can set
   a level of protection from taxation.<p>   
   But I'm not here at this memorial only to discuss Thomas Jefferson's
   powerful words about oppressive big government. I'm here to discuss
   what those words of George Bush meandemocracy and decency, the two
   pillars of civilization. Any civilization worthy of the respect of its
   citizens and worthy of being recorded in history as a great culture
   where families feel safe and secure is established those
   pillars-liberty and virtue.<p>   
   You cannot have true liberty unless people are virtuous. You cannot
   possibly hire enough men and women to wear blue and khaki to police
   effectively a land devoid of virtue. You can't hire enough U.S.
   attorneys or district attorneys or marshals or prison guards to keep
   peace in a country if a people has lost virtue. If the majority of
   citizens steal from one another and lie, and a handshake means
   nothing, and contracts mean nothing, then your culture has decayed
   past the point of no return.<p>   
   You must have a virtuous people or a free marketplace doesn't work.
   Capitalism is a failure up and down the line. But conversely you
   cannot have virtue unless a people are truly free to make decent
   choices, to choose a moral path in life. Our forefathers-again Thomas
   Jefferson concluded our Declaration of Independence with the ringing
   words "With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we
   mutually pledge to each other our lives"-and some paid that full
   price-'our fortunes"-they were all bankrupted at the end of the 61/2
   year struggle"and our sacred honor." This is the noble commitment that
   U.S. senators and men and women in the House of Representatives should
   make over and over.<p>   
   When I was 19, during my first week on active duty; I took a ball pen,
   and in the soft vinyl of a cheap Air Force folder, dreaming about
   becoming an F-86 "Saberjet" pilot, carved those words into my
   binder-"With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence."
   Tourists are visiting Jefferson's beautiful memorial across the Tidal
   Basin at this moment during Easter vacation. Inside, around the rime
   of the rotunda's dome they read: 'I have sworn upon the altar of God
   eternal vigilance against every tyranny over the mind of man."
   Powerful? Yes, our founders Were committed to a nation of virtue, to
   the spiritual, to a respect for religion.<p>   
   The First Amendment is not, a rejection of religion; religion-"the
   free exercise thereof' is mentioned in the amendment before freedom of
   speech, of the press, of the right for people to peaceably assemble
   and redress their government. The First Amendment starts off stating
   that Congress-that's me-shall respect no establishment of religion-no
   favoritism-and then the amendment says "or abridge the free exercise
   thereof." Clearly our founders and the framers of our inspired
   Constitution respected religion. Now we suffer a horribly polluted
   marketplace, a debased culture in Hollywood ridicules and assaults
   religion, tears valor and hope and virtue out of our country.<p>   
   I'm very pleased that Bob Dole is reading over some of my speeches
   delivered on the House floor over the last 19 years. Bob was brilliant
   in Iowa this week, a wonderful kick off speech in his beautiful home
   Bible Belt-state of Kansas. A day later, he was excellent in Ohio, the
   state of presidents. I think I'm already having an effect on my
   competition, and I hadn't even declared until right now. [applause]<p>   
   In this campaign, I'm going to insist we candidates discuss the
   morality crisis in our beautiful country. We are living through a
   meltdown of our cultures I repeat-we are witnessing advanced cultural
   meltdown-And we conservatives are going to reverse this tragedy. I'm
   an optimist about this challenge, because one of my political heroes,
   Winston Churchill, an inspiration to all politicians in republics?
   never apologized for saying that Western civilization was an example
   for the whole world with our representative government. And in a
   republic, the people rule, and can change anything, even meltdown.<p>   
   [IMAGE] Ronald Reagan's last wonderful public appearance was in that
   building behind me, Lincoln's Pension Building. That's where he made
   us all laugh when he talked about "looking down at the White House,
   the beautiful home, the Ellipse, David Gergen-nothing has changed."
   That's when Margaret Thatcher reminded us again what a gift to the
   world Ronald Reagan was. He helped to break apart the evil empire. And
   isn't it beyond irony, beyond comprehension that in the same
   generation that conquered most of Communism, we begin to poison
   ourselves with rampant hedonism in the popular culture. Today's
   contradictions simply does not make sense.<p>   
   I ask this of my fellow Republican primary voters, the focus of our
   primary process: please don't pick a candidate this early. Keep your
   powder dry. Keep your options open. Listen carefully to all nine of
   us. We do have a badly front-loaded primary process. The 1996 race is
   more like a 50-yard dash, unfortunately, than a longer more revealing
   contest. A long marathon would give more of a chance to the seven of
   us back in the pack. My pal Phil's got the early big money. Bob Dole
   has the name identification and big money from a wonderful, long
   federal career starting in Congress in 1961. They're both millionaires
   as are five of the remaining six. But now and then-message trumps
   money. Prayers are answered.<p>   
   And what I say to my fellow candidates, let's make Americans proud of
   the Republican Party. Let's reach out, as it says in Proverbs, to the
   poor and to the helpless. Let's not let the media spin everything our
   fine Speaker Gingrich says, everything the nine of us say on the
   campaign trail. For example, let us explain the glory of our 10th
   Amendment in the Bill of Rights and fight hard to restore power back
   to our governors...or to the people.<p>   
   In Europe they refer to this country as "the States,?' not United, not
   America. To them, greater America is Canada, Mexico, it's all of South
   America. What fascinates Europeans is our concept of federalism, the
   power invested in our regional governors, the uniqueness of our
   States. Children in European schools memorize the names of our 50
   states and love to recite them. Our children rarely learn the names of
   the nations of Europe with equal enthusiasm.<p>   
   Our states are unique. Our presidential power is unique throughout all
   the governments of the world because every other county has opted for
   a parliamentary system.<p>   
   Let's show our youth and let's show the world that the United States
   of America has its best years ahead of us. Let's try to be an
   inspiration to the world. Of course there is hope for our country, to
   stop the meltdown and recover. We honor these men and women in police
   work who give up their lives not just to protect our lives, but to
   protect our property, to give us the domestic tranquillity that was
   mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution, to help us reestablish
   the justice that is again mentioned in the Preamble as the reason to
   ordain and establish the Constitution. <p>
   I will walk around these beautiful grounds again today and answer your
   questions. There are brochures available that tell the historical
   background of this great memorial. May I point out that point out that
   my beautiful golden state of California has over 1,100 names of peace
   officers killed on duty on these walls. We will be adding 13
   California officers' names next month. I hope the press will come to
   the ceremony here you'll learn something about that middle class
   kinship around the kitchen tables in those small villages or farms
   across America where a family will say to a young son or daughter
   ';yes, go for a career in the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Coast
   Guard, the Army, the Navy. It's a fine way to serve your country. Or
   the family may decide a great career is serving as a marshal, a deputy
   sheriff-"the khaki line,X' or as a police officer-the "thin blue
   line." We owe a great debt to the middle class of this country, those
   people who are living quiet productive lives, yes lives, of virtue,
   the solid family people of this country. That's who I intend to reach
   for. I want their support so that I can proudly serve as their
   president.<p>   
   What' s our battle cry in this campaign-it's on the signs around here?
   Faith. . . Family. . . Freedom.<p>   
   Without faith what does a people have?<p>   
   Family. That's what I'm going to accentuate and why I'm proud to have
   my beautiful extended family with me here today.<p>   
   And Freedom. And I don't mean just freedom for this country. I
   say to my friends in this primary process, we have an obligation to
   try and extend liberty-freedom where we can, where we are able to
   assist, even at some loss of life to our young men and women if we can
   explain the vital interests involved. We must impart democracy,
   freedom, and virtue wherever we can around the world. But remember
   this-when terrorist countries refer to the United States as The Great
   Satan and point out our frightening crime rate, our venereal disease
   rate, our children shooting children, our pornography, the hedonist
   filth on the soap operas, the filth on the talk shows, and the
   blasphemous language, the debasement of our language on most of the
   situation comedies and on the made for TV movies, and cable
   television. When I spoke to the CEO of one of America's greatest
   communications networks last week and asked him why as an Irish
   Catholic he couldn't stop the filth on his own network. I explained
   why I wouldn't let my grandchildren watch his network. Well, here's
   all this Irishman could say to me with his millions of dollars,
   private jet, country club memberships, gated communities and special
   lounges at airports and railroad stations: he said to me,
   "Congressman, things have sure changed haven't they?"<p>   
   Well, yes sir, Mr. CEO, they have. And we're going to roll this decay
   back. We're going to restore the American dream. [applause] I am not
   going to watch as things fall apart. My favorite poet, William B.
   Yeats, wrote these words in 1939, the year Hitler began the world's
   most devastating war "Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. The
   blood-dimmed tide is loosed. And everywhere the ceremony of innocence
   is drowned. The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of
   passionate intensity.<p>   
   Well, ladies and gentlemen here's one congressman that has the
   conviction and is passionate about it. But don't let my passion
   mislead you. I have never yelled at my staff and I've tried to
   motivate my children by example, not by harshness; I have never in
   subcommittee or committee or at a press conference ever shown a mean
   streak, only passion. On the floor of the House, in the Well, yes,
   I've been a tough debater, but no tougher than Patrick Henry
   exclaiming, "Give me liberty or give me death." I apologize for
   nothing when it comes to conviction or where I have been indignant in
   House speeches. It's not easy to be in the minority for 40 years
   forsaken in that political desert. My heart goes out to all my friends
   on the other side of the aisle who are having a little difficulty
   getting used to minority status.<p>   
   But let me advise you; if someone today is not publicly indignant
   about the bankruptcy policies of the government of this, the richest
   country ever- a government destroying the American dream economically,
   and if somebody in office is not publicly indignant saying "Let's stop
   this," about our cultural meltdown-our moral decline, I'll show you
   somebody who doesn't understand the facts. I'll show you somebody
   who's a pathetic bystander watching the destruction of their country
   before their eyes.<p>   
   While I fear for our country's future, I have a fighter's heart...
   come with me. At least wish me well, watch me, and help me participate
   in this great debate. Bob Dornan will probably never retire. I'll
   probably die with my boots on, so I don't ever apologize for being
   part of a pension system that I never voted for by the way. I want to
   meet St. Peter still swinging. Like Teddy Roosevelt, I love the
   arena-the political arena George Washington called "the theater of
   action." I love the dust. And yes, I have I bled for my country. When
   I was smashed in the face by a jet fighter's canopy ejecting. I came
   as close to death as Bob Dole did but without suffering his
   pain-there's no pain involved with drowning, just fear and sadness. <p>
   I have offered to put my life on the line for South Korea, for Israel,
   for Hungary, for Berlin, for the Dominican Republic and for Vietnam.
   But God never willed it so that I would have to fire at another
   mother's son.<p>   
   This is why I have a bond of love with cops and with the men and women
   in the military. I know the weight of that role of leadership and what
   it means to be Commander-in-Chief.<p>   
   My grandsons over her to my right, Kevin and Colin, helped me fly on
   the roof of the Capitol, 194 flags for every man killed in Somalia,
   44, 30 of those killed in action. I met with the families of the two
   Medal of Honor winners.<p>   
   I asked Randy Shugart's dad, Herb why he refused to shake Clinton's
   hand at the White House Medal Of Honor ceremony. Clinton told Mr.
   [Herb] Shugart he didn't even know the about the operation in which
   Randy was killed. . . that he didn't know Addid had been flown by a US
   Army aircraft to Addis Ababa. And Herb Shugart, the father of a Medal
   of Honor winner, told me, "Mr. President, you're not worthy to be
   Commander-in-Chief. I have nothing else to say to you." [applause] I
   know what is entailed with the Commander-in-Chiefs job. It's
   disgraceful Bill Clinton doesn't even have a clue.<p>   
   I'll close on this. One of my adversaries in the press-and brother, do
   they love their adversarial role-said ';Congressman, your passion in
   the Well, is that too strong for the White House? Might you not get us
   involved in a conflict" I pointed out to him that warriors or those
   trained to be combat ready warriors do not endanger the precious lives
   of their brothers and sisters in uniform unless, if all other means
   are exhausted, we can look their parents, their brother and sisters,
   their widows, their children in the eyes and tell them why their young
   heroes was asked to risk their young lives. Clinton cannot do that
   because he doesn't understand the careful, moral use of the power
   entrusted in the presidency. If you want to see tragic American
   history unfold be fore your reading eyes in one heartbreaking chapter
   after another about evil civilian leadership, I suggest you read
   Robert Strange MacNamara's rotten book, as I'm doing. Never again,
   will a war criminal like MacNamara soil our nation's honor.<p>   
   Thank you for coming today and God bless you, everyone. It's
   going to be a lot of fun out there on the campaign trail. If someone
   can't enjoy this election process, they shouldn't declare. I think the
   door will close next month after Senator Lugar and Governor Pete
   Wilson enter the race.<p>   
   We've got all nine grandchildren with us to head north to New
   Hampshire and we're going to have a good old time. Here's my Clinton
   countdown watch showing 572 days until the election. Sallie, what's
   your counting down until the inauguration? 648! Just add 76 days to
   mine and you have the inauguration day. I'm counting the hours and the
   days until we send the Clintons packing. This is going to be a great
   quest and a great American experience for our family and friends.<p>

<h2>Testimony of U.S. Senator Richard G. Lugar
House Ways and Means Committee
Hearings on Tax Reform
June 8, 1995</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Mister Chairman, I thank you for your strong leadership in the tax 
reform arena. Your often quoted comment that our current tax system should 
be "pulled out by the roots" has been an inspiration as I have traveled the 
country advocating the elimination of the federal income tax.<p>
 What I have found during my travels is that American families are 
frustrated, and even angry, with their economic predicament. They feel like 
they are running on a treadmill and that the treadmill is wining.<p>
The problem is that many Americans suspect that there is diminishing 
hope for a better future. The economic facts justify these beliefs.  From 
1950 through 1973, hourly compensation --including both wages and benefits-- 
increased an average of 3.0 percent per year.  Since 1973, the average wage 
increase has been less than one half of one percent.  During the past two 
decades, economic growth has been cut in half, averaging only 2.4 percent 
annually. And if this isn't depressing enough for the average American 
family, limiting growth to 2.5 percent is the stated economic policy of the 
Federal Reserve Board.<p>
This we must change. The American public is demanding it.<p>
The cause of America's economic doldrums is twofold: the huge federal 
budget deficit that robs us of the capital we need to grow, and a federal tax 
system that not only discourages, but confiscates our savings and investment.<p>
Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels.  After 
averaging close to 9.0 percent in the 1960's, we recently saw our nation's 
savings rate bottom out at 1.1 percent in 1992.  Because of this low rate of 
savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce.  As a 
result, productivity has averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994.  The 
Concord Coalition estimates that had our productivity held its  pre-1974 
annual rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $50,000 a 
year instead of the current level of $35,000 a year. <p>
Americans celebrate that both houses of Congress have now passed budget 
resolutions that will bring us to balance in seven years. We now face the 
more difficult task of actually implementing this budget guide in our 
spending measures. We must be resolute in this endeavor and not fall victim 
to business as usual in Washington.<p>
As part of the effort to balance the budget, I support providing the 
American public with tax relief. But I strongly believe it is time to stop 
working around the edges of the tax code.  We must transform it completely.<p>
The federal income tax system is inherently flawed.  By taxing savings 
and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to 
economic growth in the country . It represents the worst form of big 
government intrusion into the lives of all Americans. Each year it costs 
Americans more than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal 
to the total worker output of my state of Indiana. It is unfair. It is 
riddled with loopholes.   It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. 
And finally, it doesn't work. By its own admission, the Internal Revenue 
Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, with an estimated 
$127 billion in uncollected taxes annually.<p>
 Anything this bad, this broken and this ineffective should be ended 
decisively, and that is what I propose. I want to scrap the income tax 
completely and replace it with a national sales tax.  Mr. Chairman, you have 
outlined the criteria for evaluating an effective tax system.  It must be: 
(1) simple, (2) the least intrusive, (3) fair, (4)  border adjustable, and 
(5) friendly to savings and investment.  I have added that it also must be 
transparent.  I have studied all the recent tax proposals with these six 
factors in mind.  Many are better than the current tax system. But if we are 
going to overhaul our tax system, we should choose the one that meets these
criteria. I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative.<p>
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity.  
Under a national sales tax, the burden of complying with the income tax code 
would be lifted.  There would be no records to keep or audits to fear.  The 
money a person makes is his or her own. You don't have to report it. You 
don't have to hide it. You may decide if you want to save it, invest it, or 
give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a 
tax. Although I applaud the efforts of flat tax advocates to simplify tax 
forms, nothing could be more simple than no forms at all. <p>
The national sales tax is the least intrusive of the tax proposals.  The 
IRS would be substantially dismantled under my proposal.  The IRS would no 
longer look over the shoulders of every American. There will be no audits.  
Americans would not waste time and effort worrying about record keeping, 
deductions, or exemptions that are part of the current tax code.  Although
the flat tax proposals tax consumption, they do so by giving the income tax 
a facelift and leaving the IRS largely intact.   You have stated, 
Mr. Chairman, "If the roots remain, the tree will grow back."  <p>
The national sales tax is the fairest.  Everyone pays the tax including 
wealthy individuals, criminals, illegal aliens, and others who currently 
avoid taxation.  Wealthy Americans who consume more would pay higher taxes 
under the national sales tax.  Individuals who save and invest their money 
will pay less.  Gone are the loopholes and deductions.<p>
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy.  When 
criminals and illegal aliens consume the proceeds of their activities, they 
will pay a tax.  Foreign tourists will pay the tax.  Tax systems that rely on 
income reporting will never collect any of this revenue.  <p>
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited 
means to pay taxes.  An integral part of my plan is protection for Americans 
who need it--senior citizens, the unemployed, and Americans with low paying 
jobs.  <p>
One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level 
of goods and services consumed by each American from the federal sales tax.  
Each citizen who has a Social Security number will receive this exemption.  
For example, if the exemption level were $5000, a family of four would have 
its first $20,000 of spending exempt from the sales tax.  This figure is 
approximately 33 percent above the 1994 poverty threshold for a family of 
four.  <p>
Another strategy might be the exempting of items such as housing or 
medicine.  This is the method the majority of states have chosen and the one 
advocated by this Committee's Chairman. Americans understand and are 
comfortable with this practice. In the end, it will be up to this Committee 
and the Finance Committee in the Senate to decide the most desirable path.<p>
The national sales tax is the most transparent of the tax reform 
proposals.  A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster efforts 
in Congress to achieve prudence in federal spending.  There should be no 
hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or withholding 
mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes.  Every year the public and
Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for the federal 
government to meet its obligations. If average Americans are paying that rate 
every day, they will make certain that Congress spends public funds wisely.  <p>
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national 
sales tax.  In January, the United States registered one of the largest trade 
deficits in our nation's history.  We must adopt a tax system that encourages 
exports.  Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border 
adjustable.  They are able to strip out their tax when exporting their goods.  
In comparison, the income tax, and for that matter the flat tax, are not 
border adjustable.  American goods that are sent overseas are taxed 
twice--once by the income tax and once when reaching their destination.  
In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports.  It 
would level the playing field with our trading partners.   And best of all, 
foreign imports would be taxed when they are consumed in the United States.<p>
Mr. Chairman, the last and most imperative reason for replacing the 
income tax with a national sales tax is that it would liberate our economy by 
encouraging savings.  For the first time in the modern era, the next 
generation of Americans may be economically worse off than the previous one.  
Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average 
income of families has fallen.  They feel trapped in a box with diminishing 
hope of escaping.<p>
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough.  Savings are 
vital because they are the source of all investment and productivity gains--
savings supply the capital for buying a new machine, developing a new product 
or service, or employing an extra worker.  According to a recent poll, 
seventy-two percent of Americans realize that they are not saving enough for 
the future.  Our net national savings rate in the 1990's has been 1.8 percent 
of Gross Domestic Product compared with a rate of 8.1 percent in the 1960's, 
7.2 percent in the 1970's, and 3.7 percent in the 1980's.  <p>
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans and the 
Germans save five times as much as we do.  Today, many believe that 
Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for 
the future.  Few realize that before World War II, before the income tax 
system reached its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their 
earnings than the Japanese.<p>
A national sales tax would reverse this trend by directly taxing 
consumption and leaving savings and investment untaxed.  Economists agree 
that a broad-based consumption tax would increase our savings rate 
substantially.  Economist Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University estimates 
that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year.   The 
implementation of a national sales tax is expected to create one million new 
jobs over a ten year period and a three percent rise in wages over that same 
period of time.  Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University has concluded 
that had a consumption tax like the national sales tax been put into place
in 1986 instead of the current system, the United States would have 
experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic growth!  
Mr. Chairman, our citizens and our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.  <p>
 As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the 
best tax system to replace the income tax.  It is simple.  It protects 
privacy.  It is fair and transparent.  And it promotes economically 
beneficial behavior.  For these reasons, I encourage its enactment.<p>
Mr. Chairman, we live in an exciting time when the world is opening its 
arms to free enterprise.   The Uruguay round of GATT significantly lowered 
the barriers to trade.  Congress will soon open the telecommunications 
industry to competition, better enabling individuals and companies to 
interconnect across the globe. Goods and information are able to flow freely
between countries with few obstructions.  One of the last remaining barriers 
between countries is their tax systems.   We must face the fact that America 
is competing with other countries whose tax systems are more friendly to 
investment than is our income tax.<p>
If we enact a tax system that encourages investment and savings, 
billions of dollars of investment will flow into our country.  During a 
recent poll taken by Princeton Economics International, executives of the top 
twenty Japanese companies stated unanimously that they would bring 
manufacturing to the United States if our country enacted a broad based 
retail consumption tax.  It makes sense.  America has the most stable 
political system, the best infrastructure, a highly educated workforce and 
the largest consumer market in the world.  Our economic growth and prosperity 
would be unsurpassed.  <p>
There will be complex transitional  issues to address. But in the end, 
our country will be stronger and more prosperous.  That has to be our focus. 
Our vision must be for an America in which the American family enjoys better 
job prospects and more real income. Our paychecks will be bigger, our savings 
will be greater, and our hopes will abound.  Let's give Americans this 
chance. <p> 
<br>
Thank you.<p>

Welcome to Town Hall's INFOTAINMENT.  I'm your host, Ann Klucsarits.  Each week I'll be bringing you some informative yet entertaining (get it? info-tainment) game or activity that will highlight the lighter side of conservatism.  Sometimes you'll be amused, other times challenged, but I  promise you that you'll always be entertained.<p>

This week's special is a <a href="/townhall/infotain/th_tour/door.html">tour of our very own Town Hall.</a>  Meet the faces behind the e-mail addresses and learn just a little bit about how we all work together to bring you the best sources of ideas and information in the conservative movement.<p>

In the weeks ahead, you can come to INFOTAINMENT to participate in polls, contests, and other games, and get a bird's eye view of Town Hall's kick-off event with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.<p>

We'd love to have your feedback and suggestions, so send any one of us an e-mail while you're on the tour!<p>

 these new communications opportunities.  The result of that is Town Hall.  Today Town Hall moves into a new dimension, the Internet.  And I'm very pleased to introduce the man behind the dream, Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., Town Hall's Chairman of the Board.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Thanks very much Tim, for that very nice introduction.  I appreciate it.  I'm very pleased to have with me my colleague from the Town Hall Board of Directors, Ed Capanno whose real job is publisher of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</i></a>.  Town Hall, from its very beginning, has been a joint project of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> and <i>National Review</i>.  And Ed, it's been a great learning curb for us, certainly, and we've been through a lot, but I think today bears witness to the fact that it has been worth working at.
<p>
 We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, Town Hall has been created to serve people.  To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue -- an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who's interested.
<p>
 And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.
<p>
Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty, joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families, their children, and their communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.
<p>
I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation and National Review, together, created Town Hall as the conservative meeting place on the Internet, and I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.
<p>
 From the Senate, we have Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country.  In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a national leader -- a man of action and a man of accomplishment.
<p>
On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.
<p>
 We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began
 with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
<p>
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  We're honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to produce someone who ought to know.  Please welcome in his 290th year, the father of invention and innovation, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.
<p>
Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboards and Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors, please?
<p>
<b>Benjamin Franklin</b>: Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand
  nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good
  will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny, and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentlemen, on the count of  three.... one ... two ... three ... start your engines.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Alright!  Town Hall is officially launched!
<p>
Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, you too Mr. Franklin.  Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations who vision and creativity have spurred them to join in this innovative effort.  I'm very please to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.
<p>
As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall on big screen.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, please welcome, <a href="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a>, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/welcome.html">American Conservative Union</a>.
<li>Next, Shades of the Boston Tea Party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.

I would now like to give you all an opportunity to hear from our two  wonderful leaders here today.  It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- the Honorable Newt Gingrich.

<b>Senator Dole</b>: Thank you very much.  It's a privilege for me to be here, and a privilege to see Ben Franklin again.  He was just telling me about his childhood with Senator Thurmond.  But Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the rest of our founding fathers probably never imagined the
 technology that produced the computer age, and the Internet.  But one thing they did imagine -- a
 government closer to the people; a government that listened to the people, and a public that took active
 involvement in the issues today, and that is what Town Hall is all about.  Thanks to Town Hall, Americans are into the information age and the super-highway to take a detour around the traditional media road blocks.  And I am just one of countless Americans, who will be taking a right on the information highway, and heading straight for Town Hall.<p><hr>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">




<b>Speaker Gingrich</b></a>: I want to say first of all that I am delighted to be here.  I was explaining to Senator Dole that last night we pretended we were the Senate.  And we ran all night, and we're not use to this, we didn't get out till almost ten o'clock this morning.  He's used to these kind of marathons where you have to go all the time, but we're not quite that tough.  I'm a little blurry eyed, but delighted to be here.  I believe this is part of entering the information age, I think that this is a very important commitment to reach out and to allow literally people around the entire planet to be able to interact, have ideas, to have dialogues, to know
what's going on.  And to contribute good ideas.  And I'm just delighted that Ed Feulner brought all of us
together here today, to participate in creating Town Hall, and I can tell you from our stand point we look
forward to having lots of Americans, and frankly lots of people all across the world, to share with us their
ideas and their comments, and then to work with the various groups who will have their pages on this site.  We're very grateful, and I'm delighted to behalf of the House Republicans to be here to help inaugurate this.<p><br>

Welcome to Town Hall's INFOTAINMENT.  I'm your host, Ann Klucsarits.  Each week I'll be bringing you some informative yet entertaining (get it? info-tainment) game or activity that will highlight the lighter side of conservatism.  Sometimes you'll be amused, other times challenged, but I  promise you that you'll always be entertained.<p>

This week's special is a <a href="/townhall/infotain/th_tour/door.html">tour of our very own Town Hall.</a>  Meet the faces behind the e-mail addresses and learn just a little bit about how we all work together to bring you the best sources of ideas and information in the conservative movement.<p>

In the weeks ahead, you can come to INFOTAINMENT to participate in polls, contests, and other games, and get a bird's eye view of Town Hall's kick-off event with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.<p>

We'd love to have your feedback and suggestions, so send any one of us an e-mail while you're on the tour!<p>

Hall</h2>
This unassuming doorway is the entrance to the New Conservative World.  Town Hall was created in 1991 to serve as the meeting place for conservatives.  It began as a small BBS network and grew to become a CompuServe forum and the premier conservative site on the internet.  Launched on June 29th, 1995, Town Hall had 12 citizen organizations at a kickoff party attended by Speaker Newt Gingrich and then Majority Leader Bob Dole.

<p>

Heading in 1997, Town Hall has over 30 citizen organizations, over 30 columnists, and a new feature "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/thcc/"><i>The Conservative Current</i></a>" which is a subscriber service featuring 18 syndicated columnists such as Bob Novak, Tony Snow and Dan Quayle.<p>

Town Hall builds and maintains conservative organization's web sites and Town Hall's own orginal and syndicated content as a service to the conservative movement.
<p>
Located on the third
floor of <a href="http://www.heritage.org">The Heritage Foundation</a>, in Washington, DC, these offices house the nerve center of
Town Hall, including the most sophisticated computer equipment available...and some really
cool people.  Don't bother knocking, just come right in!  <p>

Welcome to Town Hall's INFOTAINMENT.  I'm your host, Ann Klucsarits.  Each week I'll be bringing you some informative yet entertaining (get it? info-tainment) game or activity that will highlight the lighter side of conservatism.  Sometimes you'll be amused, other times challenged, but I  promise you that you'll always be entertained.<p>

This week's special is a <a href="/townhall/infotain/th_tour/door.html">tour of our very own Town Hall.</a>  Meet the faces behind the e-mail addresses and learn just a little bit about how we all work together to bring you the best sources of ideas and information in the conservative movement.<p>

In the weeks ahead, you can come to INFOTAINMENT to participate in polls, contests, and other games, and get a bird's eye view of Town Hall's kick-off event with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.<p>

We'd love to have your feedback and suggestions, so send any one of us an e-mail while you're on the tour!<p>

<title>Welcome to Renewing American Civilization WWW Homepage -- PFF</title>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/pff/multi/gif/renew2.gif" alt="Renewing American Civilization"></CENTER>
<p><p>

For 30 years, America has experienced declines in many of the most basic measures
of cultural health, from out-of-wedlock births, to crime rates to voter turnout.
These developments have coincided with the explosive growth of bureaucratic
government ("the welfare state") and the emergence of a radical challenge to some
of the most fundamental principles of American thought.<p>

Since September 1993, a serious, substantive alternative to this approach has
been offered on over 60 college campuses throughout America in the form of a
college course: "Renewing American Civilization." Developed and taught by
Congressman Newt Gingrich, who holds a Ph. D. in History from Tulane University,
the course is dedicated to describing the underlying principles of American
Civilization and applying those principles to the challenges facing America in
the 1990s and the 21st Century -- including specifically the replacement of the
welfare state with an "opportunity society." <p>

In March, Mr. Gingrich completed his latest course at Reinhardt College, a small
(900 students) liberal arts college just north of Atlanta. In addition, the
course will be distributed by means of satellite broadcast and video tape for use
on college campuses across the country. By mid-1995, the Foundation will have the
class widely available on a for-credit basis on major college campuses nationally
through Mind Extension University and have available a 90-minute video that gives
the essence of the 20 hour course. <p>

<P>
Just how stable is the American political system?  To answer that
not insignificant question, it may be helpful to look back to
the early '90s when two brash personalities took center stage
in the American political theater.<BR>

<P>
Let me begin with a question:  What do Hillary Clinton and Newt
Gingrich share in common?  That question may seem amusing, but
is in fact vital to understanding the notion of future shock in
the present tense.<BR>

<P>
Let's start with Hillary Clinton.  That smart, tough First Lady
came to Washington hoping to make radical changes in the U.S.
health care system.  Hillary Clinton was slapped down.  Newt Gingrich
- who despite our political differences has been a personal friend
of ours for more than 25 years - came back to Washington as Speaker
of the House after the election of 1994 hoping to make even more
radical changes.  Brilliant, outspoken and imaginative, he envisioned
changes not just in health care and welfare but in American society
across the board, hoping, he said, to speed our transition to
a Third Wave information society.  Newt Gingrich, too, was quickly
slapped down, although some of his proposals were later adopted
and repackaged by President Clinton.<BR>

<P>
The way both of these people were treated reminded us of a conversation
in the White House with Lee Atwater, a political campaign operative
for President Reagan and later President Bush.  What he said to
us shortly after Reagan's first election was that &quot;you're
going to hear a lot in the days to come about the Reagan revolution.
 Don't believe a word of it.  If we Republicans are lucky,&quot;
he said, &quot;by dint of heroic effort we may push the system
5 degrees in one direction to compensate for the 5 degrees that
President Carter pushed it in the other direction.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Soon, both main political parties were engaged in the quadrennial
mindless race toward what can only be called the obsolete middle.
 What Atwater knew, what the treatment of Hillary Clinton and
Newt Gingrich suggested, then and now, and what each campaign
seems to reaffirm is that the American political system resists
any radical change.  The system itself, the structure of collective
decision making, the architecture of American politics, is itself
ultra stable.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>The End of Ultra-Stability<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The idea that the U.S. political structure is ultra stable should
in fact give pause to everyone, because by fueling a global shift
from a Second Wave smokestack society to a Third Wave knowledge-based
society, Americans are opening a path to tremendous benefits not
only for America but for the world.  The benefits will range from
higher standards of living, economic standards, to better health,
cleaner environment, etc.<BR>

<P>
But Americans -- and the populations of many other countries are
being battered by the very acceleration and the pace of life that
the knowledge revolution, instant communication and the Third
Wave of change bring with them.  Most Americans now feel hard
pressed, stressed out, upset with conditions in the country. 
Many are angry.  Most wish change would slow down and let them
catch their breath.  The Second Wave smoke-stack world that they
knew is vanishing as the Third Wave future invades every aspect
of American society today.  Daily life is suffused with higher
and higher levels of uncertainty and unpredictability.<BR>

<P>
This is not just true for individuals.  Businesses and giant corporations
are investing billions of dollars, sometimes even tens of billions.
 Essentially they are placing wagers on highly unpredictable outcomes.
 Many firms are caught up in incessant, traumatic orgies of restructuring.
 Many seemingly smart managers show all the signs of future shock
and run like lemmings after the latest management fad:  synergy,
core competence, total quality management, EVA, vertical integration,
re-engineering.  Some of these may be helpful, but, by and large,
most of these changes are made without any understanding of how
the resulting organization will fit into the fast-emerging economy
of the future, let alone the emerging social structure.<BR>

<P>
Meanwhile, the stress levels rise.  We call it future shock, which
is the distress and disorientation brought on by trying to adapt
to too much change at rates faster than people can handle.  We
also believe that, in fact, today's most disturbing social, cultural
and political developments can be traced precisely to this condition.
 Among these are the frightening fanaticism that we see in many
corners of society - racial and religious intolerance, the spread
of paranoia and conspiracy theories, anarchic terrorism, the purposelessness
and moral paralysis among so many young people - or the technophobia
 that was so perfectly symbolized by the Unabomber (whose Luddite
manifesto would have found many more supporters if its author
had not, it appears, punctuated his paragraphs with blood ). 
What we really see are two ways of life, two civilizations, in
collision.  One is the fading Second Wave industrial civilization.
 The other is its fast spreading Third Wave replacement.  The
collision of these two will result in enormous and politically
dangerous dislocations of various kinds.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Solidity and Flexibility of the Political System<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Against this turbulent background, should Americans want an ultra-stable
political system that focuses on the immediate and punishes the
change makers?  Or do countries undergoing such profound, high
speed change need a political system that anticipates social change
and mitigates its  accompanying turmoil and social conflict? 
Do we want a political system that in all its basic structures
was designed for the past to remain unchanged?  Or do we want
one that changes in sync with the changes in society?  Indeed,
is the political system in America really as stable today as it
was when Lee Atwater suggested that it was?  Is the American political
system ultra-stable or even stable?  Does the ultra-stability
of our pre-digital system provide the modicum of order and predictability
that society needs? Or by its obsolescence does it contribute
to <I>disorder</I> by suppressing needed changes and essentially
creating the conditions for a possible explosion of violence in
the future?<BR>

<P>
At a time when all our industrial era institutions, our Second
Wave institutions are in crisis -- the school system, the justice
system, the legal system, the family system, the health system,
the value system, and the energy system, not to mention the welfare
system (which has neither been ended as we know it, as President
Clinton now claims, or replaced with adequate safeguards for the
helpless, as the Republicans claim) -- do we want our political
system to be stable or do we want it to be flexible?  Do we want
it to stay as it is or do we want it to change?<BR>

<P>
In 1996 politicians of both parties were busy congratulating themselves
about welfare reform legislation that finally passed the Congress
and made its way to the White House.  But are the changes that
we celebrate today really as important as they appear in a media/political
system that focuses intensely on now and not tomorrow? And the
larger question is, are we capable of creating new replacement
systems for those that are in crisis if the overloaded political
decision-making apparatus is not itself dramatically and perhaps
constitutionally improved?<BR>

<P>
When the Industrial Revolution launched a Second Wave of change
in history roughly three centuries ago, political systems were
transformed.  Monarchies toppled; &quot;divine right&quot; went
out the window; modern nations were formed; mass political parties
were organized.  In country after country, politics eventually
came to reflect the industrial order.  Politicians began to speak
in terms of machine analogies: they spoke of checks and balances,
political machines, of railroading legislation, steamrollering
a bill, capturing the state machine.  Trotsky talked about the
flywheel revolution.  All of these metaphors reflected the industrial
Second Wave technologies of that era.<BR>

<P>
Vast social dislocations followed the arrival of industrial civilization
on the planet.  Conflicts and even wars resulted from the clash
between the old First Wave agricultural elites and the rising
urban industrial Second Wave elites.  That is the historical background
we should not forget as we now go through a process of transformation
from a Second Wave to a Third Wave civilization.  Today, everything
is caught up in this vortex of transformation - our economic,
social and cultural systems are essentially up for grabs.
<P>
<CENTER><B>The Economy of the Future<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
What the United States has is not an economy.  What the United
States has are two economies or a bisected economy, with remnants
of the old Second Wave, mass production, bigger-is-better, assembly-line
economy of the industrial age, and alongside it, the rising and
rapidly growing Third Wave economy.  Our economists chattering
away on C-SPAN and CNN and in the newspapers constantly talk about
the future of the economy.  I think it is time to stop talking
about the <U>future of the economy</U> and start talking about
the <U>economy of the future.<BR>
</U>
<P>
Talking about the <U>future of the economy</U> implies a continuation
of the economy as we have known it.  Talking about <U>the economy
of the future</U> implies something dramatically different.  It
is an economy in which we will be compelled to redefine the fundamental
concepts that we have lived with since Adam Smith, Karl Marx and
the Industrial Revolution.  All the fundamental terms of economic
thinking now require radical redefinition.  What is productivity
in an information-based or knowledge-based economy?  What is property
and what is capital as they go from tangible to intangible?  Money
itself is subjected to a new law as it becomes informationalized
and as information becomes monetized.  The nature of work changes.
<BR>

<P>
We are moving into a world in which for many the job may no longer
be the primary source of income.  We are moving into a world in
which the faster the rate of change, the more complex the society,
the more information must be generated, stored and transformed
into knowledge, the more information must be exchanged and the
more competitive the global economy becomes.  We are creating
an economy with less and less room for uneducated or less skilled
workers.  Indeed, even highly skilled workers can have the wrong
skills at the wrong place at the right time and find themselves
vulnerable.  We may be moving from a economy based on employment
to one in which we do not have employees but have in fact &quot;entreployees&quot;,
some cross between entrepreneur and employee.<BR>

<P>
Everyone talks about symbol manipulation or knowledge work, but
little has been done to categorize its forms.  There is more to
mind work than just computer data.  Not all knowledge is or must
pass through our digital technology.  Face to face communication
remains vital, as well.  What is really interesting is that one
can build a typology of knowledge work.  People work at different
levels of abstraction, from the data entry clerk to the research
scientist to the financial planner or the corporate strategist.
<BR>

<P>
You have different functions going on inside companies that in
the past were regarded as essentially wasteful and unproductive.
 Some people in companies bring  information from the outside
world into the firm.  Other people are paid to take information
from inside the firm and export it.  Then you have people that
are essentially like relays; they internally carry information
from one part of the firm to the other.  Then you have those that
are creative, the people who come up with crazy ideas, one out
of ten of which is really powerful and useful. Then you have another
team of people who say, &quot;Wait a minute; that will not work,&quot;
who essentially filter the creative ideas as they are raised.
All of these knowledge processes are going on inside every organization,
but have never been mapped, categorized and or valued very highly.
<BR>

<P>
In fact, in the Second Wave, the assumption was that there were
two fundamental sources of added value, one was physical or manual
labor and the other was capital.  Ideas, people who dealt with
this information and knowledge, were regarded as paper pushers,
pencil pushers, who were unproductive and provided no value added.
We now know the reverse may very well be coming true.  These are
just a handful of the changes that the economy is going through,
and if you look at them closely they are not incremental changes
but in fact are transformatory.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>The New Role of the Family in Society<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
If all that was happening was a shift from a manual labor economy
to a knowledge based economy, that would be pretty revolutionary.
 But at the same time, we are also transforming the social structure
as deeply as the economy.  <BR>

<P>
Take the role of the home, once the center of society.  There
were exceptions, of course, but, as a rule, in First Wave agrarian
civilizations around the world, the typical family structure was
an extended family with multiple generations living under the
same roof.  Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins and sometimes
non-blood relatives identified as relatives were brought into
the households.  These large households were the center of work,
with the family serving as a production team, going out together
to work in the fields or in the cottage itself.<BR>

<P>
The family had a lot of fundamental functions in such societies.
 The family not only did the work, the family took care of the
health of its members.  If you were sick, there was no place else
to go.  The family educated the children because for most people
there were no schools.  The family took care of the sick and the
elderly because there was no was no state welfare; there was no
external support.  The family also was indeed a media system,
so that if the state or the church wanted to communicate with
the children and form that new generation, it had to do it through
the family.  The family was a transmission link in communication
from the powers that be or were.<BR>

<P>
With the Industrial Revolution family structure changes.  Family
size shrinks, and, instead of a big household with a lot of people
all living together, the nuclear family becomes the norm.   In
the United States that was defined that as:  mother stays home,
father goes to work, two children under the age of 18.   The nuclear
family, thus, became the Model T, the standard family form and
everybody was expected to grow up into that.  You're going to
get married, you're going to have kids, you're going to live in
house with a white picket fence.  You are going to grow up in
a nuclear family, and, in turn, you are going to create a nuclear
family.<BR>

<P>
In industrial society, the old, fundamental functions of the family
are stripped away from the family.  Work is no longer done in
the household, it is done somewhere else, in a factory or an office
that operates like a factory.  Notice that education is no longer
regarded as the task of the parent primarily but now is assigned
to a school, a mass education system designed for mass production
society. Health now goes to the doctor in the health delivery
system.  Care of the elderly goes to the state and, as far as
the family serving as the critical media in society, they now
have competition from the mass media.  All the fundamental social
functions that the family filled in First Wave societies have
now been taken away from them.  The family is reduced.  The relationship
is reduced essentially to procreation and psychological support
and some consumer functions as distinguished from producer functions.
<BR>

<P>
 When we were researching Future Shock in the mid-sixties, we
asked every expert we could find, &quot;What is going to happen
to the nuclear family system?&quot;  They said, with great assurance,
&quot;Nothing.&quot;  But we said that was not plausible because
there were too many other changes happening in society.  And in
fact, what has happened is that the nuclear family, defined precisely
in the terms of the Census Bureau, now describes  less than 5
percent of the population.  A major reason is that most women
now work, which immediately shatters the definition of nuclear
family.<BR>

<P>
However, there are even more fundamental changes in family structure
occurring with the arrival of the Third Wave of change.  Some
people do not like these changes, and we are not arguing that
they are necessarily good, but they are happening and they are
fundamental.   What is happening is not the death of the family,
but the emergence of multiple family styles:  single parents,
childless couples, once remarried, twice remarried, etc.  We have
gone from a homogenous family structure to a heterogeneous family
structure.  We have done this with enormous pain and traumatic
emotional agony in society, but this is not unrelated to the other
changes in the world around us.  Family is not an independent
variable; it is related to how we work; it is related to technology;
it is related to communication; it is related to the other parts
of the social system; it is a component to a larger system.  When
you change all those other components you change the family as
well.<BR>

<P>
In 1980, in The Third Wave, we wrote about the electronic cottage.
 Apart from encouraging smaller work units, apart from permitting
a decentralization and deurbanization of production, apart from
altering the actual character of work the new production system
is shifting literally millions of jobs out of factories and offices
into which the Second Wave swept them right back where they came
from originally - the home.   This strange idea was ridiculed
after we wrote it by the establishment media like The New York
Times and The Economist. The New York Times ran a page one article
dismissing the whole notion as merely &quot;visionary.&quot; 
Of course, The New York Times today is filled with articles about
people working at home.<BR>

<P>
It is not just work that is returning to the home. Health care
is as well.  When our daughter needed intravenous antibiotics
a couple of years ago, she did not get them in the hospital. 
She got them at home.  Many processes that we once thought had
to be done in the doctor's office can now be done at home: electronic
blood pressure measurement, pregnancy testing, HIV testing, etc.
<BR>

<P>
We are now beginning to see shopping at home and banking at home
and building communities from home.  We are going to see (or hear)
broadcasting from home; we are going to be publishing from home;
we are going to be organizing political protests from home.  In
short, the home is becoming a more important place -- or will
become a more important place -- than it has been for the last
couple of hundred years.  That last bastion holding out against
the Third Wave -- education -- will increasingly reenter the home,
at least partially, and despite the bitter resistance of Second
Wave educators who operate the compulsory cognitive labor factories
that we still call schools.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Demassification of Society<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
At a still deeper level, the social structure itself is being
transformed by the digital revolution. Cyberspace is a part, but
only a part, of the Third Wave because there are other things
happening on the planet, such as demographic shifts.  It is not
just technology driving this whole thing.  There are convergent
forces that are making this tremendous transformation happen.
 The Third Wave is breaking up the Second Wave mass society into
which most of us were born.<BR>

<P>
The Second Wave society was based on mass production, mass consumption,
mass education, mass media, mass entertainment, mass recreation
and weapons of mass destruction.  The Third Wave is breaking that
mass up and society is becoming more internally differentiated.
 We coined the term demassified to describe the new society because
there was no simple word in the English language to explain the
idea.  <BR>

<P>
Demassification creates a much higher complexity in the social
system and creates much higher rates of information exchange.
 (In fact, we would argue that the reason we are having an information
revolution is because higher social diversity requires the exchange
of more and more information among the units or people or institutions
in that society.  Thus we begin to see more and more differences
within the society itself in lifestyles, in marriages, in religions
and among the generations.)<BR>

<P>
We see differentiation at every level.  For example, think of
production.  We have gone from the concept of mass manufacturing
to the concept of mass customization.  With the help of information-based
technology, we reduce the cost of introducing variety into the
output of the production process.  It used to be very expensive
to change anything about a product.  The information revolution
reduces the cost of diversity and so we get mass customization.
 But mass customization is only a halfway step toward full customization
on demand.  In fact, when customers want full customization, our
future cyber-based production system will be able to provide that
probably at the same cost as a mass product because of the intelligence
imbedded within the production process itself.<BR>

<P>
It is not just manufacturing that is demassifying.  There are
more different kinds of insurance policies today than ever existed.
 There are more forms, more instruments for investments; even
real estate title searches are becoming more and more customized
and so on.   The message to business: If your company's product
line is not increasingly demassified or your technology does not
cut the cost of customization, get ready for a competitor whose
products do and whose technology will.<BR>

<P>
In markets we now hear not just about mass marketing.  When we
researched Future Shock in the 1960's and talked to the visionary
marketing people at that time, they talked about &quot;market
segmentation&quot;.  The mass market actually could be seen as
having several segments.  Later they began talking about niche
marketing and boutiques.  Today if you query  them, they talk
about &quot;particle marketing&quot;.  And what is a particle?
 You are a particle; every individual is a particle and the idea
is &quot;one-to-one&quot; marketing.  Talk individually to each
customer. Interactive technology will allow the establishment
of an ongoing relationship, a continuing dialogue, between customer
and company.  Companies may find themselves selling things to
that customer that they never previously thought about.  They
may service that customer in ways that that customer needs once
the customer tells them about their need.<BR>

<P>
All of these changes -- and all social processes -- produce additional
social consequences. In effect, we have a positive feedback loop.
 More and more change producing more and more change.  My oldest
friend is Dr. Donald F. Klein, who is the world's most eminent
psychopharmacologist.  In <I>Listening to Prozac</I> seventy pages
are devoted to him because of contributions in psychopharmacology.
 Don is always asked, &quot;Does such and such a drug have a side
effect?&quot;  His answer is very simple.  He shrugs and says,
&quot;No side effect, no central effect.&quot;  That is true in
social terms as well, except it is much harder sometimes to trace
the side effects.<BR>

<P>
We see the side effects of demassification in increased individuality
and personal freedom in the society.  We can now engage with the
society around us more as individuals than we ever could before.
 On the other hand, there are negative by-products or side effects.
 The epidemic of loneliness in America is directly related to
demassification.  Everybody or almost everybody is lonely in America
or complains of loneliness, and that is because in the old world
you knew the people who grew up with you.  You had a lot of information
about your next door neighbor.  You did not even have to discuss
it with them,  You all got up at around the same time in the morning,
you all went to the same place to work on the assembly line, you
knew what the next family was going to watch on television because
there were only three channels, etc.  There was a lot of tacit,
implied, shared knowledge.  Now you do not know very much about
your neighbors, or the girl next door, or the boy next door. I
believe that contributes to the loneliness that describes America.
<BR>

<P>
With the personal freedom has come an enormous outbreak of antisocial
behavior - a kind of 'anything goes' culture.  But even these
changes still are not the whole story.  Along with economic and
social changes, there are also profound cultural changes transforming
life at deep levels like epistemology and at shallower levels
like pop culture.  In Future Shock, we said America was going
to build a multichannel society, which is exactly what has happened.
 We went from a world of mass media to one which is increasingly
demassified.  We are obviously moving toward an infinity of channels.
 While there is a lot of redundancy in the programming and a lot
of programming that's hardly worth talking about, if you look
closely, you begin to see this diversity, good or bad.  <I>The
New York Times</I> reports about niche music radio stations. 
For example, the article lists radio stations that specialize
in the following kinds of music: blue grass, contemporary Christian,
zydeco, dance-hall, salsa romantica, tejano, tropical, not to
mention banda for rural Mexico and banghra from India.  And that
is just the beginning.  When the Internet and the cyber revolution
fully develops, the possibilities become truly infinite.<BR>

<P>
Clearly we are now en route to an infinity of channels or ports
into the home and eventually perhaps directly, who knows, into
the brain.  Add to all of this the unbelievable variety of symbols,
images, sounds and ideas made available by the Net.   In addition,
digital broadcast satellites and automatic translation, which
will eventually bring into American homes on-line information
and broadcasts from Nigeria or Brazil or China or Malaysia, will
introduce further cultural diversity.  Soon you will get programs
transmitted by the Ayatollah in Iran, neo-Nazi's in Idaho, or
broadcast by the Vatican or fundamentalist preachers like Pat
Robertson - who is indeed one of the pioneers of satellite broadcasting.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Violence, Alienation and Politics<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Not so long ago, the world's sole surviving super power was paralyzed
for weeks on end by a small group of paranoid conspiracy fantasists
and I believe racists calling themselves Freemen.  The government
was unable, because of political realities, to use force against
them.  While we want to underscore that we are not saying that
we should have used force - it is wonderful that we were able
to resolve that situation peacefully - at the same time, the spectacle
of the government unable to deal with a tiny, private para-army
calling itself a militia is disconcerting.<BR>

<P>
On the one hand, you see the government politically unable to
exercise force in that situation, while force and violence, such
as the Atlanta Olympic bombing, run pretty free in the streets
of the country.  It is troublesome because one of the defining
characteristics of a government or a state is its ability to impose
a monopoly of violence.  Violence is supposed to be monopolized
by the state so that people cannot just run around killing each
other.  What we are supposed to have is an orderly society where
only government-licensed police and the military apply violence.
 What we see today is that government offices are bombed, government
agents are threatened with their lives and there is a lot of violence
in the society.  Something is happening to the monopoly of violence.
 In fact, competition in the society is breaking down monopolies.
 State violence is one of the monopolies that is breaking down,
and not just in the United States. Ask the Japanese how they feel
now that their very orderly society, so stable since World War
II, is suddenly facing a terrorist sarin attack in its subway.
<BR>

<P>
Meanwhile, our political life in America is also experiencing
the side effects of demassification.  We see two political parties
playing their usual, ritualized games and politicians in private
denounce the polarizing rhetoric that they feel compelled to use.
 Huge sums are spent on elections, but larger and larger percentages
of Americans are resentful, alienated and cut off from any sense
of enfranchisement.  They are so cut off that they have come to
despise members of the entire political class, whether Democratic,
whether Republican, whether elected officials or the media around
it.  No one any longer feels represented in America by our pseudo-representative
government -- not only inner-city black youths, but also small
business people.  There are even super millionaires out there
who once made huge political contributions to this or that party
but refuse now to even take their phone calls.  Even they complain
that they feel unrepresented.<BR>

<P>
One evening not long ago we found ourselves sitting next to an
elderly millionairess, a grande dame and an intimate friend of
one of  this nation's living First Ladies.  This is a woman with
strong ties to the world of the White House, telling us she was
so disgusted with both political parties that she almost voted
for Ross Perot - until she concluded that he was a flake.  The
tenor of her remarks, made from deep inside the &quot;establishment,&quot;
made us think of the bitter alienation among the French aristocracy
 before their revolution.  Something is truly not right, not stable,
when the richest and most powerful members of society no longer
believe in the system in which they prospered.<BR>

<P>
This widespread mood of disaffection can be heard on talk radio,
where it ranges to actual hatred for the system.  Remember, we
are not living in Weimar Republic after a decade of horrible hyperinflation
that destroyed everybody's lives and then ultimately produced
a Adolf Hitler.  We are not living in a post-Gorbachev Moscow
after the collapse of the Soviet empire and the disintegration
of its economy.   By most measures, we are living in the most
competitive and affluent society in the world.  Americans have
lower unemployment rates than the Europeans.  Yet there is this
tremendous upwelling of hatred toward the system.  Why?<BR>

<P>
This profound and growing distrust and hatred makes one wonder,
as the television drones on with the reports of the political
pollsters and the ritual of campaigning, if, in fact, Americans
can get through the next decade or two without some kind of political
crisis.  Indeed, can the United States escape the next decade
or two without a constitutional crisis?  What we say about America
can be doubled for other countries.  Political disaffection is
not an American characteristic alone; it is true in Italy, in
England, in Japan.  It is true throughout the so-called developed
and affluent world, not to mention the countries in which people
cannot express their hatred for the government.  In short, the
question we would like to leave on the table is, can we have cyber-revolution,
a digital revolution, a social revolution, a cultural revolution,
an epistemological revolution, a biological revolution, combined
simultaneously with upheavals in the biosphere, the technosphere,
the sociosphere, the psychosphere and the infosphere, without
equally dramatic accommodative changes in the political structure?
<BR>

<P>
How we answer that question will determine whether the Third Wave
will bring positive changes.  The Third Wave can literally raise
billions of people on the planet out of poverty.  It can raise
the species to a whole new evolutionary level; it can lead us
to the stars themselves.  But can the Third Wave do so if the
leader in this global revolution -- the United States -- has collective
decision-making processes both in corporations and in the public
sphere that are slow, sclerotic, and sick?   If the internal political
system clanks and grinds and misfires, overwhelmed by the speed
and complexity of the problems that it sets out to solve, can
we get through the next period ahead without substantial unnecessary
pain?<BR>

<P>
It is time to divert some of the astonishing creativity and innovativeness
in the United States, especially the creativeness that is being
poured into technology,  to the political sphere.  We must, if
we want anything resembling a decent and democratic future.  The
time has come to recognize that both political parties in their
present form remain parties of the past, despite the rare Al Gores
and Newt Gingrichs in their ranks.  We need launch a civilized
ten or fifteen year public democratic discussion of what a democracy
in the twenty-first century under Third Wave conditions ought
to look like.  We are not advocating crash therapy, because the
attempt to impose crash therapy on the Russians has been disastrous.
 We are not talking about rapid instantaneous change.  We are
talking about a discussion that takes into account all the new,
democratic potentials that the cyber revolution produces.<BR>

<P>
We are not talking about just instant push-button voting, because
that is truly a vulgarization of the concept that cyber technology
can help us politically.  There are enormously creative ways that
we can use to re-vivify, restructure and redesign our democracy
for the twenty-first century.  It is time for Americans, whether
they are Netizens, citizens on-line or off, to organize themselves
not into armed pseudo-militias or fanatical political or religious
movements, but in cyber-based Committees or Correspondence to
lay the basis for peaceful political transformation.  Some of
that is already happening, mostly on the Net.  But we need to
bring the distributed intelligence and imagination in American
society together to simulate future democratic alternatives. 
We must envision together and discuss in civil terms, not for
a day but for a decade or more, how to take advantage of these
new tools for democracy.<BR>

<P>
If we fail to do this, we lose our human rights, we lose our privacy
.  We lose even the pretense of popular participation in political
life if we allow intolerance and violence to explode.  If we remain
so focused on the technologies of the Third Wave, we will be abdicating
our intellectual and political and human responsibilities building
a better society.  The time to begin this debate and this process
of learning together is now, not when perhaps it becomes too late.

<TITLE> Welcome Aspen 1996 </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<img src="/pff/bi.gif" align="left">
<p align="right">				August 4, 1996</p>
<p><br>
<h2><center>Welcome To Aspen 1996</h2></center>
<p>

Dear Aspen Summit '96 Participant:
<P>
Welcome!  We are glad you could join us in Aspen  a much more comfortable venue in August than Atlanta, where PFF held its first <i>Cyberspace and the American Dream</i> conference in 1994.
<P>
Since then, the Digital Revolution has kept up its frantic pace:  Java, Netscape, Windows 95, the Communications Decency Act, the debate over encryption and intellectual property, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pat Buchanan and the rise of the "New Luddites" -- all in three years.
<P>
It's hard keeping up, and even harder to keep it all in perspective.  During the next two days, we hope you'll learn something about what's happening and is about to happen as a result of the Digital Revolution.  But even more importantly, we hope this two-day "breather" will give you, and us, a chance to step back and gain some perspective on the promise and the peril of our times.
<P>
That, of course, is our main theme -- reminding ourselves that America's continued progress in the Digital Revolution is not something to take for granted.  From Al Toffler's opening speech, "Future Shock in the Present Tense," to our closing debate on whether "growth of the Internet is a 'Leading Cultural Indicator' of American progress," we want to remind ourselves that great civilizations sometimes choose paths leading to decay -- even, or perhaps especially, in a digital world.
<P>
A second theme of this year's conference is "theory vs. practice."  We are delighted at the number and quality of representatives attending this year from America's leading technology companies, and confident that their participation will 
ensure a healthy mix between the thinkers and theoreticians and the doers and practitioners.
<P>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation has grown up with the Digital Revolution.  It's in our blood, and because you are here, we know it's in yours too.  
<P><center>
Sincerely,
<P></center>
<pre>
	Jay Keyworth					Jeff Eisenach
	Chairman 					President
</pre>
<P>
P.S.  Next year's conference will be held here at the Ritz-Carlton Aspen in late July or early August.  As you can imagine, it's a popular spot, and we're booking early.  If  you would like to go ahead and pre-register for next year, please talk with Katherine Epler.

<title>Senator Bill Bradley Profile</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<img src="discussi.gif">
<hr>
<blockquote>
<font face="arial"> 
<center>
<img src="bradley.gif" align="left">
<h1>Senator Bill Bradley</h1>
<h2>A Profile</h2>
</center>
Bill Bradley is the senior U.S. Senator from New Jersey. A Democrat, he was elected to his third term in 1990. From the day he arrived in the Senate in 1979, Bradley has devoted himself to building a more secure future for Americans by creating a strong and growing economy, providing new educational opportunities, and bridging the gaps between people of different races and nations. He serves on the Senate Finance Committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the Special Committee on Aging.
<P><br>
<b><center>Tax Relief, Economic Priorities and Deficit Reduction</center></b>
<br>
Senator Bradley is widely known as the author of the proposed Fair Tax, which eventually becarne the Tax Reform Act of 1986. His tax reforms were based on the principle that people of equal incomes should pay equal taxes. Despite a widespread belief that special interests would prevail, Bradley succeeded in sharply reducing tax rates for all Americans by eliminating most corporate and individual loopholes-in the tax code. It required taxpayers who had avoided paying taxes to pay their fair share, gave tax relief to families, and insured that six million low-income working people would pay no federal tax.
<p>
As a member of the Finance Committee, Bradley has continued to fight for fair tax policy, honest budgeting, and economic policies that enhance competitiveness and growth.
<p>
Bradley has centered his attention on the federal government's debt and deficit crises. He believes that the United States will not be able to compete in the world economy in the next century without significant reductions in both. The first, and most important step that can be taken on the road back to fiscal responsibility, is to dramatically reduce unnecessary government spending.
<p>
Bradley believes that the government spends too much taxpayer money, and often for the wrong purposes. To bring reason to our spending priorities, he has proposed two principles to guide all federal funding decisions: one, the proposal must be in the general interest and essential to public life; and two, taxpayer funding must be the most cost-effective way to finance the proposal.
<p>
Bradley's actions follow these principles. In 1994, the bipartisan Concord Coalition ranked Bradley third among all Senate Democrats for his anti-spending votes. And in the 103rd Congress alone, he offered amendments to appropriations bills that would have saved nearly 600 million taxpayer dollars.
<p>
Bradley is the author of the enhanced line-item veto proposal, a measure which grants the President authority to remove wasteful spending from both appropriations and tax bills. He is also an advocate of major budget reform, which would remove many of the obstacles Congress has erected to real spending reductions.
<p><br>
<b><center>A National Rebellion Against Crime and Violence</center></b>
<br>

In 1994, Senator Bradley issued a call to arms - against the crime and violence that are ravaging our lives and our neighborhoods. In a compelling speech, Bradley demanded a national rebellion against violence, a new commitment by individuals, communities and government against the destruction that is threatening our democratic freedoms.
<p>
Bradley breaks through the clutter of anti-crime rhetoric by arguing that there is no single, simple solution to our crisis of violence. No political posturing will solve it, and no progress will be made unless we all make a contribution. The answers lie closer to home than to Washington, D.C. When only 5% of all crimes are federal crimes and the federal government controls just 13% of the crime-fighting resources, local communities must actively engage in the rebellion. Bradley knows they can -- he has spent many hours in New Jersey communities, hearing about and working with local residents who are involved in their neighborhoods to stop the violence.
<p>
Bradley has successfully fought for innovative new measures to help the federal government assist these efforts. He wrote legislation, adopted in the 1994 Crime Bill, to greatly expand community policing and to help put 100,000 new police on the street nationwide. These community policing forces can forge valuable ties to the neighborhood residents they serve and detect trouble before it turns into crime. The Crime Bill also includes Bradley's Community Schools program, a bold new venture that encourages schools to stay open after hours, on weekends, and all summer to help community leaders provide at-risk children a safe place to learn and play.
<p>
Bradley has also emerged as an advocate of tough, common-sense gun control. He is the author of new legislation which will stop the flow of illegal handguns. By requiring national handgun ID cards, registration of private handgun transfers, greatly increased gun dealer licensing fees, and a limit on purchases, Bradley believes gun violence can be markedly reduced.
<p><br>
<b><center>Race and the American City</center></b>
<br>

Senator Bradley has been described as one of the most eloquent and prophetic speakers on the issue of race relations in our country. He has established himself as a serious voice in the national dialogue on racism, pluralism, and discrimination. Senator Bradley has criticized both political parties and challenged every American to confront the reality of racial prejudices by asking each of us, "When was the last time you talked about race with someone of a different race? If the answer is never, you're part of the problem."
<p>
From a socioeconomic standpoint, he has stressed that by the year 2000, only 57 percent of the people entering the workforce will be native-born whites. In his keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic Convention, he reiterated his strong conviction that "we will all advance together, or each of us will be diminished."
<p>
Senator Bradley sees a critical link between tense race relations and the decay of American cities. He advocates significant national investment and increased personal responsibility in order to halt the deterioration of urban America. Inspired by "leaders of awareness" in churches, schools, businesses, and neighborhoods, Bradley believes we can rebuild our urban communities.
<p>
Bradley's vision for renewal is unique. It is based on successful initiatives designed by local communities themselves. Their leadership is behind Bradley's eight-point Urban Community-Building Initiative, a comprehensive assault on the three crises plaguing urban America: joblessness, violence, and family disintegration. His goal is to expand ideas already working at the local level and help city residents help themselves with programs that provide police, jobs and job training, crime prevention, banking services, and family support.
<p>
Bradley has been remarkably successful in turning this vision into reality. Virtually all of his Urban Community-Building Initiative was enacted into law in 1993-94. Three components - Community Policing, Community Schools, and Community Banking - were approved either in full or more broadly than originally drafted. Four others - Entrepreneurship Training, Mobility for Work, Individual Development Accounts, and Residential Parenting Centers, were included in legislation creating Urban Empowerment Zones.
<p><br>

<b><center>Education: Investing in People</center></b>
<br>
Bradley believes that a college education is invaluable. But he also knows that the cost of higher education has exploded out of reach for too many families.
<p>
In response, Bradley has designed a new way to pay for college. Available at the beginning of the 1994 school year, Bradley's Self-Reliance Loans give all students, regardless of age or income, the chance to borrow money directly from the federal government. Self-Reliance Loans also give students the option of repaying their loans based on income they earn after they graduate.
<p>
The program was available at several colleges in New Jersey and throughout the nation in 1994, and dozens of others will participate in 1995 and beyond. Bradley's initiative will help families who don't qualify for traditional financial aid, and students who cannot afford huge monthly loan repayments immediately after graduation. By eliminating the expensive and unnecessary role banks play in student loans, the program saves taxpayer money. ' And, in an economy that demands highly skilled workers, the program offers everyone the opportunity to go back to school for the training they need to compete in the labor market.
<p>
Senator Bradley has also worked for years to improve elementary and secondary education through the Family-School Partnership Act, and programs for Gifted and Talented students. He hosts several annual events in New Jersey to honor the achievements of young students. Thousands of New Jersey high school students have participated in events such as High School Leadership Seminars and Student-Athlete Conferences over the last 14 years.
<p><br>
<b><center>The Health and Well-Being of Families</center></b>
<br>

Bill Bradley is deeply concerned about the burden of health care costs on America's families. He supports national health care reform that would reduce costs, increase coverage, and ensure quality care for every American.
<p>
Calling domestic violence "America's dark litle secret," Bradley has launched a major effort to respond to the tragedy of spousal abuse. It is a social sickness, and women and children are its most common casualties. Bradley has spoken out forcefully on the need to confront domestic violence, and to make sure its victims get the help they need: protection, counseling, and education about their rights.
<p>
Bradley believes we need comprehensive welfare reform that promotes personal responsibility, and has spearheaded the overhaul of child support collection in New Jersey and the nation. And for families caring for disabled and elderly relatives at home, he is seeking to expand a successful New Jersey project that offers respite services to family caregivers.
<p><br>
<b><center>Rethinking American Leadership</center></b>
<br>
Senator Bradley believes that American leadership in the future will depend more on our economic productivity and the force of our values, rather than on our military might.
<p>
Bradley is a leading proponent of international free trade. He was one of the champions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, working tirelessly in 1993 to ensure passage of a plan he defined as a "historic moment" on America's path toward global economic growth. He advocates an open trading system worldwide, and co-authored the report that served as the blueprint for the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which Congress passed in late 1994.
<p>
Bradley, well known as an expert on the former Soviet Union, considers investing in people and the values of democracy the best way to build lasting security and peace in the post-cold war era. Based on these principles, he authored and passed the 1992 Freedom Exchange Act, the largest U.S. educational exchange initiative in history. Already, more than 10,000 "Bradley kids" have come to the U.S. from the former Soviet Union to study and absorb the lessons of freedom, democracy, and a market economy.
<p><br>

<b><center>Protecting the Environment</center></b>
<br>

Bradley entered the Senate in 1978 with a strong commitment to protect the environment. In 1980, he helped draft the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup bill. Since then, he has pursued legislation to track medical waste in our oceans, prevent oil spills, restore and preserve beaches, rivers, and wildlife, and ban toxic lead from the environment. Most recently, Bradley secured passage of the South Jersey Wild and Scenic River Act. This landmark legislation will protect a 35-mile stretch of the Maurice River and its tributaries, guaranteeing that future generations can enjoy the waterway in its current pristine condition.
<p>
As chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, Bradley also passed the Omnibus Water Bill of 1992, the most important piece of water legislation in a generation. The bill's most significant component requires a major overhaul of the nation's largest water project, the Central Valley Project of California. This law cuts wasteful subsidies to agriculture special interests, redistributes water resources to city residents who suffered a seven year drought, and protects endangered wildlife.
<p><br>
<center><b>Scholar, Athlete, Author</b></center>
<br>
Before his successful Senate race in 1978, Bill Bradley had achieved distinction in academics and athletics. He was born on July 28, 1943, in Crystal City, Missouri, the son of Warren and Susan Bradley. In 1965, he graduated from Princeton University with honors in American history. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he earned a graduate degree after studying politics, philosophy, and economics.
<p>
As an undergraduate, Bradley was a three-time basketball All-American and won the Sullivan Award as the country's outstanding amateur athlete. In 1964, he was captain of the U.S. basketball team that won the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
<p>
After returning from Oxford in 1967, Bradley joined the New York Knicks and played professional basketball for ten years. In 1970 and 1973, the Knicks won the National Basketball Association championship with Bradley as a starting forward. Bradley's book about his decade with the Knicks, <i>Life On The Run</i>, was published in 1976 to wide acclaim.
<p>
Bradley served in the Air Force Reserve from 1967 to 1978, attaining the rank of first lieutenant.
<p>
Bradley's second book, <i>The Fair Tax</i>. was published in 1982 and helped popularize the ideas that eventually became the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
<p>
Bill Bradley and Ernestine Schlant were married in 1974. Ernestine Schlant Bradley is a professor of German and Comparative Literature at Montclair State College. The Bradleys have one daughter, Theresa Anne, and Mrs. Bradley has an adult daughter from a previous marriage. The family lives in Montclair, New Jersey.

David Gelernter's research interests include parallel programming, software ensembles, and artificial
intelligence. The coordination language called "Linda" that he developed with Nicholas Carriero (also
of Yale) sees fairly widespread use world-wide for parallel programming. 
Linda and its central idea, called "tuple spaces", is the basis for the "JavaSpaces: extension to Java recently outlined by JavaSoft; the goal of JavaSpaces is to "unify and simplify," according to JavaSoft
's presentation at JavaOne -- Specifically to unify object storage and inter-program communication, as in Linda.
Gelernter's current research interests include adaptive parallelism (the "Piranha" system runs parallel
programs by grabbing idle workstation cycles, releasing machines when their owners need them),
programming environments for parallelism, realtime data fusion, and expert databases. He is
co-author of two textbooks (on programming languages and on parallel programming methods),
author of Mirror Worlds (Oxford: 1991) and a forthcoming book about how thinking works (Free
Press).

Gelernter is a recipient of a Presidential Young Investigator Award (1986).

Mr. Gilder has authored nine books including: Life After Television,

he served as chairman of the Lehrman's Institute's Economic
Roundtable, as Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a
frequent contributor to A.B. Laffer economic reports.  Since the
publication of his book Wealth and Poverty, he consulted regularly
with key figures in the Reagan and Bush administrations and with
leaders of America's high technology businesses.

<p>

In addition to his experience as the chairman of a small business,
Mr. Gilder serves on the board of directors of several high technology
companies. Through the Leigh Bureau of Princeton, N.J., Mr. Gilder has
also given several hundred speeches around the world to major
corporations and to conferences on business, technology, and
telecommunications.

<p>

Mr. Gilder is a graduate of Harvard University where he majored in
government, studied under Henry Kissinger, and later taught as a
Fellow at the Kennedy Institute of Politics.

<p>

<title>Biography for Jerry Jasinowski</title></head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<img src="discussi.gif">
<hr>

<font face="arial">
<blockquote>

<h2>Jerry J. Jasinowski<br>
President National Association of Manufacturers</h2><p>
<img src="jasino.gif" align="left">


Jerry Jasinowski is president of the National Association Manufacturers and one of the nation's most frequently quoted authorities on the economy and the vital role manufacturing plays in America.
<p>
He has addressed audiences across the country -- from The Commonwealth Club of California to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. -- in his role as:
<ul>
<li>an economist who can assess the rapid changes creating a new economy 

<li>an astute analyst of the impact of federal policies on business 
</uL>
<ul>
<li>an articulate spokesperson on the importance of modern manufacturing to technology, productivity, international competitiveness and economic growth, and how to improve the living standard of America's workers co-author of <i>Making It In America: Proven Paths to Success from 50 Top Cornpanies</i> (Simon & Schuster, March 1995) 

<li>industry's "most powerful advocate on Capitol Hill," according to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine
</ul><p>
Under Jasinowski's  leadership, the NAM has beein hailed as Wasington' s most influential and respected business group, helping to shape national policy on a broad range of issues from taxes to trade. He is currently calling for a national strategy to boost economic growth by dramatically downsizing and reforming government, particularly in the areas of taxes, regulations and legal burdens, and by encouraging private sector educational improvements, technological programs and export expansion.
<p>
Jasinowski is widely quoted in the media and has appeared on almost every major national network and public affairs program, including ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America</i>, NBC's <i>Today</i> and 
<i>Meet the Press</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> and <i>Moneyline</i>, John McLaughlin's 
<i>One on One</i> and the evening network news shows. His opinion editorials have run in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, and other major publications.
<p>
Jasinowski became president of the NAM in January 1990, after serving as the association's executive vice president and chief economist for ten years. The NAM is the largest broad-based industrial trade association in the United States. Its more than 13,500 member companies, including approximately 10,000 small firms, are in every state and account for roughly 85 percent of U.S. manufactured goods.
<p>
A one-time factory worker, Jasinowski joined the U.S. Air Force as intelligence officer serving in the Far East in the mid 1960s. He went on to become assistant professor of economics at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In the early 1970's, Jasinowski came to Washington to manage research and legislative activities for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. In 1976, he served as director of the Carter Administration's economic transition team for the departments of Treasury, Commerce, Labor, the Council of Economic Advisors and the Federal Reserve. He later was appointed assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
<p>
A native of LaPorte, Indiana, Jasinowski received his B.A. in economics from Indiana University, his master's degree in ePonomics from Columbia University, and is a graduate of the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. He serves on the board of directors for Phoenix Home Life and Atwood Richards.
<p>
Jasinowski has three children and resides in Washington, D.C. with his wife, vice president of government relations for The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.

<title>Biography: Alvin Toffler</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<img src="discussi.gif">
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Alvin Toffler, Ph.D.</h2>
<p>

Alvin Toffler, Ph.D., is one of the world's preeminent futurists.  As
the co-author of War and Anti-War, Dr. Toffler sketches the emerging
economy of the 21st century, presenting a new theory of war and
revealing how changes in today's military parallel almost precisely
the changes now taking place in business.

<p>
<img src="toffler.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>

Along with his wife and co-author Heidi Toffler, Dr. Toffler describes
their latest book as a suprising departure from their past work--one
made necessary by the new dangers that confront America and the world
at the edge of the 21st century.  These include tens of thousands of
tactical nuclear weapons in the strife-torn former Soviet Union and
what they call "the civilianization of war," the spread of civilian
products and technologies that can be converted to military use.  In
War and Anti-War, the Tofflers picture the runaway proliferation not
merely of weapons, but of advanced technologies with which to make
them.

<p>

This is not the first time the Tofflers have created controversy in
high places.  In 1988, when the Tofflers drove through the high red
walls fo the Zhangnanhai compound in Beijing for a meeting with Zhao
Ziyang, then China's Communist Party leader and the man behind its
dramatic economic reforms, it was an important moment.  And when Zhao
was later ousted by hardliners during the Tiananmen Square events, it
stirred deep memories for the Tofflers.  Consequently, their
best-selling books, including Future Shock and The Third Wave have
been banned in the People's Republic of China.

<p>

In Powershift, the final book of the trilogy which begins with Future
Shock and The Third Wave, the Tofflers focuses on the power struggles
to come--in business, in politics, and in global affairs--as a new
"system of wealth creation" clashes with today's vested power blocs.
In its central thesis, the Toffles propose that power is shiftein from
its traditional basis in violence and wealth toward a new dependence
on knowledge, and especially "knowledge about knowledge."  This shift
in the nature of power, the Tofflers suggest, is about to touch off
tremendous upheavals in existing power relationships as individuals,
companies and countries scramble for control of the new knowledge
resources.

<p>

In a first step toward the legalization of organized democratic
dissent in the Soviet Union, the Tofflers met with Mikhail Gorbachev
and other Western intellecuals such as Arthur Miller and James Baldwin
to launch the Issyk-kul Forum, the first citizen-initiated
non-communist, non-governmental organization to be permitted in the
country since the 1917 Revolution.  The efforts of the Tofflers and
their colleagues have made huge headlines in Pravda, Izvestia, and
Literaturnaya Gazeta as a milestone in the history of perestroika.

<font face="arial">
<h2>Michael Vlahos</h2>
<img src="vlahos.gif" align=left>
<blockquote>
While our lives move inevitably from future to past, Vlahos,
                         a senior fellow at the Foundation, has tried to march in a
                         different direction. From Bronze Age archaeology,
                         Byzantium, and British imperial history at Yale University, he
                         moved to foreign relations and modern war at the Fletcher
                         School of Law & Diplomacy. As Director of Security
                         Studies at Johns Hopkins-SAIS, he widened his view to
                         take on war and society. So broadened, he was asked to
                         turn the State Departments Center for the Study of Foreign
                         Affairs into a real, long-range think tank. He did. Its theme
                         became -- and, in 1988, just in time -- world change.
                         Vlahos was then commissioned to help turn the U.S. Navys
                         rangefinders toward Big Change, while at the Center for
                         Naval Analyses. In the Foundation, he has found a place
                         that not only sees the ongoing transformation of American
                         life -- the Big Change -- but that actively seeks to be a part
                         of it. Now Vlahos writes, in print and in the ether, about
                         where we are going and how we will get there.

<h2>CONGRESSMAN RICK WHITE</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="white.gif" align=left>
Representative Rick White took office in January 1995 with a pledge to make government smaller, more efficient, and more cost effective. In the 104th Congress, White will focus on reforming Congress and addressing the fundamental need to make our government more accessible and accountable to the American people. He has Iimited himself to serving no more than five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.<p>
Recognizing the important role that technology issues, telecommunications and international trade plays in the Puget Sound region's economy, White obtained a position on the House Commerce Committee. He is assigned to the Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee and the Commerce, Trade and Hazardous Materials subcommittee. Since the Commerce Committee is classified as an "exclusive" committee by the House, it is White's only Committee assignment.<p>
Congressman White, 41, is serving his first term in elected offlee. Prior to running for Congress, White was a partner in the business law department of Seattle's largest law firm, Perkins Coie. He joined Porkins Coie in 1983 and was made a partner in 1988. In addition he has held a number of private sector jobs ranging from dock foreman to assembly line worker to grill cook.<p> 
A resident of Bainbridge Island, Representative White has a history of involvement in community service. He is a founder and director of "Books for Kids, " a literacy program that provides free books to at-risk children. He has served for many years in the YMCA's Indian Guides program and as a leader of an Explorer Scouts post. He also served as an Elder at the Rolling Bay Presbyterian Church on Bainbridge Island.<p>
Representative White emerged as a leader in the Republican Party in 1990, when he helped found the "Farm Team" to encourage young professionals to get involved in the party.  He served on the Queen Anne Community Council from 1986-88 and has served as a delegate to various district, county and state Republican conventions since 1984.<p>
Representative White was bom on November 6, 1953. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Goverment and French in 1975 from Dartmouth College.  He spent one year in a graduate program in philosophy at the Pantheon-Sorbonne in Paris, before completing his academic career with a law degree from Georgetown University in 1980.<p>
Representative White married Vikki Kennedy in 1982. The two have four children: Kathleen (12) Emily (9), Charlotte (7), and Richard (4). The family resides on Bainbridge Island.

<TITLE>The Future of Progress -- PFF</TITLE>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h2>The Future of Progress</h2>
<B>by Jeffrey A. Eisenach</B>
<P>
 Progress.  As defined by its greatest modern student, Robert
Nisbet, it is the belief that &quot;mankind has advanced in the
past . . . is now advancing and will continue to advance through
the foreseeable future.&quot;
<P>
 No idea is more American.  No idea has played a more central
role in the development of Western and, more recently, American
Civilization.  No idea is more important to our collective future.
<P>
 And, no idea has suffered more than the idea of progress from
the cultural nihilism of the past 30 years.
<P>
 Writing in 1980, Nisbet concluded his landmark <B>History of
the Idea of Progress</B> with a warning:
<P>
<blockquote>
 [A]lthough the dogma of progress held magisterial status during
most of Western history, it has obviously fallen to a low and
sorely beset status in our century.  Its future . . . is cloudy
to say the least.  One conclusion, though, may be stated confidently:
 If the idea of progress does die in the West, so will a great
deal else that we have long cherished in this civilization.
</blockquote>
<P>
 In the thirteen years since Nisbet wrote those words, the decline
of progress has continued.  One major study of public opinion
concluded in 1990 that &quot;Americans resent the present and
fear the future,&quot; a sentiment echoed by Daniel Yankelovich,
who wrote in the Fall 1992 edition of <I>Foreign Affairs</I> that
&quot;Voters are coping reasonably well with the present; it is
the future they fear.&quot;
<P>
 Or, as Peggy Noonan put it recently, &quot;People don't have
faith in America's future anymore.&quot;
<P>
 If America is to prosper as a Civilization, the idea of progress
-- our belief in a better future -- must be revived; and, given
the idea's robustness over thousands of years, it seems quite
likely that it will be.  Indeed, there are signs such a revival
is underway, and that the rebirth of the idea of progress will
be the defining cultural event of our age.
<P>
 Perhaps, then, we should try to understand it.
<P>
<h3>Progress Versus Change</h3>
<P>
 The idea of progress is for obvious reasons associated with the
idea of change, but the two notions are as different as &quot;precipitation&quot;
is from &quot;the pristine winter snow.&quot;  Change is descriptive.
 Progress is prescriptive.
<P>
 Consider the graphic below.  Both lines shown in the graph represent
change.  Only one of them, of course, represents progress.  The
question is:  Which one?
<P>
 Part of the answer lies in what metric we assign to the vertical
axis.  Are we talking about the number of automobiles produced
or out-of-wedlock births?  Does the vertical axis represent a
&quot;good&quot; or a &quot;bad&quot;?
<P>
<I> Fig. One</I>
<P>
 Ah, but you have fallen for the trap -- because as you read the
paragraph above, you naturally assumed that the number of automobiles
produced represented a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;out-of-wedlock
births&quot; represented a &quot;bad.&quot;  Are you sure?  Or
do you agree with Vice President Gore that we have too many automobiles,
or with &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; that out-of-wedlock births represent
a positive expression of individual rights?
<P>
 The point is that progress is a heavily value-laden concept,
measurable only in terms of an explicit understanding of what
is good and evil, right and wrong.  &quot;Good change&quot; is
progress; &quot;bad change&quot; is decay.  Change by itself can
never be, as President Clinton suggested in his Inaugural Address,
&quot;our friend.&quot;  It is either our servant, or it is or
our enemy.
<P>
 Indeed, throughout history, progress has had specific connotations
and been associated with specific values.  Nisbet argues that:
<P>
<blockquote>
 There are at least five major premises to be found in the idea's
history from the Greeks to our day:  belief in the value of the
past; conviction of the nobility, even superiority of Western
civilization; acceptance of the worth of economic and technological
growth; faith in reason and in the kind of scientific and scholarly
knowledge that can come from reason alone; and, finally, belief
in the intrinsic importance, the ineffaceable <I>worth </I>of
life on this earth.
</blockquote>
<P>
If these five &quot;pillars&quot; have formed the basis for the
idea of progress, as Nisbet says, &quot;from the Greeks to our
day,&quot; and if the idea of progress is indeed to be reborn,
we can expect these central premises to be reborn with it.  The
opposite however, is also true:  The renewal of American Civilization
is inevitably tied to the rebirth of the idea of progress.
<P>
<h3>Progress and the American Idea</h3>
<P>
 Much of what troubles America today can be attributed to the
damage done to Nisbet's &quot;five pillars&quot; by what Peter
Collier and David Horowitz described as
the <I>Destructive Generation</I> -- the period from the late
1950s through the 1970s when virtually every premise of civilization
was challenged.
<P>
 Scholars from the left and right have dissected the decline of
American values down to the most minute molecule.  From Zbigniew
Brezinski's <B>Out of Control</B> to William Bennett's <B>De-Valuing
of America</B>, from Arthur Schlesinger's <B>Disuniting of America</B>
to Myron Magnet's <B>The Dream and the Nightmare</B>, there is
no shortage of analysis on either the source or the consequences
of that decline.
<P>
 In their dissection, however, these analyses have tended to ask
the wrong question:  They have sought to understand what made
the patient sick, without understanding what made it healthy in
the first place, describing the symptoms and localized causes
of &quot;the American disease&quot; but never focussing sufficiently
on its relationship to the animus -- the motivating mythos --
of American Civilization.(1)
<P>
 Yet for America, the mythos is everything.  From John Adams,
who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first &quot;in
the hearts and minds of the people,&quot; to G.K. Chesterton (&quot;America
is the only nation in the world founded on a creed.&quot;) and
Margaret Thatcher (&quot;No other nation has been built upon an
idea.&quot;),<U>The American Ideology</U>
it has always been clear that America's identity transcends geography
and ethnicity.  As George Santayana wrote, &quot;to be an American
is of itself almost a moral condition, an education, and a career.&quot;

<P>
 As Micheal Vlahos writes, the concept of a transcendent national
mission is a central element of &quot;the American myth&quot;:
<P>
<blockquote>
  Americans still hew, if unconsciously, to their identity as
a &quot;New World.&quot;  Born to a new world of hope, we have
been charged with developing a society that will ultimately uplift
all humanity.  America in our national idea is, and must be, the
source of human progress: first as model, but also as agent of
world democratic reform. . . . This myth of America as the dynamo
of human progress simply cannot be given up.  To do so would put
at risk the American identity itself.
</blockquote>
<P>
Today we have gone a step further, doubting not only that America
is the &quot;dynamo of human progress&quot; but that the idea
of progress itself has merit.
<P>
<h3>Progress and the Civic Discussion(2)</h3>
<P>
 If America is founded on an idea, then American politics can
be seen as a means by which we reinterpret the idea over time.
 As Vlahos explains,
<P>
<blockquote>
  The idea is the objective of our politics, since it is the idea
of America alone that defines and empowers us.  The power of the
idea means that political groups must seek its legitimacy first.
 'Ownership' of the idea has always preceeded election to office
in American politics . . . . The power to reshape the idea is
the only real power one can wield in America.
</blockquote>
<P>
 Hermann Kahn, the brilliant futurist, understood this well. 
In his last work of prescience (<B>The Coming Boom</B>, 1982),
Kahn foresaw our current predicament.  &quot;The question remains,&quot;
he wrote then, &quot;whether President Reagan -- and ultimately
his successors -- can maintain and build on the opportunities
of the present.&quot;  To do so, he predicted, it would be &quot;important
to the coming boom to <I>reestablish an ideology of progress</I>&quot;
which would &quot;do as much to hasten the coming boom and give
it staying power as any single policy maneuver can.&quot;
<P>
 Today it is clear that Reagan's success at &quot;reestablishing
an ideology of progress&quot; did not last long beyond his presidency.
<P>
 In retrospect, we can understand why:  Reagan's vision of progress
was <I>in the minds of the American people</I> a vision of America's
past.  When Reagan spoke of a &quot;shining city on a hill,&quot;
Americans saw pictures not so much of our future as of a past
in which values were clear, government was effective and America
was militarily, morally and economically dominant in the world.
 If you asked almost any American to describe the &quot;shining
city&quot; of which Reagan spoke, the image evoked was of America
in the late 1950s.
<P>
 Ironically, the &quot;shining city of the 1950s&quot; that Americans
saw in Reagan's vision was none other than the culmination of
the vision laid out by Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal liberals,
a vision expressed, more than in any other single event, in 1939,
at the New York City World's Fair, where America's leadership
presented a vision of the future explicitly wrapped in the language
of progress -- &quot;The World of Tomorrow.&quot;
<P>
 It was, naturally, a vision based on the ideology of the New
Deal, a combination of state-driven industrial planning and (we
sometimes forget) a view of American culture that by today's standards
would be labelled &quot;conservative.&quot;  Writing in a special
edition of <I>The New York Times Magazine</I> timed to coincide
with the opening of the Fair, the intelligentsia of the day (23
writers, including H.G. Wells, Murray Butler, Arthur Compton,
Charles Kettering, Henry Wallace, Frances Perkins and Henry Ford)
described in great detail the historical underpinnings, economic
principles, cultural mores and practical implications of a world
worth striving for.  Follow that vision, we were told, and we
would create a world full of wonders -- of interstate highways,
jet airplanes, television sets and . . . general prosperity.
<P>
 Jeffrey Hart wrote in his personal evocation of the fair, <B>From
This Moment On</B>, that it was premised on the idea &quot;that
American civilization would matter five thousand years from now
. . . indeed, that American civilization (this was the message
inside the Perisphere) would be the basis for the world of tomorrow.&quot;
<P>
 At the time, and indeed for many years, that assumption seemed
entirely valid.  As Alice Goldfarb Williams wrote in her treatment
of the 1930s, &quot;the World of Tomorrow, literally constructed
on the garbage heap of the past, was not empty metaphor; it echoed
too often elsewhere.&quot;  After all, she concludes, &quot;After
a six-year interlude of unparalleled carnage, The World of Tomorrow
would begin to unfold.&quot;  What unfolded, of course, was the
1950s, and the realization of -- yes -- jet airplanes, interstate
highways, television sets . . . and general prosperity:  The very
same Shining City Americans imagined as they listened to Ronald
Reagan.(3)
<P>
 As powerful as that vision was, and as long as it lasted, there
can be no doubt that its run is over.  For the 110 million Americans
born after 1960, it is not even a distant memory, and for nearly
all of us, if that vision lives at all today, it lives in black
and white re-runs of &quot;Leave It To Beaver&quot; and &quot;Father
Knows Best&quot; and in yellowing photographs of small children
standing with their parents next to cars with large tail fins.
 It has suffered, as Everett Carll Ladd recently put it, &quot;the
worst fate that can befall an idea:  It has become quaint.&quot;
<P>
<h3>The Next Shining City</h3>
<P>
 For at least 30 years,(4) America has been awaiting a new vision
of its future, the next reinterpretation of the American idea.
 Ronald Reagan came close to offering it -- but ultimately, while
Reagan changed the world, he did not, in this most fundamental
sense, change America.
<P>
 But history will not be denied.  A new American vision of progress
is beginning to take shape, in the ivory towers of America's think
tanks and universities and in grass-roots movements growing up
across America.  We are about to define for ourselves the next
Shining City, and to embark on a new journey of pursuit.
<P>
 America's next Shining City will be defined by three facts: 

<P>
 First, as William Strauss and Neil Howe make clear in <B>Generations</B>,
the Baby Boomers are the most spiritual, moralistic generation
since the New Deal.  
<P>
 Second, as Everett Carll Ladd demonstrates in his work on &quot;The
American Ideology,&quot; the Boomers' spirituality is consistent
with the historical American ideology, which is alive and well
-- indeed, dominant -- in American culture today.
<P>
 Third, it is apparent to virtually everyone that the bureaucratic,
&quot;welfare state&quot; form of government invented by the New
Dealers is obsolete and failing, and that it must be replaced.
<P>
 The implications of these three facts are profound and pervasive.
 
<P>
 First, because the Boomers believe that values are paramount,
they are provoking a much needed reexamination of the moral pillars
of American culture.  Sub-plots abound.  Multi-culturalists (adherents
to the value that there are no objective values) attack the Christian
Right.  New Age'rs fight both the Christian Right and the multi-culturalists,
arguing on the one hand that the public square should admit only
those spiritual discussions that omit explicit mention of religion,
and on the other that we must search for and find objective values.
 The ideological left argues for a new Puritanism against smoking,
pollution and pornography, while the ideological right offers
its own brand focussing on abortion, promiscuity and . . . pornography.
 
<P>
 Older people (the &quot;Silent Generation&quot;) and younger
ones (the &quot;13ers&quot;), who find the Boomer's fixation on
values somewhere between irrelevant and offensive, support &quot;pragmatic&quot;
politicians like Perot, worship anti-heroes like Bart Simpson
and ridicule with equal disdain Hillary Clinton's &quot;new politics
of meaning&quot; and Pat Robertson's more explicit spiritual message.
<P>
 But these sub-plots are just that.  The central fact is that
the Boomers are coming to power in every realm of American life,
and as they assume the burdens of leadership it is inevitable
that they will bring their moralism with them.
<P>
 The question then raised is whether the Boomers will ever find
a consensus of belief.  Will they ever agree on the metric by
which progress will be judged, or will the next two decades be
dominated by re-runs of Dan Quayle vs. Murphy Brown?
<P>
 The answer lies in Everett Carll Ladd's work on &quot;The American
Ideology.&quot;  Ladd, the Director of the Roper Center for Public
Opinion Research, is perhaps America's leading authority on public
opinion and belief.  He concludes in a recent article that, &quot;in
recent years, even though broad social forces centering around
education and electronic communications are shrinking the planet,
survey research still shows Americans holding tenaciously and
distinctively to the central elements of their founding ideology.&quot;
<P>
 Ladd's point is borne out by the breadth of opposition (from
Shelby Steele and Martin Peretz to Lynne Cheney and Thomas Sowell)
to multiculturalism, the only major, direct challenge to American
ideology left on the planet after the death of communism.  The
American ideology is much stronger than generally recognized,
and it is a good bet that the Boomers' quest for a new &quot;politics
of meaning&quot; will discover a large common ground within the
historical principles of American thought.
<P>
 The third fact -- the increasingly apparent failure of bureaucracy-focussed
&quot;welfare state&quot; government -- creates the prospect for
intergenerational cooperation between the two generations that
will dominate the next 25 years, the Boomers and their pragmatic
youngers, the &quot;13ers.&quot;
<P>
 For the Boomers, the failure of the welfare state is a values
issue.  The poverty, crime and decadence the welfare state has
engendered -- the children shot in the crossfires or abducted
into sexual slavery, the abhorrent conditions in public housing,
the expulsion of <I>any</I> sense of right and wrong from the
public schools -- these unwanted and, for many, unexpected consequences
of the welfare state are simply intolerable to a generation that
prides itself in doing the right thing.  The sense among Boomers
that they have a <I>moral</I> obligation to do something about
it is strong, growing and increasingly coming to dominate both
ends of the old Left-Right spectrum.
<P>
 For the 13ers, the welfare state is a much simpler matter.  It
doesn't work.  It kills jobs through high taxes and regulation;
it can't keep the streets (or even our homes) safe from predators;
it produces potholes, traffic jams and bad schools; it costs too
much and delivers too little.  
<P>
 In the closing chapters of <B>Generations</B>, Strauss and Howe
point out that today's generational &quot;constellation&quot;
is remarkably similar to the one in place in the 1850s, when a
&quot;Silent&quot; generation of compromisers was suddenly replaced
by a &quot;Boom-like&quot; generation of idealists willing to
die for principle.  But the next three decades portend nothing
so dark or menacing as America's Civil War.  It is far more likely
that the generations of our immediate future will find a shared
vision of America's next Shining City and work together in a new
age of American progress.
<P>
 Yes, it will seem messy as it happens.  People for the American
Way and the Christian Coalition are not about to lie down together,
and the very powerful entrenched coalition that feeds at the welfare
state trough will not roll over easily for a new generation of
reformers, from Left <I>or</I> Right.  But the pieces are in place
for a new era  of American imagination and creation.
<P>
 The future of progress is bright.

1  In this sense, most recent discussions of the American disease
(unwittingly) pursue an implicit intellectual course consistent
with what Thomas Sowell identifies as the &quot;unconstrained
vision&quot; -- the notion of man's perfectibility.  As he explains
in <B>Conflict of Visions</B>:
<P>
<blockquote> The great evils of the world -- war, poverty, and crime, for
example -- are seen in completely different terms by those with
the constrained and the unconstrained visions.  If human options
are not inherently constrained, then the presence of such repugnant
and disastrous phenomenon virtually cries out for explanations
-- and for solutions.  But if the limitations and passions of
man himself are at the heart of these painful phenomena, then
what requires explanation are the ways in which they have been
avoided or minimized.  While believers in the unconstrained vision
seek the special causes of war, poverty and crime, believers in
the constrained vision seek the special causes of peace, wealth,
or a law-abiding society.
</blockquote>
<P>
2  I have chosen the term &quot;civic discussion&quot; over &quot;politics&quot;
quite consciously.  In modern discussions, the latter term has
come to connote all that is <I>wrong</I> with the current political
system and been stripped of any connection with what is <I>right</I>
with representative democracy.  As used here, the &quot;civic
discussion&quot; refers to America's conversation with itself
about the nature of the national myth, a discussion which is most
often associated with political campaigns.
<P>
3  The extent to which the 1930s defined the 1950s is at one level
not surprising:  The leaders of the 1950s were, after all, the
very same children who attended, or read about, the 1939-40 fair.
 For evidence, see David Halberstam's excellent history of <B>The
Fifties</B>.
<P>
4  There is no precise way to date the death of the New Deal vision
as a motivating symbolic goal.  The end of Kennedy's &quot;Camelot&quot;
is the date that makes most sense to me, and scholars like James
Q. Wilson and Charles Murray point out most measures of the social
pathologies that now dominate our civilization &quot;turned down&quot;
beginning in 1963.  But there can be no doubt the vision was gone
by the early 1970s.  (Contrast, for example, the optimism of &quot;The
World of Tomorrow&quot; with the nihilism of Dartmouth's valedictory
address in 1971:  &quot;I have made no plans because I have found
no plans worth making.&quot;)

<a href="/pff"> <img src="bi.gif" border="0" alt="PFF Home" align="right"></a>
<h1>Renewing American Civilization: Learning to Prepare for the Future</h1>

<b>by Newt Gingrich</b>
<p>

My decision to teach a course about renewing American civilization grew out
of a discussion of problems in the third world and our inability to teach
others the habits, principles and tools that have empowered ordinary
Americans to lead extraordinary lives. It all began in a conversation about
helping Somalia and ended with a decision to focus on renewing America.
<P>
In December 1992, I was working on long-range planning with Owen Roberts in
Tampa, Florida. Owen is a brilliant student of free markets and the free
enterprise system. He believes deeply in American civilization and in the
extraordinary range of opportunities that America has given so many of its
citizens.
<P>
Yet that December day, Owen Roberts was in a rage of despair and
frustration about the current limitations on the American ability to help
people. The United States was going into Somalia to help save innocent
Somalians from the starvation and death that their own warlords were
inflicting upon them.
<P>
Roberts was not opposed to humanitarian missions and to American
intervention to help innocent victims. Far from it. His frustration lay in
the fact that our intervention would be temporary, our help would last only
a little while, and we would lack the knowledge and the commitment to truly
transform Somalian society.
<P>
The things we could not teach were obvious, yet they are at the heart of
the successes we Americans have had as a people. Free enterprise in a free
market; entrepreneurship; productivity; incentives and the work ethic;
citizenship; the rule of law; the right to free speech and free elections:
these were the kind of core values, principles, habits and institutions
that were necessary if Somalia was to develop a decent future for its
citizens.
<P>
This collection of values, principles, habits and institutions could be
grouped together as "American civilization." I asked Roberts, because we no
longer teach American civilization to young Americans, why would we think
we could teach it to Somalians?
<P>
He agreed with me that we did not have a commitment to American
civilization in our schools. He then asserted that if we could not teach
Somalians because we no longer taught ourselves, maybe the answer was to
begin by reasserting American civilization here at home and to once again
insist that America was a civilization worth studying and that renewing
American civilization was possibly the most important challenge our
generation had to meet.
<P>
The more I watched the evening news of violence, brutality, drug addiction
and child abuse, the clearer it became that American civilization has been
decaying.
<P>
I talked with people about the challenge of helping the poor leave poverty
and the vital goal of giving every American an opportunity to pursue
happiness, live in safety, get a good education and find a good job. It
became clear that the welfare state had failed, and we had to return to the
values and principles of American civilization if we were going to truly
help the poor leave poverty.
<P>
Furthermore, as we wrestled with balancing the budget in Washington, it
became obvious that only a transformation of government functions and
duties would allow us to eliminate the deficit. Yet such a transformation
would require a deep shift in popular thinking about the role of the
federal government compared to the role of the citizen, the role of the
voluntary associations (including religious institutions), the role of
private business and the role of local and state government. In effect,
balancing the federal government's budget would require a return to the
pre-New Deal (pre-1933) model of America, a model which had worked for 144
years as the most decentralized and least governmental society in the
world. That transformation would require a lot of thought and a lot of
dialogue with the American people. No change so profound and so far
reaching could be developed by so-called experts or imposed by elected
officials on a free people. Only a thorough dialogue involving a lot of
citizens could create an acceptance for a transformation on this scale.
<P>
<h2>The Future</h2>

It was also clear that our effort to revitalize American civilization could
not simply be a look backwards and an effort to return to some kind of
"Golden Age" of a past America.
<P>
In the first place, there was no "Golden Age." Every generation of
Americans has had sins of omission and commission. Many of the Founding
Fathers were slaveholders. Segregation was a sin against Black Americans
that lasted well into my lifetime. Our treatment of American Indians has
been abhorrent from the first landing of Europeans right to the present day
reality of suicides and alcoholism on government subsidized reservations
that all too often are traps for the young Americans who live on them.
Women have more freedom and opportunity today than at any other period, and
any effort to go backward would involve an unacceptable diminishment of
their lives. Our goal could not be to go back. It had to be to learn the
best of the American past and apply it to build an even better future.
<P>
There was an even deeper reason to undertake a forward looking approach to
renewing American civilization. We are living on the edge of two
transformations so powerful and so profound that they will change the
history of the human race and therefore, by definition, of American
civilization. The first is the rise of the third wave information age. The
second is the rise of the world market as the dominant economic reality of
our time. Each transformation will prove so decisive that any effort to
renew American civilization will have to look forward and take them into
account.
<P>
However, combining an interest in what lies ahead with an effort to
understand the lessons of what has happened in the past might prove to be
the most powerful combination of all.
<P>
After all, our fascination with the potential of the future must not blind
us to the value of the past. The American civilization which we inherited
has provided more opportunity to more people of more ethnic backgrounds
than any civilization in history. People from across the planet come to
America to learn to be American.
<P>
By combining the potential of the future with the lessons of the past to
enrich the present, I think we can develop a tremendous increase in the
opportunities for virtually every American.
<P>
Even if you agree with the analysis, you might question the need for a
course. After all, the more recent approach to solving problems in America
has been to purpose government programs or to announce new government led
solutions. A course on American civilization might seem a rather indirect
approach to promoting change.
<P>
Yet I believe the only way to get the scale of change we really need is to
focus on educating citizens so they have the principles, the framework and
the tools necessary to effect change on their own. As a free person you
must have some core framework of thought that enables you to function
effectively in a free society.
<P>
While a core set of ideas is important for a free person, the concept of a
core set of ideas is even more important for a free nation. Defining the
rules of the game; outlining what it means to be an American; creating a
framework of expectations so people will know what their civilization
expects of them and what rewards they will get if they meet the
expectations (what Yankelovich called a giving and getting contract): each
of these core concepts has to be outlined and clearly understood if America
is to work as a society.
<P>
Precisely because we want our central government to be limited in its
powers and authority and we want our bureaucrats to stay out of our lives
and usually out of the life of our neighborhood, it is vital that we bind
ourselves by intellectual principles rather than governmental rules.
<P>
This approach to renewing American civilization is a very different model
of the big government, big bureaucracy model that focused on politicians
and their ideas for solving problems. It is an active citizen model that
returns power to the people to whom it belongs in the first place as
"unalienable rights." It then calls on them to make a prosperous, safe
America in which every American has a sense of personal strength, unlimited
opportunity and in which the pursuit of happiness leads the American people
to create an American nation economically, militarily and morally able to
help the entire human race achieve self-government, safety and prosperity.

<h2>The Future Of Medical Innovation: Reaping The Benefits Of The Knowledge Revolution</h2>

<b>by Thomas Lenard and Brian Mannix</b>
</center>
<P><br>
<blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


We are witnessing an explosion of scientific knowledge that will form the
basis for medical advances well into the twenty-first century.  But our
ability to realize fully the benefits of these advances--actually
delivering new products to patients--is threatened by an outmoded
regulatory framework.  The purpose of the Progress & Freedom Foundation's
Medical Innovation Project is to design a new process for bringing medical
products to market--one compatible with legitimate concerns for safety and
leaps in scientific knowledge.<P>


This new process will consist of several parts:  it will provide for review
and certification of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices, as well as
the dissemination of information about these products to the medical
community; it will include a tort liability framework that stimulates
manufacturers to produce safer products, but does not discourage them from
introducing products that save lives; and, it will protect intellectual
property rights, without which these products would not be on the market at
all.<P>


In sum, the new system must provide our citizens with the safety
protections they want and need, but not impede the development of
twenty-first century technologies that measurably improve their health.
Remaining with the system we now have will lead to a continued movement of
our medical technology sectors overseas, where the benefits of new
technologies will be enjoyed while they are unavailable here.
<P>

<h2>Stifling Innovation</h2>


The United States is the world's leader in biomedical research:  in public
sector spending through the National Institutes of Health and other
government agencies; in private sector research and development
(particularly through the many entrepreneurial firms sustained by U. S.
venture capital markets); in the dramatic scientific discoveries that all
this research has produced; and, in manufacturing the drugs, diagnostics
and medical devices   that apply these breakthroughs to improving human
health.  Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to bring these
new medical products to the market.  Many studies (see references) provide
convincing evidence of the discouraging effect our current regulatory
procedures have on the development of new products.  Americans receive the
benefits of fewer new drugs and medical devices later than they should.
Our review and approval process is one of  the slowest in the world, and it
is now routine for new drugs and devices to be available in other countries
before they become available here.
<P>

During a clinical trial, if researchers observe that the patients in a
"treatment group" are dying at a significantly faster rate than those in a
"control group," the experiment is halted.  And if researchers observe that
a control group is dying at a much faster rate than a treatment group, the
experiment is also halted and the treatment made available to both groups.
What researchers cannot do, however, is make the treatment available to the
population of patients outside the experiment.  In effect, the great
majority of patients are compelled to remain in what is essentially a large
control group, whether or not it is a safe place to be.  Ultimately, the
system as now configured may deprive patients of life-saving products that
never come to market because the overall costs of innovation have been
driven too high.
<P>

The current approval process also deprives patients and their doctors of
critically important information. The biomedical research industry is an
information industry, and the FDA's principal functions are all in one way
or another information-related.  Yet manufacturers are prohibited from
disseminating much valuable information about their products.  Roughly half
of all drug prescriptions, including most of those for children, are
written for unapproved "off-label" uses.  The FDA prohibits and sanctions
manufacturers from marketing drugs for these uses.  Thus, for example, the r
esults of National Institutes of Health studies of off-label uses cannot be
circulated to physicians.  At the same time, however, a pediatrician who
withheld a drug from a sick child simply because it was unapproved would be
subject to a charge of malpractice!
<P>

The regulation of drugs and medical devices should be from the point of
view of helping patients.  With this in mind, we propose the development of
a new institutional arrangement to ensure the safety of new drugs and
medical devices--one that will be explicitly offered as a replacement for
much of what the Food and Drug Administration now does.  Our purpose is to
design a new structure that will yield the correct balance of objectives:
on the one hand, to bring new medical products to patients; on the other,
to provide at least as much assurance as we now have that those products
are safe and effective.  A replacement system must also facilitate the flow
of accurate information on the safety and efficacy of drugs and medical
devices.
<P>

<h2>The Role of the Private Sector</h2>


The appropriate division of private- and public-sector responsibilities to
accomplish these objectives is a major focus of our project.  What should
be the government's role?  A major task is to examine the advantages and
disadvantages of placing substantially greater reliance on private
institutions, which experience has shown usually provide performance
superior to that of government institutions.
<P>

Many react to this idea by saying a government watchdog is essential to
ensure safety:  How can we expect parents to give a prescription drug to
their children without the assurance of a safety review by the FDA?  We do
not  suggest that drugs and medical devices come to market without careful
review, but there are ways to do this that do not unduly slow innovation or
discourage the production of valuable information.  We need a system that
strikes the right balance: one offering all patients access to the best
health care options available and with the best information we can provide
about risks and benefits.  The bottom line is the benefit to the patient,
and whether patients can be served better by a new system.
<P>

<h2>The Revolution in Medical Technology1</h2>

Rapid advances in information technology are transforming many industries,
and nowhere is that more evident than in medicine.  The combination of
computers, sensors, and imaging systems--CAT and PET scans and MRI--are
replacing invasive procedures and "exploratory" surgery.  Microscopic
cameras and microscopic tools are making Fantastic Voyage not seem so far
fetched.  Already physicians have tested a "virtual colonoscopy" that
couples a virtual-reality imaging system with a CAT scan.  Without
inserting an instrument, the physician can "fly" through the patient's
colon on screen, searching for signs of disease.  In addition to creating
fantastic medical devices, data processing capabilities promise to allow
far more efficient tracking of treatments and outcomes for large numbers of
patients, allowing successful medical strategies to be identified.
<P>

The rapid pace of progress in information technology has been equaled, if
not exceeded, by the explosion of knowledge about the genetic and molecular
foundation of life--what we call the new biotechnology.  This new knowledge
provides us with a far better understanding of the causes of diseases, a
far better ability to identify and characterize infectious agents  and a
far better ability to design countermeasures.  We can identify a "typo" in
an individual gene and are learning how to correct it.  We are beginning to
understand the complex mechanisms by which genes are turned on and off, and
how cancer and other diseases result when these mechanisms go awry.
<P>

Modern medical technology enables us to know far more than was previously
possible about the causes, and likely remedies, for a wide range of
illnesses.  Identification of genetic defects has expanded exponentially;
already two children with Severe Combined Immune Deficiency2  have been
treated with corrective genes.  The recent identification of the cystic
fibrosis (CF) gene may make possible a similar gene therapy approach.  Gene
therapy is also being attempted for cancer, a disease with genetic
components.
<P>
Patients are now being treated with the protein products of human
genes--such as human growth hormone and human insulin--which are produced
by genetically modified bacteria.  The bacteria are engineered to contain
and express the same gene that the treated individuals lack.  One major
advantage of these bacteria-produced biologicals is that they can be made
to match perfectly the human version (so that diabetics can use human,
rather than pig, insulin), yet there is no chance of contamination with
viruses (as can be the case when the same product is obtained from animal
donors).
<P>

When human donors must be used--as is still the case with blood and other
organ transplants--biotechnology supplies sensitive tests to identify known
dangerous contamination or tissue mismatch.  New biotechnology-based tests
for exposure to HIV-1 and the hepatitis viruses are essential to assuring
the safety of the U.S. blood supply.
<P>

Genetic engineering brings special advantages to the production of
vaccines.  In the past, the principal risk of vaccination involved
administering a pathogen sufficiently intact to provoke an immune response,
but not so intact as to produce serious disease, even when administered to
millions of individuals.  Walking this line requires very careful quality
control.  Developing a successful vaccine was previously a hit or miss
proposition, but new technology allows us to construct vaccines lacking key
genetic sequences required for virulence but retaining intact antigens,
thereby making vaccines safer, more effective and more economical.  In
addition, improved understanding of the genetic basis of the immune
function opens the door to developing treatments for various auto-immune
diseases, as well as offering the possibility of enhancing the immune
response to infectious diseases.
<P>

Biotechnology also gives us tools for identifying and studying the
pathogens that cause infectious diseases.  While satisfactory progress
against AIDS has been frustratingly difficult to achieve, it is difficult
to imagine what lines of research could be pursued without the tools of
biotechnology.  Other biotechnology applications in medicine include
diagnostic applications based on monoclonal antibodies and DNA probes,
biopolymers or synthetic tissues used for implants, prosthetics and other
clinical uses.
<P>

<h2>From Laboratory to Patient -- Research and Development in
Medical Innovation</h2>

The discovery and development of pharmaceuticals and medical devices is a
time-consuming, uncertain process that requires years of expensive
laboratory work, preclinical and, ultimately, clinical testing.  It now
takes approximately 12 years to bring a drug to the market, at an average
cost approaching $400 million.3   Only a small fraction of laboratory
investigations yield a compound suitable for animal studies, and only a
small fraction of those are promising enough to warrant clinical testing on
humans.  Many years of costs are incurred before there is even a chance of
patients receiving new medicines and companies earning returns on their
investment.  This is of special significance for start-up companies, such
as many biotechnology firms which have no products bringing in revenue
while they invest in researching new medicines.
<P>

The uncertainties associated with the R&D process are dominant factors, not
only for biotechnology firms, but for the medical technology sector
generally.  At the most basic level is the scientific risk associated with
the research.  Researchers simply do not know what is going to work, how
well, or when.  If the science does work out in some form, and a product
can be brought to market, what will the market be like?  How much
competition will there be, here and abroad?  Will other scientific
developments quickly make this new product obsolete, perhaps before it is
even ready?  Investing in intellectual property carries its own particular
risks, since investors cannot be sure that, years later, they will still
own that for which they paid.  Talented individuals cannot be
indentured--after collecting a large salary for many years, they may walk
away with the firm's most significant assets. Only patentable inventions
have secure value, and the patent process has its own risks.
<P>

Additional uncertainty can be created by government or private health-care
financing rules.  Patients may not have coverage for new treatments
(regardless of whether they are approved by the FDA).  Or the price paid by
health care programs may be too low to fully recover research and
development costs.
<P>

Finally, the FDA approval process creates its own major uncertainties, both
with respect to ultimate approval and the time and expense required to gain
approval.  FDA disapproval at some stage of the process can change the
value of a firm and its effective cost of capital overnight, especially for
small companies without diversified product lines.  These regulatory
uncertainties reduce the returns from research and development in the
pharmaceutical and device sectors and, therefore, the number of new
therapeutic products that are developed.
<P>

Many risks are intrinsic to the drug and device development process itself,
but some--most importantly, the regulatory risks--may be at least partially
avoidable.  To the extent we reduce regulatory uncertainties, and the
regulatory component of development costs generally, we increase the flow
of capital to this market and the flow of new products to patients.
<P>

<h2>From Helping to Hindering the Market--A Brief Historical Review of Drug and Device Approval</h2>


Pharmaceuticals regulation always has been appropriately concerned with
information.  Sellers of medical products frequently know more about their
products than buyers, and this can be harmful to the proper functioning of
the market.  But over the years the focus of drug regulation has shifted,
from trying to correct this information asymmetry to becoming a central
participant in the basic processes of generating and disseminating
information throughout the major phases of a product's development and
marketing.4
<P>
The purpose of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the first major piece of
drug legislation, was to provide consumers with accurate information about
the quality of products they were purchasing.  False and misleading claims
about drugs and their contents were prohibited, and manufacturers were made
liable for adulterated or misbranded drugs.
<P>

The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 established the requirement for
government approval before a drug could be marketed.  Manufacturers were
required to test for safety in animals and humans and submit those test
results to the FDA for review.  The process was far shorter and the FDA's
role more limited than now.
<P>

The Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962 ushered in the current regulatory
regime.  First, they required that manufacturers provide premarket evidence
of efficacy as well as safety.  Second, they marked a major change in the
FDA's role in pharmaceuticals regulation--from essentially being a reviewer
and evaluator of information to playing a central decision-making role in
the conduct of clinical research.  FDA now regulates in detail the
protocols for the clinical trials undertaken prior to the New Drug
Application (NDA), evaluates the data, may require additional testing, and
has to approve what manufacturers can say about their products.
<P>

The 1976 amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act established a
two-track approval process for medical devices.5   As with the process for
pharmaceuticals, the premarket approval (PMA) process for devices requires
submitting clinical and other scientific evidence on safety and efficacy.
Most devices go through the less demanding 510 (k) process, which applies
to devices that can be shown to be "substantially equivalent" to products
already on the market before the 1976 amendments.
<P>

An important corollary of the current drug approval process is that
manufacturers are precluded from disseminating any information on the
effectiveness or safety of their products, unless such data have been
included in an approved NDA.  Similar restrictions apply to manufacturers
of medical devices.
<P>

Physicians, however, are free to prescribe approved products for
applications other than those in the NDA, and these "off-label" uses are
now estimated to account for roughly half of all prescriptions.6
Nonetheless, manufacturers are not allowed to refer to any published
studies, including refereed journal articles or textbooks, in their
promotional materials or to sponsor educational symposia about new uses.
They cannot, therefore, tell you or your doctor about research results on
such subjects as the effects of aspirin on heart attacks or of estrogen on
cancer.  (Your doctor can tell you if he happens to read the right medical
journal.)  Device manufacturers face comparable restrictions in the kinds
of hands-on demonstrations they can offer physicians.
<P>

These restrictions deprive doctors and their patients of valuable
information.  They may, moreover, discourage useful studies of off-label
uses from being undertaken, since information from these studies cannot be
freely used in medical communications.
<P>

<h2>Case-by-Case Regulatory Review</h2>


The goal of the case-by-case regulatory approach to reviewing new medical
products is to block dangerous products while permitting beneficial ones to
go forward.  There are two kinds of mistakes government reviewers can make:
(1) approving a product that turns out to be dangerous, and (2) blocking
or delaying a product that would have been beneficial.  While both types of
mistakes impose serious consequences on patients, they are not viewed as
equally serious by regulators.  Victims of the first type of mistake,
approving a product that turns out to be dangerous, are very visible,
provoking Congressional hearings, public outcry and perhaps even loss of a
job for the responsible reviewer.  This "Congressional-fishbowl syndrome"
provides a strong disincentive to approve something that has even a remote
potential of having unexpected negative effects.  Mistakes of the second
type, however, go largely unseen.  Victims of a delay in or disapproval of
a beneficial product are not readily observed.7   The costs of the second
type of mistake, therefore, are not readily apparent, providing the
reviewer with a strong incentive to err on the side of conservatism,
requiring extensive proof before approving new products.
<P>

It is always possible to generate additional information and increase
statistical precision by doing additional testing.  And this may improve
the chances of detecting problems in a new drug or medical device, although
the returns from additional data gathering can be expected to diminish
sharply at some point.  The institutional pressures faced by FDA do not
recognize that equal weight should be given to the costs to patients when
beneficial products are kept off the market.
<P>

There is a substantial consensus that the 1962 Amendments have slowed the
rate of pharmaceutical innovation.  A series of studies by prominent
researchers found that the 1962 Amendments and ensuing regulations had a
significant adverse effect on the introduction of new chemical entities,
after controlling for the influence of other factors.8  There is also
evidence that the PMA process for medical devices had a similar effect.
International comparisons provide additional evidence:9
<P>
Average development times for pharmaceuticals, including clinical testing
and review times, are 77 percent higher in the United States than in other
countries (9.2 vs. 5.2 years).10
75 percent of the new drugs approved (between 1984 and 1992) were already
available in other countries.11   These drugs are frequently available in a
large number of countries for a number years before approval in the United
States.12
<P>
The number of PMA medical device approvals declined steeply in the late
1980s and early 1990s, falling to a low point of 12 approvals in 1992.  In
that year, average approval time was 663 working days, more than twice the
time needed in Europe and Japan.13
Medical device manufacturers are increasingly locating research and
manufacturing facilities offshore.  For example, the CEO of a major medical
device manufacturer--responsible for developing pacemaker
technology--recently reported that virtually all of his firm's major
products are now being developed, tested and produced overseas, and, most
importantly, are available to patients elsewhere much earlier than they are
available here.14   He indicated that American patients are sometimes
receiving therapies that are two-to-three generations behind those
available in Europe, Canada and Japan.
<P>
These effects cannot be remedied by tinkering with the current system,
because they reflect a systemic problem.  The skewed institutional
incentives faced by FDA result in an imbalance of the benefits of FDA
regulation (in terms of keeping unsafe and ineffective products off the
market) relative to the costs of denying patients access to beneficial
products.
<P>

<h2>A Framework for Change</h2>


The issue, then, is how to achieve the objectives of safety and efficacy
for new medical products in a way that does not sacrifice the equally
important objectives of bringing valuable therapies and information to
patients in a timely manner.
<P>

We should begin by recognizing that the market, supplemented by the tort
system, already provides substantial incentives to produce safe and
effective products.  Moreover, current trends in health-care financing,
which increase the importance of health maintenance organizations and other
large, sophisticated buyers in the market, make those incentives stronger
than they were at the time the existing regulatory framework was being
developed decades ago.  Managed-care providers don't want to provide
coverage for unsafe or ineffective medical treatments.
<P>

There remains, however, a potentially troublesome information asymmetry
between sellers and buyers, and the market may not provide sufficient
incentives to overcome it.  The current regulatory requirements for
information on safety and efficacy may be too high in many instances, and
unnecessarily keep useful therapeutic products off the market.  But, the
clinical tests and other studies needed to generate data on safety and
efficacy are very expensive, and one can envision situations where firms
might do too little testing.  One can also imagine cases where firms might
downplay the importance of adverse results on safety or efficacy, in order
not to jeopardize a product's profitability.
<P>

Proposals for change should build on the many incentives already available
in the market for the generation and dissemination of accurate information
on quality, safety and efficacy, but should also recognize that patients
have come to rely on the third-party stamp of approval that the FDA now
confers.  They need to be equally comfortable with any alternative
arrangements.  With these factors in mind, there are (at least) three
interrelated sets of issues relating to reform of the process by which
medical innovations are introduced:  institutional issues, legal issues and
scientific issues.
<P>

<h2>Institutional Issues</h2>


The current review and approval system provides a very strong incentive to
keep unsafe products off the market--at the expense of also keeping new
beneficial products off the market.  In the process, it also suppresses the
distribution to the medical community of valuable information on off-label
uses.  The critical task, then, is to design a new system that corrects
these defects--one that encourages the flow of innovations and new
information while retaining the public's confidence in the pharmaceuticals
and medical devices on the market.  This requires that consumers have at
least as much assurance in the safety and efficacy of those products as
they do now.  The net result should be a significant increase in public
health benefits.
<P>

For some time a number of private-sector entities have accomplished
safety-related functions in other product areas, and may provide useful
lessons for the drug and device approval processes.  For example,
third-party product certification is done by Underwriters Laboratory;
voluntary standards development by the American National Standards
Institute and the American Society for Testing and Materials; and peer
review of safety systems by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations.
<P>

The major questions here concern the role of government in the review and
approval process, and the circumstances under which the incentives faced by
nongovernmental certifying entities would be an improvement over those
faced by the FDA:
<P>

Can the FDA be restructured to avoid the adverse outcomes experienced under
the current regulatory regime?  What can be learned from the experience of
other countries, which approve the marketing of new drugs and devices more
rapidly?  Could greater reliance be placed on panels of outside experts, as
is the case elsewhere?
<P>
Can private entities be structured to avoid the information asymmetry--that
sellers sometimes have an incentive to withhold information from buyers?
Should a private certifying agency be certified by the government?  Should
private certifiers compete with the FDA?  Should manufacturers, in this age
of user fees, have the option of submitting their data to either a private
firm, the FDA or both?  Would private certifiers be subject to conflicts of
interest and how would those be handled?
<P>
How much reliance can be placed on market pressures from buyers?  The
large, sophisticated buyers of medical care that now dominate the medical
marketplace have a strong economic interest in selecting products that are
both safe and effective.  These large buyers can place direct pressure on
pharmaceuticals and medical device suppliers to disclose relevant
information.  They may also prove to be good customers of private
certification firms.  Should large buyers, such as HMOs and hospitals, be
able to make their own certification decisions?  Could buyers and sellers
of medical products jointly sponsor private certifiers that would, as a
result of their joint sponsorship, have the right incentives to provide
objective information?
<P>
Should different levels of certification be encouraged, as long as the
information available is fully disclosed?  Along these lines, should the
efficacy requirement be retained for all approvals?
<P>
Should the certification process carry with it any restrictions on the
dissemination of information by manufacturers?  If so, what should be the
criteria be for defining these restrictions?
<P>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>


Product liability laws serve an important purpose, both in providing
compensation to victims of accidents and illnesses and in stimulating
manufacturers to produce safer products.  A less regulatory approach to the
approval process for drugs and medical devices may increase the importance
of product liability laws in providing appropriate incentives for safety as
well as the dissemination of reliable information.  The questions that need
to be considered concern the role of  the tort system within a restructured
drug and device review and approval framework:
<P>

How can the product liability system be structured to recognize both types
of errors that manufacturers can make--the marketing of an unsafe product
and the withholding of a safe one?15   (If it only recognizes the first
error, its biases will be similar to those of the current regulatory
regime.)<br>
What is the effect of product liability law on the incentives to produce
data both before and after a product is marketed, and to disseminate
accurate data on risks to users--patients, physicians and hospitals--of the
product?<br>
<P>
How should liability exposure be divided in a system in which there is
greater private responsibility for the introduction of new drugs and
devices?  What would be the liability exposure of private certifiers?  How
can the liability rules be structured so that these entities have
appropriate incentives for safety, but still participate in the system?
<P>
How should the tradeoff between the insurance and safety functions of
product liability be made?  This involves standards for determining both
liability and damages?
<P>
Given the national (and international) scope of the pharmaceuticals and
devices markets, should a federal product liability statute preempt state
statutes?
<P>

<h2>Patent Protection</h2>


The growth in the number of drug patent applications indicates that the
body of scientific knowledge relevant for pharmaceutical advances is
growing rapidly.16   Longer patent lives increase the expected
profitability from research and development expenditures, with a consequent
increase in the rate of technical advance.  For the patient, longer patent
protection should increase the availability of new products.  The downside
is that prices for these products will be higher for a longer period of
time.
<P>
The effective patent life for pharmaceuticals products is the difference
between approval of the New Drug Application and the expiration of the
patent.  This is generally far shorter than the statutory patent life of 17
years (recently extended to 20 years under GATT).  Recognizing the
interrelationship between the approval process, and in response to evidence
that the average effective patent life for products subject to the FDA
review and approval process was declining, Congress passed legislation in
1984 increasing patent life for pharmaceuticals and medical devices for up
to five years.
<P>

Any change that speeds the entry of new drugs and medical devices to the
market will increase the effective patent life.  The implications of this
need to be evaluated in the context of any proposed new system.
<P>

<h2>Scientific Issues</h2>


Medical innovation is about science, and the development of adequate safety
and efficacy information involves issues of experimental and statistical
design.  These necessarily involve a weighing of costs and benefits,
because it is always possible to do another test or to increase statistical
precision by expanding the sample size.  Major scientific issues involve
the extent and type of testing needed for different categories of products:
<P>

Given that testing is expensive, and keeps drugs and devices off the
market, how much testing is enough and when does it become too much?  The
answer will clearly vary depending on the nature of the therapy, the
condition it is designed to address, and the available alternatives.
Nevertheless, we need to address the value, at the margin, of the
information produced under the current system.
<P>
What is the appropriate balance between pre and postmarket studies?  The
U.S. approval process, in contrast to some other systems, is heavily
weighted toward premarket testing, which keep drugs and devices off the
market longer.
<P>
Who should be responsible for issues of experimental and statistical
design?  The FDA has increasingly taken this responsibility itself, though
there clearly are other repositories of this expertise.
<P>
What has been the effect on the review process of the requirement to
provide evidence on efficacy?  Should this requirement be revised?
<P>

<h2>Reaping the Benefits of Knowledge</h2>


The body of knowledge relevant for medical innovation is increasing at a
rapid rate, providing growing opportunities for therapeutic advances.  At
the same time, the "informational-cybernetic paradigm" of modern molecular
biology offers the promise of greater medical gains aimed at the causes of
many diseases, not just their symptoms.17   This environment demands a
system that facilitates the flow of medical innovations to patients.

<P>
Designing a new system to bring medical products and technologies to the
patient more efficiently is a complex problem, involving interrelated
scientific, economic, institutional and legal issues.  The sectors that
create new medical knowledge are diverse, as are the products they create.
We need a mechanism that accommodates this diversity and nourishes the
creative process.
<P>

As a nation, we spend tens of billions of dollars on medical research each
year, and most of it is conducted in the private sector.  Our citizens must
be confident that they are reaping the benefits of the vast research
establishment we have erected--a flow of medical products that are safe and
the best available.  They and their doctors must also be sure they can
obtain the information necessary to make choices about their medical care.
Our goal is to develop a system that satisfies these goals.

<h2>An Obsolete Federal Government</h2>
<p>
By Jeffrey A. Eisenach
</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
We live in a time of big change.  What does that mean?  It means that very basic 
forces are in the process of restructuring the way we live -- our cultural, economic, 
political and social institutions are changing very profoundly and very rapidly.
<p>
The single most elegant and insightful explanation of the changes we are living 
through is captured in Alvin and Heidi Tofflers concept of <i>The Third Wave</i>.  As the 
Tofflers explain it, there have been three waves of change in human history: the First 
Wave was the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to an agricultural society; the 
Second to an industrial society; and, now the Third, to an information society.
<p>
To make a long story short, the collapse of the price of information has destroyed 
the economic underpinnings of industrial society.  Standardization is being replaced by 
customization; mass communication is being replaced by a plethora of micromedia of all 
kinds; "Big is better" is being replaced by "Small is Beautiful"; economies of scale now 
work in reverse!
<p>
When the Tofflers wrote <i>The Third Wave</i> in 1980, it was seen as "futurism."  
Today, it is current events, and the signs of rapid change are all around us -- in the 
increase in service jobs, in the downsizing of major corporations, in the fact that two-
thirds of the net new jobs created in the last 25 years have been created by small 
businesses, and in the stunning fact, from Dun & Bradstreet, that fully half of the capital 
investment in the United States next year will be for telecommunications, computing and 
other information processing technology.
<p>
<h3>The Role of Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>
What does all this mean for the role of government, and especially the Federal 
government?
<p>
The central organizational paradigm of industrial age society was bureaucracy.  
Today, the word is taken almost as an epithet.  But at one time, bureaucratic organization 
was the centerpiece of a reform movement in America -- the progressive movement -- 
which proposed to replace the corrupt political machines of the late 19th and early 20th 
century with a theory of "scientific management."  This approach -- developed by Max 
Weber in Bismarcks Germany and imported into American business practice by 
Frederick Taylor -- entered American government through a succession of "progressive" 
Presidents, most notably Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt.
<p>
In a time when information was dear, bureaucracy was a means of organizing it, 
creating, as it were, a "priesthood" of civil servants tasked with mastering particular 
fields of knowledge.  By learning all there was to know about their subjects, they were 
expected to make the wisest possible decisions -- based on scientific knowledge -- and so 
direct society in the "right" direction.
<p>
Let me be clear about something:  This system worked.  In the private sector, it 
gave us AT&T, General Motors and IBM.  In domestic government, it produced the 
interstate highway system and landed a man on the moon.  It won World War II, created 
NATO and ultimately defeated the Soviet Empire.
<p>
Let me be equally clear, however, about something else:  That system is over.  It 
died with the fall of the Soviet Empire, the downsizing of IBM and General Motors and 
the breakup of AT&T.
<p>
In one place in the world -- literally -- it lives on. The Federal government.  It 
lives in practice -- in our outmoded models of regulation and the provision of public 
assistance, in large expanses of the Pentagon, and in the way the government -- including 
the Congress -- organizes itself.
<p>
Worse, it lives on in Washington, D.C., not just in what we do but in <i>how we 
think</i>.  To take one example -- there are plenty to choose from -- consider the article in a 
recent <i>Washington Post</i> by Vice President Gore on telecommunications policy.  "What 
My Father Helped Build with Concrete and Asphalt, We Now Build with Glass and 
Copper," it was titled, and its thesis is that the central challenge of the information age is 
to build an "information superhighway" analogous to the interstate highway system of the 
1950s.  
<p>
But the centralized, bureaucratic system that built the interstate highway system is 
dead.  "Cyberspace" is being built by hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs and 
individual hackers, working on their own, through informal associations or tiny software 
firms, or as part of team-based, "virtual" companies like  Microsoft or Sun Microsystems. 
Meanwhile, the Federal government -- whose bureaucracy-based approach delayed the 
new PCS technology by at least six years and delayed cellular telephony by at least a 
decade -- is notorious for still relying on outdated, mainframe computers, which the 
private sector now tellingly refers to as "legacy" systems.  Why would we think a system 
that is still using vacuum tube computers at the Federal Aviation Administration ought to 
be designing (much less building) a national information infrastructure?
<p>
Do not, however, think that the lessons of the Third Wave are limited to our 
approach toward information technology policy.  In every aspect of the private sector, 
from the manufacturing sector (e.g. Ford Motors recent announcement that it is 
shortening its product development life-cycle from 36 months to 24 months) to public 
assistance (where people increasingly understand that small, volunteer-oriented 
community groups are dramatically more effective than bureaucratic government 
programs), the demassifying force of the Third Wave is affecting every aspect of our 
society.
<p>
In short, bureaucracy is obsolete in every aspect of human activity.  This is not a 
matter of ideology.  It is a matter of fact. 
<p>
This fact leads directly and unavoidably to two conclusions that ought to 
intimidate all of us at least a little:  
 <ol>
<i><li> A very significant proportion of the Federal government we have today is 
obsolete.  The challenge for this generation of policymakers is no less than remaking 
much, probably most, of what it does.
 <li> Everything we know about how to create and run Federal programs is 
questionable, and most of it is wrong.<br></i>
</ol>
<p>
If these conclusions are correct, the next step of the analysis is straightforward.
<p>
<h3>Redefining Government</h3>
<p>The question is, "What overall approach should be taken toward restructuring the 
Federal government?"
<p>
Let me answer by suggesting that there appear to be two basic approaches now on 
the table.
<p>
The first approach is called "reform."  Its thesis is that the current set of programs 
can be made to work more efficiently and more effectively through relatively marginal 
changes.  By changing incentives, rewriting the criteria in authorizing statutes, hiring new 
management and generally eliminating "waste, fraud and abuse," this approach would 
argue that we can dramatically improve the results from the current system.
<p>
The problem with this approach is that it has been tried, and it has failed.  How 
many times must we try to inject economic analysis into regulatory decisions, or 
"remake" the Department of Housing and Urban Development, how many "Grace 
Commissions" and "Reinventing Government" initiatives must we watch fail before we 
recognize that the current system cannot be improved through improvement on the 
margin?  Gorbachevs "Glasnost" was not going to save Soviet-style socialism, and no 
amount of "reform" within the current U.S. government will make it "work" in the sense 
of how most people understand that word in 1995.
<p>
The second approach is called "abolishment."  Its thesis is that the problem can be 
solved by going through the Federal organization chart and eliminating agencies or 
departments.  Abolish Commerce.  Abolish Education.  Abolish Energy.  Etc., etc., etc.
<p>
Without any question, there are many functions the Federal government is now 
performing which it should simply stop, and many, many areas where duplicative and 
overlapping functions can be consolidated -- simplifying the organization chart and 
"abolishing" departments and agencies as a result.  But these are, if you will, the "easy" 
cases -- analytically if not politically.  In most areas, the notion of "abolishing" may 
apply to a box on an organization chart, but does not apply to the underlying<I> function</I> that 
box is supposed to perform.  We may, for example, "abolish" HUD -- but a Federal role 
in the national marketplace for home mortgages will persist, even if only in common law, 
simply because it is a national market.   "Abolishment" can therefore serve as a means of 
avoiding the hard questions.
<p>
<h3>Replacing Government</h3>
<p>
This brings me to a third approach.  It is called <i>replacement</i>.  What it means in 
practice is starting with a clean sheet of paper and asking the question, "Suppose we were 
trying to achieve X, what would we do?"  This is what distinguishes it from the "reform" 
approach, which begins by asking "How can we do what we are doing better?"  Reform 
starts from what we have.  Replacement starts from what we <i>need</i>.
<p>
The replacement approach differs from the abolishment approach in an equally 
important way:  It recognizes that in many or even most areas of current Federal activity, 
there is some legitimate Federal role.  The problem -- or at least one important problem -- 
is determining how to replace bureaucratic systems developed over the past six decades 
with entrepreneurial, incentive-based, "Third Wave" systems that will get us where we 
want to go much more efficiently.
<p>
Below are principles that ought to guide the replacement approach.
<p>
<h3>What Should Government Do?</h3>
<p>
First, it should be noted that the replacement approach begins by asking the 
question "What is it we are trying to accomplish?"  Or, as Deming would have put it, 
"<i>What is our aim?</i>"  Replacement forces this question to be asked.
<p>
Asking this question is important for two reasons.  In the first place, it surfaces the 
most profound questions of the role of government, questions that must be constantly 
asked and answered in a functioning democracy.  Secondly, it also forces and illuminates 
the question of measurement.  "If we are trying to accomplish X, how will we know 
whether we have succeeded?"
<p>
<i>This, then, is the first principle:  Replace current institutions with systems that 
have clearly defined, quantifiable objectives and hold those systems accountable for 
achieving those objectives.</i>
<p>
<h3>Who Are the Customers?</h3>
<p>
Secondly, I would suggest to you that you cannot define your objectives without 
first defining your customers.  Is it the teachers union, or the student?  The corporate 
shareholder, or the consumer?  Are you trying to minimize the burden on the Federal 
bureaucrat, or maximize the value created for the citizen?  And, where does the taxpayer 
fit into the mix?
<p>
We all think we know the answers to these questions -- they seem obvious enough 
in principle.  But the fact is that they are complex, difficult questions, and those in the 
private sector who have stopped long enough to ask the question "Who are our 
customers?" have often come up with answers very different from what they unthinkingly 
assumed.
<p>
<i>The second principle of replacement, then, is that each Federal activity should 
identify clearly the customers it is trying to serve.</i>
<p>
<h3>A New Framework of Law</h3>
<p>
Thirdly, one of our most immediate and obvious objectives should be to replace 
complex, ambiguous, often arbitrary laws and regulations with a lean and effective 
framework of laws and institutions.
<p>
Allow me to illustrate this point by referring to the Figure 1. The current 
bureaucratic system -- the picture on the left -- is complex, ambiguous and arbitrary.  
Imagine yourself a customer of this system -- a citizen wanting to know whether it is 
permissible to do something new or different, i.e. to move from point A to point B. (For 
example, produce and market a new product.) What you face today is a gauntlet of legal 
and regulatory hurdles:  Before moving from A to B, you must ask permission from "the 
system," usually from more than one part of the system.  Each part of the system has 
different standards, different deadlines, different forms -- and even if you are confident 
that it will ultimately be "ok" to go from A to B, you have no way of knowing how long 
the process will take, or how much it will cost.
<p>
The most obvious effect of such a system is to discourage change.  In times of 
stability, the damage done by discouraging change is arguably rather small.  Theres not 
that much change to discourage, and the benefits are relatively limited.  But in times of 
change -- times like these -- the costs can be dramatic.  They take the form, today, of 
millions of consumers denied the benefits of new information technologies (The FCCs 
decade-long delay in licensing cellular telephone technology, for example, has been 
estimated to have cost consumers $85 billion!) or, more troubling still, of Americans 
dying for lack of access to medical technologies already on the market in other nations 
but still trying to get past some piece of spaghetti at the FDA.
<p>
A second effect -- less obvious but perhaps ultimately more destructive in a free 
society -- is that a customer starting out at Point A sees nothing but a sea of ambiguity.  
The regulatory and legal system is so nuanced and so arbitrary that it becomes impossible 
to tell what is legal and what is not -- it is, from the perspective of the citizen-customer, 
without meaningful borders.  The end result of such a system is that people lose faith in a 
legal system they cannot understand and whose limits they cannot predict with any 
reasonable certainty.
<p>
The alternative is to create a lean and effective framework of laws and institutions 
that tells people clearly what is allowed and what is not.  Such a system is represented by 
the picture on the right:  If you want to move from point A to point B, you move there -- 
no permissions, no forms, no bureaucratic delays.  But equally important, you know that 
if you move from point A to point C -- you go (figuratively if not literally) "to jail."
<p>
<i>The third principle of replacement, therefore, is to replace complex, ambiguous 
and arbitrary systems of regulation with lean, effective frameworks of laws and 
institutions.</i>
<p>
<h3>Creating Incentives</h3>
<p>
The fourth principle I would offer must be credited to David Osborne -- the idea 
that government ought to "steer the boat rather than row it."  What Osborne means is that 
government ought to create the incentives by which national objectives are met, rather 
than setting up large institutions and spending programs to accomplish them itself.  One 
of the beneficial aspects of the use of incentives, of course, is that it allows for diversity 
of practice (i.e., for a shared goal to be accomplished in whatever way makes the most 
sense in a given set of circumstances) and encourages innovation (i.e., for people to 
invent new better ways of getting things done).
<p>
To Osbornes basic point, I would only add the following:  In a world of inverse 
economies of scale, where big is generally less efficient than small, a system based on 
incentives places the responsibility for actually doing things on individuals and small 
groups -- i.e. on those who can do it most efficiently.  From public assistance to 
retirement income, transferring operational responsibility from large bureaucracies to 
individuals and small groups must be a major principle of replacement.
<p>
<i>The fourth principle of replacement is to replace government activities with 
government incentives and get the government out of the "doing" business.</i>
<p>
<h3>Personalizing Government</h3>
<p>
My fifth and final suggestion is also borrowed, from the Honorable Preston 
Manning, leader of Canadas Reform Party.  In a recent meeting, Mr. Manning drew the 
distinction between privatizing and personalizing government programs.
<p>
Privatization has been applied in many areas of the Federal government, but with 
mixed results.  NASA, I would argue, is a case of massive privatization that has failed 
quite miserably.  Why?  Because privatization took the form of contracting out functions 
performed by large, inefficient government bureaucracies and turning them over to large, 
inefficient private bureaucracies.  It is worth remembering, in this context, that the same 
system of top-down centralized decisionmaking that was adopted by the Federal 
government was also the model, for at least 50 years, for private business.  And private 
businesses that have not yet made the transformation are not necessarily any more 
efficient than their bureaucratic government cousins.
<p>
<i>The fifth and final principle is that replacement should focus on moving from 
large, bureaucratic, inefficient systems to small, decentralized, efficient ones.</i>
<p>
<h3>Proper Tasks for Government</h3>
<p>
At this point, let me return briefly to the question of the appropriate role for the 
Federal government, and to my perhaps controversial assertion above that "in many or 
even most areas of current Federal activity, there is some legitimate Federal role."  
Libertarians may balk at this statement -- but only, I believe,  because they define more 
narrowly than I do the words "Federal role."  A "Federal role" does not necessarily mean 
hiring civil servants to hand out money, or empowering regulators to micromanage 
businesses.  Indeed, the grand dame of Libertarian thought, none less than Ayn Rand, 
wrote in 1964 that:
<p>
"It is the proper task of government to protect individual rights and, as part of it, 
formulate the laws by which these rights are to be implemented and adjudicated.  
It is the governments responsibility to define the application of individual rights 
to a given sphere of activity -- to define (i.e., to identify), not create, invent, 
donate or expropriate. . . . In most cases, the American government has been 
guided by the proper principle:  It sought to protect all the individual rights 
involved, not to abrogate them."
<p>
This one paragraph explains a great deal of what the Federal government does 
today.  From the air to the airwaves (the topic Rand was addressing in the article just 
quoted), from mortgage markets to shareholders rights, the Federal government has an 
essential role to play in defining who owns what, what constitutes trespass or tort, and 
how transgressions and "thefts" are to be adjudicated.  As I have suggested above, I 
believe it fulfills this role very poorly.  But it is an appropriate role.
<p>
A second area where government would appear to have a role is as an agent for its 
citizens in accomplishing shared goals and imposing common obligations.  A simple 
example will do:  Americans have decided that they do not wish to be confronted with the 
moral dilemma of elderly people who chose not to save for their retirement.  Thus, we 
have collectively decided to impose on each working citizen a requirement to put aside 
money for their retirement.  Leaving aside, for a moment, the question of whether the 
current Social Security system is a wise way of acting on that decision, the decision itself 
is surely a legitimate one in a democratic system.
<p>
<h3>Opportunity and Danger</h3>
<p>
The fundamental transformation now underway in every aspect of our lives will, 
sooner or later, transform the Federal government as well.  The last great redoubt of 
Second Wave bureaucratic power on the planet, despite having just recently been the 
most successful institution, arguably, in human history, cannot forever withstand the 
forces now at work.  Within a decade, it will be much smaller, much less bureaucratic, 
much less intrusive in the lives of its citizens.  To ignore these facts is to ignore every bit 
of evidence about what is happening around us every day, everywhere.
<p>
The only question is how the transformation will occur.  
<p>
The Chinese have an interesting approach to change, implicit in their written 
language.  The Chinese character for change, it turns out, is actually a combination of two 
figures:  The figure for danger, and the figure for opportunity.
<p>
We live in a time of great change -- of great danger and of great opportunity.  If 
we recognize what is happening and move quickly to capitalize upon it, we can create a 
Federal government that once again contributes mightily to Americas progress and is 
again a source of pride for its citizens.

<title>21st Century Medicine -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h2>21st Century Medicine</h2>
<p>
By Newt Gingrich
<p>
<br>
Many Americans will be surprised by the following assertion: During the 21st century 
health care will become dramatically less expensive, not more expensive.  If we are aggressive 
enough in pursuing the opportunities that lay before us, there well may be a 20 percent drop in the 
cost of health care in the first decade of the next century.
<p>
Driving this are five explosive changes that are occurring simultaneously. First is the rise 
of molecular medicine which will lead to cures for diseases at the genetic level. Second, increased 
computational power provides us with the capacity to create virtual reality that allows doctors to 
test therapies very early. Third, distance electronics, such as a worldwide satellite system, will 
allow experts in one part of the globe to guide therapy in real time in another part of the world.
<p>
Fourth is the rise of expert systems, meaning very specific and accurate diagnostic 
abilities. For example,  HealthSouth has a new machine that tests for carpal tunnel syndrome and 
can tell you before you get it whether or not you are developing symptoms, so your employer can 
pull you off the line and retrain you before you actually become a workmans compensation case.
<p>
While this means enormous financial savings, there is a deeper meaning.  This particular 
machine is an expert system, designed by one of the two or three leading experts in carpal tunnel 
syndrome.  It actually is more accurate than a normal doctor, because a normal doctor does not deal 
with carpal tunnel syndrome.  You must have a fairly noticeable case before a normal doctor can 
find it while the machine finds it very early.
<p>
Yet even more fascinating is that no one runs the machine.  There is no fee.  You dont 
pay a technician.  You dont pay a nurse.  You dont pay the doctor.  All you do is turn the machine 
on.  That is why there will be a 20 percent crash in the cost of health care in the first decade of the 
21st century.
<p>
The final change that will contribute to lower costs is the rise of customer driven health 
care markets. For example, my mother-in-law at 80 years of age checks her own blood count every 
day -- her own blood sugar -- and then varies her insulin based on what she teaches herself, based in 
her home laboratory.
<p>
Soon we may have more complete home diagnostic systems that, at very low cost, allow 
you to get up in the morning and if you dont feel well you test yourself. You may then 
electronically send the data to your doctor, who looks at it and either says, "Stay in bed and eat 
chicken soup;"  "Go buy the following three things;"  or, "Come see me.  This might be serious."
<p>
This is a totally different model of care, based not on doctors or hospitals, but the 
consumer.  Its not an improved version of the dying world.  It is the new world.
<p>
These five changes will drive a revolution for a healthier America. Yet at the same time 
they present great opportunities for America in the world marketplace.
<p>
We ought to see these advances as the greatest job opportunity of the 21st century, and say 
to everybody on the planet, "Show up here, give us your money, well provide you health care, and 
then you get to sell us whatever it is you think you can manufacture." Maybe health ought to be 
moved out of the Department of Health and Human Services and into the Department of 
Commerce.  Health care will be a major source of foreign exchange earnings for the United States.
<p>
<h3>Stumbling Blocks</h3>
<p>
Yet to get there we must address several problems.  One is our anti-capital accumulation 
tax code. The tax code punishes people who leave companies and set up their own business.  It is 
not designed to deal with a rapid rate of innovation.
<p>
Another problem is that our litigation law is anti-entrepreneurial.  High tech corporate 
CEOs complain that if only the resources devoted to litigation expenses could be retasked to 
productive efforts, they would produce much in job creation.  But as it now stands, entrepreneurs 
face potentially enormous liability damages that inhibit investment in innovative technology.
<p>
A third problem is the Food and Drug Administration.  Theres a brand new report out that 
says in just the manufacture of health tools, the FDA will probably cost America 50,000 jobs in the 
next five years.
<p>
For instance, we currently have a law that says to medical manufacturers, if Germany 
approves a device, but the FDA doesnt approve of it for sale in the United States, you can only 
manufacture it if you build a factory outside the United States. This has got to be the dumbest 
single law on killing jobs we have. It needs to be repealed and if any sophisticated country in the 
world approves a particular product, you should be able to make it in the United States for export 
purposes.
<p>
We also need to rethink the structure of research and development. We should set a lot 
more goals.  The person who comes in with the first breakthrough in a certain area, give them a big 
reward, which was a terrific model to spur innovation up through the 1930s.
<p>
People tend to forget that most aviation progress in the 1920s and 30s was made in 
response to people who flew in order to win prizes.  It was not made by large, cumbersome, slow 
government bureaucracies, typically doing what they think is risk averse.
<p>
We should rethink our approaches in R&D and to find more aggressive ways to be more 
risk taking, and to focus on lowering the costs.  Under what circumstances can we empower the 
customer, lower the cost and use these breakthroughs to create dramatically better health care and 
better knowledge about health at lower cost.
<p>
For example, Medicare is actually slowing down the rate of innovation by refusing to pay 
for experimental tests.  I mean this is dumbest possible position if you are at the edge of a 
revolution in health care.  It is like saying, "Please dont let us get there, it will lower the cost of 
everything."
<p>
I believe that if we would of had a Food and Drug Administration of the modern kind and 
a Medicare system of the modern kind, X-rays today would be as scarce as cat-scans, and no dentist 
in America would have one, because you can not make an argument that checking your teeth is a 
medical necessity.
<p>
Instead, because it was done in the free market and nobody figured out how to get the 
government to stop it, we think of x-rays as ubiquitous and routine. Thats a modest example of 
how much this current government raises the cost of health care, allows Americans to die 
unnecessarily, prolongs illness, and kills American jobs, all simultaneously.  A remarkable 
achievement, not matching that of the Soviet empire, but certainly in the same general zone.
<p>
I dont say that as hyperbole. With the rise of expert systems, long distance electronics and 
computational power, there is no reason we cant have a revolution in learning, in law and in health 
that will be truly dramatic.

<title>The Importance of Being Father -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>The Importance of Being Father</h2>
<p>
By Wade F. Horn
</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Despite conventional wisdom, which has held -- and in many quarters still does -- that children do not pay a price when fathers are absent from their lives, research data depict a much different reality.  Violent criminals are overwhelmingly males who grew up without fathers, including 60 percent of America's rapists, 72 percent of adolescent murderers and 70 percent of long term prison inmates.  Children living in a father-absent home are also more likely to be suspended or expelled from school, or to drop out; require treatment for an emotional or behavioral problem; commit suicide as adolescents; and be victims of child abuse or neglect.
<p>
Why are fathers so important for the well-being of children?  The answer is embedded in the larger question of why families are important.  The family's importance is nothing short of ensuring the continuity of civilization.  The family does this in two ways:  first, by propagating the species, and second, by socializing children.
<p>
Proper socialization requires the development of self-control in order to follow the rules of society.  Well-socialized children have learned not to strike out at others to get what they want; under-socialized children often have not.  Well-socialized children have learned to listen to and obey the directions of legitimate authority figures, such as parents and teachers; under-socialized children often have not.  Well-socialized children have learned to cooperate and share with others; under-socialized children many times have not.  In short, well-socialized children have developed the ability to self-regulate impulse gratification; under-socialized children often have not.
<p>
A civil society is totally dependent upon most of its adult citizenry having developed self-control.  Absent a significant majority of such well-socialized adults, storekeepers would have to post armed guards in front of every display counter; every woman would live in constant fear of being raped by roaming bands of marauding men; and, children would be largely left to fend for themselves or be exploited for the gratification of their parents.
<p>
Parents socialize children through two mechanisms.  Most obviously, children learn through direct tuition reinforced by a combination of rewards and punishments for acceptable and unacceptable behavior.  Children are first told how they should behave and then reinforced for following the rules and punished for disobedience to the rules.  But children also learn by observing others.  Of the two processes, observing others is by far the more important.  In fact, most complex human behavior is acquired not through direct instruction, but through observational learning.  Children are much more likely to do as a parent does than what the parent says.  This is why parents who lie and cheat invariably have children who lie and cheat, despite any direct instruction to the contrary.
<p>
The socialization of children simply does not get done as well when fathers are absent from the home.  When fathers are absent, boys often develop conduct problems -- they act out aggressively and sometimes quite violently toward others.  Girls also act out when fathers are absent, but in a different way -- they often become sexually promiscuous.  In short, the presence of involved fathers is absolutely critical if we are to successfully socialize children.
<p>
There appear to be at least three reasons for this.  First, mothers and fathers tend to parent different.  Beginning at the birth of a child, mothers tend to be more verbal with their children, whereas fathers are more physical.  Mothers also tend to encourage caution, whereas father are more challenging of achievement and independence.  But most importantly, mothers tend to be more powerful nurturant figures and fathers stronger disciplinarians.  Why should this difference in parenting style make such a difference for children?
<p>
We used to believe that families socialize children best when parents demonstrate high levels of love and relatively low levels of control.  Research has shown, however, that when children are reared with high levels of warmth and low levels of control there are very predictable results -- they act-out, both aggressively and sexually.  In contrast to these 1960's ideas of how to parent children, research has consistently shown that families socialize children best when they use a combination of nurturance and control.
<p>
Given that mothers tend toward nurturance and fathers toward control, children reared in single mother households are likely to experience high levels of warmth, but low control.  Conversely, children reared in single father households are likely to be exposed to lower levels of warmth and higher control.  Either way, socialization does not go as well compared to when children experience both high warmth and moderately high control.
<p>
The point here is not to denigrate the parenting style of either mothers or fathers.  But contrary to the claims of some, gender differences in parental behavior do not need to be minimized for parents to raise well-adjusted and well-socialized children.  Indeed, what children need to grow up to become well-adjusted adults is the combination of parenting styles that mothers and fathers provide.
<p>
The second reason why fathers are so critical in the socialization of children is that children -- and boys in particular -- learn to keep their aggressive impulses in check through the observation of a male figure in the home who consistently and regularly controls himself.  It is through a boy's observation of the way his father deals with frustration, anger and sadness that boys learn how men cope with such emotions.  It is also through a boy's observation of the way his father treats the boy's mother that he learns how to treat women. If the father treats the mother with respect and dignity, than it is likely that his son will grow up to treat women with dignity and respect.  If the father treats the mother with disdain and cruelty, then -- unfortunately -- his son is likely to grow up to do the same.
<p>
Finally, for girls, fathers are critical for learning mastery of their sexuality.  Indeed, one of the predictable results of father absence for girls is early and promiscuous sexual activity.  In contrast, if a girl experiences the love of a father who places her well-being above his own and who acts as a natural protector, than the girl is likely to delay sexual relations until she finds such a man herself.  If she is denied such fatherly love, then the girl is likely to try to seek it elsewhere -- often inappropriately and often at very young ages.
<p>
Given this understanding of what happens in individual families when fathers are absent due to divorce or abandonment, what should we expect as a society when father absence becomes, not the exception, but the norm?  Answer: increasing violence and increasing sexual acting-out.  That is precisely what we are seeing.
<p>
Children are the fastest growing segment of the criminal population in the United States.  Between 1982 and 1991, the rate juveniles were arrested for murder increased 93 percent, for aggravated assault 72 percent, for forcible rape 24 percent and for car theft 97 percent.  And although homicide rates have increased for all ages, those for teenagers have increased more rapidly than those of adults.
<p>
We also know that each and every day:
<p><ul>
<li>7,700 teenagers become sexually active;
<li>1,100 teenagers have abortions;
<li>600 teenagers get syphilis or gonorrhea;
<li>2,500 children are born out of wedlock; and
<li>6 teenagers commit suicide.
</ul>
<p>
Father absence may not be the sole cause of each of these social ills -- but it certainly makes each one worse. Americans need to remember the important work that fathers do in helping to rear children successfully.  We must resolve to restore the institution of good and responsible fatherhood in America.  The well-being of our children -- and ultimately our nation -- depends upon us rediscovering the importance of being father.

<h2>Click Here for Jobs: <br>
Information as a Substitute for Welfare?</h2>
By Tracy Westen
</center>
<p>
<p>

You're in trouble.<p>

You're 23, you had your first child at 15, you dropped out of school in 8th grade and you've been collecting welfare checks on and off ever since.  You've tried a few jobs, but they didn't last.  Your skills are minimal, you don't have a high school diploma, you don't have a good job history.  <p>

And, frankly, you're scared -- scared to ask for a job from people you don't know, scared to be rejected by employers who might look down on you, scared to leave your neighborhood to look for work in unfamiliar places, scared that you might get a job you can't handle, scared that co-workers might ridicule you for not knowing simple things, for not wearing the right clothes, for . . .  almost anything.  <p>

What can you do?<p>

It's 1995, and you're options are limited.  Either you swallow your fear and look for work.  Or you sit at home and wait for your monthly welfare check.  Sometimes sitting and waiting for that check is easier.<p>

<h3>Jobs On-Line</h3>

Now fast forward to 1999.  <p>

The "information superhighway" is well under construction.  You tap the screen of an Info Kiosk at your post office or super-market, or you pick up the "mouse" of an on-line computer, or you grab the remote control to your TV and:<p>

<i>Click:</i>  You pick the "jobs" icon and see of a list of available jobs.  GTE is looking for a "customer service representative."  What is a "customer service representative"?  Does it take a high school diploma? <p>

<i>Click:</i> You see a short video.  A young woman, who looks a little like you, says, "Hi, I applied for this job 6 months ago.  I wasn't sure I could handle it, but it's really OK.  A 'customer service representative' or 'CSR' is someone who answers the phone and helps the company's customers with their service problems.  Now let me show you where I work, let me introduce you to my co-workers, and let me bring over my boss."  <p>

This doesn't seem too bad.  You've always been good on the phone, you like to help people, and this job doesn't take a lot of writing.  But what does it pay, how far away is it, do they have day care for your kids, and what are the people there really like -- friendly or rude?<p>

<i>Click:</i> The "salary" icon says you'll start at $9.50 an hour, will get a raise to $14.00 an hour in 6 months and will work from 4 to 11 p.m.  <i>Click:</i> The "benefits" icon says they have day care.  <i>Click:</i> The "co-workers" icon lets you see videos of some of the other CSRs who work there (they look OK, maybe even nice). <i>Click:</i> You watch a sample interview.  You might do OK, it doesn't look too fancy, your clothes seem to be acceptable for this job. <i>Click:</i> You examine a bus route to GTE's offices -- it looks pretty convenient. <i>Click:</i> A voice comes on the line and asks if you would like a job interview tomorrow?  You hesitate, then, "Sure, I'll be there at 11:00 a.m."    <p>

And a few years later, who knows, perhaps the job interview will be conducted by desk top video conferencing.  Instead of arranging an appointment, a GTE employee's picture appears in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  "Hi," he says, are you interested in being a customer service representative?  Let me tell you about the job."  You see a picture of yourself at the upper right hand corner of the screen.  You talk for a few minutes, he likes what you say, you've got the job.  You start next week. <p>

Fanciful?  Not at all.  The technology to make this scenario a reality is being designed and put in place today.  Interactive multimedia, video on demand, two-way desk top video conferencing -- all these are now being planned, and even installed in their earliest stages, for video games, home shopping, movies on demand, even lotteries. <p>

But will these technologies be available to help us solve our social problems?  Consider other plausible scenarios.<p>

<h3>Health Care</h3>

You're 17 and pregnant.  You go to the nearest terminal and choose the "Healthy Babies" icon.<p>

<i>Click:</i> You see a list of choices -- What You Should Eat, Alcohol Advice, Drug Dangers, Cigarette Warnings , Exercise Options, Vitamins, Where to Get Free Medical Care, Regular and Emergency Room Services, AIDS Prevention, Family Planning, Caring for Your Child in the First Six Months.<p>

<i>Click:</i>   A video appears of another 17-year-old pregnant woman.  She says,  "I got pregnant when I was 16, but I found this local clinic, and they helped me have a healthy baby (scenes of the clinic are shown on the video).  If you want to see the most important things I learned to help take care of myself and my child, then click the buttons below."  A menu appears.  <i>Click</i>  "Alcohol" and you learn about fetal alcohol syndrome.   <i>Click</i> "Vitamins" and you learn about calcium and bone development. <i>Click</i> "Neighbors" and you see the pictures of other pregnant women, neighbors in  your area who have agreed to chat with you by video conference -- to share what they've learned, to get together and support each other, just to talk.   <i>Click </i>one of the "Neighbors" pictures, and you find yourself talking on a video screen with someone a lot like you -- about babies, diet, friends, where to get support.<p>

<h3>Politics</h3>

You're a father, and your kids have to walk to school past drug dealers transacting business in the open.  You're scared for their safety, and scared they'll be attracted to drugs.  The cops are never there, or they never do anything about the drug dealers. You pick up the remote control to the TV set.<p>

<i>Click:</i> You select "Drug Prevention Hotline" under Local Government.  You report the location of the drug transactions to the police. <i>Click:</i> The screen tells you the name of your City Council Member, and you dial his office.  Why isn't he doing anything about your child's safety?  When is he up for reelection?  <i>Click:</i> You check the videotaped statement by his opponent in the upcoming election on drug prevention.  His opponent is calling for more police on the streets.  Would that work?  You think it might.<p>

<i>Click:</i> You review TV, radio and newspaper stories on the drug problem. You learn that other communities are having similar problems, but they're organizing and putting pressure on their city councils to get action. <i>Click:</i> You check the video bulletin boards under "drugs" and find out other neighbors are complaining about drug sales on the streets, too.  <i>Click:</i> You discover there's a local organizing meeting on drugs, and you attend.  <i>Click:</i> Your group asks you to testify by video conference from your home, before a City Council hearing, and you explain the dangers of drug deals in your neighborhood.  You even show a homemade videotape of drug dealers making sales --and the video is seen by the City Council and everyone else watching in your community.<p>

<h3>Communications Technology and Social Reform</h3>

Consider the implications of these scenarios:  A welfare recipient is motivated to find a job, using on-line information to overcome her fear at reaching out and trying something new.  A pregnant teen-ager finds medical and psychological support from doctors and neighbors, helping her to have a healthy baby.  A father helps organize his community to fight drugs in his neighborhood. <p>

Are these scenarios simplistic?  In part, yes.  It may take more than information to help people find jobs in communities where jobs do not exist.  Some drug abusers may be too far gone to help themselves and may need more direct forms of intervention.  Community organizing is not always easy -- neighbors are sometimes fearful, sometimes apathetic.<p>

But these scenarios also have considerable power and truth as well.  And they all share an important link -- that access to modern communications technologies can help some individuals help themselves.   The need for direct welfare payments is lessened.  Health care is improved.  Citizens are empowered to help themselves. And the government saves money by investing in communications infrastructure.  <p>

We do not know, of course, what percentage of welfare recipients would improve their levels of employment, health, education and political participation if given access to easy, inexpensive, modern communications technologies. But what is important is that we find out.  We have before us the opportunity to undertake one of the most dramatic social experiments in generations: to discover whether, and to what extent, information can begin to substitute for direct welfare grants.<p>

The need for such experimentation is compelling.  Without it, we risk exacerbating the plight of the "information underclass,"  many of whom already lack even the most basic element of modern information technology, the telephone.  <p>

Seven percent of American households are still without telephone service, most of that 7 percent accounted for by low income-minorities.  In some low-income communities telephone penetration is 66.4 percent.  And as the sophistication of technology increases, so does the information gap.  The United States Census found that only 15 percent of families earning an annual income of $20,000 or less had a computer at home compared to 74 percent of households with incomes of $75,000 or more. <p>

It is critical that we use technological advances to empower citizens, instead of allowing it to drive deeper wedges between social and economic groups and  further entrench the cycles of poverty.  Rampant poverty among our citizens is among the most pressing social problems our nation faces.  In the home of the United States Capitol, the District of Columbia, nearly a third of its 600,000 residents are on some form of public assistance, and the number of jobs available has dropped by 70,000 over the last three years.  Such devastation is not without its consequences. The facts are chilling:  Washington, D.C., jails more young black men every year than it graduates from high school. Whatever our politics, we can ill afford to ignore their plight.  Rapidly growing numbers of citizens requiring public assistance is a devastating drain on our collective financial, social and cultural resources.<p>

Providing homeless people with voice mail accounts is an example of how information technology can allow people to help themselves.  Giving the homeless access to a phone number with their own voice message attached gives them a home base to communicate with potential employers or landlords, as well as friends and family.  Such a program is run by Central Neighborhood house, a Toronto community agency.  After five months of participation, 30 people were surveyed about voice mail's effects: of the 30, five were able to find jobs and five to find housing.  Several others were awaiting job interviews and making housing arrangements.  <p>

In Los Angeles, an experiment is underway which will test the usefulness of home delivery of pertinent information to inner city residents. Connect LA, a project of the non-profit Center for Governmental Studies, in planned partnership with local government, community organizations and industry groups, will construct and operate an experimental new interactive network of video, voice and textual information to selected low income homes and schools in Los Angeles.  The project will determine whether, and to what extent, communities will benefit from on-demand multimedia information regarding employment, health care, education, political participation and cultural affairs. <p>

Connect LA will be carefully monitored and analyzed to determine whether access to such information and services is instrumental in helping families raise their levels of income, health and education; improve overall community economic conditions; and, spur more active community participation and pride.  Favorable results might encourage us to make interactive multimedia technologies available more widely and illustrate the value in overcoming the problems of the "information poor" as we enter the coming century.<p>

We must aggressively support this wave of experimentation and create an environment in which creativity will flourish.  Partnerships among public, private, and non-profit entities can produce a wide array of prototypes: social laboratories in which to conduct experiments in improved communication.  Encouraging the proliferation of such prototypes will allow the greatest variety of information, services, training and incentives to be provided, therefore alerting decision makers to which combinations work best for specific populations.  <p>

To be sure, there will still be instances in which people will need money, temporary housing or substance abuse treatment.  But now it seems in our power to give the others something of more enduring value:  the power to improve their own circumstances.  This kind of assistance can change lives and benefit society as a whole.<p>

It is time for government to realize what the business and non-profit world have already acknowledged:  that there is a world of advantage, both financial and social, to be gained from encouraging developments in communications.  We all have an enormous stake in getting people off welfare, beyond saving tax dollars.  More significantly, information technology can help renew our political culture and empower citizens to help themselves. <p>

 Providing the information poor with access to the technological vocabulary necessary to participate in the new information economies makes good sense, as it makes for visionary public policy.  But in the fulfillment of this potential, we must be more than sensible.  We must be aggressive, creative and explosive.  We must roar into the next century with a ferocious commitment to innovation, equality and democracy which befits the unprecedented opportunity which has been presented us.<p>

<h2>Treating Illness Before it Occurs, and Other Marvels of Modern Medicine</h2>
<p>
By William Haseltine
<p>
</center>
<p>
Health, our own health and the health of those we love is a fundamental concern both to us 
as individuals and as a nation.  Health is an issue which unites all of us. That is why it is important 
that we understand the revolution in medical science now occurring.
<p>
Historically, the practice of medicine has been the application of external entities, devices, 
or plants and mineral extracts to our bodies.  Probably the earliest medical intervention was the 
splint -- clearly an extrinsic device to help speed repair of our body.
<p>
Very likely, as far as we can tell by examination of a number of societies around the 
world, the next type of medicine, and in fact the predominant form of medicine until the early part 
of our own century, was the use of plant extracts, other natural substances and minerals taken from 
the earth as medicines.  These too are clearly extrinsic.
<p>
This century has brought a change with which we are all familiar, those little white pills 
that probably some of you took this morning.  Most of those are synthetic chemicals.  It was the 
great flowering of synthetic organic chemistry in the last part of the previous century and the early 
part of this century that gave rise to the great pharmacopeia which treats many of our ills.  But 
again, those are extrinsic to our bodies.
<p>
<h3>The Genetic Revolution</h3>
<p>
The revolution which has occurred in biomedicine since the early 1950s has given us a 
much deeper understanding of our human body in terms of its microscopic components -- the genes 
and proteins. That understanding has begun to transform the fundamental nature of medicine.
<p>
For example, the body makes a variety of hormones. Many of the hormones are proteins 
that control very fundamental processes, such as how we grow as a child or how fast we replace 
injured or damaged tissues. Each hormone, as indeed each protein, each sub-microscopic 
component in our body, is made by a gene.  A gene can be thought of as an instruction to make a 
protein.  One gene makes one protein.
<p>
What fueled the initial biotechnology revolution was a very simple technology, the ability 
to take a single gene and make in a fermenter, sort of a big pot, as much of any particular human 
protein as you wanted.  It was that simple revolution that changed the face of biotechnology.
<p>
One of the early products from this research is the human growth hormone.  The gene was 
isolated, a lot of proteins made, and that purified human protein is now used to treat dwarfism. 
Another gene that was isolated was the gene that promotes blood clotting, the precise product that 
is missing in hemophiliacs.  Rather than using blood transfusions and concentrate on the blood, we 
now use this purified protein to treat hemophilia.
<p>
Similarly, humans make proteins that are involved in dissolving clots.  That protein is now 
used to treat people with heart attacks, when clots develop in the blood vessels of the heart. Purified 
human insulin is now made from the human insulin gene and used to treat diabetes.  Purified 
human hormones that control either how fast red or white blood cells grow are used in cancer 
therapy to great effect.
<p>
All these are natural products that are used today to treat serious illness.  Incidently, these 
handful of products that I just described account for about $8 billion of sales worldwide and have 
created more than 15,000 jobs in the pharmaceutical industry in the United States alone. These are 
just a few indications of what is to come. We can predict that there will be a torrent of products in 
the future.
<p>
<h3>A New Paradigm for Medicine</h3>
<p>
The new medicine is based not on extrinsic entities, splints, natural products from plants 
and the earth, or synthetic chemicals, but our own genes and our proteins.  It is a move from an 
extrinsic treatment to an intrinsic use of those substances which we naturally use to cure ourselves.
<p>
Not only are the proteins themselves used as the new basis of the new medicine, but the 
gene, that description, that piece of information used to program a cell to make a protein, is also 
becoming a medicine.
<p>
The change that is now in progress is more profound than the substitution of one kind of 
pill for another.  The change from extrinsic to intrinsic medicine will trigger a qualitative shift in 
the medical paradigm and will have a profound impact both on the type of medicine that is 
practiced and on our health care system as a whole.
<p>
Today much of medicine is based on the following practice: diagnosis of disease after it 
has occurred, followed by treatment to alleviate the symptoms without necessarily curing the 
underlying cause of those symptoms.  Diagnosis of disease followed by non-curative treatments is 
the rule for diseases such as arthritis, high blood pressure, heart disease, Alzheimers, many cancers, 
as well as most other chronic ills.
<p>
This medical paradigm is now changing.  We are now entering an era when disease will 
be predicted before it occurs.  Genetic text will be read to predict predisposition to disease.  That 
prediction will not always be bootless, as I illustrated with the case of colon, ovarian, and uterine 
cancer.  Nevertheless, there are remedies that can be based on that prediction.
<p>
Abnormal genes and proteins will be used to detect other diseases at a very early stage 
before illness occurs.  Prediction and early detection will permit avoidance of high risk activity 
through careful management, education, and treatment.  Changes in lifestyle, diet, exercise, will be 
designed to avoid many diseases before they occur.
<p>
The use of human genes and proteins offers another opportunity when coupled with 
disease prediction.  Healthy genes will be used to replace missing or damaged genes before disease 
occurs.  Replacement of genes can be used then to avoid the illness.  Naturally occurring proteins 
can also be used to replace missing and damaged proteins.
<p>
Finally, medicine will begin to move into an era of cure, forever altering the underlying 
cause of a disease through gene replacement.  The medical paradigm will shift from detection of 
disease, to prediction of disease before it occurs, management to reduce risk, prevention of the 
disease, and when necessary, cure.

<title>CPS:  The Key to Effective Compassion -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>CPS:  The Key to Effective Compassion</h2>
<p>
By Marvin Olasky
</center>
<p>
<p>
Many Americans know the meaning of the letters CPR.  They know that when a heart has 
stopped beating, cardiopulmonary resuscitation can restore normal breathing.  Dictionary 
definitions of the term list its three elements: heart massage by the exertion of pressure, clearance 
of air passages to the lungs, and the use of appropriate medications, when available.
<p>
Many Americans also know that the heart of our country's compassion toward the poor is 
ailing.  Citizens tired of increased governmental welfare spending are demanding cutbacks.  
Tales of extravagant spending by the former head of the United Way increased cynicism about 
philanthropic management.   Average household contributions to social welfare charities are 
dropping.
<p>
We know that emergency treatment to resuscitate charity is needed, but we have not 
received training in how to render effective compassion.  For too long we have been told to prove 
our sincerity by writing checks or passing legislation, without too much thought about 
consequences.  Yet, when it comes to changing lives, it's not just the thought that counts.  When 
people see that money is wasted, the springs of charity dry up and more lives are destroyed.
<p>
The good news is that we know how to do better, if we stop relying on either 
governmental or philanthropic bureaucracies to do the work for us.  In the 1890s, volunteers in 
New York (United Hebrew Charities), New Orleans (Charity Organizing Society), and hundreds 
of new neighborhoods helped millions of Americans to escape poverty.   In the 1990s, human-
scale charities throughout the United States -- from Clean and Sober Streets in Washington, D.C. 
to CityTeam in San Jose, California -- are having similar success.
<p>
Past and present show that there are three keys to effective compassion: It should be 
<b>challenging</b>, it should be <b>personal</b>, it should be <b>spiritual</b> -- CPS for short.  (Those three letters 
also begin the three syllables of the word "com-pas-sion.")  Just as CPR can save individual 
lives, so CPS training can help Americans to be discerning in their commitment of time and 
money. 
<p>
<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>
Think of the first element of CPR: Heart massage by the exertion of pressure.  A person 
using CPR does not press down faintly on the chest of a person close to death.  The first element 
in CPS is <b>challenge</b>, and it is important here also that the push be hard.
<p>
A century ago homeless shelters were not enablers that maintained alcoholics and addicts 
in their lifestyles and asked little or nothing of them.  When an able-bodied man came to a 
homeless shelter, he often was asked to chop wood for two hours in return for food and shelter; 
in that way he could provide part of his own support and also help those unable to chop wood.   
Women typically would do their part in sewing rooms.
<p>
Those who worked hard through this initial challenge would be helped to find jobs.  
Those who could work but refused to were not entitled to aid.  The work test, along with teaching 
good habits and keeping away those who did not really need help, also enabled charities to teach 
the lesson that those who were being helped could help others.
<p>
Today,  we need to stop talking about "the poor" in abstraction and start distinguishing 
once again between those willing to struggle and those just looking for an enabler: Entry-level 
jobs are available in every major American city, and employees who prove their reliability do not 
stay at the entryway for long. Americans should support programs that emphasize work, not 
make-work or excuses.
<p>
Alcoholics, addicts, and drifters must be challenged to change their lifestyles. Americans 
should support programs that emphasize challenge, not handouts that perpetuate self-destructive 
behavior.  
<p>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>
Consider the second element of CPR: Clearance of air passages to the lungs. An intense 
image may come to mind: The volunteer performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, occasionally 
stopping for a second to half-mutter, half-pray, "Breathe... Breathe."
<p>
Effective compassion needs a level of personal involvement almost as great.   The second 
letter of CPS stands for <b>personal</b>:  In many poverty-fighting situations lives  and values also 
have to be resuscitated, and people learn more from an individual they respect (and perhaps love) 
than from a textbook.
<p>
A century ago, charity volunteers usually were not  assigned to massive food-dispensing 
tasks, but were given the narrow but deep responsibility of making a difference in one life over 
several years.   A typical magazine story revealed how one "demoralized" woman was helped: 
"for months she was worked with, now through kindness, again through discipline, until finally 
she began to show a desire to help herself."  For months: Breathe! Breathe!
<p>
Today, we cannot buy the level of personal involvement that is needed to be next to an 
addict as he is going through withdrawal pains, or next to an unmarried, pregnant teenager who is 
going through the pain of abandonment by a boyfriend amidst crisis.  The costs of placing 
professionals in each of those situations would bankrupt governments.
<p>
But at anti-addiction organizations that banish bureaucracy, a person who has recently 
gone through detox himself, and wants to help one other person do the same, is by an addict's 
bedside.  In programs run by crisis pregnancy centers around the country, a married couple with 
compassion for a pregnant teenager is giving her a room in their home and a place at their dinner 
table. Successful experiences like that suggest some other strategies to adopt: Mentoring and 
tutoring projects that bond volunteers and the needy work best.   Americans should support 
programs that emphasize one-to-one approaches. 
<p>
Bonds that already exist, even if torn, should not be overlooked.  Americans should 
support programs that attempt to reunite aid-seekers with families and  friends.  As history shows 
and Psalm 66 states, "God sets the lonely in families." 
<p>
<h3>Spiritual</h3>
<p>
The third element of CPR is use of appropriate medications.  The idea is to take what is 
of proven effectiveness and apply it immediately.  No one doing CPR goes to a medicine cabinet 
and tries whatever the snake-oil salesman of the week has peddled.
<p>
The third letter in CPS stands for <b>spiritual</b>, and there's a strong reason for that:  "True 
philanthropy must take into account spiritual as well as physical needs," poverty-fighters a 
century ago noted, and the same is true today.  Successful anti-poverty work, past and present, 
has given the poor self-esteem not by offering easy, feel-good praise, but by reminding them that 
a wonderful God made them in his image and has a purpose for their lives.
<p>
The federal War on Poverty in the 1960s, however, was a trip to the medicine cabinet.  
Religious teaching, instead of being embraced by bureaucrats at least as a way of helping 
roaming individuals to think about their purpose in life, was excluded by judicial decree and 
administrative design.  Instead, a variety of experimental social programs came in, none of which 
touched the pessimistic core values of the welfare mentality.
<p>
 Anti-drug programs without a spiritual base, for example, have success rates in the single 
digits.  Such programs contrast with those that provide religious medication and do not merely 
cover up wounds.  Victory Fellowship is one example:  Freddie Garcia through God's grace beat 
heroin addiction; he then opened a combination church and half-way house in San Antonio; the 
program now has spread to 60 churches in Texas and New Mexico, with a 60% success rate in 
beating addiction, yet the Texas Drug and Alcohol Commission asked Reverend Garcia to stop 
referring to his ministry as "drug rehabilitation" because it did not conform to the usual 
standards.
<p>
In a pluralistic society, of course, there are many different beliefs, but that is not a 
problem as long as all have equal opportunity to develop and fund programs. Let's let  Christians, 
Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, and others compete in doing good, and over time we will see who is 
the most successful -- and if atheistic groups develop programs, let them try also.
<p>
If we focus not on weaknesses but on strengths,  the heart of American compassion can 
be saved.  The government of Washington, D.C., has a financial crisis, but volunteer-based 
programs that are enormously effective cost very little: My favorites so far are Clean and Sober 
Streets, where ex-alcoholics and ex-addicts help those still in captivity; the Gospel Mission, 
which fights homelessness by offering true hope; the Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center, 
where teenage moms and their children, born and unborn, are cared for; and Children of Mine, an 
after-school program in one of the city's poorest sections, Anacostia, run by a mature, crusty 
woman, Hannah Hawkins.
<p>
Other groups are making a difference all across the country:  One of my favorite Texans 
is Kathy Dudley, a young woman who began Voice of Hope in Dallas by walking down an inner 
city street with a soccer ball under her arm and inviting children to play, learn about God through 
Bible studies, and work at rehabbing deteriorated homes in their neighborhood.  During the past 
decade, crime rates among the boys she works with and pregnancy rates among the girls are 
much lower than in the surrounding community.
<p>
The bottom line is not money, since many of these effective programs cost far less than 
the failed but still fund-eating approaches of the Great Society.  The line that truly threatens 
American charity is a straight horizontal line, similar to that visible on the heart monitor when 
CPR fails.
<p>
<h3>Government vs. Private Charity</h3>
<p>
We need to change our methods of fighting poverty, but we need to be clear about the 
reasons for change.  Governmental welfare programs should be fought not because they are too 
expensive -- although, clearly, much money is wasted -- but because they are inevitably too 
stingy in what is truly important: treating people as human beings made in God's image, not as 
animals to be fed and caged.
<p>
Private charities can do a better job than government, but only if they practice CPS.  Here 
is where one word common in the 19th century, "discernment," needs to be revived.  New 
Orleans poverty-fighters declared in 1899 that, "Intelligent giving and intelligent withholding are 
alike true charity."  They gave an example: "If drink has made a man poor, money will feed not 
him, but his drunkenness."
<p>
Poverty-fighters a century ago trained volunteers to leave behind "a conventional attitude 
toward the poor, seeing them through the comfortable haze of our own intentions."  Bad charity 
that handed money to those who did not work could demoralize those who did.  Bad charity 
could create uncertainty among givers as to how their contributions would be used, and thus lead 
to less giving over the long term:  It was important to "reform those mild, well-meaning, tender-
hearted, sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging in indiscriminate charity."
<p>
When charity is challenging, personal, and spiritual,  then anti-poverty work can be 
effective.  The crisis of the modern welfare state is a crisis of government, but it is more than 
that.  Too many private charities dispense aid indiscriminately and thus provide, instead of points 
of light, alternative shades of darkness.  A century-old question -- Does any given "scheme of 
help... make great demands on men to give themselves to their brethren?" -- is still the right one 
to ask.
<p>
Some will have more time to give; some will have more dollars; but everyone can do 
something that will help and not hurt.  We need to learn how to apply CPS, and we need to 
become involved personally.  Involvement can vary in intensity all the way from tutoring a child 
for one hour a week to adopting a child, and  from counseling a young, unmarried pregnant 
woman to giving her a room in your home.  But everyone can do something.
<p>
Each of us should take a triple pledge based on CPS:  Com-pas-sion that is challenging, 
personal, and spiritual.  First, we should examine carefully the principles and practices of 
government programs or private charities that we might consider supporting.  Second, we should 
not support governmental programs or private charities that do not contain CPS elements.  Third, 
we should commit our time and money to those that do.

<title>Who Lost Japan? Mickey Kantor.  An Interview with Alvin Toffler -- PFF</title>

<h2>Who Lost Japan? Mickey Kantor.<br>
An Interview with Alvin Toffler</h2>
<p>
<Font Size="-1">American Civilization discusses with Alvin Toffler, co-author of "Creating a New 
Civilization: The Politics of the Third Wave," whether or not he is a Marxist, the decimation 
of middle management, the future of representative government and Japan bashing.</font>
<p>
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B> Information Age or Knowledge Age are often used as synonyms for Third Wave. Isnt 
there a clear difference between knowledge and information, and with so much information out 
there, wont people need others to filter information, be it an editor or "electronic agent?"
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B>  Raw data is just that, raw.  It frequently isn't very useful, even if it's accurate, which it 
frequently isn't, particularly in political discourse, where it's been massaged by various parties for 
their own benefit, or selected in particular ways.
<p>
I think well need both electronic agents and editors.  Electronic agents to do a kind of first 
cut, and then humans to apply more idiosyncratic, more customized, more interesting filters to the 
material, and then to help synthesize.
<p>
The synthesis of data into information, and from information into something that might be 
called knowledge, is absolutely the critical function.  The more information there is floating around, 
the more we drown without that function.
<p>
In organizations with traditional bureaucracies, that synthesizing and selecting function 
was served or carried out by the middle management, collecting information from several 
departments, synthesizing it, and then either moving it up the hierarchy or sitting on it and refusing 
to send it up.
<p>
What has happened is the introduction of computer technology into business; it has wiped 
out large swatches of the middle management, because it's no longer necessary.  But what makes it 
possible to do away with all those intermediaries are information systems that permit the individual 
at the bottom of the hierarchy to cross into other departments and other cubby holes containing 
information almost at will.
<p>
In every large scale bureaucracy two assumptions were made, one publicly and oone 
tacitly.
<p>
The explicit assumption was that the people on top, because they were getting more 
synthesized information, could see the whole picture, whereas the people on the bottom could only 
know what was in their department. Therefore, the people on top not only had power to make larger 
decisions, but they had the information appropriate to that power.  That is what we all heard.
<p>
What we never heard was that in the very act of designing the organization, of sketching a 
table of organization, there was implicit in that the assumption that the people on top knew enough 
to determine what the people down below needed to know.
<p>
When they set up an organizational frame that separated marketing from engineering, they 
were implying that the people in marketing don't need to know what the engineers are doing and 
vice versa.  So the implicit rule was that we on top know better than the people down below what it 
is they need to do and what they need to know.
<p>
The discussion of "empowerment" today in big business and large scale enterprise and in 
government bureaucracies to the degree that you even hear that, is a result of the fact that the people 
on top do not know and cannot know what the people down below need to know, because the rate 
of change is too rapid, and the complexity is too great.
<p>
The result is, that if you want to get any job done, you have got to let the people down 
below decide to what information that they will have access.  Otherwise they can't do it.  When we 
talk about empowerment, this is not a matter of noblesse oblige.  This is, you can't get the job done 
without it.  That is the democratization in a certain sense of the workplace.
<p>
I believe there's a lost power and authority at the top in all of our institutions.  There is an 
enhanced empowerment of individuals down below, who are also demanding more and more 
freedom to access information and to utilize it.
<p>
Now is that all good?  Not necessarily. It also means that the neo-Nazis and other crazies 
have access to very dangerous information.  Can you have an absolutely open information 
system?  No, we could not survive.  At the same token, you want to have a maximum open 
information system.  But you have to understand that there are risks entailed in that.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B> You have written that we're on the edge of a great democratic leap forward.  What does 
this portend for the government structure?
<p>
<B>Toffler: </B> I do not argue that we are going to have a great leap forward in democracy.  I argue that 
our current forms, our current concept of democracy are themselves reflections of a mass industrial 
society.  That mass democracy is the political expression of mass production, mass consumption, 
mass media, mass education, mass everything else.
<p>
It was appropriate that at the dawn of the machine age, we would create a political 
structure based on concepts like checks and balances, that we would create the party structures 
which were almost conceived of as machines and called machines, public machines.  That the 
function of the parties was to aggregate votes, and thereby transform an individual, transform a 
candidate into an electoral machine by the amassing of larger and larger numbers of votes.
<p>
All of that presupposed or went hand in hand in the less democratic countries with mass 
movements, the Nazis, Communism, Russia.  But it was the massness of the political structure that 
reflected the massness of other aspects of life.
<p>
Now, we're moving into a period of de-massification.  One of the implications of our 
theory of chain of history and one of the reasons we use the metaphor of waves of change, which 
makes what we say considerably different than a lot of social analysts, is that you can have more 
than one wave of change rolling at the same time.  So you can see certain processes still massified 
in the society, while other tendencies are gaining force, demassifying in the society.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B> Do you think that we are stuck with a Second Wave elite that fundamentally does not get 
what is happening in the world?
<p>	
<B>Toffler:</B> It doesn't matter.  Elites that don't get what is happening in the world do not survive.
<p>
New elites are emerging.  You'll find them, as you might expect me to say, in Silicon 
Valley and in Austin, Texas, and around Washington, D.C., and so forth and so on. These are new 
kinds, frequently based on new industry, but it may not even be just business; it can be in civil 
society and elsewhere.
<p>
We think that what happens is those sort of second wave structures, the elites that govern 
the second wave structures, either they get with the program or they get brushed away. The 
question is how civilly that occurs.  It can happen in a very unpleasant way.
<p>
<B>AmCiv: </B> With all of this decision off-loading, is there a role for any middle-management?  Im 
specifically thinking about representative government.
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B>  I believe -- and we have written and we have been radically misinterpreted again, 
primarily by Ross Perot.  He introduced the word electronic town hall and shook everybody with 
the silliness.
<p>
We do not believe in a sort of single ballot electronic town hall.  You make a decision and 
push the button and that's it. We believe that you need a representative layer, between that.  
Between the popular participation, electronically or otherwise, and the decision.  So we favor 
representative government.  However, there are ways to combine those in ways that we do not now 
do.
<p>
<B>AmCiv: </B> Do you think it should be created by modifying the Constitution?
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B>  I think it's inevitable that the Constitution will be modified.  The only question is whether 
that will be done in a reasonable and thoughtful way or as a result of some crisis.
<p>
Whether that happens in 10 years or 20 years, who knows.  I don't know.  But it seems to 
me that it is all in our interest to get as wide a civilized discussion going in the United States about 
what does the 21st century government require.  What do we as a people who want democracy 
mean by democracy in a demassified society, not just a society made up of mass movements.
<p>
It seems to me the political problem faced by politicians is to lace together thousands of 
different groupings with thousands of different interests from smoking bans, to abortion, to taxes, 
nukes, no nukes, do you commit genetic foods into the marketplace or don't you.  There are 
thousands and thousands of issues.  People line up multi-dimensional on all of these multiple 
spectra.
<p>
Moreover, most of these groups don't last more than 10 minutes.  They are constantly 
dying and regenerating.  So you have a very fluxing political field in which the old rules no longer 
apply.
<p>
The reality here is that nobody today will represent.  Minorities do not feel represented.  
Majorities don't feel represented.  The Christian Coalition doesn't feel adequately represented.  I can 
tell you that people I know who are multi-zillionaires feel that they are not represented.  So there is 
a widespread, deep, deep feeling in the country that the system doesn't match the assumptions on 
which we've all been taught to take for granted.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B> If politicians can no longer count on stable coalitions of interests, maybe we should try to 
strengthen representative government, where people no longer run on the issues but on how well 
theyd make decisions.
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B>  In fact, I don't think that that is completely ignored by the electorate even now.  When 
they vote for somebody and we get into personality and character, that is one of the issues that 
people are thinking about.  Is this a guy who is going to be a menace in the case of war?  Is this a 
guy who can handle tough decisions?  Is this a guy who is too slightly or too light-weight?  And so 
forth and so on.  So I think that it does play somewhat.  But the question you raise I think is a really 
good one.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B>  Let me ask you a question about your intellectual processes. <i>The New Yorker</i> and others 
have called you a Marxist.  Certainly youve come to different conclusions from Marx, but you 
both seem to draw on Hegels dialecticalism.
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B> Heidi and I were Marxists, but the notion that we're still Marxists is a funny kind of Marx. 
 The supra structure is more important than the base.  It's actually more Hegelian than it is Marxist. 
 But I think that they weren't up to making distinctions.
<p>
Look, Marx was no dummy.  Marx was a very smart guy. He taught that things are 
interconnected, that technology is important for change and has social consequences.
<p>
More important, in my own intellectual thought, Marxism was a model.  It is a model.  
That is what is valuable.  Not whether the model was right or wrong, but that there is such a thing, 
that there are such things as models.
<p>
Now, I could then say that model is wrong.  I can either try to correct the model or I can 
dump the model entirely and create another model.  But the early life insight that there's such a 
thing as a way to organize masses and masses of information into some kind of coherent model was 
very powerful for us. Lots of thinkers and institutions put out models.
<p>
Id go to school and be showered with facts which didn't make a lot of sense.  You had a 
chronology of history.  You had individual bits and pieces.  Suddenly, I found a bunch of people 
who could put those bits and pieces together into pattern.  That was wow, came as a great 
awakening.  As I say, it could have been some other model, but that was one of them.
<p>
If you read our books carefully, you will see that there are models in these books.  They 
are not explicit.  We never start the way an academic would and say here is the way the model 
works.  But in fact, we couldn't synthesize the stuff that we do without some kind of models.  I 
believe that we have various different models and that they are basically compatible with one 
another.
<p>
There would be no way for me to make sense of the morning newspaper if I didn't have 
some kind of framework.  Not all of it.  The best news articles are the ones that don't fit the model.  
They are the ones that force you to think.
<p>
We have got a research file of more than 3,000 categories.  Periodically something appears 
for which we simply don't have a file.  That is the best.  That just gets put on my desk.  It lives in 
my tray for months at a time.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B> You are talking about those things that don't fit.  They ground you as to why that model 
does or does not reflect reality.
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B> They either tell you that you have got to extend the model in some direction that you 
haven't attempted before, or they say you have got to rethink some chunk of it.  Maybe some part of 
it doesn't really operate that way and you've got to leave room, in which case we do.
<p>
I think we leave room for chance.  We are not historical determinists.  But these are the 
patterns that seem to be emerging, but that can be derailed.  This whole place could go up in smoke 
tomorrow.  Who knows?  The world is a very chancy place.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B>  The "Big Change" were going through seems capable of causing tremendous 
dislocations. It is, after all, changing our whole fabric of life. Are you worried about civil disorder?
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B>  Look at the rest of the world, see how instantaneously the Soviet system simply came 
apart.  Now we're better off because were are more decentralized.  But we're not immune. I believe 
that the militias are incipient separatist movements. I think that if Western Europe can have 
Basques and Corsicans blowing up police stations and so forth and so on, that we may be just 
moving into that cycle.
<p>
I am not vaguely one sided or pessimistic, but I certainly am not blindly optimistic.  I 
think we are moving into a period in which there is a lot of danger and risk.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B>  What about international affairs?  What concerns you there? 
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B> Japan bashing.  It overlooks the degree to which the Japanese economy and the American 
economy are in fact already integrated. This assumption that there's a national line and a need to 
balance some accounting is nuts.  It is obsessively focused on trade in response to a very narrow 
special interest, which overlooks the larger danger of destruction of the Asian Pacific economy.  
Not to mention the possibility of war.
<p>
I think that at the end of World War II, there was some very unpleasant talk about how we 
lost China.  I guess you know history in this period.  But in five years, 10 years, I expect to be 
hearing who lost Asia.  The answer would be Micky Kantor.
<p>
<B>AmCiv:</B> Bill Clinton.
<p>
<B>Toffler:</B>  What it seems to me they are doing is pushing Japan to pulling out of here and putting all 
their investment in Southeast Asia, which then becomes the Greater East Asian co-prosperity 
sphere. We are sitting there with a time bomb ticking away in China.  If we want to maintain any 
stability in the Asian Pacific region, the basis of that stability lies in Japan.

<title>  Where Limited Government Meets Family Values:  Parental Rights and The Third Wave -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Where Limited Government Meets Family Values:<br>
Parental Rights and The Third Wave</h2>
<p>
By Jeffrey Bell
</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
As the Third Wave ushers in an unprecedented era of government devolution and rapid 
change in the social fabric, the role of private institutions is becoming increasingly highlighted.  
This is a welcome development, for while rejection of the centralized, bureaucratic model of 
government may seem as inevitable as it is desirable, "limited government" is only half of the 
equation.  If a consensus is reached that government will no longer be responsible for carrying 
out certain basic functions, we then face the perhaps more interesting task of reassigning the 
responsibility for these functions.  As predictable as the motions of a seesaw, if government's 
role is to decrease, the role of spontaneous, private institutions must increase.  
<p>
Harsh words for Big Government's incompetence are not enough.  Pessimism about the 
competence of the centralized state must be balanced by an optimism in the ability of families 
and local communities to meet the challenges of devolution.  And when it comes to society's 
most essential task -- the care and raising of children -- America's parents are ready, willing and 
able to step up to the plate.  
<p>
To enable parents to carry out their enormous responsibilities, the law must respect their 
rights.  The importance of the parent-child relationship deserves explicit recognition and 
protection from government.  For too long, America's families have been micro-managed by 
agents of the "nanny state" exhibiting a "we know what's best for your children" mentality.  
<p>
The futility of bureaucrats substituting their judgment for that of parents is perhaps most 
evident in public schools.  Some elements of the growing parental rights movement are 
motivated by the fact that values taught in school often contradict values taught at home; others 
are more concerned with the "dumbing down" of academic standards.  Both problems result from 
a lack of accountability to parents, who are, after all, the true owners of the school.  
<p>
The Third Wave is demonstrating that decentralization tends to increase the 
quality of products produced.   We ought to apply this principle to education reform.  Today's 
children need to learn the skills that will help them adapt to tomorrow's fast-changing work 
environments.  We must place our faith in parents as the natural party to demand the kind of 
accountability and quality from our schools necessary to meet this goal.  
<p>
More firmly establishing the parental rights principle also anticipates that with the Third 
Wave will come new models for educating our children.  Consider, for example, the Noah 
Webster Academy, a network of Michigan homeschooling families which will soon be linked by 
a computer network to facilitate curriculum development and implementation through text 
transmission, video lectures and assignments.  A team of 14 licensed educators is available at a 
central location to provide assistance via toll-free helplines.  The Noah Webster Academy is 
applying for state funding under the innovative Michigan charter school legislation.  It is difficult 
to predict how our notions of "school" may change during the Information Age, but Noah 
Webster provides a glimpse of things to come.  
<p>
The parental rights principle accounts for the fact that centralized engineering and design 
have given way to spontaneous "unauthorized" problem-solving.  It provides the tool families 
need to navigate uncharted waters while expressing optimism that in the vast majority of cases, 
parents' choices for their children will be far superior to those made by agents of the state 
advocating a one-size-fits-all solution.<p>
<p>
The Third Wave is providing families with new opportunities as well as new challenges.  
While new technologies are making it easier for parents to work at home, the barrage of images 
and ideas that children are be exposed to is increasing exponentially.  We ought to ensure that 
parents have greater input into government programs and public school policies that too often 
contradict values taught at home.  Parents struggling to monitor their children's exposure to 
controversial messages in pop culture have a right as taxpayers to demand that their government 
not contribute to this problem.
<p>
In this era of rapid change and transition, it is not always easy to see which aspects of the 
current social fabric are passing away and which are foundational to that which is to come.  This 
uncertainty makes it all the more necessary to make explicit those values, those bonds between 
persons, that won't change, and shouldn't change, even if we had the choice.  The parent-child 
relationship is surely worth preserving, protecting and strengthening in order to prepare for the 
rigors of the future.
<p>
Government played a critical role in the transition from the Agricultural Age to the 
Industrial Age by providing a solid currency and protecting rights to land, capital and trade 
routes.  As we increased our power over our physical environment, government lent stability to 
the process, curbed excesses and helped make possible unprecedented economic expansion.  Our 
current transition into the Information Age coincides with a renewed appreciation for the family 
as the critical building block of a healthy society.  As our ability to manipulate, control and 
magnify our intellectual capital increases, government can again play a critical role by protecting 
the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Keeping our 
foundation of strong families intact will help ensure a smooth transition to limited government 
and a Third Wave social fabric. 
<p>

<title>The Competitive Advantage of the Inner City -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>The Competitive Advantage of the Inner City</h2>
<p>
By Michael E. Porter
</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The economic distress of America's inner cities is one of the most pressing issues facing the nation.  The lack of businesses, investment and, most importantly, jobs in these disadvantaged urban areas not only perpetuates a crushing poverty, but fuels other social problems such as crime and drug abuse.  As the inner cities continue to deteriorate, the debate on how to aid them grows increasingly divisive and bitter.
<p>
Underscoring the current state of affairs is a sad reality: the numerous efforts to revitalize inner cities over the past few decades have clearly failed.  Despite the investment of substantial resources and good faith efforts of many in the minority as well as in the majority communities, the creation of a sustainable economic base in inner cities, and with it employment opportunities, wealth creation, role models and improved infrastructure, still eludes us.
<p>
We believe that past efforts have been based on the wrong model.  Assistance to inner cities has largely taken the form of relief programs such as income assistance, housing subsidies and food stamps with the intent of addressing highly visible social needs.
<p>
Genuine economic development initiatives aimed at building businesses in the inner city have been fragmented and ineffective.  These limited efforts at economic development have taken the form of either outright subsidies and preferences for companies, or efforts to stimulate economic activity in tangential fields such as housing and neighborhood development.  These approaches have largely failed.  Without economically viable companies and jobs, social programs only grow larger.
<p>
<h3>A New Approach</h3>
<p>
We need a new model for inner city economic development. It must be based on an economic rather than a social perspective.  It must be centered on the private sector, not government or social service organizations.  It must address companies directly, rather than attempting to stimulate economic development indirectly through investments in housing and community infrastructure.  It must be focused on creating inner city businesses that are profitable in their own right, rather than presupposing the need for subsidies, incentives or unprofitable actions mandated by government.
<p>
The new model should view the inner city as a distinct but integral part of the regional and national economy, not as an island unto itself.  The new model must be trade and "export" oriented, rather than focused solely on businesses that serve the local community.  The goal should be to create regional, national and even international companies, not just small local businesses.
<p>
The cornerstone of the new model is to reveal the profit potential of the inner city by identifying the unique potential competitive advantages of inner city-based companies which provide the basis for sustainable market positions.  Inner city businesses need locational advantages which allow them to compete with firms based elsewhere and to occupy a specialized position that adds value within the regional and national economy.
<p>
If companies are to prosper and put down roots in the inner city, they must be driven by more than subsidies or social conscience.  Inner city investments will fail in the long run unless they stand on their own merits.
<p>
The new model must link the inner city to the regional economy rather than further isolate it.  This means networking with and harnessing the capabilities of companies in the surrounding region.  It also will require improved infrastructure to unclog the physical flow of goods and services into and out of inner city areas.
<p>
The new model must not only address inner city residents, but also encourage skilled and experienced individuals who live and work elsewhere, especially minorities, to turn their attention to the inner city.  These leaders must transfer their skills and participate in new business formation alongside entrepreneurs within the community, motivated by the creation of wealth, not social service or activism.
<p>
The new model must engage mainstream supporting institutions such as banks, universities, and training providers, instead of relying on fragmented and poorly equipped social service institutions.  The emphasis should be on encouraging private sector/mainstream entities to serve the community profitably, rather than creating even more overlapping government or quasi-government organizations.
<p>
The new model must address the high costs of doing business in the inner city directly, rather than employing subsidies in an attempt to offset them directly.
<p>
The role of government itself must change markedly.  The new model must be built around incentives for private sector entities instead of relying on the government to directly deliver financing or services.  Government should concentrate on improving the business environment, not taking leadership in business development.
<p>
Finally, real estate and community development must fit into a broader strategy based on these principles, instead of being seen as a strategy in its own right.
<p>
<h3>Physical location</h3>
<p>
Inner city areas are in what should be economically valuable locations.  They sit near congested, high-rent areas, major business centers, and astride transportation and communications nodes.
<p>
Inner city locations thus offer potential advantages for those businesses that benefit from proximity to downtown business districts, logistical infrastructure, entertainment and tourist destinations, and concentrations of other companies.  This creates opportunities for relocating activities such as warehousing, data processing, food preparation, and others that can be de-coupled from downtown headquarters, or other company locations, but yet still benefit from proximity. 
<p>
<h3>Demand Conditions</h3>
<p>
The second potential competitive advantage of the inner city lies in demand conditions.  The most obvious opportunity is in serving the immense inner city market.  Even though average incomes are relatively low, high population density translates into substantial purchasing power and a large market.
<p>
Our Boston study area, for example, has an estimated total family income of 3.4 billion dollars.  Despite a 21 percent lower average household income level than the rest of Boston, spending power per acre is 5.6 percent higher than the rest of Boston and much higher than in surrounding suburbs.
<p>
The inner city market is not only large, but young and rapidly growing, due in part to immigration and relatively high birth rates.  Minority consumers represent the major growth market of the future.
<p>
Local demand in the inner city has already triggered the creation of some businesses, but there is potential for many more.  Strong unmet demand for housing, for example, has led to the formation of a substantial real estate cluster in inner-city Boston and elsewhere.  Indeed, the inner city has spawned the creation of hundreds of social service organizations.  Boston has a group of inner city-based security guard companies who got started based on local demand but who are beginning to "export."
<p>
<h3>Access to regional clusters</h3>
<p>
A third potential advantage of the inner city is the ability to leverage access to competitive nearby regional clusters.
<p>
In Boston, for example, the inner city is next door to world-class financial services and health care clusters.  South Central Los Angeles is close to the huge entertainment cluster and a large logistical services and wholesaling complex.
<p>
These competitive clusters in the surrounding area create two types of potential advantages.  The first is for business formation.  Proximity to highly competitive nearby industries can be a major competitive advantage in providing supplies, components and supporting services to multiple nearby customers.
<p>
Inner city firms can also draw on the presence of competitive firms in their region to compete in downstream products and services.  For example, Massachusetts' strength in financial services should provide an opportunity for minority firms to provide financial services tailored to minority businesses and individual needs, such as secured credit cards, factoring, and mutual funds, both within and outside the inner city in Boston and elsewhere in the country.
<p>
<h3>Human resources</h3>
<p>
The fourth potential advantage of the inner city, not based on location per se, is in the area of human resources.  An abundant supply of low-cost labor is not in and of itself an advantage, because lower-cost labor is available in rural and foreign locations.  However, human resource advantages do arise today in the inner city in several forms.
<p>
First, inner city workers are often more motivated and more loyal in fields where there is high turnover in other locations.  A good example is a bakery in the heart of Boston's inner city, which bakes and decorates cakes sold to supermarkets throughout the region.
<p>
It can attract and retain residents from the areas at seven to eight dollars per hour, plus contributions to pensions and health insurance, and has almost 100 local employees.  Coupled with the logistical advantage of the inner city location, this labor pool has allowed the company to thrive.  These sorts of jobs represent a starting point in building a sustainable economy.
<p>
Second, our research in Boston and elsewhere has revealed a real capacity in inner cities for entrepreneurship.  Some of this entrepreneurial energy has been directed at building businesses.  Most legitimate inner city entrepreneurship, however, has been directed at community activism and the provision of social services.
<p>
In Boston's inner city, for example, there are a truly remarkable number of social service providers as well as social, fraternal, and religious organizations.  The density of such organizations is far higher in the inner city than in Boston as a whole.  (Forty percent of the city's employment in social service and membership organizations was in our study area in 1990, compared to 11 percent of the city's total employment).
<p>
Behind the creation and building of these organizations is a whole cadre of minority entrepreneurs who have responded to intense local demand for social services and funding opportunities provided by government, foundations, and private sector sponsors.  The challenge is to redirect some of this talent and energy towards building for-profit businesses and creating wealth.
<p>
In order to unleash this economic potential of inner cities, one must confront a series of significant disadvantages.  Businesses operating in the inner city face more obstacles than those based elsewhere.  Unless these disadvantages can be addressed directly, instead of indirectly through subsidies or mandates, the locational advantages of inner cities will continue to be nullified and eroded.  To do so, however, it will be necessary to reexamine and discard many old approaches.

<title>Privatize the Postal Service -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Privatize the Postal Service</h2>
<p>
By Thomas M. Lenard
</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The U.S. Postal Service  provides a traditional industrial age service -- the delivery of messages in hard-copy form -- which is being challenged by a variety of new information age communications alternatives.  These alternatives already have eroded the Postal Service's share of the communications market, and will continue to do so in the years ahead.
<p>
The erosion of the Postal Service's core business leaves customers contending with rising rates and inadequate services.  This situation will only degenerate as new technologies eat into the Postal Service's markets and undermine its financial viability.
<p>
The Postal Service's status as a government-owned monopoly makes it virtually impossible for either the Service or its customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology.  It is therefore imperative that we seek to replace the way America's postal services are structured.
<p>
<h3>Competition to the Postal Service</h3>
<p>
As a government-owned enterprise protected from competition in the major markets in which it operates, the Postal Service occupies a unique place in the American economy.  The Private Express Statutes give the Postal Service a monopoly over the carriage of "letter mail," which covers all first-class and most third-class mail.  Together, these two classes comprise over 80 percent of the Postal Service's business.
<p>
The principal argument against permitting competition in the delivery of mail is that the Postal Service is a natural monopoly, able to provide mail services at a lower cost than if it shared the market with other firms. Yet we know that private firms can effectively compete with the Postal Service, when permitted.  United Parcel Service and FedEx are well known success stories.  The fact that the Postal Service faces as much competition as it does, both in terms of service quality and price, from a great variety of sources, in spite of its statutory monopoly, is indicative of the high costs of maintaining the status quo.
<p>
<h3>Private Mail Delivery Firms</h3>
<p>
While it is clear that large firms such as UPS and FedEx are strong competitors, there is evidence of the viability of other technologies.  There is a small, private mail carrier industry that operates today, subject to the constraints of the letter-mail monopoly.  These private carriers deliver unaddressed advertising mail and periodicals that may be addressed.
<p>
All Postal Service mail is required to carry a written address, even if it is delivered to all addresses in an area. Advertising circulars that are delivered to most or all of the addresses in an area (i.e., are not selectively delivered) are considered unaddressed and therefore may legally be delivered by private firms.  Periodicals -- second-class mail -- and most books and catalogues also fall outside the definition of "letter mail" and may be privately delivered.
<p>
The small firms that make up the private mail delivery industry have been offering a variety of services in connection with the basic delivery service, many of which are not offered by the Postal Service.  For example, private carriers offer selective coverage based on various demographic characteristics; guaranteed delivery on a specific day; coordination with printers; and, Sunday and holiday delivery service.
<p>
None of these services is offered by the Postal Service. These are small mom-and-pop operations.  To the extent that economies of scale and scope are important in this market, the Postal Service should enjoy advantages that are unavailable to the private carriers -- especially the small firms that operate in this market.  The fact that they can compete suggests either higher costs or mispricing on the part of the Postal Service.
<p>
In recent years the private sector delivery service has grown dramatically. For example, private delivery services are now offered by more than 38 percent of the daily newspapers; 
five years after Publishers Express was founded in 1989 by Time Inc., it delivered about 60 million magazines and catalogues and about six million "ride-alongs"; and, about 70 percent of the nations 100 million households are now covered by private mail delivery.
<p>
Nevertheless, the extent to which private delivery can penetrate the market is obviously limited -- by the letter monopoly and by the letter box restrictions.
<p>
<h3>Competition From Electronic Transmission</h3>
<p>
In the long run, the Postal Service is probably more vulnerable to competition from electronic forms of transmission, which can completely bypass the existing legal restrictions. This electronic competition has been foreseen for years and is not new, but its intensity is growing.  There are, for example, now about 9 million installed fax machines and increasing use of computer-generated fax transmissions.
<p>
The market for on-line services is expanding as well, with companies like Prodigy, CompuServe and America On-line providing home shopping, banking, electronic mail and a variety of interactive information services.
<p>
There is little the Postal Service can do to forestall these new technologies. It is important that the Postal Service have the ability to respond and adapt to new circumstances, which it is unable to do operating as a rate-regulated statutory monopoly.  Otherwise, the Service will represent an increasing financial burden on those of its customers who have limited alternatives and on the taxpayer.
<p>
<h3>Redesigning the Postal Service</h3>
<p>
Given the interests of current stakeholders, how can we achieve a real redesign of the system?  The most obvious group with a stake in the current system is postal labor, but there are others as well, including the Postal Service's competitors, and individuals and businesses in high-cost service areas who fear they will be disadvantaged by a more competitive system.
<p>
As a nation, we put a high premium on the ability to choose.  This is apparent in the in the changes taking place in the telecommunications industries, where we have facilitated choice in long-distance service, and are moving in that direction in local and cable TV.
<p>
A plan to redesign the Postal Service should:  (1) provide the flexibility for the Postal Service to survive and for mailers to have a sufficient array of service alternatives and (2) avoid the service disruptions and taxpayer bailout that are likely if nothing is done.  A plan that meets these objectives should be based on the following premises:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The government's monopoly over the carriage and delivery of mail should be abolished.  There is no benefit to customers in being forced to rely on a high-cost provider of service, and the monopoly deprives mailers of needed alternatives and the USPS itself of the freedom and flexibility it needs to adapt to the nation's changing mail service and communications needs.
<li>The Postal Service should be able to compete in new markets on a level playing field, enjoying no explicit or implicit advantages relative to its private competitors.
<li>Whatever the exact nature of the organization, this implies a new Postal Service should have transferable ownership shares, because this type of organization promotes efficiency.
</ul>
 <p>
We know what a more efficient Postal Service would look like, but we don't have much experience concerning how to get there.  One way to approach the problem would be to undertake the transformation in stages, rather than all at once.  In a transition to a new system, we need to take account of the interests of individuals that made investment and other decisions under the assumption that the current rules of the game would continue, including Postal Service employees, mailers and competitors.  One way or another, however, change is coming to the Postal Service, and it behooves all those with an interest in the system to try to make the transition as smooth as possible.

<title>Term Limits: Restoring Faith in Our Government -- PFF</title>
<head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Term Limits: Restoring Faith in Out Government</h2>
<p>
By John Boehner
</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>"To restore accountability to Congress.  To end its cycle of scandal and disgrace.  To make us all proud again of the way free people govern themselves..."</i></blockquote>
<p>
These words from the preamble of the <i>Contract with America</i> are at the very heart of the new Congressional majority's effort to rebuild citizens' faith in their government.  Although the <i>Contract </i>was an important collection of long-overdue reforms to our federal government, the concept of a "contract" as a whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  That restoration of faith, long battered by an out-of-touch and scandal-plagued crop of entrenched politicians, was the true aim of this <i>Contract.</i>
<p>
No other issue better captures the spirit of this effort than term limits.
<p>
One of the people's great frustrations with government is politicians who ignore their wishes and openly flout the public policy demands of the American people.  It has been argued that the former Democratic leadership's treatment of the issue of term limits led not only to the general voter discontent with Congress felt during last November's election, but contributed directly to the unprecedented defeat of the Speaker of the House himself.  Former Speaker Foley not only opposed term limits, he used the power of his office to prevent an open and honest debate of the issue on the House floor.  And when his very own constituents voted at the ballot box to impose term limits, he took them to court in order to stop their initiative.  Is it any wonder that Speaker Foley was the poster child of the term limits movement last year?
<p>
The <i>Contract with America </i>stands in contrast to this arrogance.  It is that kind of "I-know-better-than-you" conceit that led to the very creation of a Contract and the election of a new majority committed to allowing issues such as term limits to be debated before the people's representatives.
<p>
It is very important that the great issues of the day be deliberated and acted upon.  That is why, even though I had until this year had voiced opposition to them, I fought last summer to make sure term limits were included in our<i> Contract. </i> Their absence would have been an act of disdain on our part.  While I have doubts about term limits, I have greater doubts about Congress' ability to govern without greater confidence from the public -- and that is at the heart of our efforts to reform government and renew America.  
<p>
The people of this country, in state after state and in district after district,  have made it clear that they want term limits.  And they do so not just through opinion polls and letters and protests, but at the ballot box.  Of the twenty-three states which have passed term limits, all but one are the result of citizen initiated ballot referendum.
<p>
I am proud that it is a Republican Congress that has brought this matter to the House floor for vote and debate for the first time in our nation's history -- fulfilling the promise we made in our <i>Contract with America. </i> The new majority proved to all Americans that we were willing to let the people decide whether or not they wished to amend our great charter of government, as is their inalienable right.
<p>
Although we had a full and honest debate on the issue, we were ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary two-thirds majority required to approve such an amendment.  
<p>
Just two years ago you could have had a meeting of congressional term limits supporters in a phone booth.  When the dust settled after the March vote more than 80 percent of House Republicans voted for a term limits constitutional amendment -- exceeding the 72 percent support term limits receives from the public at large.  
<p>
In order to approve the amendment, House Republicans would have required the support of just half the Democrats in the House.  Sadly, fewer than 20 percent of them voted for term limits -- ensuring defeat of the amendment.
<p>
But the story doesn't end there.  All of the great legislative reform battles in our nation's history have taken time, time to have the voters at the ballot box visit their wrath upon the elected officials who opposed their wishes.  That is why the House leadership is committed to making this an issue in 1996 and have pledged to make a constitutional amendment on term limits House Resolution number 1 in the next Congress.   
<p>
As a practical matter, term limits may for better -- or may for worse -- fundamentally change our government.  As a governing idea, they deserve a national, constitutional debate.  This debate is not just about limiting the terms for Representatives.  No, the debate is about whether or not we are willing to respect the judgment of those who elected us.
<p>
This is an issue much larger than budgets and programs and bureaucrats and all else that makes up what is known as our federal government.  This debate is about politicians in Washington thwarting the people's right to alter their form of government.  I believe this is exactly the type of debate that our Founding Fathers envisioned when they established the process whereby our nation's citizens exercise their power as "we the people."  
<p>
As a member of the new majority, I want us to rely on our performance and not our words to change the public's contempt for this great institution.  But as a Republican, I am also willing to step up and admit that the calls for term limits are not directed at any one party.  Congress' performance over the last several years has forced this call for change.  Wasteful spending, bounced checks, out of balance budgets, bloated bureaucracies, a reliance on special interest campaign funds.  Clearly, both major parties must admit responsibility in having failed the people.  We now have the opportunity to correct that failure.
<p>
While our failure to pass term limits (this time) may have disappointed many, the American people are clearly pleased with the progress the <i>Contract </i>and the new majority in Congress have made so far.  Politicians who do what they said they would do; a Congress that is working harder and more successful than any since 1933; and, a fundamental change in the way Washington does business have all helped renew America's faith in this institution.  In fact, an April <i>Wall Street Journal</i>/NBC News poll indicates for the first time a majority of those responding -- 47 percent to 40 percent -- said they approved of the job Congress is doing.   
<p>
The fact remains, however, that whenever contempt is openly displayed by politicians towards the public and their desires for reform, it severely lessens our moral authority and practical ability to govern.  Our commitment to debate and ultimately pass a term limits amendment is the first step on the long road toward restoring this institution's credibility with, and accountability to, the American people.  Nothing less will do.

<title>	How the American Media are Betraying the American Public -- PFF</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>How the American Media are Betraying the American Public</h2>
<P>
By Arianna Huffington
</center>
<P>
<p>
<p>
 What's wrong with the American media?  The first major problem
with the American media is not its liberal bias, as conservatives
have been complaining.  It's much more fundamental than that.
 It's a cynical bias, a debunking bias, a nihilistic bias, a bias
to believe the worst about us.  It usually finds expression in
a hip, irreverent journalistic style -- an attitude of casual
disdain, and even casual cruelty.  Indeed, most journalists will
eagerly throw their ideological affiliations overboard for the
opportunity to burst your bubble, rain on your parade or shatter
what they believe to be your illusions.
<P>
 In his important article, "A Generation of Vipers,"
for the <I>Columbia Journalism Review</I>, Paul Starobin, wrote: "Even though it is understandable, a migration from skepticism
to cynicism has not served the cause of journalism well.  Cynicism
can be a lazy substitute for curiosity, and in its most corrosive
form, it can produce journalists who have a diminished view of
their profession and of themselves.  Worse, it can damage readers
and viewers and thus, democracy."
<P>
<B>Trivializing the Important</B>
<P>
 The second thing wrong with the American media is that they are
cheating the American public out of a critically important conversation
on the direction of the country. A classic example of this was
the way the media treated the whole debate over welfare reform
and reduced it to footage of interest groups waving school lunch
trays, and to soundbites about a "war on children" and
about "cutting school lunches to give tax breaks to millionaires."
 Now, whichever side of the welfare debate or the school lunch
debate you were on, all of us know that this "cutting-off-school-lunch-for-starving-kids-to-fund-capital-gains-cuts-for-the-rich"
debate in the media was only a macabre parody of what was going
on -- macabre, because the real victims of this are the ten million
children that right now go hungry under the very programs that
have suddenly been turned by the media into untouchable sacred
cows. 
<P>
 If we all can agree that welfare needs to be reformed, and we
all can agree that we need to have a serious conversation about
the way in which it needs to be reformed -- then why is the media,
with its sensationalism, trivialization and fear-mongering, continuing
to make a real debate impossible?
<P>
 We have reached a turning point in American history.  Whether
one is liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, we all
recognize that something has gone wrong in America, that our traditional
approaches to our problems aren't working, that by doing more
of what we're already doing we're not going to get a different
result.  We're going to have to make some real fundamental changes
in this country in terms of policy, in terms of our civil institutions,
in terms of our values, our relationship to the state and our
relationship to each other.
<P>
   At present, 70 percent of the American people think that the
media is getting in the way of these solutions.  And they are
getting in the way by cheating the American public out of the
conversation we need to have.
<P>
<b>Betraying the People</b>
<P>
 The third thing wrong with the American media is that the very
important role that the Founding Fathers intended for them is
very seriously threatened by the breakdown of trust in them by
the American people.  In the last <I>Wall Street Journal/NBC</I>
poll, only 21 percent of Americans rated the news media as honest
and trustworthy.   And, when you remember that 37 percent consider
the President honest and trustworthy you realize how dangerously
low they have sunk in the public esteem.
<P>
 Remember the balmy days in 1979 when a Gallup Poll found that
51 percent rated the media as trustworthy.  And remember the even
balmier days in 1971 when a poll showed that a member of the media,
Walter Cronkite, was the most trusted man in America?  Our reverence
for him at that time was something like the reverence tribal people
must have once felt for the village explainers -- wise men who
made plain the world and wonders around us.  But what seems to
have happened over the past 20 years is that the village explainers
have turned into the village harranguers and the village debunkers.
  <P>
 The American people don't hate the media; betrayal would be more
apt.  Americans have always had a special reverence and affection
for the explainers in our culture.  But as the explainers turned,
first hot and heavy, and then loud and shrill, a sort of sacred
trust was breached.  What is it that we feel towards the village
debunker?  We still listen, but we are compelled to guard our
most precious valuables: our hopes, our dreams, our values and
ideals.  Because they are but ignoble ambitions full of hot air
and base motives to the village debunker.
<P>
<b>Off on the Wrong Track</b>
<P>
 So, how did things get to be so bad?  If the media is off track,
where did they go wrong?  Here are the three main reasons I believe
they went so wrong.
<P>
 First of all, members of the media have an insatiable hunger
for the approval of their peers.  There is this tremendous fear
of being uncool -- a tremendous need to appear jaded and sophisticated.
 It's a fear of being caught playing the ingenue, the innocent.
 It's almost a neurosis -- a fear of being seen as the nerdy kid
in the civics class, the one with the pocket protector and Buddy
Holly glasses.  But today's attitude-driven journalism provides
a refuge from all that, a way to submerge all reflection and thoughtful
analysis behind brash headlines and irreverent assumptions.  
<P>
 The search for peer sanction functions a bit like hemline fashion
and W's In and Out column.  One season Clinton is all the rage
-- next season no one would be caught <I>dead</I> writing a good
article about him.
<P>
 The second reason why so much has gone wrong with the American
media is that at some point in the last thirty years the media
decided to play God and obsess not about people's actions but
about their motives.  At some point in journalism we shifted from:
"These are Gingrich's ideas, and here's why they're wrong
for America" to "These are Gingrich's ideas, and he's
a mean-spirited S.O.B. who doesn't care about children" --
a commentary that was portrayed in fact on the cover of <I>Time</I>
magazine, when Gingrich was pictured not just as Scrooge, but
with the stub of Tiny Tim's broken crutch clutched in his menacing
fist.
<P>
 This obsession with people's motives expresses itself as an almost
religious certainty that behind every conviction lives a secret
agenda, and behind every proposed solution lurks a base motive.
 I've got two words for the media on this subject: Lighten up.
 This game has become ridiculous.  Freud once said that sometimes
a cigar is just a cigar.  Well, sometimes an answer is just an
answer -- sometimes people actually mean what they say.  In fact,
the media often acts as a "clean air filter" in reverse.
 Someone will say something with pure intentions, but after the
purity is filtered through the media, what they said becomes polluted.
<P>
 <I>New Republic</I> editor Michael Lewis was recently quoted
saying, "Do I believe that a lot of people's motives are
base?  Yes.  If you dig, you usually can find a selfish motive."
 Fine.  Why don't we start with the premise that no one's motives
-- except perhaps Mother Theresa's -- are 100 percent pure, and
go on from there, to also assume that this is not the end of the
story.  Yes, we all have selfish motives, but also we all have
the better angels of our nature that Lincoln so valiantly tried
to evoke.  If we don't believe that, then we simply end up with
nothing more than reductive hit pieces of the kind that <I>Nation</I>
columnist Christopher Hitchens wrote on Mother Theresa in <I>Vanity
Fair</I>, pegging her as "The Whore of Calcutta.";  I
had always been puzzled by the fact that only 70 percent of Americans
approved of Mother Theresa.  I was wondering where the thirty
percent that disapproved of her were to be found.  Now I know.
<P>
<b>Whose Values?</b>
<P>
 The third reason why the American media has lost the trust of
the American public is that they are so completely out of touch
with them and with their values.  They basically despise their
so-called middle-class values, values like faith and family.
<P>
 A dramatic example of this insensitivity is found on an April
cover of the <I>New Yorker</I> -- an Easter Bunny in a business
suit being crucified against the background of a 1040 tax form.
 This is the <I>New Yorker's</I> choice of a cover for their Easter
issue, enabling them to simultaneously offend millions of Christians'
faith in the miracle of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection,
ridicule middle America's cry for lower taxes and even take a
stab at our children's beloved Easter Bunny.  But no matter. 
Tina Brown will no doubt be greeted with bouquets of "How
brilliant!"  "How inspiring!"  "How daring!"  "How Clever!" at the next New York dinner party she
attends.  And increasingly that's all that seems to matter in
the insular, incestuous world of the media establishment.  The
thrill of pushing the last envelope, shocking the last sensibility,
breaking the last taboo until there is nothing sacred left.  Call
me uncool, but I find this mockery of the crucifixion no more
inspired or inspiring than I did the recent decision by one acclaimed
fashion designer to dress his models in the uniforms of Nazi concentration
camp prisoners and march them down the runway -- no more inspiring
and no less grotesque.
<P>
<b>Where do we Go from Here</b>
<P>
 Now let's move from the examination and diagnosis to the prescription.
 What are the three most important things the media can do to
regain the trust of the American public and help engage them in
the necessary debate over the direction of our country?
<P>
 First, the media must again see the world as it is, not just
as the cynics would have them see it.  I'm not talking about a
Hallmark card version of the world or a Pollyannish -- I'm talking
about a <I>complete</I> version of the world, one which includes
both the crucifixion and the resurrection, one which includes
both the darkness and the light.
<P>
 The challenges we are facing today will require profound change.
 And cynics don't change things.  Believers change things.  Idealists
change things.  Romantics change things.  People who  think things
could be better than they are now change things.  And the media
needs to suspend its chronic disbelief and provide forums and
straight reporting of an urgently needed conversation between
American leaders -- in our political and in our cultural lives
-- and the American public.  In other words, they need to grow
up and stop smirking and jeering at everything from the sidelines.
<P>
<b>The Good things in Life</b>
<P>
 My second suggestion for the media is to focus a little less
on our pathologies and a little more on our potential.  In a world
where the media is only on the constant lookout for trouble-makers,
can they truly be helpful in the search for problem-solvers? 
In a world where the media is on a constant treasure hunt for
failures, can they be truly helpful in spotlighting our successes?
<P>
 Sadly, up to now the media has been content with seeing its role
as one of ripping up all our delusions, deflating all our myths,
exposing what's wrong with every idea and initiative.  Where has
this left us as a culture?  It's left us wandering around dazed
and depressed, overwhelmed by our problems and oblivious to the
solutions within our reach.  If we are to survive as a civilization,
this spiral of nihilism and negativism cannot continue.  
<P>
 Whether you agree with the concept of public journalism or not,
it's a movement gaining ground precisely because it's based on
the assumption that the media have a stake in their communities
and in citizens being able to solve community problems.  During
the Civil Rights movement, many journalists saw their role as
educating the public and moving the country toward policies aimed
at racial justice.  They offered opportunities,  over years of
discussion, for politicians and for the country to come to a democratic
moral conclusion over the inadmissibility of segregation.  Today,
in a  country that has always prided itself on looking at problems
and seeing opportunities, the media looks at opportunities and
sees only problems.
<P>
 My third suggestion for members of the media is to remember that,
as that great Greek Pericles, said, "Courage is the knowledge
of what is not to be feared." The great journalists of the
future will not be found among those fearful of losing the approval
of their peers.  It's a law of nature that no great journalist,
no great political leader, no great artist, no scientist was ever
born by looking over one's shoulder for approval.  Anwar Sadat
wrote in his memoirs that he was only able to think of bold moves
for peace in the Middle East when he stopped looking for acclaim
-- closing his ears to the roar of the crowd and craning, instead,
for the small, still voice within.
<P>
 In the final analysis, the American people deserve more from
the media than pious preaching and abuse from television anchors
when they fail to live up to their standards of maturity.  Yes,
they do deserve to be informed, but information is a two-way street.
 A little listening to what actual Americans believe might do
the media an awful lot of good.  And once we sweep away the broken
shards of cynicism, perhaps the media can return to where it started,
look on America with new eyes, and see both the fullness of the
world as it is and the promise of the world as it could be.

<title>A People's Budget -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <a href="/pff/"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" border="0" align="right"></a><br>

<h2>A People's Budget</h2>
</center>
<ul><blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<p>
What would the budget of the United States government look like if policymakers in Washington followed the instructions voters set last November?  It would be the most complete transformation of the government in Washington at least since the Great Society:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The responsibility for running and paying for state and local programs would be returned to the states and localities, where it belongs -- and where people can hold elected officials more accountable for producing results.
<li>
The government in Washington would be nearly one-third smaller, as a percentage of GDP, than it is today.  At 15.7 percent of GDP, it would be the smallest it has been since 1951.
<li>
Most Federal excise taxes would be eliminated, and the income tax cut by 22 percent, giving people the funds to take care of themselves and their families, and giving states and localities the tax base they would need to take on their new responsibilities.
<li>
Medicare would begin the transformation from a 1960s "command and control" bureaucracy to a 1990s system of consumer choice.
<li>
Corporate welfare and subsidies for the privileged, powerful and elite would be eliminated.
<li>
The Federal budget would be balanced, and the debt would begin to shrink rapidly relative to the size of the economy.  With Medicare saved from bankruptcy and the budget deficit finally eliminated, the foundation would have been created to deal with the looming crisis in Social Security.
</ul>
<p>
That, at least, is the answer contained in <b>The People's Budget: A Common Sense Plan for Shrinking the Government in Washington</b>, crafted by some of the nation's foremost thinkers on the future of America, including:  Ed Dale, <i>New York Times </i>reporter on the budget for 20 years; Jeff Eisenach, President of the Progress and Freedom Foundation; Frank Luntz, 1992 Perot Presidential Campaign and 1994 Contract with America Pollster; Tim Muris, former budget official in the Reagan Administration; and, William Schnieder, defense expert currently at the Hudson Institute.
<p>
Designed not for Washington, D.C. policy experts but for the American people, <b>The People's Budget</b> will be sold in bookstores nationally beginning June 1. (It will be available May 15th by mail; order at 1-800-955-5493.) Unlike other pundits who asked how much the budget needed to be cut to be in balance, the authors of <b>The People's Budget</b> asked what type of government do people want in Washington, and then made the budget accordingly.
<p>
And the type of government people want was made loud and clear on November 8, 1994, when the American people voted for Big Change.  Nearly 73 percent said on the day after the polls closed that the Federal Government was too big. 27 percent said it should be cut between 21 and 41 percent, while a stunning 33 percent of Americans said the Federal Government should be cut between 41 and 60 percent.
<p>
Indeed, when examined by the standards of what makes sense to the American people, all kinds of seemingly sacrosanct Washington government activities do not make sense and are ripe for change -- even though many of them had a worthy purpose when they began. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Do paid bureaucrats in Washington, DC know better than the citizens of individual cities, towns and counties how to provide help to the poor?  Common sense says they do not.  But in Washington, the idea of turning welfare back to the states is "radical."
<li>	
Should the defense establishment continue using a procurement process that leads to billions of dollars in waste?  Common sense says the Department of Defense ought to operate more like a modern business than a 1930's bureaucracy; but in Washington it's a "radical" idea.
<li>	
Should special interest groups -- from corporations to labor unions, farmers to artists -- receive billions of dollars solely because they possess the political power to demand and get them?  Common sense says no; but in Washington, it is considered "radical" to go against the special interests.
<li>
Should programs that have been tried for twenty years or more in such areas as job training and education and have a record of failure be allowed to continue?  Common sense says no, but in Washington it is "radical" to terminate any program that sounds like it is intended to help children or the poor.
<li>	
Should Medicare be allowed to race towards bankruptcy, when we know how to modernize and transform the system to provide more choice for senior citizens at a lower cost to everyone?  Common sense says no; but by Washington standards, real changes in Medicare are considered "radical."
<li>	
Should a bureaucratic government designed in the 1930s, a government Americans rate as the biggest single threat to the country's future progress, which intrudes increasingly on the freedoms Americans so cherish, which levies taxes so heavy that they kill opportunity and destroy jobs and runs a deficit so high it squeezes out private sector investment -- should such a government be allowed to continue?
</ul>
<p>
Washington's answer is that fundamental change is "too radical."  The people's answer, say the authors of <b>The People's Budget</b>, is that fundamental change is nothing more than common sense.
<p>
In essence, the Federal Government people want is one that stops taking money from people, localities and states to do things that ought to be done, and mostly still are, by people, localities and states.  It is a Federal Government that stops taking on functions which  it performs badly. It is a Federal Government that gets back to the basics: national security; social insurance (Social Security and Medicare); paying interest and paying down the national debt; and, a few other core functions (Treasury, Justice and State Departments).
<p>
The basis for this desire springs from the belief of the American people that the Government in Washington is not in a better position to tell someone in their home town and state how to build roads, educate their children or house their poor. And if the Government in Washington is going to cede control over these activities to their rightful locale, then it makes no sense for the Federal Government to tax people, bring the money to Washington and then send it back -- with or without strings.
<p>
Exactly what do people get from this plan?  They get a Federal Government nearly one-third smaller than today -- the smallest since 1951.  They get the elimination of nearly all Federal excise taxes and a 22 percent cut in income taxes.  They get a government down from today's 22 percent of GDP to 15 percent -- which frees resources to empower communities and the private sector. And, they get a balanced budget by the year 2002.
<p>
But most importantly of all, the American people will restore the American dream.  <b>The People's Budget</b> aims to create a legacy for our children by stopping a financially and morally bankrupt government in Washington from mortgaging our generation and our children's future.
<p>
That is what the five authors propose in the first full-fledged budget of US government ever produced by an independent think tank. It is a "People's Budget" both because the people last November signaled their conviction that the role of Washington should be sharply changed and reduced, and because the plan will bring decision making closer to the people themselves -- to individuals, families, neighborhoods, local governments and state governments, in that order.  The authors emphasized that what they are offering is not merely a list of proposed spending cuts; it is more, even, than a series of proposals.  What the authors have done is develop a full- fledged budget for the United States government:  A complete blueprint for downsizing and transforming the government in Washington into a smaller, more modern, less intrusive, more effective, and much less expensive institution.  The numbers and the economic assumptions add up -- they just add up to less money for the government and more money for the people.
<p>
<p>
<i>In <b>The Strange Death of Liberal England</b> by George Dangerfield, the editors found the following quote describing British Prime Minister Asquith: "In composing his 1909 Budget he was faced with an enormous deficit....The Budget he then contrived came to be known as the "People's Budget," because it aimed a rude blow at the rich, and more especially the Lords."</i>

<title>Debunking Cyber Hype -- PFF</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Debunking Cyber Hype</h2>
<b>Silicon Snake Oil:</B>
<P>
By Clifford Stoll, Doubleday 1995, 247 pages
</center><P>
<p>
<p>
 At last, a book on telecommunication's new era by someone who
is neither geek nor reactionary; a book that lives up to its dust-jacket
promise of being "full of passion but devoid of hysteria."
 <B>Silicon Snake Oil</B> is a book that delivers, in passing,
this minor miracle: Explaining the technology, and much of the
related culture, without a clue as to the author's politics --
making for a provocative work that ought to offend no one ideologically.
<P>
 Why is it provocative? Not because of the promised "ambivalence."
Author Clifford Stoll emerges much less ambivalent than the book's
opening. In chapter 10, a rollicking debunker of electronic mail,
you find this disarming mid-page pivot: "even as I write
this, I'm having second thoughts."  A lot more of the book,
however, is lighthearted fantasy-evictor.
<P>
 Stoll unravels media calculations about how many Americans really
are "on the net." Video-on-demand "will remain
a dream," in part because "keeping a thousand movies
ready for instant retrieval" is a "surprisingly tough
engineering problem." Electronic books? "Your every
suspicion is correct."  As for CD-ROMs: "Don't be suckered
in by claims of double-speed or quad-speed drives: Unless a database
is designed with the right kind of index, searches just poke along.
And when lots of people access a CD-ROM volume over a network,
everybody hangs suspended, banana-like, in lime-flavored Jell-O."
<P>
 On it goes: The reader encounters bucket after bucket of cold
water -- but without acid. So I can't agree with <I>Washington
Post</I> reviewer Stephen Bates when he calls <B>Snake Oil</B>
"essentially a venting of the author's cyber-dyspepsia."
The book has much humor, and some sorrow -- but almost zero anger.
(Yes, the title is a bit snarly, but it was probably imposed by
the PR folks.) "Quirky" is probably the harshest thing
one could fairly say about this book. 
<P>
 For example, the author conducts a dozen simple experiments,
one of which exonerates a system hated by technoid and redneck
alike. He has his brother mail him a postcard -- from western
New York to northern California -- every day for two months. "Half
the cards arrived in two days; many took three days, and one required
eight days -- [but] every postcard arrived. At the same time,
I sent e-mail to myself from five different remote accounts. Most
letters arrived within two hours; some took up to two days --
[and] five messages never made it."
<P>
 And yet: "If one sack of mail gets burned by a disgruntled
letter-carrier, it makes headlines across the country. Should
the university's computer crash and destroy three days of incoming
mail, everyone shrugs," Stoll observes. Society is cutting
the new and mysterious much more slack. "We're familiar with
the mechanisms of letter-delivery, so we hold the postal service
to a high standard."
<P>
 At other points, Stoll makes no-tech devices seem vastly more
interactive and creative than the high-gloss new gear: Consider
"a two-dollar pack of cards. There's a thousand games to
play. You can invent new ones, change the rules, build a house,
or tell a fortune. They work equally well in the backseat of car
or around a campfire. Anyone you meet can understand and join
in. If you get frustrated, throw the pack out the window. Try
that with your Pentium."
<P>
 At least three categories of people would profit or otherwise
benefit from <B>Snake Oil</B>:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Librarians. Stoll, a lifelong researcher, shows how their
trendy, budget-busting administrative colleagues, by doing things
like substituting terminals for the old card catalogue, are alienating
patrons and hurting low-income groups. In short, rank-and-file
librarians need spine-stiffening.
<P>
<li>Editors. Boom times loom for text-managers of all types,
as "Internet hype" makes smart people feel stupid and
swamped. How? By drowning them in digital data and potential knowledge
when they can't even make time to read their favorite magazines
and newspapers.
<P>
<li>Conservatives who battle Utopianism but are lately overtaken
by telecomm's alluring giddiness. You know who you are, and that's
okay, because your reviewer faces the same temptations.
<P>
</ol>
A fourth and final group of beneficiaries is small in total
numbers, but probably represented surreptitiously in your office.
They believe what Stoll is too good-natured and laid-back to say:
The real "computer" is the one God gave you. As self-improvement
founder Earl Nightingale put it in 1972, the human mind is "the
greatest agency ever to appear on earth -- and you own one, free
and clear." By that standard, all the rest of these devices,
from the 50-cent diskette to the fabulous Pentium itself, are
peripherals. For those who occasionally realize this in private,
Stoll's book is a fortifier. 
<P>
<B>CB Sludge and Forks in the Road</B>
<P>
 Finally, where does Clifford Stoll come down on the "fork-in-the-road"
telecomm issues, those places where America as a whole contemplates
its long-term direction?
<P>
  He denies commercialization will make computer networks cheap
and easy for everyone. Salespeople, he claims, "can never
be replaced by listings of goods to sell. No pretty network graphics
will make this job obsolete. Plenty of businesses are hot to exploit
cybersales. I'll bet that most lose their shirts. Today, about
the only ones making money are the communications and computer
companies."
<P>
 What about the era of "boundless bandwidth" forecast
by George Gilder? More users and "flashier services"
will use it all up, claims Stoll. "If every user expects
the kind of service that's being touted by today's Internet hustlers,
a gigabyte per-second bandwidth won't be enough."  As with
the second-wave highways, traffic will keep expanding ahead of
capacity.
<P>
 Education: His skepticism about multimedia and distance-learning
may give pause to those of us who raved about Lew Perelman's 1992
masterpiece <B>School's Out</B> and its "hyperlearning"
menu of "tools, not schools." Won't expensive equipment
be a magnet for thieves and vandals? Then stick with pencils and
a blackboard, says Cliff Stoll: After all, "you can keep
going even if the chalk breaks." Unfortunately, <B>Snake
Oil</B> never tackles Perelman's fundamental point that this new
technology allows children as individuals to discover their hidden
excellence, in ways discouraged by the command-and-control "sage
on the stage" model.
<P>
 As for Universal Access: Even assuming high-capacity networks
can reach this stage, Stoll's model is playfully disconcerting.
He was in grad school when C.W. McCall paid his Top 40 "Convoy"
tribute to trucker gangs and First Lady Betty Ford became "First
Mama" on (gulp) <I>citizens-band radio.</I> "Strangely,
CB fulfills many of the goals of the emerging National Information
Infrastructure: It supports cheap universal access, with neither
censorship nor restraint of communications. It supports both commercial
and private application. Heavily used, too. Yet what a barren
landscape" And what an ominous comparison.
<P>
 So what does Stoll like? Toward the end of <B>Snake Oil</B>,
only two paths shine. One is living "a real life in a real
neighborhood." The other is local bulletin boards. If that's
the case, paradise becomes Blacksburg, Virginia, where a Bell
Atlantic experiment, using high-density cables instead of modems,
lately allows hassle-free multimedia electronic interaction among
a third of the townspeople. Since it's the only place uniting
their very different telecomm visions, maybe Stoll and Gilder
ought to have a Summit there. I'd love to be their transcriber,
and would admittedly need a laptop.

<H2> Dreaming of America's Future in Space
</H2>
by Newt Gingrich
</center>
<p>
<HR>
<P>
 I have a very optimistic vision of the future. The exploration,
development, and settlement of space is really an American tradition.
There's a lot of interesting science and technology to it, but
in the end it's really about the American idea.  As President
Ronald Reagan said in his first inaugural address "We have
every right to dream heroic dreams... After all, we are Americans."
<P>
 The tradition of our society has been one of being very aggressive
in seeking out and taking on frontiers. Today, we are at the start
of a period where we face both very bold frontiers here on the
planet, with the beginning of what I think will be considered
the age of molecular medicine, and at the same time, very bold
frontiers off the planet.
<P>
 By the way, I have very good credentials in the space field.
I go back to the days of Missiles and Rockets Magazine which is
probably beyond the memory of a lot of the younger folks reading
this newspaper. I can even remember when they were separate publications,
so I got interested in space very early.  Later, when I was a
sophomore (2nd year member of the House of Representatives), I
introduced a Northwest Ordinance for Space legislation (see Title
II of HR 4286 from the 97th Congress, 1981) which was looked on
as a joke at the time. But it basically raised the question when
there are enough people off the planet, what are the organizing
principles by which they apply for admission to the United States?
<P>
 Now, I cite that for this reason remember that President Thomas
Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase and then launched Lewis
and Clark's expedition across the continent. What then is a comparable
size gamble for the United States today? I mean, today people
say they are Jeffersonians, by which they mean they are for limited
government. Jefferson was for limits... he never did more than
send the Marines to Tripoli, or buy half the continent, or send
a scientific team to explore a path to the Pacific. So within
those limits, what is the comparable journey, what are the comparable
things we could do in space today?
<P>
 It's very important that as Americans we bring our imagination
to the challenge of the space frontier.  And politicians in Washington
need to hear your ideas for what goals could move the nation,
and the world, to really take on the space frontier.  If we want
to maximize the human race's opportunity to move out into space,
and if we want to ensure that freedom is the philosophy that the
human race carries out into space, then what should our policies
here in Washington be?
<P>
 This question leads me to a couple of observations. First, America
needs a project, with our European and Japanese allies, big enough
to genuinely draw together the Free World. During the Cold War,
we were driven together by the Soviet Empire. If we don't find
several very big projects that tie us together, we are, in fact,
gradually going to fall apart.
<P>
 And they have to be real projects, where everyday people are
working with each other. Two ideas would be to land on Mars or
to begin the permanent human habitation of the Moon. But these
are the sort of minimum size projects. You need to think about
what is big enough, over the next twenty or thirty years, to bring
our systems together. Because, if you take the total economic
resources of the United States, Europe, and Japan. These are enormous
economic systems. And for a relatively tiny percentage - say
the amount we spend, say, on dog and cat food - you can in
fact achieve enormous breakthroughs if it is spent intelligently.
<P>
 However, let's not replicate the last generation of government
bureaucracy. Let's try new methods, such as prizes, which worked
very well in aeronautics up through the 1930s.  We can use X-projects experimental demonstrations of advanced technologies - or some other entrepreneurial incentive which maximizes the results we get.  Our requirement has to be the cheapest  and fastest possible ways of getting what we want.
<P>
 I've been asking defense contractors to find a way to lower the
amount of time for fielding a new system by eighty percent, and
the cost of production by forty percent, a sort of minimum goal.
We need a similar objective in space. There's no reason that technology
only rises in cost if the government uses it, while in every other
field technology inherently gets cheaper and cheaper.
<P>
 Now, if history is any guide the bureaucracy will come back and
say our goals cost an impossible amount of money so we can't do
it.  This will justify their avoiding taking risks. We have to
have Sir Francis Drake's spirit of adventure. This is a country
where the risk avoidance mentality of government leads people
to go out and hang glide or do cave diving. We want projects for
volunteers, for people who believe they're at the cutting edge
of the human future, and understand that there are some risks
involved. After all, if the Wright brothers had encountered OSHA,
we would never would have had Kitty Hawk.
<P>
 Second, we need to look at revolutionizing how we launch people
and cargo into space.  America needs radically cheaper and more
reliable and frequent access to space. That requires going way
beyond the Space Shuttle both technically and organizationally.
My recommendation is that NASA adopt the role of Delta or United
or American and become a customer of private space transportation.
The government should build multiple Single StageTo Orbit (SSTO)
vehicles to push the state of the art in technology, then encourage
the large contractors to develop fully reusable launch vehicles
that meet commercial and/or government needs. The government would
help out by contracting for a certain amount of guaranteed purchase
from the lowest price bidder(s).
<P>
 And just do it. No committee meetings. No government procurement
rules. No long planning sessions. No micromanagement. No budget
reviews. In other words, exactly the model of Boeing or McDonnell
Douglas selling to an airliner. I've been told by some contractors
that they think they could come in for as low as forty percent
of the cost currently projected for a NASA developed second generation
shuttle, and probably do it in about half the time.
<P>
Third, in the meantime we need to lower to cost of the current
Shuttle by essentially contracting out its operation.  Running
the Shuttle is a management problem; the system doesn't have a
motivation for improving efficiency. It's not something the government
does particularly well.  One alternative is to have a major contractor
take it over on a bid, run it on a commercial basis, have to meet
certain functional specs, and earn big incentives for downsizing.
If they can share in the savings they'll go out and find ways
to do things cheaper, faster, better.  
<P>
 Setting bold goals and cutting the cost of space access will
create enormous opportunities for American industry and entrepreneurs
in space.  But space commercialization will also benefit us here
on the Earth, too.  For one thing, these new space enterprises
are going to create a lot of jobs here in America. And they'll
create new goods and services that we can only make or offer from
space, things that you can't do on the ground. We're going to
learn things that we'll look back at fifty years later and say,
"Well, those are all obvious."
<P>
 But I'm always fascinated by people who will invite you into
their home, turn on their color television set, put on a VCR,
start their microwave oven, and give you a poptop beer, and tell
you that they're really tired of technological efforts. People
always understand the present, and are confused about the future.
The fact is, we are at the edge of a whole series of revolutions
in fields like microminiaturization.  We can now put seventy electric
engines in a space one fourth the size of a postage stamp. But
we can't quite imagine, given this level of technology, what we're
going to be able to accomplish when we put our mind to it, in
the"weightless" but energy and materials rich environment
of space.
<P>
 The odds are pretty high we'll discover a lot of useful and productive
things we can do. They'll improve human health and quality of
life, they'll improve incomes for American workers, and they'll
strengthen our national security. And the way America can be the
leading country in space is to play to our strength free enterprise and focus on space commercialization so we'll have a lot of private as well as public resources driving creative people to open the frontier.
<P>
 This is a critical point. Entrepreneurs are different. In the
Renewing American Civilization course we spend two hours on entrepreneurial
free enterprise, and two hours on the spirit of invention and
discovery. In a sense they are about the same thing.  Because
people who are creativine are different than people who are routine
and ruledominated. People who go out and force success, force
achievement, get the job done, and cut through the red tape, are
different psychologically than people who dot the"i"cross the "t" and make sure they've met the requirements. We are, preeminently, the best country on the planet at being entrepreneurial, and the worst at following rules and running
bureaucratic structures.
<P>
 A very simple demonstration of how ingrained this is in our culture
is to compare drivers in Germany and the U.S.  Germany is a great
bureaucratic country where there's no speed limit on the autobahn.
 But if you imposed a speed limit tomorrow morning virtually every
German would obey it until the election, at which point the current
party would be thrown out and replaced by those promising to repeal
the speed limits.  
<P>
 Most Americans, on the other hand, have a different cultural
response to the challenge of speed limits. For most Americans,
a speed limit is a benchmark of opportunity. Ask yourself and
your friends whether you don't automatically add five or ten miles
per hour to the limit.  
<P>
 Now, there's a very profound message in all of this. You can
get Americans to be excited by the opportunity to do neat things.
But you can't regulate them worth a darn. This is why our public
schools are collapsing in the inner cities. Because we try to
regulate our way through a regulated approach to learning, which
just means all the kids just quit trying. Whereas you can incentivize
people to achieve dramatic change.
<P>
 What Science Committee Chairman Bob Walker and I want to do regarding
space, and where we need your help, is to develop a more traditionally
American approach to the space frontier.  We want to cut through
the regulatory baloney.  We want to create clean, simple zones
of risk taking. We want to establish a tax code which dramatically
favors entrepreneurship and investing in space. We want to explore
the use of prizes, so that if have a goal we want to achieve,
let's set up a prize and whichever entrepreneur gets there first
gets the money.
<P>
 And by the way, not all of these space businesses are going to
be high tech. I will bet anybody that, if we're daring enough,
by the year 2015 a major profit center in space will be operating
a hotel. There's no reason in terms of physics that you can't
get into space for about the cost of a first class ticket from
Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia. That's the fuel expenditure
required to get into space; we just make it artificially more
expensive. So figure out how many people last year flew first
class to Sydney, or flew around the world.  That many people could
be visiting space in 15 or 20 years.  
<P>
 This is real.  Tourism and travel is the second largest industry
on the planet. So when you talk about space, why shouldn't tourism
and travel be the second largest industry in space? Or the largest?
 So why shouldn't we try to get this generation into space? Of
course it's a risk. So is going on safari in Africa. So is going
down the Amazon. The number of people who do various National
Geographic and American Museum and Smithsonian trips, who spend
a lot of money and risk diseases and all sorts of things is just
huge. But in a free society, you're allowed to take some risks,
as long as you're informed. So why shouldn't the search for adventure
expand into space? 
<P>
 Now I'm sure somebody will say "Gingrich wants your tax
dollars to subsidize rich tourists going into space."  That's
crazy.  That's the old model, where government not only funds
but does everything in space itself.  That isn't working now,
and it's not going to work again.  Bob Walker and I are talking
about empowering the private sector to take on these risks.  
<P>
 One idea Bob has been talking about for a long time is to set
up a tax holiday on profits from space.  So for ten or 15 years,
businesses making new products and services in space would be
able to keep 100% of their profits. I'll be fascinated to see
how the Joint Tax Committee scores this idea, since these businesses
don't currently exist and therefore are not paying taxes.  I can't
see how they could score this as a tax loss. In fact, you could
make a pretty good argument that so many new jobs would be created
on Earth to earn the taxfree profits in space, and all these jobs
would be paying taxes, so that you'll have a large revenue increase
for the government by creating the incentive in space.
<P>
 Bob Walker and Chairman Bill Archer of the House Ways &amp; Means
Committee have agreed to hold joint hearings on this idea soon.
My hope would be that, this year, we would pass a tax holiday
on profits made in space, to begin to establish the right incentives.
After all, that's how we built the transcontinental railroad.
Using incentives to influence private behavior has a long Anglo-Saxon
tradition. It's why Francis Drake's tiny ships were often better
than Spanish Galleons, which were much bigger. They had a different
incentive plan. British sailors got to keep the gold. That's at
the bottom of what drove the founding of the American Colonies.
It's only recently that we've used programs and rules to try to
do things; incentives have a much longer tradition in our civilization.
<P>
 But ultimately the responsibility for achieving your dreams for
America's future in space lie with you.  We in Washington need
you to tell us how bold we have to be.  
<P>
You tell us the incentives, you tell us the deregulation, you
tell us how to set up a New American Space Agenda that will work.
And then we'll work with you so that we create the right government
framework within which Americans like you can bring your entrepreneurial
spirit and creativity to the challenge of exploring, developing,
and settling the space frontier starting with this generation.

<title>Privatizing Social Security: Lessons from Chile -- PFF</title>
</HEAD>

<h2>Privatizing Social Security: Lessons from Chile</h2>
<P>
By Mark Klugmann
</center>
<p>
<p>
<P>
 As Americans increasingly question the long-term health of the
Social Security system, they may want to examine how other countries
dealt with problems in their national pension systems. For instance,
in 1980, the government of Chile replaced a bankrupt, government-funded
pension system with a revolutionary innovation:  a privately administered,
national system of mandatory retirement savings.
<P>
 Even before privatizing its steel, electric power, airline, and
telephone companies, this developing South American country had
already transferred its pension system to the private sector.
<P>
 That landmark reform, realized by then-Minister of Labor and
Social Welfare Dr. Jose Pinera, established a model for an increasingly
important global trend:  the private delivery of government-mandated
social services.
<P>
<b>A Private System, Publicly-Regulated</b>
<P>
 Under the Chilean system, the typical worker pays no social security
tax to the state.  Nor, once he retires, does he collect a government-funded
pension.  Instead, during his working life, he automatically deposits
10 percent of his wages each month in an individual investment
account.  This account bears the worker's name, is his property,
and will be used to pay his retirement pension.
<P>
 A worker chooses one of the private Pension Fund Administration
companies (AFP's) to invest his savings.  These companies can
engage in no other activities and are subject to strict government
regulation to guarantee a diversified and low-risk portfolio,
and to prevent theft, fraud or mismanagement.  A separate government
entity was created to provide this oversight. 
<P>
 Unlike most other countries, workers' savings do not enter the
government treasury, nor are they paid out in pensions to already
retired workers (as occurs, for example, in the pay-as-you-go
U.S. Social Security system).  Under the AFP system, the government
does guarantee a minimum pension and does serve as the insurer
of last resort, but those guarantees are funded out of general
revenues, not worker savings.
<P>
 <b>The AFP Company</b>
<P>
 Each AFP operates the equivalent of a mutual fund that invests
in stocks, bonds and government debt.  Although investment decisions
are made by the AFP, government regulation determines which debt
and equity issues are approved for investment and sets maximum
percentage limits both for specific types of instruments and for
the overall mix of the portfolio.  
<P>
 Workers are free to change from one AFP company to another. 
For this reason, there is competition among the companies to provide
a higher return on investment, better customer service or a lower
commission.
<P>
 A worker may contribute up to an additional 10 percent of his
wages to his account each month, as a form of voluntary savings.
 (The first 10 percent of withholding is obligatory on up to U.S.
$20,000 of annual income.) In the branch offices of many AFP's,
there are simplified computer terminals that permit the worker
to calculate his future pension, based on the money in his individual
investment account and the date at which he hopes to retire. The
computer will calcutate how much he must deposit each month to
achieve his retirement income goal and calculate the age at which
he may retire.
<P>
 Worker contributions are free of taxes, as is the AFP investment
account.  Upon retirement, when funds are withdrawn, taxes are
paid, usually at a lower rate.
<P>
 The mandatory savings levels are designed so that the typical
worker will have sufficient money in his AFP account to fund a
pension equal to 70 percent of his final salary, plus survivor's
benefits.
<P>
<P>
<b>Additional Economic Advantages</b>
<P>
 The AFP system solves the typical problem of labor demographics:
 in an aging population the number of workers per retiree decreases.
 With the AFP system of individual retirement accounts, the working
population does not subsidize the retired population.  Thus, in
contrast with the pay-as-you-go system, the potential for inter-generational
conflict is avoided.
<P>
 The problem that many countries face, of unfunded pension liabilities,
does not exist under the AFP system, and instead the economy benefits
from an ever-larger pool of retirement savings available for investment.
<P>
 The system also has the benefit of being fully portable -- the
retirement account is tied to the worker, not the company -- permitting
worker mobility.
<P>
<b>The Results of the AFP System in Chile</b>
<P>
 The Chilean Private Pension System, as of September 1994, managed
an investment fund of U.S. $20,000 million, an unusually large
pool of internally-generated capital for a developing country
of 13 million people and a GDP of U.S. $44,000 million.
<P>
 This long-term investment capital has not only helped fund economic
growth, but also spurred the development of efficient financial
markets and institutions.  The availability of AFP investment
capital made it easier to finance the privatizations of state-owned
enterprises.  In large part due to the effects of the AFP system,
the capitalization of the stock market in Chile equals the GDP,
an extraordinary phenomenon in Latin America.
<P>
 Since the system began to operate on May 1, 1981, the average
return on investment has been 14% per year.  Largely because of
this high return, more than half of new retirees choose to take
early retirement.  At present, six out of seven workers who reach
retirement age have AFP savings that yield pensions in excess
of the government-subsidized minimum.
<P>
 Although pension levels are determined only by contribution levels
and investment performance, pensions under the AFP system have
been significantly higher than under the old, state-administered
system, which required a payroll tax of 25 percent.
<P>
<b>A World Model</b>
<P>
 The success of the Chilean AFP system has been noted by its South
American neighbors, and the system has in the last year been directly
adapted and implemented in Argentina, Peru and Colombia.  (A somewhat
different version is being attempted in Mexico.)  Chilean AFP
companies have entered these markets, linking their knowledge
in joint ventures with local partners and also, in some cases,
with transnational financial companies. 
<P>
 At the level of public policy discussion, the AFP system has
also been advocated in Italy and Spain, and been favorably reviewed
in the economic press in the United States. 
<P>
 Politically, the AFP system has proved popular and has helped
promote social and economic stability.  Workers have a direct
and visible stake in the economy -- they are investors. When the
AFP was inaugurated in Chile in 1981, workers were given the choice
of entering the new AFP system or remaining in the old system.
 Most chose the AFP system, with 500,000 (one fourth of the workforce)
joining in just the first month -- far more than the 50,000 that
had been expected.  Today, more than 90 percent of the workers
who had been under the old system have individually and voluntarily
transferred to the AFP system.
<P>
 As the state pension system disappears, politicians will no longer
decide whether pension checks need be increased, and in what amount,
for which groups.  Thus, pensions are no longer a key source of
political conflict and election-time demagoguery, as they once
were.  A person's retirement income will depend on his own work
and on the success of the economy, not on the government or on
the pressure brought by special interest groups.

Reform.

<title>The Moderate Republican Austerity Trap -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>The Moderate Republican Austerity Trap</h2>
<p>
By Pete du Pont
</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The new majority in Congress had a good 100 days.  More importantly, so did the American people with the passage in the House of tax cuts, the line item veto, the balanced budget amendment and real Congressional reform.
<p>
But one of the Republicans' greatest contributions to the future prosperity of the country went largely unnoticed -- the defeat of the disastrous proposal to irrevocably link tax cuts to deficit reduction. Avoiding this moderate Republican austerity trap did more to ensure future prosperity than the tax cuts themselves.
<p>
Understand exactly what the moderates proposed:  that the tax cuts of the Contract With America be suspended -- in effect, repealed -- in any year between now and "2002 and thereafter" (my emphasis) in which deficit targets were not met. 
<p>
The targets were neatly laid out in a statutory table -- $150 billion in 1996, $125 billion in 1997, scaling down to a balanced budget by 2002.  If President Clinton's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) did not annually certify that each of these targets had been met, tax cuts would be repealed and tax rates would jump back up to the 1995 level.  Adding the word "thereafter" ensures that, from here to eternity, no taxes could ever be reduced in a year in which the budget was not in balance to the penny.
<p>
Such an austerity trap is paralyzing, both economically and politically. 
 <p>
First, it removes from the policy debate the idea of tax cuts to stimulate economic growth, a concept used successfully by Presidents from Kennedy to Reagan.  Even liberal economists 
agree that tax reductions can stimulate growth, and most will admit that annual economic growth in the United States -- averaging an anemic 2.1 percent  over  the last 6 years --  is far below the country's potential.  But the moderates' proposal would prohibit using this fiscal tool at all until another fiscal tool -- spending cuts -- has been totally successful.
<p>
Second, it mandates that economic growth is a lesser goal than deficit reduction.  The experience of the 1980s and the foundation of the huge Republican electoral victories of 1980 and 1994 were based on exactly the opposite principle -- that economic growth and job creation are (after sound currency, of course) the first economic priority.
<p>
Third, it assumes that the current federal tax burden -- about 25 percent of the earnings of the average working family -- is appropriate and should be left in place until the administration says otherwise. But as one House Leader said in closing the tax debate in the House, "won't a little less money for the government and a little more money for... families be a good thing?"
<p>
Fourth, the idea of allowing a few faceless economists at OMB to decide the growth rate of the economy, and thus the number of jobs that will be lost or created, is deeply flawed.  Turning the future prosperity of the country over to basement bureaucrats who have the ability to cook the numbers, and are hostile to tax cuts in the first place, is sheer folly.  The collapse of the 70-year Soviet experiment with this philosophy, and the rejection of socialist central planning around the world, should long ago have consigned this idea to the dustbin of history.
<p>
Finally, the idea is wholly impractical.  How can individuals or small business owners  plan for the coming year, not knowing until several months into the year whether their tax obligation will  go up or down?  They can't, because the answer depends upon how much spending the Congress cuts, and then upon whether some bureaucrats agree they have cut enough.
<p>
Politically, the tax cut-deficit reduction linkage is catastrophic.  It is a return to the 
"me-too" liberal Republicanism of the '60s and '70s in which Republicans agreed in bipartisan goodfellowship with Democratic policies in principle (in this case deficit reduction as the primary economic policy), but at slightly less cost  (in this case tax cuts if the deficit is reduced).   It was a politically disastrous formula, dooming Republicans to permanent minority status in the legislative branch of government.  Returning to it now would abandon the Reagan-Gingrich-Contract With America philosophy of economic growth that won the only victories the Republicans have enjoyed in a political lifetime.
<p>
Adoption of this moderate Republican austerity trap would be a dead-end street.  It was beat back during the first 100 days, but the battle is not over.  Liberal Republican Senators lie in wait, hostile to tax reductions and friendly to bigger government.  Whether Republicans drive a stake through the heart of this vampire before it rises again to suck the lifeblood from the economy and the Republicans' 1994 victory will largely tell the tale of the conservative revolution.

<H2>Cutting Taxes and Improving Education</H2>
By Lawrence W. Reed
</center>
<P>
<p>
<p> 
With more than two dozen states facing lawsuits over the wide
disparities in school spending created by property taxes and most
of the 50 states faced with burning questions regarding the quality
of education, many states are asking: "Has Michigan given
us a model to emulate?" No other state has, in such a short
period of time, done as much as Michigan on the two major fronts
of the education wars -- finance and quality reform.
<P>
 On March 15, 1994, Michigan voters turned out in large numbers
to overwhelmingly approve what <I>The New York Times</I> dubbed
a "revolution" in financing public schools.  In the
process, they swapped most local property taxes for higher taxes
at the state level and implemented strong Constitutional limitations
on the future growth of taxes and school spending at both levels
of government.
<P>
 A month later, Governor John Engler pushed through sweeping changes
in collective bargaining rules for public school teachers.  Those
changes will give broad new authority for school boards to manage
schools by dramatically reducing the clout of teacher unions.
<P>
<B>Tax Revolt</B>
<P>
 The impetus for doing something about school finance in Michigan
arose from widespread public anger over burdensome property taxes.
 Governors and legislators of both parties tinkered with the system
over a twenty-year period, proposing ballot initiatives and statutory
adjustments -- only to be rebuffed by partisan bickering or an
untrusting electorate.
<P>
 By 1993, Michigan's property tax burden had become one of the
nation's highest, driving people from their homes and businesses
from the state.  School spending was above the national average,
and the average teacher salary was nearly the highest in the nation
at $41,490.  
<P>
 At the same time, the state's high school graduation rate was
barely above 70 percent, and there were 15 school districts where
more than 75 percent of the incoming seniors could not pass a
10th grade test and earn a state-endorsed diploma. Public attitudes
increasingly revealed in Michigan what seemed to be holding true
for the nation as a whole -- namely resentment that we were spending
more and more and getting less and less for our money.  
<P>
<B>The Bombshell of '93</B>
<P>
 In July 1993, Michigan lawmakers began a new round of debate
over school finance, after voters had rejected a string of proposals
at the ballot box. A surprise amendment offered by a Democrat
in the state senate to abolish all property taxes for schools
without any plan for replacing lost revenues was embraced by Governor
Engler, and within 24 hours the deal was done.  Michigan would
have no property taxes for schools come mid-1994 -- a whopping
$6 billion tax cut.  Michigan's Great Education Debate was underway.
<P>
 From the start, Governor Engler insisted that the end of property
tax funding for schools should be the beginning of fresh thinking
about all aspects of public education.  Indeed, he put quality
issues ahead of finance issues.  No private business decides on
price before it determines what its product is, he argued, and
neither should government. Declaring before a joint session of
the legislature that "Public education is a monopoly and
monopolies don't work!"; he proposed a regime of choice, competition
and accountability that would empower parents, teachers, administrators
and educational entrepreneurs to break free of a failing, bureaucratic
system.
<P>
 School reformers were disappointed, however, that when the Christmas
Eve compromise materialized, finance changes emerged as far more
significant.  Most of the Governor's quality initiatives had failed
by narrow margins in the legislature, or had been watered down
substantially.  Cross-district choice didn't make the cut.  Measures
to rein in the power of teacher unions were mostly gutted.  Reforms
of tenure and certification were minimal.  
<P>
 The one major quality reform that survived, though in somewhat
diluted form, was the charter school initiative.  Michigan became
the first state to adopt a law that put no upper limit on the
number of charter schools that could be created.  These "borderless";
schools-of-choice can be created anywhere in the state by any
local school board, community college or state university.  Existing
public schools may opt into charter status, freeing them from
certain state regulations.  The goal is for 200 new charter schools
to open their doors by the fall of 1996, each one receiving the
same per-pupil allocation of state funds as that of the district
in which they are located.
<P>
<B>The Voters Make A Choice</B>
<P>
 The Christmas Eve compromise brought forth two radically different
methods for refinancing Michigan schools -- each principally backed
by one of the political parties -- that were put to the voters
to decide.
<P>
 Both plans offered a mix of tax hikes, cuts and shifts, but the
central question that dominated the public debate was:"Which
impacts a state's economy with the least negative effects, the
sales tax or the income tax?"  On this issue, the two plans
were poles apart: Proposal A would have raised the state sales
tax and cut the personal income tax.  The back-up plan would have
left the sales tax unchanged and boost the income tax sharply.
<P>
 By a margin of better than 69-31 percent, the state's voters
approved Proposal A.  As a result of that vote, Michigan's tax
structure for schools will shift from a heavy reliance upon local
property taxes to a mix of mostly consumption taxes imposed at
the state level.  
<P>
 The state's sales tax rose from 4 to 6 percent.   Property taxes
were slashed from a statewide average of 35 mills on all taxable
property to a base of 6 mills on homesteads and 24 mills on second-homes
and businesses.  Michigan taxpayers, on net balance, realized
a tax cut of at least $500 million in 1994 and can expect their
net tax bill for 1995 to be about  $200 million less than it would
have been under the old regime.
<P>
 For the first time, the state now guarantees schools a "foundation
grant"; of at least $4,200 per child.  The highest-spending
districts (the 35 that spend more than $6,500 per child) are permitted
a limited amount of additional, voter-approved property tax millage
to keep their current spending levels intact.  Spending disparities
will still exist, but less than before.  The gap will probably
close sufficiently to inoculate the state from court challenges
on the equity issue that has plagued other states.
<P>
<B>Learning the Lessons</B>
<P>
 The lessons from these developments in Michigan school finance
are numerous, but three in particular may be most instructive
to other states:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Sales taxes are more palatable and less destructive
than income taxes.
</ul>
<P>
 Proposal A succeeded in large measure because the public perceived
it as a choice between these two kinds of taxes.  A common sentiment
was,"I'd rather pay a tax on some of what I buy than a tax
on everything I earn."  The case was bolstered by the fact
that Michigan's 4 percent sales tax was 30 percent below the national
average, and raising it to 6 percent would place it very close
to both the national and regional averages.  The Governor also
frequently and persuasively argued, as most economists do, that
high income taxes are a direct assault on investment, business
expansion, and job creation.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Any tax shift should be accompanied by tax limitation.
</ul>
<P>
 Unlike the unpopular back-up plan, Proposal A incorporated much-needed
taxpayer protections.  For instance: annual increases in property
assessments for tax purposes are capped at 5 percent or the inflation
rate, whichever is less, on each individual parcel; and a vote
of three-quarters of both houses of the legislature is required
before the state government can raise the base rates of property
taxes in the future.   
<P>
 Moving to centralize school funding at the state level is, by
itself, fraught with dangers.  No evidence exists suggesting that
school performance improves the more distant the funding source.
 States like New Hampshire, which rely almost entirely on local
funding of schools and receive very little from the state, consistently
show superior outcomes in the classroom and higher public support
for what schools are doing.  That's primarily because of the old
adage, "He who pays the piper calls the tune."  
<P>
 Less involvement by state government means more local control
by the very people who are most involved with education in the
first place--teachers, principals, and parents.  Less state involvement
almost always means less bureaucracy and politics, lower costs,
more freedom for innovation, and fewer schemes from professional "educrats" in state capitols to "homogenize" and mold young minds.  
<P>
 By itself, Proposal A would have brought with it all of these
dangers.   What saved Proposal A from that prospect was the so-called
"Headlee Amendment" to the Michigan Constitution, approved
by the voters in 1978.  That amendment establishes a ceiling on
state revenue--from all tax sources--of 9.49 percent of personal
income.  Proposal A pushes state revenue right up to that ceiling,
which means that Governor Engler and the Republicans have put
in place a permanent and powerful restraint on the growth of government
in Michigan.  If the teacher unions come to Lansing now and demand
more school spending, even sympathetic lawmakers will have to
say, "We can't legally do that unless we cut spending somewhere
else."
<P>
 State legislatures which seek to shift the funding sources of
public schools would do well to adopt tough tax, revenue, and/or
spending limitations to protect taxpayers and insulate themselves
from public cynicism that might sink any real change in the right
direction.
<P>
<ul>
<li>The  power of state teacher unions is not invincible.
</ul>
<P>
 Though the powerful Michigan Education Association (MEA) -- by
far the state's largest teacher union -- and its allies in the
legislature held most of the education quality reforms at bay
in the first wave of reform, it lost the public relations war
and a major portion of the finance reform battle.  The MEA is
now widely perceived as a self-serving, obstructionist force that
uses its excessive political muscle to thwart needed change. 
 Opening the public education system to a statewide, full-fledged,
fundamental debate has irrevocably shaken the status quo and set
the state on a path toward a more market-oriented, parental choice-driven
system in the future which not even the MEA can stop.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
 Thanks to the sweeping changes enacted since 1993, Michigan parents
and school boards are in the process of taking back their schools.
 What's already been done means that management will manage, and
teachers will teach, in ways they haven't been able to for a long,
long time.  At this time, the Engler administration is working
to scrap the state's school code altogether and replace most state
rules for governing schools with locally-developed and administered
rules.  When that happens, "local control" will have more real meaning in Michigan than perhaps in any other state.  The door will be wide open for implementation of new strategies that make use of new schools, motivated volunteers, state-of-the-art
technology, and private sector-driven cost control.  
<P>
 Michigan's tax structure now imposes less of an overall burden
on enterprise than it did barely four years ago.  Its mix of taxes
is more balanced, so that the state's competitiveness with its
sister states is improved. As a model for other states, it ought
to be at the top of everyone's list.

<title>Karl Marx's Revenge

<h2>Karl Marx's Revenge</h2>
<P>
By Michael Rothschild
</center>
<P>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><I>"No matter how simple at the start, an income tax inexorably
evolves to hideous complexity, political corruption, and public
cynicism."</I></blockquote>
<P>
 Dick Armey a Marxist?  No way. Long before it became fashionable,
the House Majority Leader was an unabashed champion of economic
freedom.  Yet, in the coming struggle over tax reform, Mr. Armey
has inexplicably lined up on the Left.  
<P>
 Rather than wipe out the income tax and replace it with a non-regressive
National Sales Tax, Mr. Armey's so-called Flat Income Tax proposal
is designed to rescue a tax system first promoted in the Communist
Manifesto.  Second only to the "abolition of property,"
Marx listed "a heavy progressive income tax" as essential
to the demise of capitalism.
<P>
 Marx viewed an economy as a zero-sum game.  Like a thundering
steam engine, Marx's economy could only run so fast and produce
so much.  For me to win, you had to lose.  Win-win outcomes were
impossible.  Income -- the accumulation of wealth -- was inherently
evil, because it could only be gained by grabbing it from the
weak.  All profit came from exploitation.  The income tax would
right this wrong, returning wealth to its creators.  
<P>
 Today, we know better.  Or at least we should.  Though zero-sum,
class war rhetoric still shapes the mindset of Liberal Democrats,
the Information Age economy is a positive-sum game where win-win
outcomes are the norm.  New wealth flows from higher performance
at lower cost, a phenomenon driven by technological innovation.
 More like a rapidly evolving rainforest than a steam engine,
the economy is a complex, living system whose growth is limited
only by human creativity and the availability of capital needed
to turn new ideas into reality.  
<P>
 With the dawn of the Information Age, and the worldwide collapse
of socialism, one might assume that the last vestiges of Marx's
misbegotten policies had disappeared.  But there it is -- the
federal income tax -- America's most crucial economic law; a bearded
German policy wonk's remedy for the evils of 19th century capitalism.
 Ironically, now that Dick Armey finally has the power to turn
rhetoric into law, he's trying to revive Marx's tax instead of
leading the charge to eradicate it.
<P>
 As Mr. Armey would certainly point out, he is not pushing for
a "heavy progressive income tax."  Indeed, his Flat
Income Tax would have just one rate.  After taking a standard
exemption, a 17 percent tax would be applied to income regardless
of the amount.  Mr. Armey promises a system so simple that the
1040 Form will shrink to postcard size.  
<P>
 History teaches otherwise.  When first enacted in 1913 as a 1
percent levy on incomes over $4000 (about $70,000 in 1995 dollars),
the federal income tax was a simple, flat tax.  But ever since,
the law's complexity has grown without limit.  Today, the Internal
Revenue Code and regulations weigh in at one million words and
5,000 pages.  On average, the law is "reformed" once
every 1.3 years. Since 1986, 4,000 sections have been added.
<P>
 Evil special interests, their Gucci-shod lobbyists, and PAC hungry
politicians take the blame for punching loopholes in the tax code.
 But these folks are merely acting out roles made inevitable by
a tax system based on the concept of "income."
<P>
 Because income is not inherently evil, anyone can make a reasonable
case as to why at least some of their income should not be defined
as taxable "income" or why some of their expenses ought
to be deducted from the calculation of "income."  Is
it fair to treat as taxable "income" money saved for
retirement?  What about "too much" savings?  How much
is "too much?"  What about mortgage interest?  Or college
tuition?  Or business lunches?  
<P>
 No matter how flat or simple when it starts out, an income tax,
by its very nature, inexorably evolves into hideous complexity,
political corruption and public cynicism.  Year after year, the
loophole-ridden income tax law erodes the public trust on which
our democracy is founded.
<P>
 Setting a tax rate is easy.  The hard part is defining precisely
to what that rate should apply.  That's why virtually every word
in the tax rules attempts to distinguish "taxable income"
from "non-taxable income," supposedly ill-gotten gains
from honest earnings.  Rules and exceptions.  Exceptions to exceptions.
 This is the shadowy domain inhabited by tax accountants, tax
lawyers, tax lobbyists and Congressional staffers, who pour over
IRS texts, contorting the language to free their clients from
tax hell.
<P>
 No such massive waste of human talent plagues the sales tax.
 Forty-five states, home to 98 percent of all Americans, already
rely on sales taxes and not one state has suffered from creeping
definitional complexity.  Every final retail purchase triggers
a known tax.  Cash registers figure it out and merchants send
it in.  "Ripping out the income tax by its roots," and
replacing it with a National Sales Tax, as proposed by House Ways
and Means Chairman Bill Archer would mean no more 1040 forms.
 No more late nights.  No more tax accountants.  No more tax lawyers.
 And no more IRS.  
<P>
 This is precisely the kind of profound, transformative change
that the new Republican majority in Congress promised the American
people.  No matter how well-intentioned, any "reform"
of the income tax -- whether its labeled flat, simplified or consumption-based
-- will come back to haunt those who champion it.  Back in Gorbachev's
time, such economic reforms were called "half-measures."
 Rather than face up to the need for genuine change, these so-called
"reformers sought to rescue the destructive system
they had inherited.  
<P>
 But if an NST is so dramatically superior to any form of income
tax, why are so many otherwise clear-thinking people like Dick
Armey afraid of it?  Simply put, because they see no way to avoid
the harsh impact that sales taxes typically impose on low-income
families.  Since lower-income families spend virtually all their
earnings on basic consumption, critics contend that an NST would
be severely regressive, taxing away a larger share of the income
of the poor than of the rich.
<P>
 But this problem easily solved with a universal rebate.  Assuming
a family of four spends $25,000 on basic consumption, at a 20
percent rate, the NST would cost them $5,000.  But that $5,000
would be rebated in quarterly payments of $1,250.  Simply listing
their names and social security numbers on a postcard would qualify
a family for a rebate adjusted by its size.  Regardless of income
level, every family would get a rebate that makes their basic
consumption tax free.  
<P>
 The universal rebate eliminates regressivity and the need to
calculate and report on income, consumption, or savings.  Your
taxes would be based on your demonstrated ability to pay.  If
you splurge on that $80,000 Mercedes, you'll pay $16,000 in NST,
while I pay just $2,000 on my $10,000 Plymouth Neon.  With elegant
simplicity, the NST punishes the playboy while rewarding the miser.
 <P>
 Rejecting Marxist envy, the moral message conveyed by the NST
is, "No matter how rich you get, if you save and help grow
the capitalist rainforest by financing new technologies and jobs,
you pay no tax.  You only pay when you take resources out of the
economy and consume above a basic level."
<P>
 If Republican leaders, like Dick Armey, mean it when they promise
Americans a new "Opportunity Society," they should begin
by eradicating the federal income tax.  Notwithstanding Karl Marx,
there is no shame in getting rich.  There is only shame in "reforming"
an income tax designed to prevent all Americans from doing so.

<title>The Myth of the Coming Balanced Budget Recession -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<center><h2>The Myth of the Coming Balancing Budget Recession</h2></center>
<p>
<center>By John E. Berthoud</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The recent Balanced Budget Amendment debate, along with renewed pledges from the Congressional leadership for a budget resolution that will put the federal government on a glide path to zero deficit, have spurred numerous denouncements from economists of the idea of budget balance.  While granting that eliminating the deficit may help with long-term economic growth, many prophesy short-term disaster. Laura Tyson, new Director of the National Economic Council, has long warned that cutting the deficit too fast could greatly harm the economy.
<p>
Will the gut wrenching fiscal decisions required to bring our federal budget into balance lead us into recession?  International experience indicates that such gloom-and-doom projections are off the mark.  There are numerous international examples which show that balancing the budget, far from hurting an economy, might actually be an integral part of economic resuscitation and growth.  The United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and Denmark all clearly show this to be the case.
<p>
Throughout the 1980's, Margaret Thatcher made huge cuts in public spending in the 
United Kingdom to achieve budget balance.  Between 1980 and 1992, public sector employment fell by 26 percent, largely through substantial privatization efforts.  The government also made cuts in social welfare spending which had ballooned in the preceding decades.  What were the economic results?  Budget balancing seems hardly to have been detrimental to economic growth.  There was an almost-inverse relationship between bringing the budget into balance and the unemployment rate.  From 1981 to 1989 the UKs budget deficit fell steadily going from a deficit 
of 4.7 percent of GDP in 1981 to a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in both 1988 and 1989.  During the same period, the unemployment rate fell from 10.5 percent to 7.3 percent and GDP, which as a percent of GDP shrank by 1.3 percent in 1981, was in 1988 and 1989 growing at 5 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.
<p>
Interestingly, there was an outcry from economists in the UK similar to what we are 
hearing now in the United States.  At the beginning of Thatchers austerity efforts, 364 
economists wrote a letter to The Times denouncing her for balancing the budget, claiming it would destroy the economy. Their gloomy projections obviously did not pan out.
<p>
Australia is another country which brought its budget into balance with no apparent 
negative economic consequences.  In the 1980's the government pursued a policy of balance through large cuts-in social welfare spending along with cuts in aid to the states.  The budget, with a deficit which-peaked at 4.1 percent of GDP in 1984 fell and went into surplus by 1988.  The unemployment rate fell from 8.5 percent in 1984 to 6.8 percent in 1988 and 5.7 percent in 1989.  GDP growth was strong in these years as well, growing at 4.8 percent and 3.0 percent of GDP respectively.
<p>	
Some of the most in-depth work on this question has been done by two Italian economists, Francesco Giavazzi and Marco Pagano.  Contra Keynes, their analysis of European fiscal policies and economics shows a clear relationship between decreases in government spending and increases in private domestic demand.  Denmark and Ireland are, however, the two most striking cases of "expansionary stabilizations" in Europe.  In Denmark, the fiscal reversal turnaround of 1982 was followed by a very strong expansion over the next four years.   In Ireland a fiscal 
stabilization in the late 1980's led to economic growth, although a similar effort in the early 80's had led to recession.  Interestingly, throughout Europe cuts in spending have a simulative effect, but Giavazzi and Pagano find that there is a negative correlation between increasing taxes and private consumption which they note is consistent with the predictions of Keynesianism.
<p>
Denmark, which had seen spiraling debt in the early 1980's (public debt as a percent of GDP-grew annually by 10.2 percent from 1979 - 1982) elected a Conservative government in late 1982 which-opted to largely slash spending to restore fiscal balance (although taxes were also raised). Complementary monetary and exchange rate policies were also adopted.  As a result of these efforts, the debt to GDP ratio started declining.  While this contractionary fiscal policy was underway, real-GDP grew by an average of 3.6 percent over the years 1983-1986.  Other measures also jumped upwards-including consumers confidence, private consumption and total 
real wealth.  Interestingly, consumer-confidence rose markedly when taxes were being raised and public services cut.
<p>
Ireland faced a similar situation to Denmark in the early 1980's.  In 1981, public debt as a 
percent of GDP was 87 percent.  A policy of fiscal austerity was adopted.  As with Denmark, monetary policy and exchange rate policies complemented the fiscal policy retrenchment.  Also like Denmark, after initial devaluation, Ireland pegged its currency to the Deutsch Mark and liberalized capital flows. Initially in 1982, fiscal retrenchment caused economic slowdown.  Private consumption fell 7.1 percent in 1982 and remained flat for two years.
<p>
But in 1987, the new government led by Charles Haughey enacted another series of 
retrenchments cutting the deficit substantially and causing the debt to GDP ratio to start declining for the first time in almost twenty years.  Economic growth was relatively strong during this second retrenchment.  What was the key difference from the first period of austerity?  While there were-several differences, the most significant was that the deficit was reduced largely through spending cuts rather than tax increases.  And while some (although very little) of the budget balancing in the second instance was done through increases in taxes, these revenues only came 
from broadening the base, not from raising any rates.  Marginal rates in fact actually fell slightly during this period.
<p>
In Denmark, the combination of fiscal and monetary policy changes led to a decline in 
interest rates and thus there was a wealth effect increasing consumption.  But the wealth effect cannot fully explain the changes in consumption.  The remaining increase was due to cuts in government spending. In Ireland, disposable income appeared to be the key factor driving consumption and thus there was a Keynesian contraction in 1982.  But in 1987, when contractionary fiscal policy was conducted largely through cutting spending and there was a liberalization in the credit market, Irish private consumption boomed.
<p>
How can cuts in government spending prove to be simulative to the economy?  After all, didnt Keynesian economics teach us just the opposite?  Giavazzi and Pagano believe their findings prove the theories of the German Council of Economic Experts who have argued that cutting spending leads to private sector expectations of lower taxes in the future, thereby leading to a simulative impact on the economy.  In Europe, economic actors have realized that a reduction of government spending and borrowing today will mean lower taxes and a more robust economy tomorrow.  Thus, cuts in government spending and deficits are quite logically accompanied by coincidental expansions in private consumption and strong overall growth.
<p>
The empirical lessons from Europe and Australia are clear: the coming federal government retrenchment does not necessarily mean hard economic times for the United States.  Critical to our economys future growth, however, is for the Republican Congress to make good on its promises and balance the budget through cuts in spending, not increases in revenues.

<center><h2>Religion, Politics and Society</h2></center>
<center>An Interview with Ralph Reed</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><center>
<font size= "-1">American Civilization speaks with Ralph Reed, Executive Director of the Christian Coalition, about the broadening public policy interests of evangelicals, about the characterization and reality of evangelicals, and about their goals over the next several years. </center></blockquote></Font>
<p>
<b>AMCIV:</b> Are you worried that by engaging the Christian Coalition in support of the Contract with America or tax issues that you risk being characterized as just another special interest group, no different than business groups or teachers unions who are more interested in economic issues than moral issues?
<p>
<b>REED:</b> Well, I think that there is often a close distinction between what constitutes an economic and what constitutes a moral issue.  I mean, certainly whether or not we're going to continue to run up a national debt that we have no intention of ever paying and saddling our children and grandchildren with 
that debt, is clearly a fiscal issue. But it is a fiscal issue with a moral component. 	Welfare reform ultimately is a cultural and moral issue because it deals with whether or not we're going to subsidize out of wedlock births while discouraging and punishing marriage, work and family.
<p>
I think the issue of tax policy is ultimately a values issue because it reflects the priorities of a society.  If you tax job creation and you tax family formation while subsidizing illegitimacy and subsidizing other forms of social propriety, you are making a values statement as well as a fiscal statement.  
<p>
So I have always felt that the false dichotomy between the moral and cultural agenda on the hand and the fiscal and economic agenda on the other hand was something created by our critics and our foes to marginalize our movement and to confine us to a very narrow band of issues.
<p>
The Christian activists of previous eras never confined themselves to one or two issues.  The Christian progressive of the late 19th and early 20th centuries worked on issues like temperance and integration, and also worked on issues like the progressive income tax and a need for social welfare programs in the inner cities.
<p>
So I believe we have a broad-based agenda.  That broad-based agenda does not mean that we are the holier subsidiary of any political party.  The Contract with America, I believe, is an ultimately bipartisan document.
<p>
And the high level of support of it is enjoyed among the Democratic caucus, I think, 
demonstrates that. 
<p>
<b>AMCIV:</b>  The Christian Coalition is often portrayed by media as having a narrowly defined agenda with one true goal, which is trying to legislate the nation's morals.  How do you respond to that characterization?  Is it accurate, and if not, can you give us an accurate portrait of evangelicals who are active politically?
<p>
<b>REED:</b> Our agenda is to persuade and not to impose.  It is to include and not to exclude.  It is to bring more people into the political process and not reduce the number of people in the political process.  
<p>
We don't want to dominate, but we do want to participate.  We don't want to exclude the minority voice or the women's voice or the union voice or the business voice.  But we do think that those voices need to be enriched by the religious voice and by the moral voice.
<p>	
I don't see that as a left/right issue.  I think whether it's the Children's Defense Fund quoting Old Testament prophets to talk about caring for the least among us, or Martin Luther King invoking his religious beliefs to condemn segregation, or the Christian Coalition bringing its values to bear on issues that concern it, these are all part of a long and cherished history of religion being one of the brightest tapestries in the texture of American politics.
<p>
<b>AMCIV:</b> The dominant political motto in our society currently is that pro-active government help isn't going to work, that government has failed to solve our nations problems and even maybe exacerbating them. Many people are turning elsewhere for solutions, including religion and religious organizations.  What role do you see for religion or religious revival or a searching for spiritualism to help address some of the problems America faces? 
<p>
<b>REED:</b>  Well, I think the ultimate answer to what ails America is going to be spiritual and cultural renewal and not government policies.  We should not try to replace the social engineering of the left over the last 30 years with the social engineering of religious conservatives.  What we ought to be trying to do is not impose our values or Bill Clinton's values.
<p>	
Try to get the federal government out of our lives and out of our pockets and out of our 
homes, so that we can begin to live our own values that we cherish and celebrate in our homes, churches and synagogues.  
<p>
So I think politics ultimately is a relatively small part of the total picture.
<p>
<b>AMCIV:</b> The 100 days of the Contract with America is almost up.  Looking at the longer term, the next 1,000 days or the next several years, what more needs to be done in the political arena to allow the faithful to truly live free lives? 
<p>
<b>REED:</b>  I think after the 100 days we need to more dramatically reduce the role of government.  We need to look at taking entire Cabinet departments and their bureaucracies that are centered in Washington and ship them back to communities, and take the tax dollars that are then saved and apply them to the deficit.  
<p>	
I think the second thing we have to do is we have to secure religious liberty and freedom of conscience for every American, not only for school children desiring to pray in public schools, but also for communities that want to honor and celebrate their religious beliefs in their communities -- nativity scenes on courthouse lawns.  
<p>	
I think we also need to more dramatically reduce the role of the welfare state in our lives.  I think clearly reforming Aid to Families with Dependent Children is a step in the right direction, but we need to look at the full range of entitlement programs, and ask ourselves at every turn whether these needs couldn't be better met by families, by private charities and by churches and synagogues in the faith community.
<p>	
I think we are prepared at the Christian Coalition to issue a challenge to the faith community, that it isn't just a question of these needs being met more efficiently by private individuals.  It is our moral duty and obligation to meet those needs and not turn them over to a government bureaucracy.
<p>	
It is a symptom of our own failure as a faith community that the government has assumed these responsibilities that we should have been carrying all along.  
<p>
<b>AMCIV:</b> If we agree that the federal government should get out of welfare and turn it over to local community groups, private organizations, church organizations, what do you do with the church/state issue?  Because a lot of people are going to say well, these church groups are going to try and help people in their community, but they can't preach, which in a sense, guts those programs of their effectiveness.
<p>
<b>REED:</b>  No, I think that we certainly should not create a situation where the government is subsidizing the propagation of a particular theology.  On the other hand, if a government program provides that a voucher for an individual religion need can be redeemed at a private charity that does not have a religious or theological foundation, it seems to me that that same voucher could be redeemed at a church or a synagogue without violating the historical distinction between church and state.
<p>
We allow people under the GI Bill to go to state universities or to institutions that are church-related.  It seems to me that doing this through the welfare program would be no different.  The aid should be to the individual, the voucher or the aid, and then they go to whatever institution best meets their needs.

<title>The Freedom Model of Telecommunications Deregulation -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h2>The Freedom Model of Telecommunications</h2></center>
By George Gilder</center>
<p>
<br>
New technologies are overthrowing the logic of regulation and offering Americans 
a much improved life. The nascent telecosm will empower individuals and families in 
work, education, entertainment, medicine and even politics.  Among the wonders awaiting 
us in the telecosm is the teleputer, a device which combines both interactive video and 
telecommunications in one unit.  It will replace todays televisions and telephones, and 
give its users the ability to tap into a vast world-wide network of other teleputers.
<p>
The expansive array of available services will include on-demand mass 
communication, highly personalized entry to libraries of texts and films, Internet-style 
forums, teleconferencing between homes and offices, interactive distance learning, virtual family gatherings, telemedicine and access to huge new business markets.  Participation in the telecosm will be affordable for all, not just the rich.  The average American citizen will gain a new enthusiasm, and the authority to directly affect his life in a positive manner, through this highly effective and selective way to manage both his time and information.
<p>
But innovations such as the teleputer, which can be adopted within three years, 
will be delayed an additional five to seven years if Congress fails to immediately de-
regulate the field of telecommunications.  The pace of technological change today is such that technology doubles its cost effectiveness every twelve months.  Every time 
technology is blocked, or its natural fulfillment is stifled, the benefits of this cost-effective doubling are irretrievably  lost.  The secret, as Cal Tech Professor Carver Mead says, is to listen to the technology.  Simply put, time costs money, and neither is a commodity we can afford to waste.
<p>
By stalling on de-regulation, Congress risks the stagnation of stock market values, 
incomes and job growth.  The best solution is a freedom model of de-regulation which 
would allow all existing and future companies to interact in each others business markets without undue government interference or delay, granting only common carrier status in return.  It would remove restrictions to cross-ownership of cable and telephone lines.  It would not force companies to separate their functions unnaturally -- and unprofitably -- into subsidiaries, and it would not impose delayed entry schedules and other invidious tests upon competition.  Finally, it would not demand universal service or any other unnecessary hidden entitlements.
<p>
<b>Phone and Cable Companies</b>
<p>
	Central to new technologies such as the teleputer are the establishment of 
broadband connections to the home.  Cable TV companies are under tremendous pressure from Direct Broadcast Satellite, which is absolutely universal and far superior to cable in both audio quality and video resolution.  Cable providers will not survive unless Congress frees them to find new uses for their connections.  Once unassailable regional telephone companies now face similar threats from new technologies, and need cable TV broadband connections to the home, since duplicating cables connections would be an obvious waste of time and money.  Specifically, telephone and cable companies should be allowed to 
merge or directly collaborate with one another to create fiber optic systems and digital 
services in the phone companies existing territories.
	<p>
Bringing broadband digitally switched services over cable wires to the home will 
require investments of $100 to $300 billion, but these can and should be provided by the 
private sector.  Existing private concerns, and others which may be created, offer the 
means to enter the telecosm without government subsidies or guarantees.  But they cannot 
make the needed investments if a restrictive regulatory regime makes the changeover 
unprofitable.
<p>
Subsidies and guarantees are unnecessary and unwanted.  As there is no way to 
know in advance which companies will succeed in the telecosm, it is both futile and 
counterproductive for government to guess.  The once legitimate concern about 
communications monopolies has been silenced by the centrifugal force of the computer 
chip.  Bigness no longer ensures success in telecommunications.  Government regulation 
supposedly claims to protect competition, but it is the kind of competition where nobody 
wins and nobody loses.  Only competition which permits robust rivalries will bring the 
teleputer and other inventions on-line swiftly.
<p>
Universal service is but one example of how technological change continually 
defies governments ability to manage issues of equity or efficiency through regulation.  
Over the last fifty years, various cross subsidies, mandates and special reserves have 
combined to achieve near universal service in the telephone industry, with 95 percent for America\n homes possessing telephone service.  Conversely, technology itself, with the owering in price of a variety of products, has produced 98 percent television coverage, with no requirement for universal service.  Furthermore, the basic problem of universal service for current wireline cable TV and telephony is that it costs much more to serve rural customers than it does urban customers.  At a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital cellular systems soon will lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold and totally close the gap between the costs of serving rural and urban customers.  This removes the need for either cross subsidies or universal service requirements.
<p>
A freedom model of de-regulation would restrict the powers of state public 
utility commissions to regulate investment and depreciation rules, to ensure rate re-
balancing and pricing flexibility.  Both cable and telephone companies shoulds in order to encourage investment, and eliminate current cross subsidies 
which discourage both competition and the introduction of new services.  The freedom 
model of de-regulation is not likely to be any companys or industrys first choice.  Each, 
of course, would like to preside over a government-protected monopoly which provides 
restrictions on competition.  This is only human nature, but since it is impossible to grant 
special advantages to everyone, it seems logical that free and open competition should be 
accepted as each players second choice.
<p>
Congress has the unique opportunity to free American industry and lead the world 
into an era of unprecedented hospitality for individual creativity, family authority and 
economic growth.  The main beneficiaries of a telecommunications industry organized 
along the principles of the freedom model will be the vast American citizenry. It will allow 
them to take full advantage of the telecosm to exercise greater control over their lives and 
environment.  On the other hand, should Congress fail to adopt a freedom model and 
persist in the illusory hope that government can shape the future through regulation, 
America and her citizens stand to lose up to $2 trillion dollars in new economic activity,  
our world-wide leadership in telecommunications and, worst of all, the personal 
empowerment which the telecosm could provide.  America is at a crucial crossroads in her 
cultural and technological development.  We can only hope that Congress will opt to 
boldly embrace the future, instead of blindly clinging to the past, and choose the option 
that is most in the public and national interests, the freedom model of de-regulation for the 
telecommunications industry.

<title>If We Believe in the Declaration, Weve Got to Transform our Culture -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<center><h2>If We Believe in the Declaration, We've Got to Transform our Culture</h2></center>
<center>By Newt Gingrich</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Americans can no longer escape the reality that three decades of social welfare 
policies have failed, condemning too many of our fellow citizens to lives of despair.  Most Americans want a more compassionate society that will help the truly needy. They want to replace the current welfare system not just to save money, but to create a system that really helps people.
<p>
To accomplish this end will require replacing the culture of poverty and violence 
with a culture of productivity and safety. It is not just helping the poor or focusing on the 
inner cities, but the replacement of one culture with another.
<p>
Efforts to repair or improve the current welfare system are doomed to fail because 
they misunderstand the holistic nature of the problem. In a holistic model, everything 
within the model has to be taken into account.  But in a reductionist model, you attempt to break a problem down into a series of building blocks, deciding which piece you want to 
deal with first.  Theres a very big difference between the two; in the holistic model, every 
piece depends on the other pieces -- if you dont deal with the totality, it does not work.
<p>
Piecemeal efforts to repair our system and its culture of poverty and violence are 
irrelevant and doomed to fail.  Every time we say, "Well, lets do a specific small piece, 
because at least we will make progress," we are wrong. You will have no impact at all, or virtually no impact.  The culture of poverty and violence is so powerful that if you try to change one piece of it, the whole rest of it will thwart your efforts.
<p>
We say, "why dont you go to work?"  And you say, "Fine."  And so we find out 
that if you go to work, you lose Medicaid. One of your children gets sick, you promptly 
lose all the money you just worked for. What we have is an interlocking system, in which 
to change any one piece without thinking through the change of the whole doesnt get you 
anywhere.
<p>
To replace the whole culture of violence and poverty, we must address four key 
realities which define any solution to the problems.
<p>
<b>New Beliefs for New Behavior</b>
<p>
The first reality is that when individuals are caught within a dysfunctional culture, 
they must transfer their loyalties, beliefs and behaviors to another culture to truly change their behavior.  For instance, Alcoholics Anonymous is a conversion experience.  They say, yesterday, I was an active alcoholic.  Today, I am a recovering alcoholic.  Yesterday, when I felt anxiety-ridden, I took a drink.  Today, when I feel anxiety-ridden, I go to my AA meeting and talk to my friends, or I pray -- but there is a conscious effort to rebuildthe entire person and to recognize that the transition to this system from another system is a decisive moment. If you dont have a support structure, if you dont have something which helps you when you start to slide back, youre going to break down.
<p>
<b>Without Money But Not Poor</b>
<p>
Samuel Goldwyn wrote a book about growing up in a low-income community in 
which two different cultures exist side by side in the same neighborhood among people of the same income level.  It is not a circumstance of money.  Being without money and being poor are two different things.
<p>
This is the core problem were faced with because we have confused these two 
distinctions.  This is what Samuel Goldwyn wrote about his childhood:
<p>
"Where else on earth among the poorest people did you see in every home a blue 
and white box where you were supposed to drop your pennies? Once a week, an old 
woman would come around and empty it, and off it would go somewhere overseas.  The poorest of the poor helping still poorer ones across the Atlantic somewhere. Hundreds of sweat shop employees, men and women who sat at machines for nine and 10 hours a day, came home, washed up, had supper, and went to the lodge hall or settlement houses to learn English or to listen to a fellow read poetry to them. I saw workers, welfare workers, scribes, teachers, philosophers, all hoping and striving for one goal, to break away.  And they did too.  America gave them all hope in life, and they repaid America."  
<p>
Goldwyn is talking about people who worked all day and then took a couple of 
pennies, maybe an hours work, to go and pay the poet reader at the community center to give them part of their soul as well as food.  This was the real world.  
<p>
This is not mythical.  This is not some theory.  This was America at the turn of the century.  
<p>
This description begins to make vivid the healthy world of being without money 
which led to two generations of strength, versus the unhealthy world of being without 
money which has led to two generations of disaster.
<p>
<b>One Person at a Time</b>
<p>
<p>Part of the reason it is hard for us to really change things is that we underestimate 
the second reality: cultural change is very hard.  It requires tremendous persistence over time, and can often only be achieved one person at a time.  I think part of what happens tous is we say, "Okay, Im willing to do this for up to a year and a half."  Thats a little bit like a farmer who says, "Ill grow corn as long as it makes it in three weeks. If it doesnt make it in three weeks, Im throwing that sucker out and replanting."
<p>
To break through in a culture and to get people to start dramatically changing their 
behavior means getting to enough individuals by starting with one person, and then two and then three, and then gradually beginning to peel away the whole culture.
<p>
<b>Governments Role</b>
<p>
The third reality is that this kind of cultural change is best done outside 
government.  And I would argue that with the exception of the militarys boot camps, 
there is virtually no government program that gets the level of cultural change you need inside government for the very reason that governments are poor agencies of 
acculturation.
<p>
Americans should be furious when some bureaucrat tries to acculturate them.  You 
should say, wait a second, I pay taxes.  Who are you to tell me whether I ought to be in 
the circle or the square?  Are you nuts?  You work for me.  I dont work for you.  And so you would have a very hard time ever getting an agreement for cultural change delivered by government.
<p>
The kind of cultural change we are talking about requires missionaries.  It requires 
the person who will sit there at 3:00 oclock in the morning holding the hand of the person who is about to commit suicide.  Yes, there are some wonderful government employees.  You find people who are individually fabulous, but you cant recruit to a bureaucracy on 
the premise youll stay there as long as they need you.  You can recruit to a volunteer 
organization on that premise.  Very different models.  And so we sometimes get mad at the bureaucracy, because we ask it to do things it cant do, instead of being more careful about what government can do well and what other parts of society can do better.
<p>	
I would argue that government and politicians have found the first three realities of 
cultural replacement unacceptable.  They have, therefore, tried to find piecemeal short-
term improvements that at least meet their political needs and the publics desire to get something done. Thus for 30 years theyve engaged in a series of underfinanced, short-sighted, small efforts that have failed.
<p>
<b>A New Way of Life</b>
<p>
To truly make a difference, we must move people out of this culture of violence 
and poverty and into a better culture.  This is the fourth reality, that the cultural change 
must be from one way of life to another.  Individual changes within the old culture are 
often overwhelmed by other aspects of the culture. We must make clear that a culture of poverty and violence is not acceptable.  There are millions of Americans who live in that culture right now. What we are saying to them is, look, it is better to work than to be dependent.  It is better to be safe than to be in danger.
<p>
Now, the word "better" is very argumentative.  Some argue that, who are we to 
start imposing what would once have been called middle-class, bourgeois virtues on 
others? The only good answer is, we have already tried a technique of dealing with 
violence and poverty, and we cant stand the result that we see on television.  We cannot stand the pain were inflicting on the children.  We cannot stand the 4-year-old being thrown off the tenement house balcony. 
<p>
People are becoming susceptible to what I call "compassion exhaustion."  Their system, despite their best efforts, has never quite worked. Now theyre terribly disappointed.  They ought to be optimistic. The reason is that in America, very powerful reform movements can emerge very quickly and can have a very powerful impact. 
<p>
We went from the Montgomery Boycott of buses in 1955 to the Civil Rights Acts 
of 1964 and 1965 in 10 years.  You can quickly get to a catalytic moment.  We can 
suddenly begin to have real change very fast. You see this by looking back at American History.  The great American reform movements starting with the Great Awakening of the 
1730s, the Revolutionary Generation, the Jeffersonians, the Jacksonians, the 
Abolitionists, the founding of the Republican Party, and the Progressive Movement were almost all in a 5 to 10- year cycle from beginning, to the process of speeding, to 
consolidation.  In the more modern era, you had the New Deal, which did most of its best work in about five years.
<p>
<b>The Pursuit of Happiness</b>
<p>
Although we may be on the cusp of a great movement to replace our culture of 
violence and poverty, weve got to be very cautious, because this is not a simple thing; it is very hard.  We have failed at it so far because we keep trying to reduce it to a level of simplicity that will make it easy.  It isnt, and it wont be.  
<p>
Let me also suggest that the vision we want to establish is that every American is 
endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  If we actually mean that sentence as our vision, we must add a second sentence: "We owe it to every American citizen to grow-up in a culture and system which ensures their God-given rights and responsibilities as full citizens."  The key here is "every American."  We all sort of say it.  But are we really determined to live it out?  Are we really determined to say every child born in 1995 should absolutely grow up in that kind of framework?  That is a big order.
<p>
To accomplish this goal, we need three really simple principles, visionary 
principles. Every citizen is an American. Every neighborhood is part of America. Every 
child is an American child. The moment we accept that, we have to say to ourselves:  This is a big challenge. We cannot avoid it.  Because every time a child dies for lack of prenatal care or a child gets killed in a drive-by shooting or a child ends up in a room where they are not going to learn anything, we have failed at our vision-level commitment that every American has the right to pursue happiness.
<p>
What we have done is basically cut a deal with the poor.  We said, starting in the 
late 1960s, well maintain you.  Well send you money.  Perhaps being selfish middle-
class people, we never sent enough money, but the theory was, well send you money.  
We will not demand you change your behavior.  You want to have your kids born in total ignorance?  It would be inappropriate for us to interfere.  You want to go to a local school that doesnt work?  Well, at least its not a school we send our kids to.  So well give lip service to changing it, but the truth is, we wont change it.  Well just have study commissions that will say, yes, they should do better. What we have all allowed to happen over a 30-year period is people who do not have what the Declaration of Independence guarantees them. To do that, youve got to, for example, reestablish safety.  Any American whos physically threatened is being cheated of the constitutional provision to provide for the common security.  Because danger is domestic as well as foreign.
<p>
This is, again, one of the things we keep kidding ourselves about.  If we truly want 
healthy inner cities, if we truly want healthy Indian reservations, and if we truly want 
healthy West Virginia Appalachian poor neighborhoods, we are talking about a big 
change.  This is not a small change.  This is one of the largest changes in American 
history.  And we just dont take it seriously.  We pay lip service to it. We walk off and 
when a kid gets killed we say, "Thats sad."  And what I am suggesting is, if we take that child seriously as an American and we take the Declaration and the Constitution seriously, then we must decide in our generation that we are fed up with it and were  going to actually shoulder our responsibility as a country. All of us, including the poor, are making this transition, we are taking on a big challenge.  Maybe in some ways as big as the Cold War.  Its not going to be a small challenge and its not going to happen overnight.

<center><h2>Civilized Reading:<br>
The Americn Presidency:  An Intellectual History</h2></center>
<center>By Forrest McDonald, University of Kansas Press, l994</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Few books written today in American politics reflect the careful and prodigious research, as 
well as the considerable breadth of knowledge and historical insight brought to bear by Forrest 
McDonald than <b>The American Presidency: An Intellectual History</b>.      
<p>        
As one might expect, given McDonalds reputation as a leading scholar on the American 
founding, about half of the book is devoted to a discussion of the numerous influences shaping the creation of the presidency as well as the institutions evolution during the formative early years of the republic.  A noted biographer of Washington and Jefferson, McDonald offers what are undoubtedly the best chapter length treatments on record of the precedent rich Federalist and Jeffersonian Republican eras.  But the standard of excellence that McDonald brings to his discussion of the early period in the evolution of the presidency is matched or exceeded in his carefully crafted analysis of the modern era.
<p>         
McDonalds focus is more compatible with the work of Clinton Rossiter than it is with the 
highly "personalized" perspective on leadership associated with Richard Neustadt.  The Rossiterian influence is evident in McDonalds pronouncement that "the president is during his tenure the living embodiment of the nation.  Hence it is not enough merely to govern well; the president must also seem presidential."  Rossiter perceptively noted that the office of the presidency presents the opportunity for fusing the dignity of a king with the governmental adeptness of a prime minister.    McDonalds discussion of Woodrow Wilson, Ronald Reagan, and Jimmy Carter serves to illuminate, even better than Rossiter did, the "chief of state" and "chief executive" roles. 
<p> 
Shortly before taking office, Wilson wrote that the president "must be the prime minister, as much 
concerned with the guidance of legislation as with the just and orderly execution of law..."   To stress this point Wilson "abandoned precedent by appearing in person to address Congress," much as a prime minister addresses the parliament.
<p>
<b>The Magisterial Office</b>
<p>
While Wilson focused his energies on the "chief executive" role, Ronald Reagan was chief of state par excellence.  McDonald suggests that Reagan saw the main task in his role as head of state (as distinguished from head of government) as restoring the nations confidence and self-respect after the traumas of Vietnam and Watergate.  President Carter had perceived the same need but had exacerbated the problem by giving a television speech in l979 in which he almost whiningly complained about a "crisis in confidence."  Reagan, by contrast, exuded faith in himself and in his country, and the confidence was contagious .
<p>       
The contrast between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan on the "chief of state" role is striking.  
While Reagan clearly understood the importance of preserving what Walter Bagehot described as the habitual reverence of the people for institutions that instill a sense of dignity in their government, Carter seemed to have no such  conception of the office.  McDonald cites Tip ONeills memoirs to illustrate this point.  Commenting on Carters efforts to, in press secretary Jody Powells words, "de-pomp" the presidency, ONeill wrote:
<p>
"What Carter failed to understand is that the American people love kings and queens and royal 
families.  They want a magisterial air in the White House, which explains why the Kennedys and the Reagans were far more popular than the four first families who came in between them."
<p>        
ONeill was not alone amongst Members of Congress who yearned for a more presidential air.  
Dan Rostenkowski once surprised Carter during the presidents visit to Chicago by having the house band strike up "Hail to the Chief" as Carter entered the room.  Until this point, such pomp had been strictly forbidden by Carter, but the enthusiastic response that he received from the Chicago audience convinced Carter to allow the practice to continue.
<p>
<b>Negative Campaigning</b>
<p>
The lively interplay between historical insight and contemporary analysis of the presidency makes for interesting and informative reading.  McDonald reminds us, for example, that negative campaigning is as old as American politics.  While George Bush was chastised by the press for calling Clinton and Gore "bozos" in the l992 race, and for not instantaneously repudiating the non-candidate sponsored commercials on the saga of the furloughed felon named Willie Horton in l988, these incidents pale in comparison to the campaign that Andrew Jackson faced in 1828.  Supporters of John Quincy Adams vilified Jackson as "an uncouth frontier ruffian, a murderer, and an adulterer."  And, as if this wasnt enough, Jacksons detractors "slandered his wife" and charged that Jacksons mother "had been the 
concubine of a black man and thus that he was a bastard mulatto."
<p>
Jacksons supporters responded in kind, "charging Adams with corruption, with using public 
funds for private advantage, for having had premarital sex with the woman he later married and for being involved, while minister to Russia, in facilitating the seduction of an American girl by the tsar."
<p>        
Nor are adversarial relations with the press new.  Woodrow Wilson made it clear that he viewed 
reporters as impertinent, disrespectful and prying:  "The reporters, for their part, regarded Wilson as cold and aloof, prone to lecture as if he were still a professor, and somewhat dictatorial in his efforts to control the news."  Needless to say, Wilson did not ingratiate himself with the press.
<p>
<b>Legislative Goals</b>
<p>
McDonalds reading of history is refreshingly different from the Rooseveltian lenses of a Richard 
Neustadt or an Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.  In addressing Roosevelt, McDonald writes:  "Having reached the pinnacle of legislative power and having taught the people to look to the president as the remedy for every problem, Roosevelt went too far and committed political blunders that made it impossible for himself and for successors to fulfill the expectations he had raised."
<p>      
Bill Clinton should be encouraged to read at least this much of McDonalds book, but he ought to 
read pages 378-379 as well.  McDonald notes on these pages that Ronald Reagans program was not all  gloom and doom.   On the down side, federal expenditures increased from $657 billion to $1,064 billion in a seven year period, and "by no means just because of defense spending, since outlays for civilian programs increased considerably faster."  On the plus side, "the nation experienced a period of economic growth and prosperity that lasted more than seven years."  Federal revenues increased from $599 billion in l981 to $909 billion in l988.  And while Reagan left a legacy of increasing deficits, the economy was growing so rapidly that the deficit "was less as a percentage of gross national product when Reagan left office than when he had entered it."  As an added bonus, in McDonalds view, the deficit "had the effect of preventing Congress from enacting many new social or economic programs."
<p>        
And Congress, McDonald reminds us, surely does not escape blame for the Reagan-Bush era 
deficits.  He notes, for example, that no real spending cuts were made under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, "not even of the bogus variety Washingtonians called a cut: a smaller-than-projected increase."  After nearly two years of struggling with the deficit, George Bush broke his "no new taxes" pledge and agreed to support a tax increase in exchange for a promise to cut spending.  As McDonald notes, "Congress lived up to half the agreement, namely the tax increase."
<p>       
It is perhaps fortunate for McDonald that he did not suffer the burden of having to appraise Bill 
Clintons presidency in the first edition of this remarkable book.  He does note, however, that Clintons path to the presidency included a saxophone solo on the Arsenio Hall show and an appearance on MTV.  
<p>        
Tony Coelho, a top adviser to Clinton, acknowledged a few weeks before the mid-term elections of l994 that there is "a feeling among the American people that maybe hes not quite up to being president."  Because Clinton had "become a prime minister," Coelho added, "people dont know he has a vision.  Hes got to keep being president."   Perhaps Coelho has already read McDonalds book.  Implicitly, at least, he seems to reaffirm McDonalds studied judgment that "it is not enough merely to govern well; the president must also seem presidential."

<title>Americas Manufacturing Revolution: The New Economy -- PFF</title>
</head>
<center><h2>America's Manufacturing Revolution:  The New Economy</h2></center>
<center>By Jerry Jasinowski</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Picture in your minds eye two different scenes. The first is America in 1985. 
America was on the defensive on the economic front. Industry after industry, company after company, was losing global market share. Foreign products were pouring into America. The quality of American products was scoffed at.  "Made in Japan" had gone from a joke in the 1960s to being the standard in the 1980s. It seemed clear -- America was losing the battle in global competition.  The second scene is America in 1995. America is on the offensive on the economic front.  Industry after industry, company after company, have been gaining global market share. A record amount of American products are being sold abroad. The high quality of American products is widely recognized.  "Made in America" is becoming the new standard. It is clear -- America is now on the road to winning the battle in global competition.
<p>
That is a startling difference in just one decade. How could the situation change so 
dramatically and so quickly?  In particular, what did companies in America do to generate this turnaround and comeback?  
<p>	
The answers to these questions center on the biggest economic transformation taking 
place in America today:   the manufacturing revolution. I use the term "revolution"  because over the past ten years manufacturing companies across America have been undergoing a transformation on a scale not seen since the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s.
<p>
Instead of declining, as some pundits predicted, American manufacturing has, by a broad collection of measures, become #1. 
<p>
America is #1 in exports. Our double digit rate of export growth exceeds our competitors and we have expanded our world market share.  America is #1 in productivity. A Brookings Institution study found that productivity in German manufacturing was 86 percent of that in the United States while Japanese productivity was an even lower 78 percent.  Finally, America is #1 in many key industrial sectors that are among the most important to long term growth, such as 
computer systems and computer software.
<p>		
The intriguing question is:  How did America regain the overall number one 
ranking in competitiveness and all these other number one positions?
<p>
Certainly, government policies contributed to the competitive comeback, particularly the move to more competitive exchange rates, monetary and fiscal policy, and the strong commitment to open trade policies that expand global exports. But positive government policies are only a modest part of the story. In most cases,  government policies have done more to harm American competitiveness than to help it. Witness the damaging impact of crushing regulatory and legal burdens. 
<p>		
To understand Americas economic comeback, you must understand the bold and 
innovative changes taking place in the private sector; you must understand Americas 
manufacturing revolution.
<p>
<b>Manufacturing Revolution</b>
<p>
Let me begin by sharing with you my first hand exposure to the inside story of this 
revolution. For two years, economic consultant Robert Hamrin and I went searching for the best success stories among American manufacturers of all shapes and sizes. After examining over 200 such stories, it became clear that something major was occurring - that all the success stories pointed to a manufacturing revolution that goes far beyond incremental and isolated corporate changes. We wrote a book about the revolution, "Making It in America", which identifies ten Paths to Success that these pacesetter companies are following. 
<p>	
This revolution is as profound as the original industrial revolution of the last century, but its different in nature. The industrial  Revolution was about doing everything on a bigger and bigger scale -- more resources, more capital and labor, lager scale production -- these were the elements that drove growth. Today, we are looking at a productivity-led revolution where growth is achieved primarily by greater technological advance and doing more with less. This historic departure radically changes how products are made and the economy operates. 
<p>
Let me highlight six of the ten paths to success that we uncovered in our research:  
leadership in managing change; total quality management; investment and use of information technologies; employee empowerment; innovation in product development and service; and, going global.
<p>
<b>Leadership in Managing Change</b>
<p>
I  begin with leadership in managing change because that is where significant corporate transformation almost always begins:  with true leaders  who have a vision and passion. The vision makes clear where the company should go and what its focus should be. The passion makes certain that the vision is achieved. 
<p>	
One such leader in America is Jack Welch, the Chairman of GE. Listen to how this leader thinks:  "If your change isnt big enough, revolutionary enough, the bureaucracy can beat you. When you get leaders who confuse popularity with leadership, who just nibble away at things, nothing changes."
<p>
The bedrock of Americas manufacturing renaissance involves corporate leaders 
recognizing and acting on a fundamental truth:  there must be a balance between business basics and embracing constant innovation to manage change. That dynamic tension between two powerful forces is a tough one to balance. But the truly successful company will, over the long run,  build upon a foundation of basic values, such as understanding what business you are in, while at the same time being boldly innovative and entrepreneurial.
<p>
<b>Total Quality Management</b>
<p>
The focus on cutting costs led to a renewed emphasis on all aspects of quality ... quality of products first, and quality of the company second. Concepts like Total Quality Control with its 
stress on the customers and doing things right the first time was the first step companies took to 
become competitive. This led to a more revolutionary  way of thinking, called Total Quality 
Management, or TQM, which forced a whole new way of doing business by striving to eliminate 
all waste in corporations and striving for continuous improvement.
<p>	
Motorola is of course the classic corporate example of applying TQM techniques. Their 
excellent implementation produced cost savings of at least $5 billion for the period 1987-1993.
<p>
<b>Investment and Use of Information Technologies</b>
<p>  
The third revolutionary path to success is investment and use of information technologies. 
The investment figures tell the story. Nearly half of business spending on equipment is for 
computers and other information technologies. And that doesnt even include the billions of 
dollars that companies spend on software and programmers each year. This investment has helped 
to greatly boost company productivity and create whole new systems of manufacturing.
<p>
The deployment of  these technologies has transformed the American factory. Many 
factories now possess unprecedented  speed in the production process, which has greatly 
improved products. At the same time these factories can now engage in agile manufacturing 
which gives them the flexibility  they need to meet customers rapid and ever changing demands.
<p>	
Some manufacturers are already moving beyond agile manufacturing to mass 
customization. This is the ability to customize products literally in quantities as small as one while 
producing them at mass production speeds. The ultimate outcome, fast approaching, is 
simultaneous manufacturing, where even as the customer is giving the order, the product starts to 
be made. The trend is clear:  the mass production paradigm of the Industrial Age is being replaced 
by the mass customization paradigm of the Information Age.
<p>
<b>Employee Empowerment</b>
<p>
The fourth path to success is employee empowerment. Many companies have been smart 
enough to recognize that people -- their workers --  are their most valuable resource. That is why 
they have unleashed the full power of their workers, under such names as employee involvement, 
participative management, and employee empowerment. 
<p>
When you think of employee empowerment, you should think of the three "T" words:  
trust, teams and training.  Employee empowerment requires trust.  It is built around trust - trust 
that is two way:  bosses trusting employees and employees trusting bosses.  Teams are among the 
renaissances most widespread and powerful elements.  In 1980, virtually all manufacturing 
employees worked on their own.  Today, millions of workers are working together in teams.  
Teams are so effective because they boost employee morale and teamed employees more readily 
take it upon themselves to focus on customer satisfaction and product quality.  Training of 
workers is increasingly being recognized as an investment for the future, not a cost.
<p>
<b>Innovation in Product Development and Service</b>
<p>
The fifth path that successful companies stress is innovation in all aspects of 
manufacturing, but particularly in new product development and service. Since a top quality 
product has become a "given", the real challenge today is product innovation. If you want to 
grow, speed and creativity in new product development is the most effective way to get there.
<p>
But even developing new products is often not enough. American manufacturers have 
discovered the critical importance of product delivery and service to their customers. Customer 
satisfaction is no longer enough. Rather, a company must "delight", or "please", or "surprise" its 
customers. They are doing this through getting to know their customers in great detail, providing 
them with superior service, and getting them involved in their product development decisions.
<p>
<b>Going Global</b>
<p>
Finally, for companies interested in growth, they have to go out and find new customers in new markets. The main way American companies have done this in the last decade is by going 
global. 
<p>
Even small companies, for the first time ever, are well represented among exporters:  over 
half of U.S. companies with revenues less than $100 million exported products in 1993, up 
sharply from 30 percent in 1990. American companies are also investing abroad quite heavily. 
<p>
The results are clear. Companies that have gone global in a serious manner find that it is a 
driving force behind corporate growth, with foreign sales accounting for 40 percent to 90 percent 
of their total revenues.
<p>
<b>Meeting Todays Challenges </b>
<p>
The first requirement is a healthy dose of humility. We got into trouble in the past by being 
arrogant. In todays rapidly changing, highly competitive world, thats more risky than ever. At 
the very least, in both government and the private sector, we have to be prepared to engage 
ourselves in improving each day.
<p>
So what should be our top priority?  Its clear that our top economic priority must be 
maintaining and expanding economic growth, providing employment and improving standards of living. If we want innovative, market economies to succeed we must provide economic 
prosperity.
<p>
On the international front, this means that the main responsibility of national governments 
must be an ongoing commitment to open trade. They must work hard to get the newly established World Trade Organization off to a good start and to effectively implement the many changes established in the latest Uruguay Round. They must also act to reduce barriers to trade that still exist and develop a stronger investment code. Most importantly, the business community needs to educate their workers and the public that expanding trade produces jobs.
<p>
On the domestic economic front, we need national governments initiating revolutions in the way government is run. They should look to key lessons learned from the manufacturing revolution that has taken place in America. The goal should be to make government as efficient and effective as possible. Following corporate examples, they should first listen to their customers 
about what they want, and what they think of the quality of their current products.  But the main action will, and should, take place in companies in the private sector. They are the basic engines of growth. Business leaders around the world, many of them gathered in this 
assembly, will face two fundamental challenges:   to continually improve and to nurture our 
people.
<p>
In the future, the key to maintaining good corporate performance will be to never rest on 
success. Companies in the past would set goals, either performance goals or specific action goals, and when they were obtained they would rest. Many would become complacent. Relentless global competition will not allow such resting in the future. As Andy Grove, CEO of Intel, has said: "only the paranoid survive."
<p>
Companies focused on continuous improvement will also recognize that they cannot rest 
on just efficient operations and strong productivity growth. Rather, they must turn their attention 
to growth. This will involve focusing on exciting new product development, discovering new 
markets, and going global, both through increased exports and direct investment overseas.
<p>
The second challenge -- nurturing people -- flows from the Information Revolution that is 
rapidly shaping a knowledge society in many countries around the world. Here, the one 
fundamental fact that must always be borne in mind is that most of the value in a business is 
generated by the energy from peoples intellect and creativity. The best companies of the 21st 
century will stay ahead by freeing their workers from the command and control organization of 
the past, investing in their expanding learning and regarding good performance with incentives 
and profit sharing. 
<p>
Continually improving and constantly nurturing people. These two corporate mandates 
will not be easy ones to implement. They will take many business leaders and  companies well out of their comfort zones. But they are the absolute imperatives for success in todays global economy.

<title>Common Sense Welfare Reform Act -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff/"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<center><h2>Common Sense Welfare Reform Act</center></h2>
<center>By Joe Knollenberg</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
On February 9, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson stood before a joint session of 
Congress and announced: "This Administration today, here and now, declares 
unconditional war on poverty in America."  With this simple statement, the U.S. 
government embarked upon one of the largest expansions of domestic social spending in the nations history.  Literally hundreds of new federal programs were created to provide Americas less fortunate with financial assistance, housing, food, education, health care and jobs in the hope that poverty could be eliminated once and for all.
<p>
Yet 30 years and nearly $5 trillion later, there are more people living below the 
poverty line than when we started -- even though we now spend 5 percent of GDP on 
welfare!  
<p>
Adjusting for inflation, we have spent more on the War on Poverty than we did 
to win both World Wars combined.  In fact, if viewed strictly from a budgetary 
perspective, there should be no poverty in America.  Presently, the federal and state 
governments combined spend over $300 billion on welfare payments and other anti-
poverty programs -- money that if simply divided among the poor, is three times enough to lift every welfare recipient in America above the poverty line.
<p>
Clearly, the amount of money is not the problem; it is the delivery system.  
Americas welfare delivery system has become a de facto government monopoly.  It is 
woefully expensive, overly bureaucratic, preoccupied with "process,"  and client-ignorant.  
<p>
It was originally created to assist neighborhood charities, but now it undermines them.  For example, neighborhood charities often find it difficult to condition aid on getting a job or quitting drugs when prospective recipients can walk down to the local welfare office and pick up a government check with no strings attached.  It is also no coincidence that the portion of charitable giving in this country devoted to alleviating poverty has declined by a shocking one-third since 1960.  As government (with taxpayer money) took more and more responsibility for caring for the poor, it fostered an "I gave at the office syndrome" that sapped Americas spirit of community involvement.
<p>
This year, Congress is finally taking up the issue of welfare reform.  We will 
consolidate overlapping federal programs, give states more flexibility to experiment, and enact measures to encourage work and discourage out-of -wedlock births.  But while these are all good ideas, none of them are aimed at fundamentally changing the method by which we deliver aid to the poor.
<p>
Thats why Congressman Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) and I have introduced  the Common 
Sense Welfare Reform Act of 1995.  Our bill would create a "Choice in Welfare" tax 
credit, designed to give individual citizens a voice in how this country fights poverty.  
"Choice in Welfare" means that every taxpaying American would be free to direct up to 
$2500 of their federal income taxes to a charitable organization in their community (or 
anywhere in their state) that is engaged in anti-poverty efforts.  Each time a taxpayer 
claims this credit, federal welfare spending would be lowered by the same amount.
<p>
By getting taxpayers into the act, welfare decision-making would no longer be 
solely in the hands of government bureaucrats and politicians.  Indeed, every taxpaying  American would be able to choose whether their tax dollars are spent on public programs ike AFDC, Food Stamps and public housing subsidies, or spent on private organizations like the Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity, and Project Hope.
<p>
This bill seeks to reward private charities for doing what they have traditionally 
done best:  giving prompt, temporary assistance to those in need.  Private charities view assistance as a tool by which to change behavior -- not as a right or a way of life.  They stress personal responsibility and provide hands-on management for recipients.  Public welfare requires nothing from the recipient except eligibility.  It is inconceivable that a family could subsist for generations on the local soup kitchen, food bank or shelter -- as many now do on welfare.
<p>
The reforms Congress is currently considering are a good start, but Americas War 
on Poverty will never be won by simply tinkering with the current government-run system.  We must create a new system that puts neighborhood charity above government payments and caring individuals over a faceless bureaucracy.  Only when this is accomplished will we finally be able to address poverty in a truly effective and meaningful way.

<title>The American Idea and American Promise -- PFF</title>

<center><h2>The American Idea and American Promise</h2></center>
<center>By Everett Carll Ladd</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The American Idea is an enormous resource.  Since this is demonstrably so -- and has been for two centuries -- its more than a little surprising that so few political leaders have recognized the extent of the resource, or the extent to which it can be helpful to them in moving the country in large and constructive ways.  Some have recognized it, of course, and they have been our great leaders.
<p>
More on that in a bit.  First, we need to understand just what the resource is.  It begins 
with the fact that America is a "creedal nation."  G. K. Chesterton, one of Britains great
all-purpose men of ideas, grasped it nicely when he wrote that the United States "is the only nation in the world that is founded on a creed."  He went on to observe that this foundation-creed "is set forth with dogmatic and even theological lucidity in the Declaration of Independence....It enunciates that all men are equal in their claim to justice, that governments exist to give them justice, and that their authority is for that reason just."
<p>
The American Creed or Idea is indeed the promise of the Declaration, but it is more than this.  It is nothing less than an insistence on permitting all who strive to realize their fullest individual promise.  Its a uniquely far-reaching individualism -- in this sense of the ideal of the fullest individuality.
<p>
Some critics at every period want to diminish the ideal by observing that we have not 
always honored it and have never fully realized it.  We havent.  But while it is true, this criticism is also silly.  On this planet, ideals are never fully realized.  The important question about them is whether they are real, vital and in some substantial way operative as the standard goal driving the society along.
<p>
As is true with so much of the American political heritage, Abraham Lincoln grasped the special role played by Americas founding Idea.  This knowledge governed his entire political approach after 1856.  He put it best, I think, in his June 26, 1857 speech on the Dred Scott decision, delivered in Springfield, Illinois.  Lincoln gave many memorable addresses, but this one is, I believe, easily his greatest.  All his essential political judgments appear fully formed in it.
<p>
Lincoln told his audience that June evening that the ideals of the Declaration and, in 
general, of the countrys founding Creed comprised our only substantial claim to nationhood.  These ideals had not, Lincoln surely understood in the midst of the slavery crisis, always been 
honored.  But to abandon them, as Chief Justice Taney in effect proposed in his majority decision in Dred Scott, would be to utterly destroy this creedal nation.  Lincoln observed that the Founders surely did not think people were each the same, but that they did view each citizen as having an essential equality of moral claim:  "They defined with tolerable distinctness, in what respects they did consider all men created equal -- equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  This they said, and this they meant.  They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them.  In fact they had no power to confer such a boon."
<p>
Nonetheless, what they did was of overriding importance:  "They meant to set up a 
standard maxim for free society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all; constantly 
looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly 
approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere."  This, then, is the American Idea, the constituent basis of American nationhood, to be constantly striving for a far-reaching promise of full individuality as the only tenable goal for the nation.
<p>	
The great Progressive intellectual, Herbert Croly, founder of The New Republic, also 
understood this well.  Croly discussed it in his great book, The Promise of American Life.  The promise was nothing less than the fullest opportunity for each citizen to realize his or her highest 
possible level of achievement.  Crolys book is badly misunderstood these days because discussion of it focuses on only one of its parts.  Writing in 1909, he indeed believed that more government intervention was needed to redress excessive concentrations of private power and extend individual opportunity.  Whether Croly would advocate more government today is, of course, unanswerable, but I think there is good reason to suspect that he would not.
<p>
The central thesis of The Promise of American Life is that each age must harness the 
Creed and find its own ways to extend the promise.  Croly believed that Washington, Hamilton 
and the Federalists made that contribution best in the founding years, that Lincoln was its 
principal exponent during the slavery crisis, and that Theodore Roosevelt came closest to playing the role in the early 20th century.  Each of these leaders or movements used very different approaches, given differing challenges.
<p>
We are left to find, in our own time, ways of harnessing the enormous moral energy of the 
Creed to extend the promise of American life.  While this does not involve, in my view, disdaining 
government as such, it surely does not include a principal reliance on governmental action.  In so many sectors, excessive growth of the state has come to threaten, not enhance, the realization of the nations promise.  But, again, the core of that promise has always come back to the individual -- the demanding and frustrating, but ultimately rewarding enterprise, through which individual citizens join together in a thousand separate ways to advance their common purposes.
<p>
We must all understand clearly and cleanly the role of ideas in this creedal nation.  We 
must understand, too, the great energy available if we harness Americans deep commitment to their nations special promise.  Today, we are groping for the successful articulation of the Idea in our own time.  But, fortunately, we dont need new answers, only appropriate applications of our old answers to new circumstances.  As in every previous era, our challenge is finding fresh means of achieving an ever fuller and more fulfilling individuality.

<title>Misunderstanding Microsoft -- PFF</title>
<head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<center><h2>Misunderstanding Microsoft</h2></center>
<center>By Stan Liebowitz</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Did you know that the American way of life is in jeopardy? Not from international communism.  Not from radical terrorists. Not even from our inadequate educational system. Instead, according to a  remarkable document submitted to the courts, our freedoms are apparently imperiled by the Microsoft corporation. This document was crafted by individuals who believe that our market based economy has led  
us to type on the wrong keyboards, tape with the wrong videorecorders, and drive the wrong cars. If you  think I exaggerate, read on.  
<p>
Our strange story begins with the recently completed Justice Department investigation of  Microsoft. Microsoft and Justice came to an agreement whereby Microsoft consented to make certain changes in its business practices that Justice believed were anticompetitive.  
<p>
But the agreement has been overturned by U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin. It is widely thought that he was heavily influenced by a group of lawyers and economists who prepared a written submission to the court. This group relied on economic theories suggesting that markets sometimes get stuck using a "wrong" product. These economic theories concluded that we may need the government, in its wisdom, to choose our products for us. These authors repeat their arguments in another court submission in opposition to Microsoft's friendly purchase of Intuit, a maker of personal finance and tax software.  
<p>
Although many dreadful scenarios are discussed by these authors, the most frightening is this: "It  is difficult to imagine that in an open society such as this one with multiple information sources, a single company could seize sufficient control of information transmission so as to constitute a threat to the underpinnings of a free society. But such a scenario is a realistic (and perhaps probable) outcome."  Consumers, according to this theory, will be so locked-in to Microsoft's technology that they will be compelled to purchase Microsoft products even when those products are far inferior to rival products. And as a result, Microsoft will gain control over every market it enters, eventually dominating all the information technology.  
<p>
With no less than the destruction of our freedoms being put forward as a probable outcome, it is  
perhaps not surprising that Judge Sporkin was reluctant to approve the proposed Microsoft-Justice settlement.  
<p>
But before we march on Microsoft headquarters with our pitchforks and torches to destroy the  
apparent monster that Bill Gates has created, and before we hand over to some government bureaucrat our right to choose the products that we consume, we might want to ponder the basis of these economic theories.  
<p>  
<b>Unsupported Theories  </b>
<p>  
Theories are acceptable only when they are capable of explaining actual events or behavior. Even in economics, we have a long history of testing theories with empirical evidence in order to verify their validity. Yet when we carefully examine the empirical support for the theories used to derail the Justice-Microsoft agreement, we find no support for their alarming conclusions.  
The single overriding example that is used to support these theories is the rather quaint yet well-known example of the typewriter keyboard.  
<p>
If you look at the upper left hand keys of your keyboard, you will see that they form the letters  
QWERTY. One commonly hears the claim that to keep the old-fashioned mechanisms from jamming on the early typewriters, the mechanics who created the keyboard adopted a design that actually slowed down typing speed! Thus the QWERTY design is reputed to be far inferior to the "scientifically" designed Dvorak keyboard which claimed a 40 percent increase in typing speed. Supposedly, the Navy conducted experiments during the Second World War demonstrating that the costs of retraining typists on the new keyboard could be fully recovered within ten days!   
<p>
This example appeared to be a perfect case to support the claim that consumers and markets get stuck with the wrong product. Yet upon investigation, this claim turns out to be false.   
In an article published in the Journal of Law and Economics in 1990, Stephen Margolis and I  
demonstrated that this story was a myth -- a myth based largely on wishful thinking and on a shoddy reading of the history of the typewriter keyboard. The QWERTY keyboard, it turns out, is just about as good a design as the Dvorak keyboard, and was better than most competing designs that existed in the late 1800s when there were many keyboard designs maneuvering for a place in the market.  
<p>
We discovered a set of experiments conducted under the auspices of the General Service  
Administration in the 1950s comparing QWERTY with Dvorak that disproved the claims of Dvorak's superiority. Many, if not most, of the claims to the contrary were made by the patent owner of the competing keyboard design, Professor August Dvorak. The wartime Navy study turns out to have been conducted under the auspices the Navy's chief expert in time-motion studies -- Lt. Commander August Dvorak, and the results were clearly fudged.    
<p>
Yet in spite of our five year old paper, which has not been factually disputed, the QWERTY  
keyboard remains the leading example put forward to support the theory that markets get stuck with wrong products. One could hardly find better evidence of a theory's lack of empirical support than the continued use of a result that is known to be incorrect.  
<p>
Another supposed example often put forward to support these theories is our use of VHS when  
we supposedly should be using Beta videorecorders instead. It is claimed that Beta was a better format and that VHS only won because it luckily got a large market share early on in the competition with Beta. But this story turns out to be just as inaccurate as the keyboard story. In an article forthcoming in the Journal of Law, Economics and Organization, Margolis and I demonstrate that Sony had previously shared its patents and secrets with the creators of VHS; that Sony had offered and demonstrated the Betamax and its innovations to the owners of VHS; and that the two formats were so similar that Sony engineers considered the VHS machine a copy of the Betamax. The one crucial difference was the size of the videotape cassette. The Betamax cassette was smaller than the VHS cassette and allowed at first only one hour of recording capacity -- too short to record many movies. The larger size of the VHS cassette provided longer recording time for any quality of picture, and was capable of recording movies or football games. So, once again, the markets did not get stuck with the wrong product. In fact, since the Betamax appeared first, yet was overcome by VHS, directly contradicts the conclusions put forward by these theorists.  
<p>
One of the economists who helped prepare the submission against Microsoft has argued that we might be stuck with gasoline powered engine when steam might have been a superior choice. If you believe that we would be better off driving Stanley Steamers.  I guess you might also believe the dire predictions of these theories. In that case, however, I have a bridge I would like to sell you.  
 <p> 
<b>Implications  </b>
  <p>
This does not mean that the Microsoft acquisition of Intuit or the Justice Department settlement  
should not be scrutinized. But before we engage in hysterical hyperbole, we had best check whether the theories being put forward to influence public policy have any validation out there in the real world.  Instead of sounding alarms about Microsoft jeopardizing our freedoms, we should worry about relying on those technical wizards in the judiciary and government to choose our technologies for us. Do we really need policy police receiving their marching orders from professors who cannot seem to get their facts straight? Abridgments of our freedoms are far more likely to come from government which can compel our behavior, than from corporations that require, for their own survival, our voluntary purchases of their products.

<title>Condemning the Successful -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<center><h2>Condemning the Successful</h2></center>
<center>By Michael Rothschild</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
No matter how fervently we profess our devotion to the principles of American free-
enterprise, when it comes down to the specifics of Bill Gates and Microsoft, most of us get a bit wobbly in the knees.  Instead of standing up for Americas most successful entrepreneur in his 
struggle with the Federal Government, we stand back and let Bill Gates fight alone.  
<p>
Jealousy and sloppy thinking have worked their magic.  I dont know about you, but just a 
tiny sliver of Gates billions would set me up for life.  To get that rich, by means fair and square, 
doesnt seem possible,  does it?  Just like the Robber Barons of old, Bill Gates must have crossed 
the line from brilliant entrepreneur to craven monopolist, from good capitalist to bad.  And now, 
of course, he deserves his comeuppance at the hands of Federal officials.
<p>
Or so, at least, goes the morality tale framing Microsofts current travails.  Egged on by 
Microsofts also-ran competitors, the Federal Trade Commission, then the Department of Justice, 
and now U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin have taken their shots.  The specific allegations keep 
changing, but every attack on Microsoft is based on the same assertion: namely, that Microsoft is 
a "monopoly" or "near monopoly" that must be stopped before it consolidates its stranglehold 
over the global software industry.
<p>With Microsofts guilt presumed by virtue of its "monopoly" position, the lawyers quickly 
move on to the assessment of penalties.  Should Microsofts "monopolistic" business practices be 
restricted?  Should the company be broken up?  Should Microsoft be blocked from acquiring 
Intuit (maker of the wildly popular Quicken home bookkeeping software)?  Or should Microsoft 
be prevented from entering the on-line services industry?  Before long, the Supreme Court may be 
asked to sort things out.  But ultimately, even the High Court cant solve the fundamental issues 
causing Microsofts current woes.  Only Congress can decide whether Americas first great 21st 
century company deserves to be punished or whether our 19th century antitrust laws needs to be 
changed.  
<p>
<b>Setting Standards</b>
<p>
<p>
Congress might begin rethinking antitrust by asking a simple question --whether the 
concept of "monopoly" still makes sense in an Information Age economy.  Consider the brief 
history of the personal computer industry.  IBM launched its first personal computer, the IBM-
PC, in 1981.  Bogged down by a vast internal bureaucracy that had taken power during the 
companys endless struggle with the FTC and the Justice Department, IBM simply couldnt move 
fast enough to enter the explosive new market created by Apple Computer and other PC upstarts.  
Desperate to catch up, IBM abandoned its tradition of internal development and assembled its 
first PC from components made by outside suppliers.  Among the pieces IBM pulled together was 
an operating system, called DOS, made by an unknown Seattle pip-squeak.  
<p>
Backed by IBMs enormous prestige, its PC instantly became the industry standard, the 
safe choice in the confusing new world of personal computing.  Sold by the millions, each IBM-
PC carried a copy of Microsofts DOS operating system.  The operating system is the layer of 
software that translates commands from software applications like word processors, spreadsheets, 
and games into signals that the hardware can understand.  
<p>
Like VHS, Morse Code, QWERTY keyboards, Number 10 envelopes, Group III fax 
machines, and 110 volts, Microsofts DOS became the de facto standard of the PC industry.  Such 
unsanctioned standards emerge in all technologically sophisticated industries.
<p>
The key is getting other independent companies to voluntarily make their products 
compatible with your proposed standard.  When IBM, then still master of the computing universe, 
selected DOS for its PC, it anointed the tiny firm with "IBM-ness," immediate industry-wide 
certainty that DOS had become the de facto standard, the language that everyone else had to learn 
to speak.
<p>
But given the torrid pace of change in the information economy, even a de facto standard 
like DOS is vulnerable to rapid obsolescence.  And by the late Eighties, as PC hardware became 
more capable, DOS was at risk of being displaced by an entirely new kind of operating system.  
Had Bill Clintons friend John Sculley, then CEO of Apple Computer, comprehended the 
fundamental economics of de facto standards, he would have licensed Apples superb Macintosh 
operating system to other hardware makers and created the standard for the next PC generation.  
<p>I
n failing to do so, Mr. Sculley committed the greatest single strategic blunder in modern 
business history and gave Bill Gates a second chance to hang onto industry leadership.  Microsoft 
responded by launching Windows, its Macintosh look-alike.  Had John Sculley made the right 
move, the Justice Department wouldnt be wasting its time on that "has been" Microsoft.  Instead, 
Apples attorneys would be the ones fending off allegations of monopoly power.  
<p>
Integrating disparate technologies into easy-to-use, seamless systems doesnt work 
without compatible interfaces among those technologies.  With technological specialties 
proliferating and the pace of innovation accelerating, the need for de facto standards will grow, 
not shrink.  Right now, vicious competitive struggles are raging to determine forthcoming de 
facto standards for compact videodiscs, Internet interfaces and electronic cash payment systems.  
The winners have not yet emerged.  But when they do, they will hold huge shares of their 
respective markets.  
<p>
By definition, if the industry leader holds much less than 90 percent market share, its de 
facto standard has not yet been established.  And without a clear standard, sensible investors, 
producers and consumers play "wait and see."  Technological progress slows and international 
competitiveness is undermined, along with job creation and economic growth.  But if a company 
has the technological prowess and business smarts to knock off rivals and capture 90 percent of 
its market, it will almost certainly be pilloried as a "monopoly" engaged in "exclusionary 
practices" under the antitrust laws.  In short, winning the 21st century business game condemns a 
company to losing the 19th century antitrust game.  This is the Catch-22 that Microsoft now finds 
itself in.
<p>
As a candidate, President Clinton pledged to review Americas antitrust laws -- principally 
the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914 -- to assess their impact on the 
global competitiveness of American companies.  It hasnt happened.  Now Congress should 
examine how laws based upon Machine Age economic theory are undermining our Information 
Age economy.  If Congress wants American companies to be world beaters, if it wants upstarts 
like Microsoft to grab market dominance in Japan and Europe, and create many thousands of 
high-pay, high-skill jobs here at home, then weve got to stop telling our companies to compete 
hard, but not too hard.  
<p>
Judge Learned Hand, a giant of American jurisprudence, once wrote:  "The successful 
competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins."  Now that 
the federal government has turned upon Bill Gates and Microsoft, who among the devoted 
supporters of American free-enterprise will stand up for principles in action?

<title>A Nation of Cowards -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<center><h2>A Nation of Cowards</h2></center>
<center>By Jeffrey R. Snyder</center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Our society has reached a pinnacle of self-expression and respect for individuality 
rare or unmatched in history.  Our entire popular culture - from fashion magazines to the 
cinema - positively screams the matchless worth of the individual, and glories in 
eccentricity, non-conformity, independent judgment, and self-determination.  This 
enthusiasm is reflected in the prevalent notion that helping someone entails increasing that 
persons "self-esteem;" that if a person properly values himself, he will naturally be a 
happy, productive, and, in some inexplicable fashion, responsible member of society.
<p>
And yet, while people are encouraged to revel in their individuality and 
incalculable self-worth, the media and the law enforcement establishment continually 
advise us that, when confronted with the threat of lethal violence, we should not resist, but 
simply give the attacker what he wants. If the crime under consideration is rape, there is 
some notable waffling on this point, and the discussion quickly moves to how the woman 
can change her behavior to minimize the risk of rape, and the various ridiculous, non-lethal 
weapons she may acceptably carry, such as whistles, keys, mace, or, that weapon which 
really sends shivers down a rapists spine, the portable cellular phone.
<p>
Now how can this be? How can a person who values himself so highly calmly 
accept the indignity of a criminal assault?  How can one who believes that the essence of 
his dignity lies in his self-determination passively accept the forcible deprivation of that 
self-determination?  How can he, quietly, with great dignity and poise, simply hand over 
the goods?
<p>
The assumptions, of course, is that there is no inconsistency.  The advice not to 
resist a criminal assault and simply hand over the goods is founded on the notion that 
ones life is of incalculable value, and that no amount of property is worth it.  Put aside, 
for a moment, the outrageousness of the suggestion that a criminal who proffers lethal 
violence should be treated as if he has instituted a new social contract:  "I will not hurt or 
kill you if you give me what I want."  For years, feminists have labored to educate people 
that rape is not about sex, but about domination, degradation, and control.  Evidently, 
someone needs to inform the law enforcement establishment and the media that 
kidnapping, robbery, carjacking, and assault are not about property.
<p>
Crime is not only a complete disavowal of the social contract, but also a 
commandeering of the victims person and liberty.  If the individuals dignity lies in the 
fact that he is a moral agent engaging in actions of his own will, in free exchange with 
others, then crime always violates the victims dignity.  It is, in fact, an act of enslavement.  
Your wallet, your purse, or your car may not be worth your life, but your dignity is; and if 
it is not worth fighting for, it can hardly be said to exist.
<p>	
<b>The Gift of Life</b>
<p>
Although difficult for modern man to fathom, it was once widely believed that life 
was a gift from God, that to not defend that life when offered violence was to hold Gods 
gift in contempt, to be a coward and to breach ones duty to ones community.  A sermon 
given in Philadelphia in 1747 unequivocally equated the failure to defend oneself  with 
suicide:
<p>
He that suffers his life to be taken from him by one that hath no 
authority for the purpose, when he might preserve it by defense, 
incurs the Guilt of self-murders since God hath enjoined him to seek
the continuance of his life, and Nature itself teaches every creature
to defend itself.
<p>
"Cowardice" and "self-respect" have largely disappeared from public discourse.  In 
their place we are offered "self-esteem" as the bellwether of success and a proxy for 
dignity.  "Self-respect" implies that one recognizes standards, and judges oneself worthy 
by the degree to which one lives up to them.  "Self-esteem" simply means that one feels 
good about oneself.  "Dignity" used to refer to the self-mastery and fortitude with which a 
person conducted himself in the face of lifes vicissitudes and the boorish behavior of 
others.  Now, judging by campus speech codes, dignity requires that we never encounter a 
discouraging word and that others be coerced into acting respectfully, evidently on the 
assumption that we are powerless to prevent our degradation if exposed to the demeaning 
behavior of others.  These are sign-posts proclaiming the insubstantiality of our character, 
the hollowness of our souls.
It is impossible to address the problem of rampant crime without talking about the 
moral responsibility of the intended victim.  Crime is rampant because the law-abiding, 
each of us, condone it, excuse it, permit it, submit to it.  We permit and encourage it 
because we do not fight back, immediately, then and there, where it happens.  Crime is not rampant because we do not have enough prisons, because judges and prosecutors are too 
soft, because the police are hamstrung with absurd technicalities.  The defect is there, in 
our character.  We are a nation of cowards and shirkers.
<p>
<b>Do You Feel Lucky?</b>
<p>
	In 1991, when then-Attorney General Richard Thornburgh released the FBIs 
annual crime statistics, he noted that it is now more likely that a person will be the victim 
of a violent crime than that he will be in an auto accident.  Despite this, most people 
readily believe that the existence of the police relieves them of the responsibility to take 
full measures to protect themselves.  The police, however, are not personal bodyguards.  
Rather, they act as a general deterrent to crime, both by their presence and by 
apprehending criminals after the fact.  As numerous courts have held, they have no legal 
obligation to protect anyone in particular.  You cannot sue them for failing to prevent you 
from being the victim of a crime.
<p>	
Insofar as the police deter by their presence, they are very, very good.  Criminals 
take great pains not to commit a crime in front of them.  Unfortunately, the corollary is 
that you can pretty much bet your life (and you are) that they wont be there at the 
moment you actually need them. 
<p>     
Should you ever be the victim of an assault, a robbery, or a rape, you will find it 
very difficult to call the police while the act is in progress, even if you are carrying a 
portable cellular phone.  Nevertheless, you might be interested to know how long it takes 
them to show up.  Department of Justice statistics for 1991 show that, for all crimes of 
violence, only 28 percent of calls are responded to within five minutes.  The idea that 
protection is a service people can call to have delivered and expect to receive in a timely 
fashion is often mocked by gun owners, who love to recite the challenge, "Call for a cop, 
call for an ambulance, and call for a pizza.  See who shows up first."
<p>
Many people deal with the problem of crime by convincing themselves that they 
live, work, and travel only in special "crime-free" zones.  Invariably, they react with shock 
and hurt surprise when they discover that criminals do not play by the rules and do not 
respect these imaginary boundaries.  If, however, you understand that crime can occur 
anywhere at anytime, and if you understand that you can be maimed or mortally wounded 
in mere seconds, you may wish to consider whether you are willing to place the 
responsibility for safeguarding your life in the hands of others.
<p>
<b>Power and Responsibility</b>
<p>
<p>
Is your life worth protecting?  If so, whose responsibility is it to protect it?  If you 
believe that it is the polices, not only are you wrong - since the courts universally rule that 
they have no legal obligation to do so - but you face some difficult moral quandaries.  
How can you rightfully ask another human being to risk his life to protect yours, when you 
will assume no responsibility yourself?  Because this is his job and we pay him to do it?  
Because your life is of incalculable value, but his is only worth the $30,000 salary we pay 
him?  If you believe it reprehensible to possess the means and will to use lethal force to 
repel a criminal assault, how can you call upon another to do so for you?
<p>	
Do you believe that you are forbidden to protect yourself because the police are 
better qualified to protect you, because they know what they are doing but youre a rank amateur?  Put aside that this is equivalent to believing that only concert pianists may play 
the piano and only professional athletes may play sports.  What exactly are these special 
qualities possessed only by the police and beyond the rest of us mere mortals?
<p>One who values his life and takes seriously his responsibilities to his family and 
community will possess and cultivate the means of fighting back, and will retaliate when 
threatened with death or grievous injury to himself or a loved one.  He will never be 
content to rely solely on others for his safety, or think he has done all that is possible by 
being aware of his surroundings and taking measures of avoidance.  Lets not mince 
words: He will be armed, will be trained in the use of his weapon, and will defend himself 
when faced with lethal violence.
<p>Fortunately, there is a weapon for preserving life and liberty that can be <p>wielded 
effectively by almost anyone -- the handgun.  Small and light enough to be carried 
habitually, lethal, but unlike-like the knife or sword, not demanding great skill or strength, 
it can be used effectively by the old and the weak against the young and the strong, by the 
one against the many.
<p>
The handgun is the only weapon that would  give a lone female jogger a chance of 
prevailing against a gang of thugs intent on rape, a teacher a chance of protecting children 
at recess from a madman intent on massacring them, a family of tourists waiting at a mid-
town subway station the means to protect themselves from a gang of teens armed with 
razors and knives.
<p> 
But since we live in a society that by and large outlaws the carrying of arms, we 
are brought into the fray of the Great American Gun War.  Gun Control is one of the most 
prominent battlegrounds in our current wars.  Yet it is unique in the battlegrounds in our 
current culture wars.  Yet it is unique in the half-heartedness with which our conservatives 
leaders and pundits -- our "conservative elite" -- do battle, and have conceded the moral 
high ground to liberal gun control proponents.  It is not a topic often written about with 
any great fervor, by William F. Buckley or Patrick Buchanan.  As drug czar, William 
Bennett advised President Bush to ban "assault weapons," George Will is on record as 
recommending the repeal of the Second Amendment, and Jack Kemp is on record as 
favoring a ban on the possession of semiautomatic "assault weapons."  The battle for gun 
rights is one fought predominantly by the common man.  The beliefs of both our liberals 
and conservative elites are in fact abetting the criminal rampage through our society.
<p>
<b>Selling crime prevention</b>
<p>
By any rational measure, nearly all gun control proposals are hokum.  The Brady 
Bill, for example, would not have prevented John Hinkley from obtaining a gun to shoot 
President Reagan; Hinkley purchased his weapon five months before the attack, and his 
medical records could not have served as a basis to deny his purchase of a gun, since 
medical records are not public documents filed with the police.  Similarly, Californias 
waiting period and background check did not stop Patrick Purdy from purchasing the 
"assault rifle" and handgun he used to massacre children during recess in a Stockton 
schoolyard; the felony conviction that would have provided the basis for stopping the sales 
did not exist, because Mr. Purdys previous weapons violations were plea-bargained down 
from felonies to misdemeanors.
<p>
In the mid-sixties there was a public service advertising campaign targeted at car 
owners about the prevention of car theft.  The purpose of the ad was to urge car owners 
not to leave their keys in their cars.  The message was, "Dont help a good boy go bad."  
The implication was that, by leaving his keys in his car, the normal, law-abiding car owner 
was contributing to the delinquency of minors who, if they just werent tempted beyond 
their limits, would be "good."  Now, in those days people still had a fair sense of just who 
was responsible for whose behavior.  The ad succeeded in enraging a goodly portion of 
the populace, and was soon dropped.
<p>
Nearly all of the gun control measures offered by Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI) 
and its ill embody the same philosophy.  They are founded on the behalf that Americans 
law-abiding gun owners are the source of the problem.  With their unholy desire for 
firearms, they are creating a society awash in a sea of guns, thereby helping good boys go 
bad, and helping bad boys be badder.  This laying of moral blame for violent crime at the 
feet of the law-abiding and the implicit absolution of violent criminals for their misdeeds, naturally infuriates honest gun owners.
<p>
The files of HCI and other gun control organizations are filled with proposals to 
limit the availability of semiautomatic and other firearms to law-abiding citizens, and 
barren of proposals for apprehending and punishing violent criminals.  It is ludicrous to 
expect that the proposals of HCI, or any gun control laws, will significantly curb crime.  
According to Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) 
statistics, fully 90 percent of violent crimes are committed without a handgun, and 93 
percent of the guns obtained by violent criminals are not obtained through lawful purchase 
and sale transactions that are object of most gun control legislation.  Furthermore, the 
number of violent criminals is minute in comparison to the number of firearms in America 
-- estimated by ATF at about 200 million, approximately one-third of which are handguns.  
With so abundant a supply, there will always be enough guns available for those who wish 
to use them for nefarious ends, no matter how complete the legal prohibitions against 
them, or how draconian the punishment for their acquisition or use.  No, the gun control 
proposals of HCI and other organizations are not seriously intended as crime control.  
Something else is at work here.
<p>
<b>The tyranny of the elite</b>
<p>
Gun control is a moral crusade against a benighted, barbaric citizenry.  This is 
demonstrated not only by the ineffectualness of gun controll in preventing crime, and by the  fact that it focuses on restricting the behavior of the law-abiding rather than 
apprehending and punishing the guilty, but also by the execration that gun control 
proponents heap on gun owners and their evil instrumentality, the NRA.  Gun owners are 
routinely portrayed as uneducated, paranoid rednecks fascinated by and prone to violence, 
i.e., exactly the type of person who oppose the liberal agenda and whose moral and social  
"re-education" is the object of liberal social policies.  Typical of such bigotry is New York 
Gov. Mario Cuomos famous characterization of gun-owners as "hunters who drink beer, 
dont vote, and lie to their wives about where they were all weekend."  Similar 
vituperation is rained upon the NRA, characterized by Sen. Edward Kennedy as the 
"pushers best friend," lampooned in political cartoons as standing for the right of children 
to carry firearms to school and, in general, portrayed as standing for an individuals God-
given right to blow people away at will.
<p>
The stereotype is, of course, false.  As criminologists and constitutional lawyers 
Don B. Kates, Jr. and former HCI contributor Dr. Patricia Harris have pointed out, 
"[s]tudies consistently show that, on the average, gun owners are better educated and 
have more prestigious jobs than non-owners....Later studies show that gun owners are less 
likely than non-owners to approve of police brutality, violence against dissenters, etc."
<p>
Conservatives must understand that the antipathy many liberals have for gun 
owners arises in good measure from their statist utopianism.  This habit of mind has 
nowhere been better explored than in The Republic.  There, Plato argues that the perfectly 
just society is one in which an unarmed people exhibit virtue by minding their own 
business in the performance of their assigned functions, while the government of 
philosophers-kings, above the law and protected by armed guardians unquestioning in 
their loyalty to the state, engineers, implements, and fine-tunes the creation of that society, 
aided and abetted by myths that both hide and justify their totalitarian manipulation.
<p>
<b>The unarmed life</b>
<p>
When columnist Carl Rowan preaches gun control and uses a gun to defend his 
home, when Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer seeks legislation year after year to 
ban semiautomatic "assault weapons" whose only purpose, we are told, is to kill people, 
while he is at the same time escorted by state police armed with large-capacity 9mm 
semiautomatic pistols, it  is not simple hypocrisy.  It is the workings of that habit of mind 
possessed by all superior beings who have taken upon themselves the terrible burden of 
civilizing the masses and who understand, like our Congress, that laws for other people.
<p>
The liberal elite know that they are philosophers-kings.  They know that the people 
simply cannot be trusted; that they are incapable of just and fair self-government; that left 
to their own devices, their society will be racist, sexist, homophobic, and inequitable -- and 
the liberal elite know how to fix things.  They are going to help us live the good life, even 
if they have to lie to us and force us to do it.  And they detest those who stand in their 
way.
<p>
The private ownership of firearms is a rebuke to this utopian zeal.  To own 
firearms is to affirm that freedom and liberty are not gifts from the state.  It is to reserve 
final judgment about whether the state is encroaching on freedom and liberty, to stand 
ready to defend that freedom with more than mere words, and to stand outside the states 
totalitarian reach.
<p>
<b>The Florida experience</b>
<p>
The elitist distrust of the people underlying the gun control movement is illustrated 
beautifully in HCIs campaign against a new concealed-carry law in Florida.  Prior to 
1987, the Florida law permitting the issuance of concealed-carry permits was administered 
at the county level.  The law was vague, and, as a result, was subject to conflicting 
interpretation and political manipulation.  Permits were issued principally to security 
personnel and the privileged few with political connections.  Permits were valid only 
within the county of issuance.
<p>
In 1987, however, Florida enacted a uniform concealed-carry law which mandates 
that county authorities issue a permit to anyone who satisfies certain objective criteria.  
The law requires that a permit be issued to any applicant who is a resident, at least twenty-
one years of age, has no criminal record, no record of alcohol or drug abuse, no history of 
mental illness, and provides evidence of having satisfactorily completed a firearms safety 
course offered by the NRA or other competent instructor.  The applicant must provide a 
set of fingerprints, after which the authorities make a background check.  The permit must 
be issued or denial within ninety days, is valid throughout state, and must be renewed 
every three years, which provides authorities a regular means of re-evaluating whether the 
permit holder still qualifies.
<p>
Passage of this legislation was vehemently opposed by HCI and the media.  The 
law, they said, would lead to citizens shooting each other over everyday disputes involving 
fender benders, impolite behavior, and other slights to their dignity.  Terms like "Florida, 
the Gunshine State" and "Dodge City East" were coined to suggest that the state, and 
those seeking passage of the law, were encouraging individuals to act as judge, jury, and executioner in a "Death Wish" society.
<p>
No HCI campaign more clearly demonstrates the elitists beliefs underlying the 
campaign to eradicate gun ownership.  Given the qualifications required of permit holders, 
HCI and the media can only believe that common, law-abiding citizens are seething 
cauldrons of homicidal rage, ready to kill to avenge any slight to their dignity, eager to 
seek out and summarily execute the lawless.  Only lack of immediate access to a gun 
restrains them and prevents the blood from flowing in the streets.  They are so mentally 
and morally deficient that they would mistake a permit to carry a weapon in self-defense as 
a state-sanctioned license to kill at will.
<p>
Did the dire predictions come true?  Despite the fact that Miami and Dade County 
have severe problems with drug trade, the homicide rate fell in Florida following 
enactment of this law, as it did in Oregon following enactment of similar legislation there.  
There are, in addition, several documented cases of new permit holders successfully using their weapons to defend themselves.  Information from the Florida Department of State 
shows that, from the beginning of the program in 1987 through June 1993, 160,823 
permits have been issued, and only 530, or about 0.33 percent of the applicants, have been 
denied a permit for failure to satisfy the criteria, indicating that the law is benefiting those 
whom it was intended to benefit -- the law-abiding.  Only 16 permits, less than 1/100th of 
1 percent, have been revoked due to the post-issuance commission of a crime involving a 
firearm.
<p>
The Florida legislation legislation has been used as a model for legislation adopted 
by Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Mississippi.  There are, in addition, seven other states 
(Maine, North and South Dakota, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and, with the 
exception of cities with a population in excess of 1 million, Pennsylvania) which provide 
that concealed-carry permits must be issued to law-abiding citizens who satisfy various 
objective criteria.  Finally, no permit is required at all in Vermont.  Altogether, then, there 
are thirteen states in which law-abiding citizens who wish to carry arms to defend 
themselves may do so.  While no one appears to have compiled the statistics from all of these jurisdictions, there is certainly an ample data base for those seeking the truth about 
the trustworthiness of law-abiding citizens who carry firearms.
<p>
Other evidence also suggests that armed citizens are very responsible in using guns 
to defend themselves.  Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck, using surveys 
and other data has determined that armed citizens defend their lives or property with 
firearms against criminals approximately 1 million times a year. In 98 percent of these 
instances, the citizens merely brandishes the weapon or fires a warning shot.  Only in 2 
percent of the cases do citizens actually shoot their assailants.  In defining themselves with 
their firearms, armed citizens kill 2,000 to 3,000 criminals each year, three times the 
number killed by the police.  A nationwide study by Kates, the constitutional lawyer and 
criminologist, found that only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person 
mistakenly identified as a criminal.  The "error rate" for the police, however, was 11 
percent, over five times as high.
<p>
It is simply not possible to square the numbers above and the experience of Florida 
with the notions that honest, law-abiding gun owners are borderline psychopaths itching 
for an excuse to shoot someone, vigilantes eager to seek out and summarily execute the 
lawless, or incompetent fools incapable of determining when it is proper to use lethal force 
in defense of their lives.  Nor upon reflection should these results seem surprising.  Rape, 
robbery, and attempted murder are not typically actions rife with ambiguity or subtlety, 
requiring special powers of observation and great book-learning to discern.  When a man 
pulls a knife on a woman and says, "Youre coming with me," her judgment that a crime is 
being committed is not likely to be in error.  There is little chance that she is guilty to 
shoot the wrong person.  It is the police, because they are rarely at the scene of the crime 
when it occurs, who are more likely to find themselves in circumstances where guilt and 
innocence are not so clear-cut, and in which the probability for mistakes is higher.
<p>
<b>Arms and liberty</b>
<p>
Classical republican philosophy has long recognized the critical relationship 
between personal liberty and the possession of arms by people ready and willing to use them.  Political theorists as dissimilar as Niccolo Machiavelli, Sir Thomas More, James 
Harrington, Algernon Sidney, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all shared the view 
that the possession of arms is vital for resisting tyranny, and that to be disarmed by ones 
government is tantamount to being enslaved by it.  The possession of arms by the people is 
the ultimate warrant that government governs only with the consent of the governed.  As 
Kates has shown, the Second Amendment is as much a product of this political philosophy 
as it is of  the American experience in the Revolutionary War.  Yet our conservative elite 
has abandoned this aspect of republican theory.  Although our conservative pundits 
recognize and embrace gun owners as allies in other arenas, their battle for gun rights is 
desultory.  The problem here is not a statist utopianism, although goodness knows that 
liberals are not alone in the confidence they have in the states ability to solve societys 
problems.  Rather, the problem seems to lie in certain cultural traits shared by our 
conservative and liberal elites.
<p>
One such trait is an abounding faith in the power of the word.  The failure of our 
conservative elite to defend the Second Amendment stems in great measure from an 
overestimation of the power of  the rights set forth in the First Amendment, and a general 
undervaluation of action.  Implicit in calls for the repeal of the Second Amendment is the 
assumption that our First Amendment rights are sufficient to preserve our liberty.  The 
belief is that liberty can be preserved as long as men freely speak their minds; that there is 
no tyranny or abuse that can survive being exposed in the press; and that the truth need 
only be disclosed for the culprits to be shamed.  The people will act, and the truth shall set 
us, and keep us, free.
<p>
History is not kind to this belief, tending rather to support the view of Hobbes, 
Machiavelli, and other republican theorists that only people willing and able to defend 
themselves can preserve their liberties. While it may be tempting and comforting to believe 
that the existence of mass electronic communication has forever altered the balance of 
power between the state and its subjects, the belief has certainly not been tested by time, 
and what little history there is in the age of mass communication is not especially 
encouraging.  The camera, radio, and press are mere tools, and, like guns, can be used for 
good or ill.  Hitler, after all, was a masterful orator, used radio to very good effect, and is 
well known to have pioneered and exploited the propaganda opportunities afforded by 
film.  And then, of course, there were the Brownshirts, who knew very well how to quell 
dissent among intellectuals.
<p>	
<b>Polite Society</b>
<p>
In addition to being enamored of the power of words, our conservative elite shares 
with liberals the notion that an armed society is just not civilized or progressive, that 
massive gun ownership is a blot on our civilization.  This association of personal 
disarmament with civilized behavior is one of the great unexamined beliefs of our time.  
<p>
Should you read English literature from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, 
you will discover numerous references to the fact that a gentleman, especially when out at 
night or traveling, armed himself with a sword or a pistol against the chance of 
encountering a highwayman or other such predator.  This does not appear to have 
shocked the ladies accompanying him.  True, for the most part there were no police in 
those days, but we have already addressed the notion that the presence of the police 
absolves people of the responsibility to look after their safety, and in any event the 
existence of the police cannot be said to have reduced crime to negligible levels.
<p>
It is by no means obvious why it is "civilized" to permit oneself to fall easy prey to 
criminal violence, and to permit criminals to continue unobstructed in their evil ways.  
While it may be that a society in which crime is so rare that no one ever needs to carry a 
weapon is "civilized," a society that stigmatizes the carrying of weapons by the law-
abiding - because it distrusts its citizens more than it fears rapists, robbers, and murderers 
- certainly cannot claim this distinction.  Perhaps the notion that defending oneself with 
lethal force is not "civilized" arises from the view that violence is always wrong, or the 
view that each human being is of such intrinsic worth that it is wrong to kill anyone under 
any circumstances.  The necessary implication of these propositions, however, is that life is not worth defending.  Far from being "civilized," the beliefs that counterviolence and 
killing are always wrong are an invitation to the spread of barbarism.  Such beliefs 
announce loudly and clearly that those who do not respect the lives and property of others will rule over those who do. 
<p>
In truth, one who believes it wrong to arm himself against criminal violence shows 
contempt of Gods gift of life (or, in modern parlance, does not properly value himself), 
does not live up to his responsibilities to his family and community, and proclaims himself 
mentally and morally deficient, because he does not trust himself to behave responsibly.  In 
truth, a state that deprives its law-abiding citizens of the means to effectively defend 
themselves is not civilized but barbarous, becoming an accomplice of murderers, rapists, 
and thugs and revealing its totalitarian nature by its tacit admission that the disorganized, 
random havoc created by criminals is far less a threat than are men and women who 
believe themselves free and independent, and act accordingly.
<p>
While gun control proponents and other advocates of a kinder, gentler society 
incessantly decry our "armed society," in truth we do not live in an armed society.  We 
live in a society in which violent criminals and agents of the state habitually carry weapons, 
and in which many law-abiding citizens own firearms but do not go about armed.  
Department of Justice statistics indicate that 87 percent of all violent crimes occur outside the home.  Essentially, although tens of millions own firearms, we are an unarmed society.
<p>
<b>Take Back the Night</b>
<p>
Clearly the police and the courts are not providing a significant brake on criminal 
activity.  While liberals call for more poverty, education, and drug treatment programs, 
conservatives take a more direct tack.  George Will advocates a massive increase in the 
number of police and a shift toward "community-based policing."  Meanwhile, the NRA 
and many conservative leaders call for laws that would require violent criminals serve at 
least 85 percent of their sentences and would place repeat offenders permanently behind 
bars.<p>
Our society suffers greatly from the beliefs that only official action is legitimate and 
that the state is the source of our earthly salvation.  Both liberal and conservative 
prescriptions for violent crime suffer from the "not in my job description" school of 
thought regarding the responsibilities of the law-abiding citizen, and from an 
overestimation of the ability of the state to provide societys moral moorings.  As long as 
law-abiding citizens assume no personal responsibility for combating crime, liberal and 
conservative programs will fail to contain it.
<p>
Judging by the numerous articles about concealed-carry in gun magazines, the 
growing number of products advertised for such purpose, and the increase in the number 
of concealed-carry applications in states with mandatory-issuance laws, more and more 
people, including growing numbers of women, are carrying firearms for self-defense.  
Since there are still many states in which the issuance of permits is discretionary and in 
which law enforcement officials routinely deny applications, many  people have been put 
to the hard choice between protecting their lives or respecting the law.  Some of these 
people have learned the hard way, by being the victim of a crime, or by seeing a friend or 
loved one raped, robbed, or murdered, that violent crime can happen to anyone, anywhere 
at anytime, and that crime is not about sex or property but life, liberty, and dignity.
<p>
The laws proscribing concealed-carry of firearms by honest, law-abiding citizens 
breed nothing but disrespect for the law.  As the Founding Fathers knew well, a 
government that does not trust its honest, law-abiding, taxpaying citizens with the means 
of self-defense is not itself worthy of trust.  Laws disarming honest citizens proclaim that 
the government is the matter, not the servant, of the people.  A federal law along the lines 
of the Florida statute - overriding all contradictory state and local laws and acknowledging 
that the carrying of firearms by law-abiding citizens is a privilege and immunity of 
citizenship - is needed to correct the outrageous conduct of state and local officials 
operating under discretionary licensing systems.
<p>
What we certainly do not need is more gun control.  Those who call for the repeal 
of the Second Amendment so that we can really begin controlling firearms betray a serious 
misunderstanding of the Bill of Rights.  The Bill of Rights does not grant rights to the 
people, such that its repeal would legitimately confer upon government the powers 
otherwise proscribed.  The Bill of Rights is the list of the fundamental, inalienable rights, 
endowed in man by his Creator, that define what it means to be a free and independent 
people, the rights which must exist to ensure that government governs only with the 
consent of the people.<p>

At one time this was even understood by the Supreme Court.  In United States v. 
Cruikshank (1876), the first case in which the Court had an opportunity to interpret the 
Second Amendment, it stated that the right confirmed by the Second Amendment "is not a 
right granted by the constitution.  Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that 
instrument for its existence."  The repeal of the Second Amendment would no more 
render the outlawing of firearms legitimate than the repeal of the due process clause of the 
Fifth Amendment would authorize the government to imprison and kill people at will.  A 
government that abrogates any of the Bill of Rights, with or without majoritarian 
approval, forever acts illegitimately, becomes tyrannical, and loses the moral right to 
govern.
<p>
This is the uncompromising understanding reflected in the warning that Americas 
gunowners will not go gently into that good, utopian night:  You can have my gun when 
you pry it from my cold, dead hands.  While liberals take this statement as evidence of the 
retrograde, violent nature of gun owners, we gun owners hope that liberals hold equally 
strong sentiments about their printing presses, word processors, and television cameras.  
The republic depends upon fervent devotion to all our fundamental rights.

<title>Statement of Principles on Telecommunications Policy -- PFF</title>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<center><h2>Statement of Principles on Telecommunications Policy</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<center>
<blockquote><Font Size="-1">Rapid technological advances are creating a revolution in communications.  These advances are making possible countless new products and services which could vastly improve the quality of life in America and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.  However, these developments are being impeded by a complex and outdated web of governmental regulations.</center>
</blockquote></Font><p>
This year, Congress will be considering a broad range of regulatory reform 
initiatives.  Telecommunications policy reform, with its potential impact on one of the 
largest and most vital sectors of the U.S. economy, should be considered a crucial part of these efforts.  Needed reforms include:
<p>
1.  Elimination of barriers to competition.  Government should not be in the 
business of protecting monopolies.  Federal and state policies that bar competition in the provision of local telephone, cable and other services should be eliminated.
<p>
2.  Elimination of artificial barriers between industries.  Provision of many 
telecommunications services is kept artificially segregated by the AT&T consent decree, federal law, and FCC regulations.  Barriers between telecommunications services should be eliminated as soon as possible.  In particular, the long-distance service and manufacturing restrictions in the AT&T consent decree should be eliminated by a date certain.  Similarly, outdated cross-ownership restrictions on broadcasters should be eliminated.
<p>
3.  Reduction of the burden of regulation.  Policymakers should rely upon markets 
and consumers--not regulation--to determine prices and services.  The role and scope of FCC regulation should therefore be greatly reduced.  Competitive markets--including those for competitive local services and AT&Ts long-distance service--should not be regulated.  In less competitive markets where regulations has proved harmful to consumers, such as cable television, regulation should also be rolled back.  In no case should rate-of-return regulation be used.
<p>
4.  Elimination of protectionist policies.  Currently, federal law bars non-citizens 
from holding most FCC licenses.  As a result, not only are consumers denied the benefits of additional investment from abroad, but foreign governments are encouraged to restrict U.S. investment.  These restrictions should be repealed.  
<p>
5.  Elimination of telecommunications subsidies.  Current telecommunications 
policies contain billions of dollars in hidden cross-subsidies intended to further universal service and other goals.  These payments are not targeted to those in need and are hidden from public view.  If not eliminated, any subsidies should be limited in scope, targeted to those in need and subject to normal appropriations processes.
<p>
6.  Freeing the radio spectrum.  The electromagnetic spectrum is currently subject 
to an inefficient system of central planning and control.  Frequencies should instead be
assigned and allocated based on market forces, allowing new technologies to develop and consumer preferences to be better served.  Licensees should be allowed to use frequencies for any purpose, as long as users of the spectrum should be extended the same First Amendment protection as other media.
<p>
Congress has a rare opportunity this year to implement long-overdue reform of 
telecommunications policy.  Instead of trying to adapt an outdated regulatory scheme to todays telecommunications landscape, Congress should allow markets and consumers to determine the course of this industry.

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h1>From Virtuality to Reality</h1>

<b>by Newt Gingrich</b>
<P><br>

Since the mid-1960s people have been talking about computers and the
information revolution. Drucker's The Age of Discontinuities, Boulding's,
The Meaning of the 20th Century and Bell's Beyond Post-Industrial Society
were all precursors to the first popularizer of this notion, which was
Future Shock by Heidi and Alvin Toffler -- and that was written basically a
quarter of a century ago.
<P>
Now, those four books described everything we're living through for all
practical purposes, except the details, and nothing has changed for a
quarter century. That leaves us with an interesting question: Since this is
all intellectually obvious, why can't we break through? Why, given this
potential of information, have we been so slow and so timid to embrace the
Third Wave?
<P>
I think the essence of this occurs at two levels.
<P>
The first was put forward by C.P. Snow in a 1959 BBC lectures series called
"The Two Cultures." Snow, who is a novelist, politician and a Ph.D. in
physics, argued that over the last century, and particularly the last 60
years, Western Civilization had broken into two cultures: a scientific
engineering culture that largely spoke the language of math, and an arts
and literary culture that largely spoke the language of literary allusion.
These two cultures had grown further and further apart, with the result, if
I can summarize in the modern era, that those who know are inarticulate,
and those who are articulate don't know. If you're capable of being glib
and verbal, the odds are you have no idea what you're talking about but it
sounds good; whereas if you know a great deal of what you're saying, the
odds are you can't get on a talk show because nobody can understand you.
<P>
You end up with more and more politicians and more and more reporters who
cover things they don't have a clue about, while people who understand the
potential literally cannot express that potential in a common language in a
way that people understand.
<P>
Two major facts compound the problem. One is that most entrepreneurs who
make breakthroughs are almost by definition psychologically uninterested in
working in dull, slow processes in which most of your time is spent
listening to people who don't know as much as you. The other is that the
science and engineering communities' are against being politically active
in any kind of practical sense. Thus with entrepreneurs and scientists not
engaged in governing, you end up with a society in which lawyers dominate,
so we get more laws to sue the few engineers who are left.
<P>
There is a second failure as to why we haven't broken through into the
Third Wave yet, and it's largely a failure of the imagination. If you ask
me intellectually where we are -- and this is directly out of the Toffler's
work, so it won't surprise most of you -- I would argue that the most
accurate analogy for where we are right now is not 1933, it's the 1770s to
1800. Just as the English-speaking world went through the transition from
the end of the medieval agrarian society to the rise of the commercial and
ultimately manufacturing society and out of that came waves of change that
were very traumatic and very profound, so the transition from the
industrial era into the information age is very similar in forcing us to
ask the most profound questions about relationships.
<P>
The greatest single works of that earlier period were intellectually both
by the same man, and it's interesting that the one we seldom talk about,
The Theory of Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith, which proceeds and frames The
Wealth of Nations, is an inherently philosophical and moral work, seeking
to understand how it is that human beings function and what it is that
drives them in concluding, as he put it, that there is a man in the mirror
and that each of us internally in some way seek to justify ourselves to
what we would call a conscience.
<P>
Later he wrote what was largely, much like Alexis de Tocqueville, a book of
reporting. That is, if you read The Wealth of Nations as the description by
a political philosopher of the changes he was literally living through as
Britain began to shift out of the medieval guild society into the
commercial world market society, it is almost the economic parable to de
Tocqueville, who later does the same thing for an American society making
the transition from republican virtue to democratic commercialism. Now, in
that setting, the Founding Fathers, the Federalist Papers, the Constitution
are in a sense all driven by this larger world view, this wrestling with
the nature of freedom and the nature of human beings, their relationship to
their creator and where they're going.
<P>
It's from this that you then begin to get radical change. Now, in the
United States it's easy and obvious. We have a revolution, the Articles of
Confederation fail, we have a second try. And this is why I keep telling
people don't worry about occasional failures. The second try is the
Constitution. It's worked reasonably well now for over 200 years. But it
wasn't their first product.
<P>
Now, I gave you that background because I think what we're missing in part
is: A) the ability to get people who are willing to think broadly enough
about basic issues and then draw conclusions from their thought, and B) the
willingness by politicians to take those ideas and begin to apply them
directly to the modern world and to begin to say, okay, if these principles
are true, what, then, should we do? For instance, I recently got some
excitement because I said we need to transform Medicare, which was, by the
way, promptly denounced by some people who say Gingrich wants to abolish
Medicare, which is not what the word "transform" means at all.
<P>
But my argument's very simple. Everywhere on the planet, we are saying that
the information age means more decentralization, more market orientation,
more freedom for individuals, more opportunity for choice, more capacity to
be productive without controls by the state. So we go to Poland, Hungary,
Russia, you name it, China, and then you look at the Health Care Financing
Administration, a mid-1960s effort to apply European centralized
bureaucracy to health care for the elderly, and which is having, by the
way, precisely the long-term results you'd expect. It is gradually cheating
doctors and hospitals and will presently cheat the elderly. And it is
producing a very expensive, very bureaucratic product which is not allowing
the citizen themselves to have any choice about the expenditure of their
funds for their lives.
<P>
Now it seems to me you could make a pretty good argument -- and given
everything we're saying to everybody else on the planet this ought to be a
no-brainer -- we can offer better health care with greater choices at
higher quality for more senior citizens by transforming Medicare than we
can by the next 200 task forces on paperwork at the Health Care Financing
Administration. Now, what makes that possible?
<P>
Well, one of the challenges I've made to doctors is to tell them we can
either go to Canada or to Walmart. You can either go to a nationally
controlled bureaucratic structure or you can go to the marketplace, but
you're not going to stay in a guild status where you have all the knowledge
but share none of it. And I'll give you a simple example: My wife had a
thyroid problem a couple of years ago, she called three different
specialists and said, "What do you charge?" None of them would tell her.
That's nuts.
<P>
And you should be able to access easily the database that says, "Here are
the doctors in the area; here's what they charge; here's what their
outcomes are like" before you walk in. And, by the way, "Here's where they
studied and here's what therapies they believe in."
<P>
It's not a lack of potential to do this. It's not a lack of ability to put
it on-line. It's not a lack of ability to teach people. Many of you will
remember when people didn't pump gas because, it was said, if everyday
citizens pumped gas, they'd set their cars on fire; you can't really let
people go out and put their own gas in their car; I mean, who knows what
they'll do; they'll be making molatov cocktails and throwing them at each
other; bad things will happen. How many of you remember this debate? This
was a serious debate in the 1970s all across the country.
<P>
Now, in that framework, let me give you a way of thinking about this. First
of all, I believe that the central issues of our time are cultural; they
are not political. What drove me to this belief was an analogy. The
questions I was trying to figure out was why do Americans do bureaucracy
badly. Why is it that bureaucratic models objectively, outside the military
and very small elite groups like the National Parks Service or the FBI, do
not work well?
<P>
As a general principal, create a bureaucracy in America and watch the decay
set in. And yet that's not automatically true about bureaucracy as a
system.
<P>
One can argue that much of Chinese history was remarkably bureaucratic and
pretty good. You can argue that German bureaucracy is a very impressive
model. Thus the conclusion was that Americans' problem with bureaucracy is
cultural. I don't know how many of you have been in Germany. As you know,
in Germany, on the Autobahn, there's no speed limit. You can go literally
any speed you want. Many Americans rent a car, they're doing 100, they're
excited and a Mercedes goes by at 160, they pull over and cry and they
never fully recover from the experience.
<P>
If tomorrow morning the Bundestag adopted 100-kilometer or 62- mile-an-hour
speed limit, virtually every German would obey it the next day, and at the
next election they would massacre the current generation of politicians and
they would elect The No Speed Limit Party.
<P>
Now, I'm always cautious about this because I don't want to offend anybody,
but my understanding is that the American cultural response to the
challenge of speed limits is substantially different from the German
cultural response.
<P>
In most of America, a speed limit is a benchmark of opportunity. Let me
just ask you a question. How many of you find that as a norm you look at
the posted number and add five or 10?
<P>
This, to me, was one of the two moments I became a revolutionary. A country
in which virtually every citizen drives over the speed limit it is
impossible to lead by bureaucratic regulation. By definition. And this is
why the Clinton health plan last year was so crazy. By definition, a nation
driven by incentives will wake up every morning and say, how do I get
around the rule; what can my lawyer find for me; is there a consultant who
knows the loopholes? And because the incentive for the individual always
beats the incentive for the system, the bureaucracy will always be one
layer behind and will be adding the complexity to the answer you had last
week, just when you found the new answer this week. The long-term cost
being that we absorb more and more resources into paperwork, bureaucracy,
blaming, litigation and all the horrors that we now have. An utterly
mindless and destructive system.
<P>
And part of my argument as a grand strategy is, we ought to go through and
wipe most of it out. If there's not some overwhelming reason for doing it,
quit doing it. You may not gain much profit but at least the pain will go
down.
<P>
Now, the second example that made me a revolutionary was we developed a
program called "Earning by Learning." We were worried about end states, we
weren't worried about processes; we were worried about outputs, not inputs.
<P>
<P>
We wanted second- and third-graders in public housing to learn how to read.
And so we'd go into public housing with volunteers and we would pay $2 a
book for every kid who would read, and we would do it in a setting where we
used the local public libraries, the books were free, we had the local
commons room so the room was free, we had a volunteer. So the only money
you had to raise, which I normally did just by making speeches and turning
the money over, was you had to pay the kids. If you had 50 kids and they
each read 20 books you had to raise $2,000. A very low-cost, very simple
model, based on incentive.
<P>
We went into Douglas County, Georgia, to the public housing project and an
eight-year-old child said, "You're going to cheat us." And this for me was
the breaking point. This is why, as far I'm concerned, the old order is
gone and the question is just how long it takes to get rid of it. And we
said, "What do you mean, we're going to cheat you?" This kid was eight
years old.
<P>
They said, "You're going to manipulate us into reading and then you won't
pay us." This was an eight-year-old kid who was already gone. I mean, as
far as they were concerned, the whole system was a cheat, all these people
are going to cheat us, you can't trust anybody.
<P>
So we said, all right -- because we believe in responding and listening and
it being a cybernetic system -- we said okay, for your group we'll pay
every week, cash. The first week about seven kids came. We paid them cash.
Read three books, here's six dollars. They had to read the book or answer
questions or in some way prove to the adult that they had mastered this
book.
<P>
These are kid's books, second graders. Six dollars. The following week
there were 14 kids. We said, "What happened?" They said, "Well, when you go
to the ice cream truck and you're buying ice cream and your friend turns to
you and says, how come you have money, you say, well I read, you know."
<P>
Now, my personal guess is that if no more than 10 percent of all current
federal spending for literacy programs was spent through volunteers in this
kind of incentive-driven program, we would begin to move toward 99 percent
literacy -- but it is a totally radically different way of thinking about
life.
<P>
Here are my suggestions for breaking through to this future. First of all,
I believe that during the next few years there's going to be new hope.
<P>
You're going to see genuinely a shift towards a positive, optimistic mood.
<P>
I believe second, there's going to be a new dialogue. That's why Congress
is now on-line and why we're going to change C-SPAN's access to the
Congress. That's why we're going to do a lot of things in public that the
old order did in private, that's why you're going to see a tremendous
effort on our part to reach out. I had a town hall meeting Saturday with
600-plus people. I'll have a town hall meeting every Saturday for the next
10 weeks. And people are going to have access all the time. It is nonsense
that you can't get access to the Speaker unless you pay money. In the sixth
District of Georgia, if you get out of bed, put on your clothes, get in the
car and show up at 2:00 in the afternoon, you have access. And if your
congressman doesn't give you access, fire him and hire one that will.
<P>
After the new hope and the new dialogue, you're going to see us do
something very different. We're going to create a new partnership. The word
partnership is very central to where we're going, and by the way, fits the
information age and I think fits the Internet. Partnership means we both
have responsibilities. Yes, I'll be compassionate, now what are you going
to be? But don't tell me the job is entirely one way. Don't tell me you'd
be glad to be rich but you don't want to work, you'd be glad to be wise but
you don't want to learn. The Declaration of Independence says we are
endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Pursuit implies getting up and
doing it. It doesn't say happiness stamps, it doesn't say happiness
entitlements, it doesn't say we need a federal department of happiness.
<P>
Recently I suggested, and I said at the time it was probably a dumb idea,
to offer a tax credit for laptops. It was a dumb idea; I shouldn't have
said it. But let me tell you what I was trying to get at. I was trying to
get at the idea that instead of saying, wow, all of the really
sophisticated, well-educated, upper middle-class people, you get to be over
here, and so we're going to take 30 percent of the country into the
information age and leave everyone else behind. What we ought to be saying
is we had better care about reaching out a helping hand to every American
and saying we'll do our half, we'll find some way.
<P>
Now maybe it ought to be done by private philanthropy. Maybe it ought to be
done by other kinds of devices. Maybe private companies ought to do it.
<P>
But somehow there has to be a missionary spirit in America that says to the
poorest child in America, "Internet's for you. The information age is for
you. There's an alternative to prostitution, drug abuse and death, and we
are committed to reaching every child in this country. And not in two
generations or three generations; we're committed this year, we're
committed now." If we can wire the world, 84 countries, 42 million people
wired into Internet "Talking to Thomas" in the U.S. Congress, if we can
wire the world, we can wire Washington, D.C., we can wire an Anacostia. We
can find a way to reach out. And I am not, obviously given my background,
recommending that what we do now is adopt a Soviet style centralized
institute of information distribution, but I am trying to
start a debate, a dialogue, and to set up the notion of a partnership
because it will change everything about where we're going.
<P>
The fourth point I would suggest to you is that out of this process a new
team will emerge, so we have new hope leading to a new dialogue creating a
new partnership. And why will a new team emerge? Because people are going
out doing things you don't expect. It is somebody willing to lay it on the
line to entrepreneurially try to create a better future and who's willing
to take the risks of doing it. And you're going to start finding people who
really are making things happen.
<P>
What are the 20 best places in the country on drug addiction? That's
knowable. My guess is that 19 or all of them are private. Where are they?
<P>
Who are their leaders? What are they doing? What are the 20 best places in
the country at taking children born in poverty without family structure and
getting them educated enough to go to college? That's knowable. And I'll
bet you're going to find a lot of them are private. We've got to start
learning from the positives.
<P>
I believe if through our having new hope we have a new dialogue, we can
build a partnership, and a partnership at every level. And that
partnership, by the way, has to involve a radically higher understanding of
the potential of the information age than we have today.
<P>
What you've got to focus on is the notion that somehow we're going to get
information out, we're going to have a dialogue among ourselves, we're
going to get aggregated information back in, we're going to identify the
most interesting and the best ideas, and they're not necessarily going to
come from the people that we know personally or that fit in a social or
credentialed spectrum. I don't know how to do that. It's going to take a
lot of smart people to invent this. We are 1760 not at 1789. We are
beginning to invent the America of the information age, we're not about to
inaugurate George Washington. Let's work together, and usher in the future
for America.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Introduction</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A book entitled <U>Privatization in the United
States</U> would be very thin indeed.  It would be so partly because
America did not participate as extensively as most other countries
with this century's destructive experiment of government production
of goods more efficiently produced by the private sector. Unfortunately,
the book also would be thin because Americans have been less aggressive
and imaginative than countries from Great Britain to Bolivia in
withdrawing the national government from activities better carried
by the private sector.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The federal government currently operates businesses
like electric generation, passenger rail service, mail delivery
and air traffic control that other countries have privatized.
Yet Washington's only principal divestitures have been Conrail
in 1987 and the Great Plains Coal Gasification Plant in 1988.
The value of salable federal enterprises is estimated to be more
than $75 billion, and selling them would save taxpayers $6.2 billion
per year. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This report proposes a politically viable plan
to expand privatization in America by selling three of the federal
government's Power Marketing Administrations. The PMA's, as they
are known to the cognoscenti, market power generated at dams owned
by the federal government. Currently, the federal government is
the nation's largest producer and transmitter of electricity.
 Yet whatever may have originally justified the government's involvement
in this area no longer exists. Areas that were once rural and
underdeveloped are now booming and thus do not need subsidized
electricity to encourage growth. The electric industry is now
entering an age of intense competition that undercuts its &quot;natural
monopoly.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Last year, the House Resources Committee developed
a plan to sell one of the PMA's, the Southeastern Power Administration
(SEPA). A coalition of concerned interests, including bass fishermen
who were worried about how the sale would affect them, blocked
the plan. This episode is typical of what has happened, and will
continue to happen, as serious attempts are made to reduce the
size of the federal government. Each year, millions of Americans
make decisions about planting a crop, attending college, or starting
a business based on the expectation of some benefit from Washington.
When these beneficiaries feel that their &quot;entitlement&quot;
might be taken away from them - regardless of the net benefits
to society - they often become active opponents to change.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The plan outlined here provides a creative
solution to this problem. Through a warrant privatization scheme,
current beneficiaries of the subsidized power provided by the
PMA's are effectively compensated for any potential loss of their
subsidy. Through a river association scheme, the users of environmental
and other non-power benefits of federal dams are actually given
control of &quot;their&quot; dams, with an opportunity to enhance
their benefits. Although it might be debatable that beneficiaries
deserve to be reimbursed for the loss of their subsidy, there
is no doubt that compensation will turn opponents of privatization
into proponents. Similar plans in Great Britain, Central Europe
and Latin America have turned pensioners, laborers and students
into capitalists. Similarly, our plan can serve as a model on
how to harness the energy of ordinary Americans in support of
privatizing many government functions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Not only does our plan reduce the size and
scope of the federal government, it also decentralizes the decision-making
process and returns power (no pun intended) to individuals and
local communities.  The birth of last year's plan to sell SEPA
was accompanied by a commotion of meetings, hearings, consultation
and lobbying in order to solve some very thorny issues.  What
was to be sold?  To whom?  At what price and under what conditions?
 Our plan will move these decisions as much as possible out of
committee rooms in Washington and give those decisions to people
who have a direct interest in the outcome.  Potential buyers of
the PMA's will have to woo consumers instead of sending lobbyists
to the Capitol.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is a broad consensus that the old, centralized
model of government is unsuitable for the future.  In both the
ends it achieves and the means it uses to achieve them, our plan
represents an innovative way to make the electric industry and
the federal government ready for the next century.</FONT>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">What are PMA's?</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Through the Tennessee Valley Authority and
five Power Marketing Administrations, the federal government produces
and markets about 9 percent of all electric power in the United
States. The PMA's are federal agencies within the Department of
Energy that market power produced by federal generation facilities
(mostly hydroplants). There are five PMA's in the Southeast, Southwest,
West and Alaska: Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA); Southwestern
Power Administration (SWPA); Western Area Power Administration
(WAPA); Alaska Power Administration (APA); and, Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA). This white paper deals with the privatization
of SEPA, SWPA and WAPA. (Alaska Power Administration is already
being defederalized; the Bonneville Power Administration and Tennessee
Valley Authority each present significantly different issues.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Southwestern Power Administration was established
by the Secretary of Interior under the authority of the President's
war powers in 1943. The authority to create permanent marketing
authorities was provided in 1944 with passage of Flood Control
Act. In 1950, the Secretary of Interior established Southeastern
Power Administration. Western Area Power Administration was authorized
under the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 when the
existing PMA's were transferred from Department of the Interior
to the Department of Energy. The purpose behind the PMA's was
to market electric power generated at federal water projects -
built primarily for the purposes of irrigation, navigation or
flood control - to provide for the repayment of these projects,
and to help supply households and businesses in certain areas
with inexpensive (subsidized) electric power  in order to promote
regional development.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Four of the five PMA's are funded annually
with appropriations, and receipts from their activities, such
as sale of electric power, are deposited in the Treasury as general
funds. BPA is an exception; in 1974, Congress stopped providing
Bonneville with appropriations and instead provided it with a
revolving fund maintained by the Treasury and permanent Treasury
borrowing authority. PMA's generally do not &quot;own&quot; and
operate the generation facilities (power houses and the dam structures
themselves). In case of SEPA, SWPA and WAPA, the generation facilities
are &quot;owned&quot; and operated primarily by the Corps of Engineers
or Bureau of Reclamation. The PMA's &quot;purchase&quot; power
from the Corps or the Bureau and then transmit and distribute
it through their transmission facilities (except for SEPA, which
does not own any transmission facilities and only markets power
through other utilities' transmission networks). The &quot;purchase&quot;
price that PMA's pay to the Corps or Bureau is not a market price,
but rather an administrative charge set  high enough to cover
the expenditures that the Corps or Bureau incur in investment,
operation and maintenance of power generation facilities. WAPA
and BPA are also required to cover in their administrative charges
costs of irrigation and other non-power activities that exceed
these users' ability to pay. (As both the generation and transmission
facilities are federally owned, we treat these transfers between
the PMA's and the Corps or Bureau as a budgetary issue. We assume
for the practical purpose of privatization that the firms consist
of the power generation equipment and the marketing organization.)
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The PMA's sell most of their power to &quot;preference
customers,&quot; so-called because the legislation establishing
the PMA's gave priority to certain classes of wholesalers.  For
example, the act establishing BPA states that, </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;<I>in order to insure that the facilities
for the generation of electric energy at the Bonneville project
shall be operated for the benefit of the general public, and particularly
of domestic and rural consumers, the administrator shall at all
times, in disposing of electric energy generated at said project,
give preference and priority to public bodies and cooperatives.&quot;</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">These preference customers, mainly cooperative
or municipal electric utilities (munies and co-ops for short),
generate their own power or purchase power from various sources,
including PMA's, and then distribute electricity to ultimate end
users in their service areas. State and federal agencies involved
in generation and distribution of electricity (e.g. state power
authorities, irrigation districts) also count as preference customers,
as do end users who are government entities, such as Air Force
bases. In recent years, the PMA's have begun contracting with
investor owned utilities (IOU's) to provide excess power to IOU
transmission network. The IOU's are not, however, considered to
be preference customers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">PMA power is among the least expensive electricity
available in the country. In 1993, average wholesale price for
electricity in the Southeast was 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour,
while SEPA sold on average for 1.89 &#162;/kWh.  The average wholesale
price in the Southwest was 2.76 &#162;/kWh as opposed to SWPA's
1.23 &#162;/kWh; the price in the West was 3.09 &#162;/kWh while
WAPA charged 1.81 &#162;/kWh. This data suggests that the PMA's
have succeeded in their mission of providing inexpensive power
in their marketing areas. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">How can the PMA's sell at such low prices?
 First, these PMA's market power generated at hydroplants, which
are, by their very nature, one of the cheapest sources of electric
power.  Second, legislation requires the PMA's to set their prices
at the lowest possible level consistent with sound business principles;
the PMA's goal is to generate revenue sufficient just to cover
their costs without making a profit or even adequate rate of return
on their investment. This means that the taxpayers are forced
to finance unprofitable businesses. Third, and perhaps most importantly,
the PMA's do not appear to recover all of the costs incurred 
in the production of electricity, directly contrary to the intention
of the legislation that created them. The reported costs do not
cover the real costs or, at least, postpone the recovery of these
costs to later periods. This problem is in part due to the fact
that the PMA's bookkeeping methods are not consistent with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as applied to private businesses.
Instead, the PMA's are subject to government accounting methods
and are audited under generally accepted auditing standards called
Government Auditing Standards. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">For example, WAPA depreciates its plants over
what appears to be an excessive period of 64 to 93 years (as opposed
to IOU's which use about 50 years). WAPA also uses the compound
interest method in which depreciation expenses are lower in the
earlier years of operation and higher in later years, which is
contrary to standard accounting practice. An analysis of WAPA's
1993 financial statements made by Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP,
showed that using straight-line depreciation method over 50 years
(which appears to be close to actual depreciation) would result
in depreciation expense of $90 million, as compared to $34 million
reported in its financial statements. This implies that the true
costs of generating electricity are actually higher than the costs
reported by the PMA's.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Some costs of the federal hydro program are
not recovered due to the distorted allocation of costs for power
production and irrigation. For example,  with WAPA's Pick Sloan
Missouri Basin Program, part of power generation costs were to
be recovered from future irrigation project revenues. However,
many of originally proposed irrigation projects have not been
and probably never will be built. While common business sense
suggests shifting the allocation of these costs from irrigation
to power production with an increase WAPA's rates accordingly,
this has not happened. As a result, &quot;approximately $454 million
of the federal investment in the Pick Sloan Program's hydropower
facilities and water storage reservoir is unrecoverable unless
the project repayment allocations are revised&quot;.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Another reason for low rates are low costs
of borrowing capital from the federal government, which gives
the PMA's an implicit subsidy and an advantage not available to
all other utilities. The PMA's and the Corps or Bureau amortize
the federal investment in generation and transmission assets over
a period of 50 years with an average interest rate ranging from
2.7 to 4.6 percent (this contrasts with 8.1 percent average interest
rate on long-term debt held by IOU's in 1993). These interest
rates are actually lower than the interest rates at which the
federal government borrows money (average 6.9 % in 1995).<SUP>
</SUP> By lending to PMA's at lower interest rates than the rate
of borrowing from bondholders, the federal government cost taxpayers
an estimated $946 million during 1985-1994.  The artificially
low costs of capital allow PMA's to charge very low rates, rates
that would be unsustainable if they had to repay the investment
at market interest rates over a normal commercial amortization
period. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Another obvious, albeit implicit, subsidy for
PMA's is their exclusion from paying <I>any</I> federal, state
or local taxes. Such a subsidy costs taxpayers a significant amount
of money by shifting the tax burden normally assumed by the power
company shareholder and electricity ratepayer to the general taxpayer.
For example, in its bid for Phoenix Area assets of WAPA (this
area markets about 18 percent of WAPA power), Tucson Electric
Power Co. calculated that if the assets were sold to a taxpaying
entity, the U.S. Treasury would have received approximately $140
million in federal taxes, while the state of Arizona would have
received about $126 million in property taxes (the numbers are
in present value terms). The EOP Group study estimated the present
value of the federal income taxes paid by the privatized PMA's
would be $1.013 billion.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">Why Should the PMA's Be Privatized?</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">While all taxpayers subsidize the capital costs
of PMA's, it is only some consumers who receive the benefits of
PMA power in the form of lower electricity rates. It is not apparent
why people living in the Northeast should pay part of the electricity
bills for people living in the Southeast, or, at the extreme,
why the people on one side of Los Angeles (those who buy power
from Southern California Edison and pay 12.10&#162;/kWh) should
subsidize the electricity bills for people on the other side of
the city (those who buy power from the City of Los Angeles and
pay 9.85&#162;/kWh). The residents of Santa Clara CA (7.30&#162;/kWh)
and Palo Alto CA (5.46&#162;/kWh) receive an even better deal
from their municipal utilities distributing PMA power. Their neighbors
in San Francisco Bay Area pay 12.25&#162;/kWh to PG&amp;E which
has to bear full costs of capital and has no tax exemptions. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The federal power program (together with support
for rural electric cooperatives provided by the Rural Utilities
Service, formerly Rural Electrification Administration) was originally
intended primarily to serve farmers, households and small businesses
located in remote, rural, underdeveloped areas which investor-owned
utilities might not supply with power at reasonable prices. While
the ultimate consumers of PMA power are often rural households,
they are by no means their only customers. There are a number
of examples where the benefits of the federal power program now
flow to people who were not originally intended to receive them.
Places like Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Pasadena, Riverside, Sacramento
or Anaheim, California, Colorado Springs, Springfield, Missouri,
Lincoln, Nebraska and Kansas City have their own municipal utilities
that purchase power from the PMA's.  These communities can hardly
be called rural or poor or characterized as undesirable from the
IOU's perspective. Palo Alto, one of the richest communities in
the world, is a stunning example of governmental subsidies flowing
to the least needy people.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Many communities that may have fit the profile
of those intended to be aided by subsidized public power may once
have been rural, but over the years have become prosperous suburbs.
Still others have become popular resorts catering to wealthy clientele
(Hilton Head, South Carolina, Vail and Aspen, Colorado). </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Still other beneficiaries of subsidized public
power are huge corporations, especially in the extractive industries
such as mining, that gain an unfair competitive advantage based
not on merit but on subsidized power.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The electricity industry is undergoing unprecedented
change, moving from a tightly regulated industry to the competitive
one.  Eventually, consumers may be able to choose their electricity
supplier as they now do their long distance service provider.
But investor-owned utilities will find it difficult to compete
with companies whose power is cheaper <I>not</I> because they
are more efficient, but rather because they have access to government-subsidized
capital. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is not only subsidies that distort competition.
PMA's are also exempt from a variety of Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) regulations. Under recently issued Order No.
888 on open transmission access, the PMA's are not required to
file open access tariffs like private utilities. They become subject
to the open access order only when they seek access to other utilities'
lines (the so called reciprocity provision). Because SWPA and
WAPA own substantial transmission systems, excluding these systems
from <I>full</I> open access requirements may actually chill wholesale
competition. By privatizing, the PMA's will be subject to the
same regulatory requirements as any other investor-owned utility
and will provide for a competitive marketplace. Privatization
of federal power assets is critical to creating a level playing
field for a competitive electricity industry in America. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Technical Efficiency</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is commonly recognized that due to the lack
of profit imperative or risk of bankruptcy, government-owned enterprises
are usually less efficient than private firms. Even the Chairman
of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors begrudgingly
admits this in his recent book entitled <U>Whither Socialism</U>:
&quot;Yet I do think that the popular prejudice is, by and large,
correct: <I>Private sector activities, while not necessarily more
efficient, are on average so </I>[emphasis by the author]&quot;.
However, the empirical evidence relating to public power sector,
if interpreted superficially, may lead to the contrary conclusion.
Some studies find that the private power sector is not always
more efficient than the public sector. For example, William J.
Hausmann and John L. Neufeld: <U>Property Rights versus Public
Spirit, etc</U>., conclude that &quot;We constructed several measures
of productive efficiency&#133;We found that for every measure
examined, the municipally owned electric utilities were significantly
more efficient than their privately owned counterparts.&quot;
Or Lon L .Peters: <U>Attenuated Property Rights, etc</U>., state
that  &quot;almost all studies [in the utility industry] of costs
and efficiency found either no significant differences between
ownership types, or an advantage of some type in favor of publicly
owned publicly owned [nonprofit municipal] firms.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">      Without addressing specifics of these
studies, we would like to emphasize that better performance of
publicly owned utilities is unlikely to be simply the result of
public ownership. Instead, together with others we would stress
the importance of <I>competition,</I> hard budget constraints<I>
</I>and the absence of government price <I>regulation </I>in shaping
the incentives for efficient performance of both public and private
firms. Indeed, rate of return regulation, as practiced in the
United States, has proven to provide very weak incentives for
managers of IOU's basically because it limits the rewards from
cost saving as well as the pain from inefficiency. It is not that
surprising that <I>unregulated</I> public utilities often do better
in this environment. Both public ownership and regulation dull
incentives and it is not surprising that in this choice between
two &quot;bads,&quot; public ownership at times turns out to dull
incentives less than cost of service regulation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> However, the U.S. electric industry is moving
away from regulation and toward competition.  In this new environment,
both public and private electric companies will be subject to
the same markets forces. On the question whether private or public
is better in this environment, it is appropriate to conclude with
Vickers and Yarrow that &quot;&#133;where competition is effective,
the available evidence suggests that private enterprise is generally
to be preferred on both internal efficiency grounds and, subject
to the qualification that other substantive market failures are
absent, social welfare grounds.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Fortunately, the question of public/private
efficiency is less theoretical in the case of PMA's. Here we actually
have some limited data on the operations of hydro plants both
by the federal government and by privately owned utilities. Our
conclusion is that some federal government practices are clearly
less efficient than those of privately operated hydro plants.
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Full Gate/Best Gate</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">PMA's power contracts are largely based on
capacity, and so it is advantageous to maximize output to avoid
the need to purchase capacity somewhere else. As a consequence,
the PMA/Corps plants are operated at Full Gate, which means that
water control gates in the turbine are opened to provide maximum
water flow and thus maximum output (in MW).  However, this is
less efficient than Best Gate, a regime normally used by investor-owned
utilities, in which the turbine water flow is set at the point
of peak turbine efficiency. This enables the highest possible
amount of potential energy in the form of accumulated water to
be turned into electric energy, while at Full Gate, some of the
water energy accumulated in the federal dams is wasted. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A good example of this type of inefficiency
is suggested by a cursory analysis made of the four SEPA/Corps
of Engineers projects on the Alabama River Basin by Southern Company
(an investor-owned utility) to estimate the inefficiencies caused
by Full Gate operation. They found that, due to a loss of turbine
efficiency of about 7 percent,  the value of annual energy lost
is about $700,000. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Outages</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Another inefficiency found in PMA operations
is their outage rates. The PMA's do not produce the maximum power
possible due to very long outages. Causes for this include the
added wear on units from continual Full Gate operations, generator
overheating and prolonged repair outages. The timing of these
outages is also inefficient. Unlike investor-owned utilities,
PMA's do not provide a reserve fund for major unit repair costs,
and funds for the repairs must come from Congress. Because of
this the PMA's cannot schedule their outages at optimal (i.e.
off-peak) periods. They are forced to make repairs when they receive
funds, often during summer peak periods. Non-optimally timed outages
represent an obvious loss of energy. They result in excess spillage
and increases in energy production from other, usually more costly
resources, in order to meet the peak load.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At one point SEPA had about 800MW of hydro
capacity (or 26 percent of its installed capacity) either out
of service or forced to operate at less than full capacity because
of maintenance problems. This is in contrast to the industry average
outage rate of 8.7 percent for the past five years. As an extreme
example, unit #1 at Jones Bluff project was out of service from
March 1992 until August 1995, and unit #1 at Millers Ferry has
been out of service since June 1992. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Budget Impact</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Governments often privatize industries to receive
a quick &quot;windfall&quot; of cash to cover budget deficits.
For politicians, budgetary considerations may also be the driving
force behind privatization efforts of federal hydro assets. The
Clinton Administration's FY 1995 budget proposed to sell the PMA's
to their preference customers was clearly motivated by budgetary
factors. The Clinton proposal, because it involved selling the
PMA's to other governmental or quasi-governmental entities, was
unlikely to yield any of the efficiency gains true privatization
would confer, but it may still have had  favorable budgetary consequences.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">With the sale of the PMA's, the government
would receive a lump-sum of revenue to help offset the budget
deficit and would be relieved from any future financial obligations
for the operation of PMA facilities. It would also receive corporate
income taxes from the privatized PMA's as well as income taxes
from their bondholders or shareholders.  The government would,
however, forego the revenue from the PMA's since the receipts
from PMA's deposited in the Treasury currently exceed the appropriations
as the PMA's are repaying their past debts. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The mathematics of the budgetary costs and
benefits is quite simple. Our estimate of the present value of
what the Treasury loses by privatizing is $3,386 million (the
assumptions we used tend to make this estimate higher than the
real number). If the privatization proposal described later is
adopted, the federal government will end up with at least $3,523
million from the sale of SEPA, SWPA and WAPA. The present value
of the stream of future taxes was estimated to be $1,013 million.
Thus the <I>net</I> budgetary benefit can be considered to be
$1,150. The fact that most of the benefit is realized in a lump
sum revenue makes privatization even more attractive to Congress
struggling with a deficit. It is also worth noting that, due to
the fact that the PMA's will be sold for a fixed price as a consequence
of the privatization mechanism described in Part 2, Congress has
an opportunity to adjust the revenue by simply moving the fixed
price up or down. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">If There Are So Many Benefits,</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">Why Haven't the PMA's Been
Privatized Yet?</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The first attempt to privatize the PMA's was
made by President Reagan in his FY 1987 budget proposal. As its
response, the 99<SUP>th</SUP> Congress imposed a prohibition on
the federal government to solicit or study any proposals to sell
the PMA's without specific congressional authorization. In its
FY1996 budget proposal, the Clinton Administration also suggested
divestiture of all PMA's except Bonneville. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The most recent effort to privatize the PMA's
was undertaken in September 1995 by the U.S. House Committee on
Resources. The Committee reported &quot;The Power Administration
Purchase Act,&quot; that would have eventually privatized SEPA
and its associated generation facilities to the highest bidder.
This effort apparently was stopped by traditional interest group
politics, including the objections of subsidized recreational
users of the water projects. The beneficiaries of the federal
hydropower program (i.e., the recipients of subsidized power as
well as beneficiaries of the other aspects of the water projects)
 have overridden the general interest of taxpayers - who paid
for the construction and operation of the dams, including the
assets of the PMA's, and who currently subsidize both power and
non-power benefits from the federal water projects. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The opponents of privatization usually make
three points. First, they point out that the PMA's traditionally
have been a source of inexpensive power and thus privatization
would lead to unjust rate increases that would hurt ordinary citizens.
While the likelihood of rate increases have been exaggerated (particularly
because there are surpluses of power throughout the country),
even if there were significant increases in PMA rates at the<I>
wholesale</I> level, the concern of privatization opponents over
rate increases at the consumer level is excessive. PMA power represents
a fairly small portion of all the  power distributed by co-ops
and munies to their ultimate customers - of all sources of power
used by preference customers in each market,  WAPA supplies only
12 percent, SWPA only 13 percent and SEPA only 5 percent.  Thus
increases in PMA rates would affect only a small portion of preference
customer's portfolios - which they could minimize by buying from
other suppliers. An EOP Group study for the Edison Electric Institute
estimated that the electricity bills of  93 percent of ultimate
residential buyers of SEPA power would not increase by more than
5 percent; increases no higher than 5 percent would be experienced
by about 73 percent of SWPA customers and 90 percent of WAPA customers.
From the data provided in the EOP Group Study, we have calculated
the average monthly bill increase for a household served by a
muni or co-op to be $1.50 for SEPA, $3 for SWPA and $1.10 for
WAPA. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Second, the opposition stresses that the PMA's
currently yield a positive return to the U.S. Treasury, and that
by privatizing the federal government would be deprived of a valuable
source of revenue. As mentioned above, the PMA's have been rather
an expensive venture because the interest on their debt is lower
than the interest on the national debt. However, even if we do
not take this into account, any privatization that brings revenue
higher than the present value of the expected PMA contributions
is desirable from the fiscal point of view. As we show in the
previous section, our privatization plan satisfies this condition.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Third, the opponents of PMA privatization have
been stressing that federal water projects are multi-purpose and
that the new owners would fail to provide adequate irrigation,
recreation, navigation and fish and wildlife protection. What
the opponents conveniently fail to mention is that there are 366
hydroelectric projects throughout the country operated by investor-owned
utilities, plus 90 additional projects operated by private non-electric
entities, subject to FERC license, and that all of these, by their
very nature, provide benefits other than power. Table 2 presents
the extent of private hydroelectric production in four regions
of the United States. The private sector is able to build and
manage even large projects -  there are 77 private projects whose
installed capacity exceeds 50MW, and among them 7 projects with
capacity over 500MW. The non-power functions of private dams are
thoroughly scrutinized through the FERC licensing process, which
also applies to public non-federal entities. However the licensing
process may be in imperfect way to balance the power and non-power
interests.  It is important to point here that all relevant parties
(farmers, fishermen, boaters, public authorities) have input into
the licensing process and their concerns are included in the conditions
of license. There is no reason to believe that the new owners
of PMA/Corps facilities would do a worse job than the present
private dam owners.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Despite the benefits of PMA privatization,
action remains blocked by special interests. This is yet another
example of how good intentions are simply not enough to move the
process in Washington. There are thousands of pages of reports
describing the benefits that privatization would bring to the
general taxpayers; there are hundreds of pages of reports showing
that any possible harms to various interest groups would be much
lower than the groups claim; yet, this blizzard of paper is not
going to move the privatization of PMA's forward. What is needed
is a plan that recognizes the interest group nature of the political
process; a plan that recognizes that current beneficiaries of
federal programs such as the PMA's will slow, and in some cases
stop altogether, privatization efforts; a plan that would create
the proper incentives for current beneficiaries to become champions
of privatization. Such a plan is focus of this report.</FONT>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">BLOCK-SHADEGG PRIVATIZATION
PROPOSAL<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">Resolving the Interest Group Problem</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We propose to privatize the PMA's in a way
that will hurt neither the end users of PMA power nor the people
who enjoy the non-power benefits of the federal hydro projects.
In fact, our privatization plan overcomes traditional interest
group opposition by attempting to turn the end users of public
power and other beneficiaries of federal hydro programs from opponents
of any privatization into potential proponents. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In designing a program to privatize federal
hydroelectric assets, Congress can learn many lessons from the
recent privatization experiences of other countries. A good contrast
between a well-designed privatization plan with strong public
support (and strong support for the politicians who put it through)
and a plan that ignored the stakeholder aspects of privatization
and thus magnified the fear of privatization and slowed the process,
is provided by comparing the Czech and Hungarian privatization
experiences.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Czechs have led the world in privatizing
their economy. In 1990, only about 4 percent of their GDP was
privately produced. By 1995, 67 percent of GDP was privately produced.
The Czech privatization efforts were successful because, in part,
they relied on voucher privatization - a system in which each
citizen could purchase, for a little bit more than the average
weekly wage, vouchers that could be exchanged for shares of those
enterprises being privatized. The government then sold (or privatized)
its enterprises in a unique auction in which millions of people
were able to bid for thousands of corporations' shares and pay
for them with their vouchers. The share value citizens obtained
was on average substantial (a few months income). This mobilized
the self-interest of the Czech people and created very stable
political support both for privatization and the transition from
communism in general. The Czech privatization process was completed
in two separate waves. As the profits of the first wave became
evident to average citizens, they started to criticize the government,
not for privatizing too much, but for reserving too much property
for direct sales and not allowing the general public to bid on
more assets with their vouchers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Hungarian government, on the other hand,
offers a cautionary tale for any would-be privatizer. Hungary
downplayed mass privatization and put a good deal of emphasis
on the budgetary and foreign capital inflow implications of privatization.
The government attempted to sell their enterprises to international
corporations or to the current managers and paid very little attention
to stakeholder politics. It was not uncommon for the Hungarian
government to sell an enterprise very cheaply to a group of managers,
who immediately resold it at a handsome profit. While there is
nothing economic inefficient with such transactions, the public
viewed them as unjust - a small group of the privileged benefited
most from privatization while the &quot;man on the street&quot;
was left only with assurance from economists and others that eventually
the efficiency gains  would trickle down. Abstractions apparently
do not sell very much better in Central Europe than in the United
States, and this privatization approach eventually led to a loss
of confidence in privatization. The initial program had to be
stopped and revised and the privatization process significantly
slowed down.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">While privatization would lead to a net increase
in the wealth of Central and Eastern European nations, not all
of these countries were able to make rapid progress in privatization.
Similarly even though the gains to the winners in PMA privatization
will exceed any losses, privatization still may not succeed. Those
who believe they might be losers due to a public policy change
may, if losses are sufficiently concentrated and benefits sufficiently
diffuse, stop a generally beneficial policy change. The lesson
from the formerly communist economies is that a creative privatization
program, such as that used by the Czechs, can make almost <I>everybody</I>
a winner and generate enough political support to accomplish the
privatization. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This is exactly what our privatization proposal
is all about. We have designed a plan that has the potential of
making everyone winners. All end users of PMA power who might
be hurt by rate increases will receive fully negotiable warrants
entitling them to a below market purchase of &quot;their&quot;
PMA stock, and thus to potential capital gains significant enough
to offset most, if not all, of any rate increase. In fact, since
private ownership is likely to increase efficiency, their potential
capital gains should actually outweigh the present discounted
value of any rate increase. The recipients of the non-power activities
of the hydro projects would be given shares of a river association
(having a corporate structure) that would own and manage the non-power
side of &quot;their&quot; projects. They will thus be the ones
deciding how to structure the provision of non-power activities.
 Since the arrangement we propose guarantees a sufficient flow
of revenue from the power source to the non-power river corporation,
all river users will also receive a valuable asset.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">A Warrant Approach to PMA
Privatization</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Conversion of PMA's into Government  Corporations</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Before proceeding to the core elements of our
proposal, we need to describe how to prepare the target PMA's
for sale. At present, the PMA's are simply federal agencies operating
within the Department of Energy. They keep accounting records
under government accounting methods and have no equity capital.
They do not finance their expenditures with their own internal
funds or through the capital market, but through annual appropriations
from Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The first logical step on the way to privatization
is to turn these federal agencies into more standard corporations,
with shares that could be sold to private citizens. This is exactly
what Congress did when it privatized Conrail. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The federal government would establish a separate
corporation for each of the PMA's. Each PMA would incorporate
in a state within the region where it operates and have the same
powers as any other private corporation. These corporations would
have the authority to operate and maintain the generation and
transmission facilities and to market transmission services and
electricity. Each corporation would be directed by a Transition
Manager appointed by the President of the United States, who would
have the powers and duties of the Board of Directors until the
board is elected by the new owners. On a given date, each corporation
would issue capital stock to the Treasury and all funds, debts
and contracts of the PMA's and all facilities to be privatized
would be transferred from the federal agency to the new corporations.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Distribution of Warrants</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The next step is the key step: The <I>ultimate</I>
consumers of PMA power - those who actually use PMA power distributed
by their co-ops or munies (or in some rare cases their IOU) to
light their homes and operate their businesses - would be given
warrants that would entitle them to purchase a fixed number of
shares in the PMA by a pre-set date at a price that we call &quot;strike
price.&quot; We propose that the strike price (which is treated
in much greater detail below) be set below the expected market
value of the shares. How many shares each particular consumer
will be able to buy with his warrants will be based on how much
power he bought from the PMA in the past (the specific time is
referred to as the reference time period).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The concept is probably best communicated by
example: Suppose that the Wildcat Electric Cooperative purchased
power from WAPA that amounted to 10 percent of all the power produced
by the to-be-privatized WAPA facilities. Further assume that Ms.
Smith has a rather large house and during the reference year consumed
0.02 percent of power sold by Wildcat Electric Cooperative. Thus
Ms. Smith consumed 0.002 percent of power produced by WAPA facilities.
As a consequence, Ms. Smith will be given a warrant that entitles
her to buy 0.002 percent of WAPA shares at the strike price. If
WAPA Inc. issued 10 million shares, the warrant would entitle
Ms. Smith to purchase 200 of these shares at the strike price.
She could, of course, purchase as many warrants from other customers
as she wished and hence purchase as many shares of WAPA Inc. as
she thought desirable.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The warrants issued to end-users would be fully
negotiable; anyone will be allowed to buy or sell warrants at
any conditions agreeable to the contracting parties (i.e. buyer
and seller). The actual sale of PMA shares would take place on
a specified date to the individuals holding warrants on that day.
After that day, the warrants that were not redeemed for shares
would become void.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Translation of Warrants into Profits</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The most politically attractive feature of
our privatization proposal stems from the fact that the strike
price would be set below the expected market price. If, for example,
the market price of a share is $5 while the strike price is only
$3, Ms. Smith can make, by exercising her right to purchase 200
shares at the strike price of $3 and reselling them at market
for $5, a profit of $400. Estimates of potential profits for average
consumers as well as some analysis of these estimates are presented
in Part 3 below. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Of course since the warrants are fully negotiable,
Ms. Smith does not even have to risk her own money to earn a profit.
 Because the warrants entitle <I>anyone</I> holding them to purchase
stock at below the market price, they in themselves have value.
 Potential buyers of a PMA would be willing to pay up to the difference
between the market price of the stock and the strike price for
a warrant controlling a single share.  As we expect that the warrants
would sell for close to this difference, Ms. Smith's  warrant
would be worth $400--the difference between the market price and
the strike price, $2, multiplied by the number of shares it controls,
200.  So she can sell her warrant and earn just as much as if
she had purchased shares using the warrant and sold them at the
market price.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is likely that a majority of the original
warrant holders - households such as Ms. Smith's - would not actually
exercise their warrant entitlements to become shareholders of
their PMA. They may not be interested in being an owner of a PMA,
and the relatively small number of shares that their warrants
entitle them to purchase would not enable them to exercise any
appreciable control over the PMA's management. Instead, we expect
most warrant holders will simply sell their warrants, make a tidy
profit and never bother with actually buying shares and risking
their own capital in a privatized PMA.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Czech experience, while not an exact analogy,
provides instructive lessons on how our  Ms. Smith would respond
to privatization. The Czechs did not, as it turned out, actually
have to exchange their vouchers for shares of enterprises. Instead
they could entrust a part or all of their vouchers to one of a
number of investment funds (usually established by banks or other
investment corporations). It was the fund that bid for and eventually
obtained the shares of the enterprises being privatized. The people
who entrusted their vouchers to the fund became shareholders of
that fund. As it turned out, these investment funds actually saved
the entire privatization process. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">When the Czech privatization program began,
there were millions of people who did not understand the voucher
scheme, who had no experience with &quot;shares&quot; or &quot;capital
markets&quot; and who did not see any real value in the shares
they could potentially obtain. Even among those perceptive souls
who could see the value of the stock gained in exchange of vouchers,
there were doubts about whether anybody would buy their shares
(there was no stock exchange at that time). Early in the process
not many Czechs showed an interest in buying vouchers and participating
in the process. In fact, in the early stages the whole process
was deemed to be a political failure. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">But the profits were too enticing. The difference
between the voucher price (1,035 Czech Crowns or about $40) and
the expected market value of the shares an average citizen could
obtain (30,000 Crowns or almost $1200) created a <I>huge</I> profit
potential. Through a little marketing -  a charismatic leader
of an innovative Harvard Investment Fund appeared on the TV screens
declaring &quot;Whoever entrusts his vouchers to Harvard Fund
will get 10,350 Crowns in cash next year&quot; - Czechs quickly
became aware that they stood to make money and enthusiastically
joined the privatization effort. For our purpose, it is also worth
noting that other investment funds had little choice but to join
the race. They started bidding up the prices for vouchers, redistributing
the gains from privatization from the funds to the general public.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are a number of parallels between the
Czech experience and our PMA privatization proposal. We expect
that many people would not understand the uses of their warrants.
There may be people who fear that they will not be able to sell
their shares above the strike price. However, there is little
doubt that many utilities, investment bankers and other groups
are interested in gaining control over the PMA's generation and
transmission assets. These interested parties will make a market
in warrants.  In fact, they are likely to make a market at issue;
that is, as soon as the legislation is signed, bidding may start
for the right to buy warrants at the time of their issue. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The potential buyers of warrants will likely
advertise through newspapers and television or directly contact
recipients of warrants. The highest price that each prospective
warrant buyer will pay is equal to the difference between the
value they attach to the shares and the strike price. Competition
among various parties for warrants, and hence for control over
the PMA's, will force each potential bidder to bid as high a price
as they can. Each bidder will be forced by competition to bid
just short of how much the warrants are worth to them. This competition
between bidders will assure that the original warrant holders
(i.e., the current end users of PMA power) will reap much of the
gains from privatization. These gains are precisely the mechanism
that we think will turn current opponents of privatization into
proponents. It will not be rate increases, which are not likely
to be very significant anyway, that PMA's end users will be most
concerned about; instead, they will be concerned about how much
money they will get for their warrants, and will be checking their
newspapers  and their mail for the latest offer. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As the market for warrants develops, the prospective
buyers are likely to be quite inventive in their efforts to buy
warrants from the end users. It is likely that potential buyers
will make tender offers - public announcements that they are willing
to buy warrants from any original warrant holder at a specified
price - and communicate them to the warrant holders through the
media or mail. Some warrants, of course, will be purchased by
speculators who do not desire to gain control over PMA's but want
to resell the warrants. We are persuaded that Wall Street will
make a market in warrants and in short order the market will change
from a decentralized and spontaneous one to a centralized market;
a market that will concentrate supply and demand at one place;
a market that will eventually achieve an equilibrium price for
warrants and will move the warrants to those who value the ownership
of PMA's most highly. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The competition in bidding for warrants will
assure that the ultimate owners of PMA's are those who will be
able to operate them most efficiently. Those who can run PMA's
most efficiently will be able to outbid other potential buyers,
and the current end users will get most of the gains from reallocating
the PMA's to the most efficient owners. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The governmental involvement in the market
for warrants should be limited to making information about end-users'
warrant holdings easily available, so that the costs of contacting
them are minimal. Low costs of obtaining this information as well
as equal access to such information are important conditions for
maximizing the end users' gains. Publishing the list of end users,
together with the number of warrants they hold and their addresses
in the Federal Register will just do that.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Investors who worry that this plan will not
enable them to gain a controlling interest in the newly privatized
PMA's need not be concerned. Even if all of the warrants for the
PMA shares were in the hands of individual households, there is
no reason to believe that creatively structured tender offers
would not yield sufficient warrants to gain control of the PMA's.
As in the Czech experience - even more so because our capital
markets are so much more advanced - most households will avail
themselves of the opportunity to reap profits now by selling their
warrants rather than holding shares or selling them to their preference
suppliers at non-competitive prices.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">However, even if a large number of households
do not sell their warrants to the highest bidder or that the costs
of acquiring all of the necessary warrants this way are excessive
(there is no evidence that this would be the case), all is not
lost. As Table 3 indicates, a very large share of all warrants
will be held by commercial and industrial consumers. In fact,
in WAPA, if you take the combined share of commercial and industrial
warrant holders (who we assume are quite likely to sell to the
highest bidder) and the federal government (which will under our
plan have to sell to the highest bidder), the highest bidder could
potentially control over 58 percent without acquiring any warrants
from households. Also, because of uneven distribution of warrants
<I>inside </I>customer classes, it is sufficient in order to gain
a controlling interest to buy warrants from a relatively small
number of end users who have relatively large warrant holdings.
Both logic and experience suggest that the highest bidder will
not have a problem in gaining control of PMA assets.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The experience of the British privatization
program is particularly instructive on this point. One of its
objectives was to achieve more widespread stock ownership in Great
Britain. In some cases (British Telecom, Trustee Savings Bank,
British Gas and British Airways) the shareholders were encouraged
to retain their shares, typically by the promise of free bonus
shares after three years. Thatcher era privatization did increase
the number of individual shareholders enormously - from 5 percent
of adult population before privatization to 20-23 percent in 1987.
As for the concentration of ownership in particular companies,
the diffusion of ownership was less enduring. Within one year
after privatization the number of shareholders in Cable and Wireless
fell from 150,000 to 26,000, and in British Aerospace the number
had fallen from 158,000 to 27,000. Even corporations with incentives
for small shareholders to retain their shares experienced huge
drop shareholder numbers. When British Telecom was privatized
in 1984, it had 2.3 million shareholders. In 1987 it had only
1.4 million. More than one million people initially bought British
Airways stock while only three months after the sale it had 420,000
shareholders.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Like the Thatcher era privatization in Britain,
our privatization plan will create a large number of potential
shareholders and we expect a similarly rapid and dramatic fall
off in the number of shareholders after privatization. In fact,
since warrants will be distributed without any action being taken
by the warrant holders, many of these potential shareholders are
likely to be less interested in becoming shareholders than were
their British counterparts (who had to apply for their shares).
The distribution of warrants to many individuals who are only
marginally interested in stock ownership should make for an even
more active market in warrants than may be expected from the British
experience. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The capital markets in this country are very
well developed and creative, and it may be that advertisements
for warrants will develop even <I>before </I>the Congress approves
this privatization plan. If this were to happen it might prove
very useful since there is a chicken and egg problem in PMA privatization
- public power consumers are opposed to privatization because
they fear rate increases and do not see any offsetting gains.
Of course they cannot see any gains until they have their warrants,
which they cannot get because they are blocking privatization
proposals in Congress. The prospective buyers are able to cut
the Gordian knot by signaling to end users that they would make
money through PMA privatization. Advertisements for &quot;warrants
if issued&quot; might dramatically change the political dynamics
surrounding PMA privatization. It would foster an attitude that
privatization is something from which ordinary citizens can actually
gain.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Rules Concerning the Rates Need to Be Made
Clear</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">If the end users are to receive the maximum
value for their warrants (or eventually their shares), potential
investors need to have a clear idea about how much the PMA's are
going to be worth. That is, they need to know what rates they
will be allowed to charge their wholesale customers after taking
control of the PMA's, or at least under what rules the rates will
be determined. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This question of what rates to allow is a classic
dilemma facing every government that is considering privatizing
a regulated industry. The lower the allowed rates, the lower the
privatization revenue. The higher the rates, the less customers
gain from privatization. Fortunately, the warrant approach mitigates
the dilemma. Since warrants are exchanged at a fixed strike price,
government revenue is not effected by rule considerations as long
as the rates are high enough to assure that the value of the PMA
is higher than the strike price. However, higher rates for the
PMA's would enable the government to set higher strike prices.
The correlation between end users' well being and higher rates
is also weak since any rate increases translate to a higher value
for warrants. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Since under a warrant plan rate changes are
basically compensated by changes in warrant value, we think that
Congress should focus on efficiency when deciding on post-privatization
rates. However, the end users' gains will be also affected by
clarity of the rules. If those who would like to gain control
of the PMA's are risk averse, they will be willing to pay less
for the warrants if they are uncertain about the rates they will
be allowed to charge. Hence the rules under which rates will be
determined need to be made clear and should not be altered during
the course of privatization. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">What should the rules be like? First, there
is no economic reason why Congress should continue to give some
wholesalers preferential access to hydropower.  Second, instead
of trying to dictate specific rates, Congress should take into
account the fact that wholesale power markets have become sufficiently
competitive and little regulation is actually needed.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">From the &quot;level the playing field&quot;
point of view, the solution most readily available is to make
the post-privatized PMA's subject to the same FERC wholesale rate
regulations that apply to all IOU's. However, such a solution
has a shortcoming: It is very unclear what the rates would actually
be under such a proposal. FERC may be ordered to base them on
historical costs, but in that case, rates would probably only
cover actual costs if the strike price was set below book value
as the capital costs of PMA acquisition would reflect market,
not government-subsidized interest rates. Moreover, in this case
the FERC would be prolonging the PMA pricing problem. On the other
hand, reflecting the capital costs of acquisition in the rate
base creates a circularity problem, that is, the rates would be
higher the more the new owners paid for the PMA's. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We think Congress should rely on markets rather
than regulators by letting the PMA's charge market rates. Markets
will set a limit on the rates that the privatized PMA's will be
able to charge, and in this case market prices will be more predictable
than regulators. Intervention might be needed when a PMA has significant
market power. This may be a problem in those areas where the PMA's
transmission lines are constrained and in this case FERC might
regulate rates using a benchmark approach. We think that requiring
PMA's to charge no more than market rate prevailing in a given
region in a given time is a sufficiently general solution to the
rate setting problem.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The position of existing contracts with preference
customers is problematic. The current contracts are written for
a very long period (many of them do not expire until well beyond
2000) and usually contain cost-based formula, disadvantages of
which were discussed above. We would suggest that the federal
government simply define market based rates as cost based rates
for the purpose of these contracts. As compensation for this action
the federal government should allow the preference customers to
back out of any of these contracts. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally it also should be noted that in order
to create a level playing field in the electricity markets, the
privatized PMA's should become subject to the same tax laws and
security laws as any other business, as well as to FERC's open
access transmission requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Importance of PUHCA Repeal </FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is worth stressing that any cost or restriction
on the prospective buyers of the PMA's and any restriction of
the rights of end users to freely sell their warrants will lead
to lower prices for warrants, lower gains to end users, and reduce
the political attractiveness of privatization.  For many investor-owned
utilities buying stock in a privatized PMA is complicated by the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Another New
Deal legacy, PUHCA will limit the number of buyers and complicate
efforts to gain control of the newly privatized PMA's. By restricting
the market for corporate control PUHCA lowers the potential price
of the PMA's.  This is just one of many reasons why PUHCA should
be repealed. However, it may happen that PUHCA as such is not
repealed at the time the PMA privatization legislation is pending
in Congress, and it would not be wise to either privatize the
PMA's without PUHCA repeal or postpone privatization until after
PUHCA is repealed. The remedy to this is to make acquisition of
PMA's exempt from all provision of PUHCA.</FONT>
<P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are a number of issues that Congress
will have to address if they are to implement a privatization

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Warrant Eligibility</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">.
First, it will be necessary to specify the formula for distributing
warrants among the end users. The basic choice is whether the
calculations should be based on physical units (power sales in
kWh) or monetary units (power sales in dollars). The distinction
would be irrelevant if all classes of customers faced the same
electricity rates. But rates differ significantly between the
various classes of users. Generally it is the residential customers
who pay the highest prices per kWh, while large industrial users
and public users pay the lowest unit prices. While we do not have
aggregate data on both physical sales and revenues from sales
by customer classes for PMA's, we do have such information for
all utilities, presented in Table 4.</FONT>

</TABLE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The percentages in the Table 4 indicate how
the warrants (and hence profits) would be distributed among different
customer classes, provided of course that the same sales distribution
ratios apply to PMA's as other utilities. The choice between basing
the distribution of warrants on physical sales or on revenues
from sales has significant implications for the gains from privatization
among residential and industrial consumers. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our recommendation is to base the allocation
formula on monetary values and not physical units, as this will
make the gains more visible to the residential users without impairing
the visibility of gains to the industrial users. The gains to
industrial users are already visible due to the absolute magnitude
of electricity consumption while the perceived gains to residential
customers needs all the magnification possible. We base all of
our following estimates of end user stock ownership and gains
on revenues, not physical sales.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Firm/Non-Firm Power<B>.  </B></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Another
aspect of PMA privatization that has similar distributional consequences
is whether to count only firm power sales or both firm and non-firm
power sales for warrant eligibility. Wholesale customers receive
firm and non-firm power from the PMA's in varying proportions.
For example, while non-firm WAPA sales in 1993 represented only
about 2 percent of power sold to municipal utilities, or 4 percent
in the case of cooperatives, they made up 45 percent of power
sold to investor-owned utilities. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Basing warrant eligibility only on firm power
sales would reduce by half the number of shares IOU customers
would receive, without increasing significantly the number of
shares available to other end users. Not only because of this,
but mostly because of the fact that customers are ultimately billed
for firm as well as non-firm power, we recommend to include both
firm and non-firm power into calculations of warrant eligibility.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Reference Time Period.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
A more subtle problem Congress will face is the choice of the
reference time period to be used for the calculation of warrant
eligibility. Because of annual fluctuations in electricity consumption,
basing warrant eligibility on consumption in the past several
years instead of only the most recent year spreads the gains more
equally among consumers. It also lowers the gains to those who
moved into PMA power areas only recently (and thus enjoyed the
subsidized power for a shorter time period), while enabling those
who already moved out of PMA power areas to capture some of the
gains - even though these people are not going to be affected
by any potential rate increase resulting from removing the subsidies.
In this case, there is a minor efficiency impact: Using several
years as a base requires more sales data and analysis and thus
is more costly to calculate. For economic as well as political
reasons we would suggest using only a single year (perhaps the
last calendar or fiscal year) as a reference year. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Strike Price.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
A key issue in implementing our privatization plan is the strike
price. The revenue to the Treasury from PMA privatization is the
number of shares times the strike price. The higher the strike
price, the larger the contribution PMA privatization will make
to budget deficit reduction. On the other hand, since the gains
to the end users are equal to the difference between the expected
market value of the shares and the strike price, placing too much
emphasis on the budgetary impact of PMA privatization will dissipate
the gains of end users and reduce their interest in the process
- the interest of people who we plan to assign much of the privatization
gains and who we hope will be the principal source of support
for privatization. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Congress may pick virtually any value between
zero and the expected market value as the strike price, and there
really is no efficiency argument for one value over any other.
At one extreme, it may set the strike price at zero, by which
it would transfer the entire value of the PMA's to the end users
and investors, without any direct contribution to the budget.
(There will, of course, be an indirect contribution from federal
taxes paid by PMA's and their shareholders or bondholders in the
future.) At the other extreme, it may choose the future market
value, by which it would collect the same amount of money as in
the auction to the highest bidder, leaving the end users only
with possible rate increases but no offsetting gains.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We suggest two basic approaches to follow when
setting the strike price, and choosing between them depends on
the primary objective of privatization. If the emphasis is on
making sure that privatization does not hurt consumers, then it
makes sense to set the strike price at such a level that the gains
the average end user makes by selling his warrants would just
equal the net present value of the average expected bill increase.
What is left after compensating consumers goes to the budget.
If the emphasis is that PMA privatization be (at least) budget-neutral,
then the strike price should just equal the net present value
of the future contributions of PMA's to the budget (or more),
giving to end users what is left after satisfying budgetary needs.
Fortunately, our estimates conclude that there is no direct conflict
between the two objectives.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Following are four specific strike prices based
on the approach just described:</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT FACE="Arial">Budget Neutral (BN).</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">
Probably the easiest way to set the strike price is to have it
equal to the present value of the revenue from PMA's foregone
by privatization. This makes the budget just break-even, assuming
there will be no income taxes in the future. According to our
estimates, the Budget Neutral strike price is $688 million for
SEPA, $389 million for SWPA and $2,309 million for WAPA - see
Table 5. The BN strike price discounts (SPD) are 0.636, 0.786
and 0.554,  respectively, which means that about 64 percent, 79
percent and 55 percent of the total value of SEPA, SWPA and WAPA
will end up in the hands of end users.</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT FACE="Arial">Budget Neutral with Taxes (BNT).</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">
The approach just described actually overpays the federal government.
As the government will also be receiving income taxes after the
PMA's are privatized, it can afford to lower the strike price
by the present value of future taxes without harming the budget.
Since it is lower, the BNT strike price also has the advantage
of making privatization more attractive to end users.</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT FACE="Arial">Consumer Neutral (CN).</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">
According to our calculations, the average residential customer
of a municipal or cooperative utility would suffer a 1.87 percent
(or $18.5 per year) increase in their bill in the case of SEPA,
4.07 percent (or $36.5) in the case of SWPA and 1.96 percent (or
$12.6) in the case of WAPA. The present value of these average
bill increases over 20 years is $172, $339 and $117, respectively.
In order to compensate consumers, the strike price discount must
be high enough to allow the value of warrants to be at least equal
to these values. To achieve this, following our estimates of the
gains available to end users from privatization (presented and
analyzed in a comprehensive manner in Part 3 and Appendix 3),
the Consumer Neutral (CN) strike price must be 70.1 percent below
market value for SEPA, 65.8 percent below market value for SWPA,
and 32.7 percent below market value for WAPA (see Table 5). Setting
the strike price at these (or any lower) values guarantees that
the end users of PMA power are no worse off (or even better off)
after privatization.</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT FACE="Arial">Balanced Gains (BG).</FONT></U><FONT FACE="Arial">
As it is apparent from Table 5, the Consumer Neutral strike price
is higher than the Budget Neutral with Taxes strike price for
all three PMA's and is also higher than the Budget Neutral strike
price for SWPA and WAPA. This means that after perfectly compensating
the end users and the budget, there is still some value left.
Here the net privatization gains become apparent both to end users
and the budget makers. By setting the strike somewhere between
BNT and CN,<I> both</I> the end users and the Treasury actually
profit from privatization, and Congress has a &quot;bargaining
space&quot; within the BNT and CN belt for negotiation over who
should get bigger piece of the pie. The most natural suggestion
for us to recommend is to split this pie equally (hence Balanced
Gains). The end users of SEPA, SWPA and WAPA power will receive
about 73 percent, 78 percent and 50 percent of the total value
of these companies, while the Treasury will receive $3,523 million,
which is actually higher than the Budget Neutral (without taxes)
strike price, hence eliminating any uncertainty about future taxes.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Balanced Gains is the strike price on which
all our estimates of the value of warrants presented in this paper
are based. We think that due to its &quot;equal sharing&quot;
character it is also very likely to be politically attractive.

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal Warrants.  </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally,
it is important to recognize that a considerable part of PMA power
is consumed by public entities, including federal ones. For example,
as we can see in Table 3, federal agencies (mainly the Department
of Defense) purchase for their ultimate use almost 9 percent of
all the power distributed by WAPA. Other examples of direct public
users include many state universities and hospitals especially
in the Western states. In addition, thousands of public authorities
purchase PMA power indirectly for purposes like street lighting
through their municipal or cooperative electric utility. Treating
all end users equally implies the distribution of warrants to
the public users who would then decide whether they want to sell
their warrants or purchase shares of the privatized PMA. The latter,
at least as it applies to the federal government, would not facilitate
the federal government's retrenchment from the economy. Shifting
ownership of PMA's from the Department of Energy to the Department
of Defense is not privatization. Shifting some of the ownership
to state and local entities is also hardly privatization, but
in the spirit of federalism the decision of whether these entities
continue to hold shares of a PMA is best left at the state and
local level.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We propose the following treatment of ownership
&quot;rights&quot; accruing to the federal government: Congress
can and should insist that all warrants assigned to the federal
agencies be pooled together for each PMA and sold in a direct
sale to the highest bidder. It is important that this auction
takes place before warrants are distributed to end users or at
least before they are redeemed for shares, so that the auction
provides clear information about the real value of PMA shares.
Such a sale of warrants would bring at least an additional $319
million to the Treasury, provided that strike price is set at
BG (this estimate includes direct federal purchases only). As
for non-federal warrant holders, we believe that they will find
it preferable to sell their warrants and not to become shareholders.
Their consumption of PMA power is too low to allow them to exercise
relevant control over the privatized PMA's, and selling warrants
does not require them to spend money from their budgets, while
buying shares does. However, as we note above, this is a local
issue and it is best solved at that level. After exchanging warrants
for shares, the federal government should also auction off the
shares that were not claimed by warrant holders.</FONT>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">WHO GAINS AND HOW MUCH THEY
GAIN UNDER THE BLOCK-SHADEGG PRIVATIZATION PLAN?</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">When privatization legislation is enacted and
warrants distributed, all end users will focus on one question:
&quot;How much money can I get for my warrants?&quot; Here we
show that our plan will generate several billion dollars in gains
for households, businesses, and state and local governments. Depending
on the value of the strike price, all current PMA customers can
earn substantial amounts of money in gains as a direct result
of privatization. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This section shows how much the average business,
household and public agency could make by selling their warrants,
assuming that the strike price is set at the BG. In reaching our
estimates, we followed our recommendations from the previous section
regarding warrant eligibility and non-firm power. Our estimates
are based on 1993 sales data, and are in 1995 dollars. The estimations
of the market value of the PMA's were taken from an EOP Group
Study, which presumes that the PMA's would raise prices to the
levels prevalent in their geographic areas. Since the time of
that study, wholesale electricity prices have generally been falling,
which would result in somewhat lower market value of the PMA's.
On the other hand, the study did not account for any efficiency
improvements, which have an offsetting effect on market value.
 Detailed information on potential gains, including the effect
of different strike prices, is given in Appendix 2.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Average consumer gains under the Block-Shadegg
plan are given in Table 6. The average gain for nearly all customer
types for each PMA is over $100. Only the average residential
consumer of WAPA power earns less than $100, and this is due to
a large number of IOU customers who receive PMA power. The average
residential customer of a co-op or muni that buys power from WAPA
could earn an amount comparable the residential customers in other
PMA areas. As Table 6 shows, the average commercial consumer of
PMA power could gain several hundred dollars by selling their
warrant, and the average industrial user over $10,000. It should
be remembered that warrant holders can obtain these gains either
by selling their warrant, or by exercising the warrant and selling
the stock. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">End users' gains vary significantly depending
on their local electricity supplier. Co-op and muni customers,
those who ostensibly would suffer most from &quot;rate shock&quot;,
stand to gain substantially more than customers of IOUs. The concentration
of relatively larger average shareholdings in the hands of the
consumers served by munies and co-ops (in WAPA area there are
nearly 12 million households served by IOU's compared to about
4 million served by munies and co-ops) should create an easily
distinguishable group with a strong political interest in privatization.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Co-op and muni customers are worth focusing
on because in the past they have been most resistant to the sale
of the PMA's. Table 7 shows that the average customer of a muni
or co-op will earn at least $100 through the Block-Shadegg plan.
The largest winners, on average, are consumers of SWPA power.
The average household ultimately buying SWPA electricity through
its muni or co-op could gain $401 dollars, the average commercial
business above $1,200, and the average industrial user about $39,000.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As can be seen in Table 7, the size of the
gain among co-op and muni customers varies broadly. The average
gain to the top 10 percent of warrant holders is much larger,
at least several hundred percent, than the bottom 10 percent.
However, except in the case of WAPA's residential consumers, the
majority of warrant holders still gain several hundred dollars.
Moreover the aggregate numbers hide the fact that there are some
very large potential winners under the Block-Shadegg plan. SEPA
contains over two dozen munies whose residential customers gain
more than $400. There are over two dozen munies and co-ops each
in SWPA and WAPA whose household customers will obtain more than
$1000. The largest winners are the customers of the municipal
utility that serves Manitou, Oklahoma. The average household there
could gain $3,958. (In Appendix 3, we present a list of munies
and co-ops whose average households are estimated to  gain more
than $400.)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The data we had available allowed us to estimate
only the gains to <I>average</I> residential, commercial, industrial
and public end user served by a particular muni or co-op. It did
not allow us to find out what the distribution of gains is <I>within
</I>customer classes served by a particular muni or co-op. Thus
all distribution information presented here is based on comparison
of average gains for each muni or co-op. This does not appear
to reduce the value of the information that we present, especially
in the case of residential customers. The differences in electricity
consumption between high and low income households are much smaller
than the differences in contribution of PMA power in munies' and
co-ops' power needs. Also the distribution pattern for residential
customers can be assumed similar for all munies and co-ops. Hence
the decisive factor for the size of gains is the share of PMA
power in preference customers' power supply. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In case of commercial and industrial end users,
the differences in average gains between munies and co-ops are
apparently caused not only by different shares of PMA power but
also by much greater differences in electricity consumption by
these end users. There are several industrial customers who, having
a high electricity consumption and being supplied by a muni or
co-op with a large share of PMA power, have gains exceeding $1,000,000.
Also note that our estimates were based on sales to commercial
and industrial <I>meters;</I> many companies have several meters
in different locations so their gains are actually more concentrated
than our estimates. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, it is worth mentioning the gains that
can be obtained by state and local agencies. Unfortunately our
data allow us to identify these customers only in the WAPA area
because only WAPA sells its power directly to some public agencies
(all three PMA's have a handful of ultimate public end users supplied
by munies and co-ops). Organizations like the University of California
at Davis, the University of Nebraska, the North Dakota Mill and
Elevator Association, and the Fergus Falls Hospital in Minnesota
have the potential to earn hundreds of thousands or even millions
of dollars under the Block-Shadegg plan. These agencies are highly
visible interest groups and will be certain to get the attention
of their representatives in Washington. They would add a weighty
impetus to privatization. </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial">It is easy to say that the government should
privatize the PMA's, but it is not quite as easy to specify what
exactly should be sold. Selling the PMA's assets as they appear
on the PMA's financial statements would mean selling their transmission
facilities (or in case of SEPA, which does not own any transmission
assets, the government would be selling only rights to market
power). Under this scenario, the operation of dams and production
of electricity would still be provided by the Corps of Engineers
or Bureau of Reclamation. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Yet this is only one approach to PMA privatization.
The PMA sale also might include powerhouses, dams, locks, land
around the reservoirs - or even the water itself (provided that
ownership of water is not already defined by water rights). Each
option has a different impact on the management of both power
and non-power resources, on incentives of all the parties involved,
and on the revenue to the Treasury. Perhaps most significantly,
different options affect the gains to end users.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The more assets sold as part of the PMA will
not always translate into greater PMA market value. Before any
privatization plan proceeds, the federal government must decide
not only what physical assets to sell, but also the rights, responsibilities,
restrictions and contractual arrangements tied to these assets.
In other words, the government must define a split between power
and non-power activities and an institutional mechanism that will
shape the relationship between them. Generally speaking, we suggest
that the government should make such a split and create such an
institutional mechanism that will maximize the value of the warrants
subject to satisfying the interests of the users of non-power
activities.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Outlined below is an attempt to find such an
option. First, we look at some &quot;traditional&quot; suggestions
for deciding what parts of the federal hydro projects should be
privatized and how to address the problem of provisioning non-power
benefits of these projects. Then we describe our own proposal
(the river association approach), which we believe would lead
to a more efficient use of the nation's water resources. Most
importantly, just as warrants make privatization interesting to
the end users of PMA power, we believe that our proposal would
turn the current beneficiaries of the non-power activities (who
so far oppose any privatization efforts) from privatization opponents
to advocates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">The &quot;Traditional&quot;
Privatization Options </FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Sell It All</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">From an administrative perspective, the most
straightforward approach to the privatization problem is to sell
everything that PMA's and the Corps/Bureau own - power marketing
rights, transmission facilities, power houses, dams, water locks
and the land surrounding the reservoirs, including beaches. If
this option were chosen, the easiest way to deal with the multiple
use aspect of the original water projects would be to make the
privatized dams subject to FERC licensing rules (this is the approach
currently used where IOU's own hydro projects). </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are at least four problems with such
an approach.:</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">License Costs.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
FERC licensing (and subsequent relicensing) is a complicated,
costly and uncertain procedure that lasts several years. The utility
seeking the license; interest groups; environmental groups; state
and federal agencies with jurisdiction over issues like fish and
wildlife, navigation or irrigation; and the FERC itself all spend
substantial resources on an administrative process that aims to
balance the competing demands on water resources. Utilities must
submit license applications that include often unnecessary studies
on the economic, engineering, environmental and safety features
of the project, many of which probably would not otherwise be
prepared. Moreover, the licensing process itself probably introduces
unnecessary uncertainty into the hydro business. As a result,
including dams subject to FERC licensing in any privatization
will frustrate the buyers and reduce the price they are willing
to pay. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Environmental Regulations. </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Environmental
regulations imposed on the project licensee (such as fish ladders
or minimum spillage requirements) also impose significant costs.
While the licensee may try to seek recovery of these costs through
higher rates, this will become difficult in increasingly competitive
electricity markets Environmental regulations will almost certainly
lower the licensee's expected profits; thus including the dams
in privatization, if they are subject to these burdens, will lower
the PMA's value and end-user gains.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We are not proposing that environmental requirements
be abolished or environmental benefits necessarily be reduced.
Yet we do think that the government should realize that privatizing
the dams may put the dam owner (and/or the power consumers) in
the position of paying all of the costs for regulations that they
have very little say in establishing. Such a disconnect between
regulation writing and cost bearing is likely to result in inappropriate
standards. As a result, the &quot;sell it all&quot; approach may
actually result in excessive environmental standards and reduced
PMA values - and thus lower proceeds to the Treasury than from
a more limited privatization. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Locks.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Many
dams in the Southern United States have locks that enable boats
to travel up or downstream past the dam. A number of utility representatives
have expressed the opinion that they would rather avoid having
responsibility for the locks. Their aversion seems to stem from
the sense that operating locks would result in a potential public
relations problem since waterways are commonly perceived as a
public resource.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The problem arises because each opening of
a lock causes a visible loss of power output due both to spillage
of water that could otherwise flow through a turbine to generate
power and to a back-up pressure that the water flowing from the
lock puts on the turbine. Currently, since navigation is one of
the purposes of federal water projects, the Corps or Bureau simply
open the locks to any boat that wants to pass the dam. This may
cause inefficient losses in power output. An unrestricted, profit-maximizing
private owner of such a hydro project would have motivation to
reduce such a loss by tolling boats $250 for each passage or at
least by introducing a reasonable opening timetable. Assuming
that the private owner is not in a position to exploit a monopoly,
the toll solution actually leads to more efficient allocation
of resources. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A utility that purchased the dam may be restricted
from acting as a profit maximizer by its FERC license, which could
request it to open the lock for everybody wishing passage. In
this case the utility would bear all the costs of uneconomic lock
openings and would thus bid less for the PMA's. However, even
if private buyers are not restricted in what they could do with
the locks, it is not assured that the efficient outcome (achieved
by pricing and/or an optimal opening timetable) would occur. Waterways
are perceived to be a public resource, and any effort by the utility
to deny free access through the dam would probably create enormous
 public opposition. Having a good public image and demonstrating
concern for the non-power aspects of the water project may be
an important part of corporate strategy with long-run and favorable
profit implications. Having full responsibility for locks in a
dam might place the utility that bought the PMA between Scylla
of lost power output and Charybdis of bad public relations - a
dilemma that potential buyers of a PMA are willing to pay to avoid.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Recreation.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
A similar problem may be raised around recreation facilities (i.e.,
using reservoirs for boating). Again, the Corps currently does
not charge anything close to market value for their use. If the
power producer only bears the maintenance costs and provides free
recreation, it loses money. If the power producer tries to charge
for this service, it loses its public goodwill. Recreational facilities
do not enhance the market value of the PMA's and may reduce that
value.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Lease It All</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">While privatization, by definition, involves
creating actual ownership over assets, another possibility is
for the federal government to lease dams and powerhouses to a
newly privatized PMA. This is actually the way the Argentinean
government privatized its Alicura Hydroelectric Project on the
Limay River. The state-owned enterprise operating the project
(Hidroelectrica Alicura S.A.) was privatized, but the government
retained ownership of the dams and powerhouses and gave concession
to Hidroelectrica Alicura to use these facilities for 30 years.
The concession contract specified the rights and obligation of
the power producer in a way similar to FERC license and established
a monthly payment schedule the power producer pays the government
for use of the facilities. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Although such an approach may be less controversial
than sale of the dams to the private parties, and is definitely
better than if the federal government remained both the owner
and operator of the projects, we do not advise it. First, it is
not free of the problems discussed in the &quot;Sell It All&quot;
section. Second, it adds a new problem: An inherent feature of
any long-term lease is the disincentive on the part of the lessee
to undertake desirable investment and capital maintenance actions
at the end of the lease period, because the benefits of such investments
and maintenance cannot be fully realized after expiration of the
lease. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Sell Only the Power Resources and Let the
Federal Government </FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Continue to Operate the Dams</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Another approach to privatizing PMA's is to
sell the powerhouses and all other power resources through a warrant
offering, and let the federal government (in most cases represented
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation)
retain ownership and control of the dam and responsibility for
the non-power activities of the water project. Currently there
are a small number of hydro projects in the U.S. operating under
this structure. For example, the Holt and Bankhead water resource
projects on the Black Warrior River in Alabama were originally
built for navigational purposes. During their enlargement in the
1960's by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Alabama Power Company
installed a powerhouse under FERC's (actually Federal Power Commission
at that time) license. This historical accident created a structure
where the investor-owned utility (Alabama Power) owns, operates
and maintains all facilities directly used for power generation,
while the Corps owns, operates and maintains the dam structures,
locks and recreation facilities. The Corps has responsibility
for managing the water flows and coordinating this activity with
the Alabama Power Co. The two entities exchange information necessary
for the smooth operation. The license anticipates that construction
and improvement of fish and wildlife facilities or recreation
facilities may be provided either by Alabama Power Co. (under
FERC's supervision) or by the U.S. Corps of Engineers. In the
latter case, the Alabama Power Co. is required to provide (without
charge) its land and other property needed for such construction
or improvement. Alabama Power is also required under the operating
agreement to supply free power for the operation and maintenance
of the lock and, most significantly, to pay the Corps of Engineers
an annual fee determined by the FERC. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are some advantages to the Holt/Bankhead
solution. First, although the entirely private aspects of these
projects are subject to FERC licensing procedures, the Corps'
activities are not. This structure, at a minimum, saves both ratepayers
and taxpayers money in the form of reduced administrative expenses,
and may actually reduce the regulatory burden by having the government
internalize the costs of the non-market benefits of the dam. A
private power company could produce these non-power benefits (e.g.
recreation facilities, flood control) but given the politically
sensitive nature of these benefits, it is probably less costly
to have the political entity do so. At least in this case, the
government internalizes the costs of regulating these benefits.
If a private firm produces the non-power benefits under a regulatory
scheme, the costs of this regulation are exported to the power
company and eventually to its customers. Such a scheme for operating
the dam might actually lead to higher overall costs of running
the dam.  Second, if the government runs the dam, it relieves
the electricity producer from responsibilities that are in conflict
with power production and that might cause conflicts with the
public (e.g. navigation). Having a politically responsible entity
operate the dam may reduce the costs of these conflicts. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The structure of a Holt/Bankhead type relationship
is crucial for efficient operation of hydro projects as well as
for the price that the potential buyers of the PMA's would be
willing to pay to the warrant holders. Most relevant to the value
of the powerhouse are the arrangements for financing dam operations,
of which a number of approaches exist.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Taxes.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Theoretically,
one could make the argument that government's dam operations and
production of non-power activities of the water projects are collectively
consumed (or public) goods and should be financed from government's
general revenue. Whatever the merits of this theoretical argument,
we can put this solution aside because it is politically infeasible
to sell the profitable or revenue producing part of these projects
and leave the government with the obligation to fund the dam's
operations. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Fixed Fee.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
One possible alternative is to use the current Holt/Bankhead arrangement
and have the power resource owner pay the federal government a
fixed fee, set at a level sufficient to cover at least the current
costs of operating and maintaining the non-power functions of
a project. Under this plan, the power producers would have the
same costs as they would if they owned the reservoir and provided
the non-power functions directly, at least during the initial
period. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">From the government's perspective, setting
the fixed fee at the current level of operational expenses (including
depreciation and indexed for increases in costs of living) will
enable the federal government to collect sufficient revenue to
produce the same amount of non-power activities as it produces
now. Moreover, this structure should provide some incentive for
dam management to control the growth of expenses. We are presuming
that the officials who manage the dam resources would find having
additional funds appropriated to supplement their power fees unlikely.
To make this cost-reducing incentive effective, the Corps of Engineers
or the Bureau of Reclamation should be financed in a way that
these agencies do not deposit their receipts in the Treasury and
then ask for congressional appropriation, but rather are self-financed,
and are allowed to keep their revenues in a way that, say, BPA
can. (Such a change would be desirable even while the PMA's are
awaiting privatization.)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">From the non-power users' perspective, under
this proposal the federal government would have enough resources
to provide the same level of &quot;their&quot; benefits, and we
do not think that there is a reason why the federal government
would restrict the production of these benefits. Hence, the non-power
users are not made any worse-off under this proposal. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">However, the fixed fee approach has a drawback:
It does not provide any incentives to the dam operating agency
to economize on water usage or for optimal intertemporal water
allocation. Water spillage is not free nor is the value of water
to the power generator constant over time; water is much more
valuable in summer (the period of peak seasonal electricity demand)
and during working hours (the period of peak daily electricity
demand). A fixed fee that does not depend on magnitude and timing
of water flows ignores both the value of water as well as the
fluctuations of this value over time. It does not give the dam
operator any incentive to make efficient decisions about magnitude
and timing of spillage and lock openings. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Flow Charge.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
One approach to financing dam operations that would tend to optimize
the magnitude and timing of water flows (i.e., would help structure
the decisions on competing uses of water for energy production,
navigation, irrigation and spillage) is to have the power producer
pay a flow charge. The power house owner would pay a certain amount
of money per unit of water flowing through the turbine. The initial
flow charges, and they could be either flat rate or time dependent,
would be set so that at current flows the federal government could
recover its cost of dam operation. We realize that the governmental
agencies that would run dams such as the Corps or Bureau of Reclamation
are not-for-profit entities; however, we believe that they, at
least to some extent, care about the revenue they may generate
from their activities if only because it reduces their need to
seek appropriated funds. A revenue stream that increases with
the amount of water flowing through the turbine may make the Corps
or the Bureau consider more carefully the way it manages water
flows. The flow charge system builds in an opportunity cost for
each lock opening or spillage or irrigation discharge. It does
so because the Corps or the Bureau could, instead of any of these
activities, let this water flow through the turbine and generate
additional revenue. A flow charge might, for example, dissuade
the agency operating the dam from providing virtually unlimited
lock services and induce it to preschedule the lock openings or
group boats together. The latter would reduce the total spillage
through the locks, increase flow through turbine, and generate
greater revenue for the dam operator. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">If the flow charge also varied with time of
year and, possibly, time of day, the charge would serve as a tool
for resolving intertemporal water use problems. Water is more
valuable to power producers during peak periods and they are willing
to pay higher flow charges during those periods. From that perspective
the government agency that operates the dam would be motivated
to manage water flows more prudently and to conserve water flow
for periods when it is a more valuable resource. The dam operator
would be encouraged by the time-dependent flow charge to try to
schedule most of the lock openings for early mornings and late
afternoons, and to do whatever it could do to maximize the summer
turbine flows.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">One approach to setting flow charges would
be to use the historical costs of operating the dam as well as
the historical flows through the turbine, and then to set the
flow charge such that if the current volume and timing of flows
were maintained, the yearly sum of the flow charges would just
equal the costs of operating the dam. If there are sources of
revenue other than power (water supply, marina leases), these
revenues should be subtracted from the operating costs so that
the addition of flow charges and non-power revenues would just
equal the costs operating the dam.  From the power producer's
perspective, this means that he would pay the same amount of flow
charges as he would in other solutions so that the flow charge
would not reduce the PMA's value to potential buyers. However,
flow charges do give power producers additional value, represented
by an institutional arrangement that makes the government agency
more likely to provide sufficient water to the turbine and at
times when it is most valuable. From the government's perspective,
setting the flow charge in this manner assumes that the operating
agency has sufficient revenue to run the dam and provide the same
level of non-power activities as in the past. The agency, however,
has the potential to increase its revenues and use this money
for other public purposes such as improving recreational sites.
From the non-power users' perspective, the size of some of their
benefits may actually increase. Of course, some non-power users
may be adversely affected by possible reallocations of water flows,
but these affects are most likely to take the form of changes
in the timing of their consumption rather than changes in the
amount of consumption. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Disadvantages of a Holt/ Bankhead Arrangement</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A Holt/Bankhead type of ownership structure
involving private ownership of the powerhouse and government ownership
of the dam resolves many problem associated with total government
or total private ownership of water resource projects and, because
of its neutral distributional consequences, appears to be politically
acceptable. However, there are several objections against this
solution which leads us not to recommend its use. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Lack of Economic Incentives Due to federal
Ownership.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> The first objection to
a Holt/Bankhead approach is straightforward. A substantial amount
of water resource activities (i.e. non-power benefits) would still
be provided by a governmental agency. Even though the governmental
agencies are concerned about expenditures and revenues, we do
not believe that the federal ownership would provide sufficient
interest in minimizing costs and trying to optimize water flows
in order to maximize revenues from flow charges. As it would be
very hard to adopt an alternative flow charge concept that would
not guarantee revenue high enough to cover historical costs under
historical flows, it is likely that the dam operating agency would
be satisfied with keeping status quo and might not attempt to
cut costs or optimize water flows. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Lack of Discipline Due to Monopoly Position.
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">The federal ownership of all dams
supporting power generation of privatized PMA's places the federal
government in a purely monopolistic position that negatively affects
economic efficiency in two ways.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">First, the federal government would be in a
position to take advantage of setting flow charges at a level
exceeding the competitive level. The relationship between the
power resource owner and the dam owner is a typical case of a
bilateral monopoly, but the market power of a dam owner is somewhat
constrained if there are more dams with different owners. If there
are more dams with different owners, the power producer will give
preference in dispatching to the powerhouses located in the dams
that charge lower flow charges (other things remaining equal),
and a dam owner attempting to charge excessive flow charge will
actually lose revenues from the powerhouse. Such a constraint
is lacking if a single federal agency owns all of the dams. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Second, if one entity owns all the dams in
a region, it will have an adverse effect on the dam owner's incentives
to minimize costs. Since a fixed fee or flow charge, paid by the
power producer, is likely to be based on the cost to provide traditional
non-power benefits, and since the government would somehow regulate
that price, the agency operating the dam would be always guaranteed
sufficient revenues. This gives the agency a very weak incentive
to operate efficiently. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Separation of Costs and Benefits.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
The separation of the costs and benefits of the non-power activities
is also a problem in the split ownership regime. Under the Holt/Bankhead
type arrangement, most of the costs of non-power activities are
unilaterally passed on to power producers and hence (if the market
for electricity becomes sufficiently competitive) on to power
consumers. While, as a starting point, having power consumers
pay all of the costs may make this a politically feasible way
to privatize the PMA's, it also causes certain long-run problems.
Particularly, there is nothing to induce the non-power users to
pay attention to how much their benefits cost and nothing to induce
them to adjust their demand for these benefits according to their
costs. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Currently the non-power users reveal their
preferences though the political process, either by participation
in a FERC licensing procedures or, in case of public ownership,
by attempting to persuade the public authority that operates the
dam to provide &quot;their&quot; benefits. Unless there is some
sort of realistic charge for the non-power activities, users will
demand the highest possible amount of these activities because
they will not have to bear any significant costs for their actions.
These costs are then borne by power producers, who, in turn, use
the political process to limit the levels of non-power activities.
The outcome is what usually appears to be a reasonable compromise,
but it is a compromise based on balancing political pressures
instead of balancing costs and benefits of each non-power activity.
This undoubtedly leads to underconsumption of some activities
and overconsumption of others. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Political Irrelevance.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
The last objection to using a Holt/Bankhead arrangement in privatization
is that it does little to make the users of non-power activities
interested in and advocates for privatization. Their strong opposition
against  privatization efforts in the past suggests that they
might be so concerned about &quot;their&quot; benefits that even
a Holt/Bankhead arrangement would be perceived as too risky. If
they are satisfied with the status quo, why should they like any
change (even if the change is unlikely to make them worse off)
if that change does not make them explicitly better off? To build
the necessary political support to privatize the federal hydro
program and reap all the benefits from private ownership, we need
to mobilize the support of non-power users. Just as the warrant
concept turns the end users of PMA power into privatization supporters,
we believe that a river association approach for privatization
of federal dams presented below could have a similar impact on
non-power users. <BR>

Hydro Projects </FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Stakeholders other than power consumers - environmentalists,
fishermen, sporting associations - were among the strongest opponents
to last year's privatization proposals. They feared that private
ownership of water resource facilities would not lead to a sufficient
supply of &quot;their&quot; benefits (e.g. wildlife protection,
fishing, water sports, flood control, etc.). Under the current
state of affairs, these stakeholders either rely on the &quot;reasonable&quot;
behavior of the public agency that operates the dam or try to
assure provision of &quot;their&quot; benefits through political
influence. Privatizing through a private/public partnership, in
which the private owner owns only the power resources and the
public agency controls the dam and the non-power water project
activities, leaves these stakeholders in much the same situation
as they are today. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Absent any compelling advantage resulting from
a private/public partnership model, weaknesses of such an arrangement
are the inefficiency of the government agency that provides the
non-power benefits, the separation of costs and benefits of the
non-power activities, and the fact that the benefits themselves
are often not exactly what the non-power stakeholders actually
would like.</FONT>
P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">One simple way to improve on the Holt/Bankhead
privatization model is to directly involve the non-power stakeholders
in the management of the dam. This can be done by transferring
the dams to an association of stakeholders: farmers who need water
to irrigate their fields, second home owners who want the reservoir
to provide the amenities they were seeking when they purchased
their property, the power producer who needs the dam water to
generate power, water consumers who want the dam to provide sufficient
supply of water, resort owners along the beach who want the dam
to be attractive for the general public, and perhaps some other
stakeholders whose &quot;rights&quot; to the dam are not tied
to the land (environmentalists who want wildlife habitat preserved,
fishing associations who want to have sufficient number of fish
in the reservoir and down stream, barge companies that want to
have the lock open any time they need it, rafting companies who
want to have enough downstream water, surfers' associations who
want to have enough upstream water). As explained in greater detail
below, we believe one association should be formed for one river,
and that that association should own all of the existing federal
hydro non-power assets on that river (hence the name &quot;river
association&quot;). The association would own everything that
the federal government now owns (except the power resources) and
would make decisions about, and bear responsibility for, dam maintenance
and water management. In most cases this association would be
composed of local stakeholders so that local organizations are
the ones deciding local, or at least regional, issues. Financing
of dam maintenance and non-power activities would be provided
by revenues from the power producer, like in the Holt/Bankhead
type of arrangement (either by an annual fixed fee or, in the
best case, by a flow charge), and other possible sources (e.g.
water supply).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Incorporating the River Association</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The general purpose of the association would
be to provide the desired benefits to its members, thus it might
seem appropriate that its structure be co-operative or non-profit.
However, there are strong reasons to favor a more traditional
corporate structure. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Establishment of River Corporations.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
For each river, on which the federal government owns and operates
a SEPA, SWPA or WAPA hydro project, the federal government would
establish a corporation (e.g. the Arkansas River Corporation).
The federal government would transfer all its property in these
hydro projects (except for the facilities directly used for generation
and transmission of electricity) to these corporations. Contracts
with current employees of the Corps of Engineers or Bureau of
Reclamation (those who perform activities not associated with
power production), liabilities and responsibility for managing
the water flows would also be transferred to the corporations.
The government would then issue shares of each corporation, the
nominal value of which would be equal to the accounting value
of the property transferred to the river corporations.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Distribution of Shares.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
The following step has a number of parallels with our warrant
proposal.<I> The federal government would distribute (without
charge) the shares of the river corporations to the non-power
stakeholders </I>according to a procedure defined in the statute.
The current users of non-power activities would thus become owners
of &quot;their&quot; dams, and would thus have direct control
over the distribution of &quot;their&quot; benefits. Since the
river corporation would have a guaranteed stream of revenue from
the power producer (i.e., the privatized PMA), the non-power users
would not only be given the responsibility for water resources,
but also a potentially valuable asset.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Advantages of the Corporate River Association
Approach</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Cost Minimization.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
The river association would have an obvious incentive to minimize
the costs of operating the dams and producing the non-power activities.
Such an incentive would be present even if the association were
a co-op or a non-profit, but the corporate structure makes this
incentive much stronger because any cost savings can be distributed
among shareholders (non-power users) as dividends. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">How the fixed fees or flow charges are structured
will have a powerful impact on incentives. If the fixed fee or
flow charge is set to cover exactly the expected costs of dam
operation, (i.e., some form of rate of return regulation as traditionally
applied to electricity rates), the cost minimizing incentive for
the river association would be much weaker. Thus we propose that
the fee or charge originally should be set at the level of historical
costs as incurred by the Corps or Bureau in the period just before
transfer, and then indexed to the consumer price index or some
other benchmark. Such an approach is not without problems, but
its cost minimizing incentives and its predictability both to
power producer and dam operator make it attractive. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Budget Impact.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
Although it seems that by giving away shares to the dam the federal
government receives no compensation, this is not the case. While
the government would be relieved of some of its assets, this privatization
structure will not have a negative impact on federal finances.
Giving the dams and their obligations away will not reduce the
proceeds from privatizing the PMA's. The price at which the PMA's
are going to be sold to the warrant holders is fixed at the strike
price, and the revenues that the government is going to generate
by auctioning off the shares it obtains by federal warrant entitlements
is determined by other factors, such as the level of the fixed
fee or flow charge. It does not matter to investors whether these
fees or charges are paid to the operating agency or a river association.
What matters is the level of the fees and the likely performance
of the dam operator. Because the fees or flow charges would be
set at the same level regardless of whether the federal government
or the river association owns the dam, and operating the dams
is not intended to be a profitable activity, the federal budget
will not suffer if a river association operates the dams. In fact,
it might even get some revenue if this ownership pattern is likely
to result in better run dams. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Reconnecting the Costs and Benefits.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
Under the river association plan, the non-power stakeholders will
not be concerned about whether the new owners of the dam are hostile
to their interests - for they will be the owners. They will determine
how much of &quot;their&quot; benefits should actually be produced.
No longer would bureaucrats living thousands miles away decide
how much of the non-power activities should be produced and how
to resolve the disputes of competing demands on water resources,
but the people who live near the dam and who actually use the
dam and benefit from it will. The people who have competing interests
in the dam would no longer lobby the government to promote their
particular interest. Instead, they will simply sit together around
a table and find a solution among themselves. There seems to be
a political tendency to devolve many environmental regulations
from the centralized government to the level at which the environmental
problems are best solved - at the local and regional level; the
river association concept is a good example of applying this tendency
to a specific issue. The river association concept also presents
the type of local self-government that has historically characterized
American democracy.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">From an economic perspective, the corporate
river association approach may eventually lead to a more efficient
allocation of resources. The non-power users who now become hydro
project owners will have reason to think about how much the benefits
they are enjoying are really worth. If they decide to cut expenses
on a particular activity, they can take the savings in higher
dividends. It is possible that in some cases people will prefer
cash to their non-power benefits. On the other hand, if dam management
decides to spend more on a particular activity, their dividends
will be lower; and it is possible that in some situations people
will prefer less cash in exchange for more non-power benefits.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">For example, the river association members
may decide to built a fish ladder in order to protect fish. However,
such an environmental benefit is not free, and the river association
members will bear the costs in terms of lower, perhaps zero, dividends.
The point is that before they were given control of the dam operations,
they had no title to dividends and less fish. Building a fish
ladder makes the association members better off, and they decided
to do so with full realization of costs of their activity, materialized
in lower dividends. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This is exactly what we mean by reconnecting
the costs and benefits. Having dividends from dam operations depend
on the level of non-power production builds-in a feedback between
the costs (in terms of opportunity costs) and benefits, without
making any of the non-power stakeholders worse off - no stakeholders
will have to pay any out-of-pocket costs in order to keep their
initial level of benefits, and the stakeholders may always have
the option of keeping the status quo in terms of the level of
non-power activities. While doing this would result in zero dividends,
what is important is that stakeholders have the information about
how much they are sacrificing by having their dividends unchanged.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Political Impact.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
We think that the river association approach might change the
political dynamics of PMA privatization in a way similar to the
impact of warrants. Instead of trying to persuade the non-power
stakeholders that privatization is not harmful to their interests
(which has not proven to be a very effective strategy), we propose
to empower them to pursue those interests. We believe that for
most non-power stakeholders the possibility of co-owning a dam
and deciding on its future is much more attractive than the current
arrangement in which they need to rely on political influence
and/or some sympathetic bureaucrat. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The river association plan goes farther than
giving the people who use the dam a voice in its operations; it
also gives them a monetary stake in its management. When the non-power
users learn about the possibility of owning the dam, influencing
its operations and benefiting from any improvements in its management,
we believe they will see new advantages of privatization. We anticipate
that the non-power stakeholders will refrain from opposing privatization
efforts and instead many become its promoters. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Controversial Issues in the Corporate River
Association Approach</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are a very large number of options for
structuring the river association, each with a different efficiency
as well as distributional implication. Several issues must be
resolved before an association is formed, the property transferred
to it, and shares distributed to the non-power stakeholders. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Size.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> It is
possible to have a separate association for each reservoir, one
association for all reservoirs on a single river or a river system,
or, at the extreme, one association that includes all federal
hydro projects in a single PMA's marketing area. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">For a number of reasons, the one river one
association seems to be most desirable. While associations tied
to a single reservoir would have the advantage of creating strong
personal ties between the members and the association, in some
cases they may be unstable because they would be too small. They
may also be too small to internalize many of the effects of the
project and potentially could, by seeking only their own interests,
harm associations located downstream. As for &quot;supersize&quot;
association comprising the entire PMA area, we have serious doubts
that it would be able to operate effectively. The ownership of
such an association would be very dispersed and, as a consequence,
individual stakeholders would not have strong enough incentives
to participate actively in the management of the dam. A mega-association
would also put together stakeholders who actually have neither
common interests nor common conflicts - stakeholders benefiting
from, say, the Clair Engle Lake on the Trinity River in Northern
California have little in common with the people benefiting from
the Hoover Dam. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">On the other hand, an association that contains
all of the non-power resources along a single river has an inherently
logical basis. This option puts together groups of people who
share a common resource (one river) in which actions of one group
of stakeholders may influence the well being of other group of
stakeholders in the association. For example, by including as
participants of a single association all farmers taking water
for irrigation from various locations along  a river, this structure
would effectively prevent the upstream farmers from &quot;exploiting&quot;
the downstream farmers by opportunistically over-consuming water.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Even though having one association for one
river seems to be the most appropriate general approach, there
may be specific dams, rivers and watersheds for which a different
structure may be more suitable. It would not be reasonable to
insist on &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; solution; instead, we
encourage that the spread of river associations should realize
the regional problems and interests.  </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Who should get the shares?</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
This is obviously one of the most important and most controversial
questions concerning the structure of a river association. Excluding
some non-power users hurts these users in two ways: First, they
are deprived of the chance of receiving dividends from the association
and, second, they might lose some of the benefits they currently
enjoy by not having a direct say in reservoir management. On the
other hand, including too many users may lead to too widely dispersed
ownership and risk that the stakeholders will not be interested
in active participation because their individual influence would
be too small. It might also lead to the inclusion of stakeholders
with too limited an interest in the specific water resource. This
is particularly the case of some environmental groups whose interests
are not tied to land and resource ownership along the river and
whose focus is national environmental policy. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A group whose &quot;rights&quot; to shares
seem to be obvious are people whose interest in the dams is somehow
tied to the ownership of the land or to the consumption of water.
The link between the dam and people's well being is strongest
in the case of farmers, who enjoy irrigation, and residents, who
benefit from water supply and flood control. Any change in the
water supply may have a dramatic impact on their incomes, well
being and/or safety. For other landowners, such as resort and
vacation home owners, worsening the recreational qualities of
the reservoir may have an impact on their incomes and on the value
of their real estate property. Tying the eligibility for shares
to the land ownership has an advantage of providing a transparent
rule for distribution of shares: In proportion to the land, with
a possible ceiling that would protect smaller owners.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Although land ownership and water consumption
may appear to be two different things, they should not be separated
when talking about ownership of the river association. This is
obvious in the West, where water distribution is very often determined
by water rights, and the water rights are part of the title to
the land, whereas farming or urban (it should be emphasized that
privatization of the dams must leave the current water rights
intact). Then the only difference between assigning shares in
proportion to land holdings or water holdings is that using land
as a determinant enables including those landowners who have a
stake in the dam but do not hold water rights. This principle
can also be used for areas where water rights are not established,
simply looking at water consumption <I>as if</I> it was based
on water rights. Urban water users probably require special treatment.
It would not make much sense to disperse the ownership of the
river association among thousands of urban households who own
very small pieces of land relative to farmers. What would make
more sense is to have the local municipal or investor-owned water
company represent the interest of urban water users in the river
association, using the area they supply as a measure of  their
stake, again with a possible ceiling to protect individual farmers
or vacation home owners. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are other stakeholders whose incomes
and well being are directly tied to the water project, but are
not related to land ownership. Incomes of barge companies depend
on such factors as the amount of water in the river and the reservoir,
as well as the operation of locks (opening frequency, tolls).
But since those interests do not depend on land ownership, their
stake is much harder to measure. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">And the existence of more or less intrinsic
benefits of hydro projects complicates this problem even further.
Fishing or kayaking associations do have an interest in the dam,
but it is an interest that is harder to define in terms of eligibility
for shares and very difficult to measure in relation to the interests
of land owners. However, excluding such associations may have
negative environmental impacts; for example, fishing associations
may play a very positive role in protecting fish and habitat.
Finally, on top of this &quot;subjective value pyramid&quot; are
the environmental organizations who do not derive any direct benefits
at all but who want to preserve fauna and flora and may even be
willing to pay for it. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are some solutions for allocating interest
in the dam. For example, the government might assign the bulk
of the shares (say 80 percent) to the power company, land owners
and water users (distributed by size of holdings) and then undertake
investigations on who would be assigned the remaining interest.
The eligibility of these other claimants would need to be proven
by, say, evidence that a particular barge company uses the river,
that members of a particular fishing association actually fish
in a given dam or that a particular environmental organization
did participate in licensing hearings or made a similar effort
indicating their concern in the past. While the final decision
will to some extent be arbitrary, we think that it should be made
by an administrative body on a case by case basis. Not only would
attempts to solve this at a legislative level result in lengthy
congressional hearings slowing down the formation of river associations
(while administrative body may at the time of investigating the
eligibility for shares also work on other details) but they could
also lead to a unified ownership structure for all projects, which
would probably disregard fairly significant regional differences.
The role of Congress in this issue should be limited to defining
the procedure for assigning shares. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Another possibility might be to allocate some
shares to the power company and then auction off the remaining
shares. This would lead to a distribution of ownership that would
reflect the real values attached to the dam by various parties.
This system, however, eliminates the positive political impact
of free shares and may even foster opposition from those who have
interest but would not be entitled to free shares. Auctioning
the shares, while theoretically appealing, is a political non-starter</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Participation of the Power Producer.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
There is little doubt that the power producer is the most important
single stakeholder in decisions about the dam. It is probably
the party with the most resources at stake. A reservoir that is
safely and reliably managed is the key to the power producer's
success at any hydroelectric project. The company that owns the
power resources will not only want to influence decisions about
dam operations and maintenance, but it is also willing to bear
significant costs incurred in these operations. The importance
of dam operations, as well as the willingness of firms to contribute
to funding such operations, is best illustrated by those water
projects that are purely private. In these cases, the power companies
bear <I>all</I> costs and the projects are still profitable.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Excluding the power producer (i.e., the privatized
PMA) from participation in river associations is possible but
may not be the best solution. Including the power producer in
the river association might make co-ordination of activities better
and lead to greater operating efficiency. However, including the
power producer in proportion to their stake might, under a simple
majority rule, lead to the power producer always having a majority
- which could in some cases harm non-power stakeholders. It is
important to include the power producer in the association in
a way that is beneficial both to the power producer and to non-power
users. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Giving free shares in the dam to the power
producer is something that might encounter fierce opposition.
What instead might be acceptable to both parties is raising the
capital for the association by selling preferred shares to the
power producer. The amount of shares would not be too great, so
as to protect the non-power users. The power producer would get
more direct influence over key decisions, and the association
would get a start-up cash endowment, part of which might be used
as a reserve fund. This cash, however, also may be used to provide
the non-power users with some additional benefits. Whatever decision
the shareholders choose, increasing the capital by the power producer
increases the value of shares to the non-power stakeholders. Another
advantage of raising the capital is that it makes the disputes
over fixed fees or flow charges less sharp, since at least part
of such a charge would accrue to the power producer - as a river
association shareholder. Raising association's capital in such
a way does reduce the value of a PMA to the potential buyer because
the cash endowed to the association is &quot;dissolved&quot; among
other shareholders; on the other hand, this decrease in value
is somewhat compensated by the benefits described in this paragraph
that the power producer will also share with other association's
shareholders. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The internal decision-making mechanism of the
river association might be structured in a more subtle way than
simple majority rule. The shares issued to the power company are
preferred shares; they may carry a prior claim on dividends but
they might also carry a non-preferential voting restriction. In
this case the preferred stockholder might only be entitled to
fractional voting rights. On the other hand, to guarantee that
a majority of non-power users could not harm the power producer,
an affirmative rule of the preferred stockholder might be required
for some major decisions. This would give the power producer the
ability to block some actions but not the power to undertake actions
alone. This might be combined with some near unanimity rule to
override a veto by the power producer. The number of options are
numerous enough so that the role of the power company is soluble
in a mutually acceptable way. </FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Transferability of Shares.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
Normally, shareholders in a corporation are free to transfer their
shares at any time and under any conditions they want. However,
there are some reasons why it may not be optimal to implement
this principle in the case of corporate river associations. The
purpose of the river association is to pool together the stakeholders
to enable them manage their common water resource. The corporate
structure is intended to mobilize the interest of stakeholders
by giving them valuable assets and focusing their attention on
the opportunity costs of the non-power activities. However, completely
free trade in the associations' shares may harm the first objective
of keeping all stakeholders involved in the management of the
dam. On the other hand, not enabling the non-power users to trade
their shares dramatically reduces the value of these shares and
hence weakens the incentive of non-power users to invest in long-run
improvements in the dam. Such restrictions also reduce the ability
of the association to solve intra-user conflicts. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">One solution to the transferability problem
might be to allow the trading of shares only among the non-power
users. This would guarantee the balance between power and non-power
interest and would potentially lead to a more appropriate distribution
of shares among non-power users. The users who do not attach very
high value to membership in the river association would sell their
shares while those who place a high value on non-power activities
as well as the chance to actively manage the dam would buy them.
The drawback is that the potential scope (hence number) of buyers
is quite limited, which has a negative impact on prices at which
the shares could be sold. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">An alternative to this type of limitation on
sale might be to grant a right of first refusal to current users.
This approach would (in the stock certificate) lift the limitation
on the scope of buyers but protect the interests of current users.
A user wishing to sell his shares would be required to give the
right of first refusal to all of the current users at the outside
offer. If not enough users wish to buy the his shares in, say,
a week, then he could sell the shares without restrictions to
anyone at any price. Such a solution again assures that if some
users do not want to keep their shares, the shares would remain
in the hands of other users who attach sufficient value to them.
A good general principle would be a requirement that if someone
received shares due to ownership of land and later decided to
sell their land, then the shares must be sold together with the
land.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">Privatization of Power Is
the Priority</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We have presented a variety of options for
structuring the sale of the PMA's along with the advantages and
disadvantages of each. We strongly prefer transferring the non-power
facilities and activities of federal hydro projects to corporate
associations of non-power stakeholders, because we believe that
the association is the appropriate entity to operate dams and
is the best institutional form in which to reach a reasonable
compromise of competing demands for water resources. However,
we realize that creating river associations could be a very complex
and potentially time consuming process: a process which could
substantially delay privatization of federal power. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is our position, however, that the privatization
of federal power activities should be given priority. That is
why we conclude that sale of PMA's via warrants should be initiated
as soon as possible, and a Holt/Bankhead type arrangement adopted
as an interim measure with a promise that the river association
is a target structure. The only thing that would need to be addressed
at that point would be the future position of the privatized PMA's
in river associations (e.g. percentage of shares, raising capital
by issuing preferential shares) because these have an ultimate
impact on the PMA market value. Immediately after the PMA's are
privatized, the federal government should begin transferring ownership
of the dams, using a river association approach. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The government must not slow down the privatization
of the PMA's while figuring out who should get the shares in the
river associations and how many. Removing the federal government
from the electricity business is the all important objective,
and it should not be delayed by arguments over the best way to
deal with the disposal of the non-power assets of the various
water projects. There will be time after we get the federal government
out of the electricity business to get the ownership and structure
of the dam operating agency correct. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">EPILOGUE</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">WHAT'S NEXT?</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The privatization of the three PMA's analyzed
in this report is only the first, albeit important, step on the
road to remove the federal government from the electricity business.
It is the first step in cutting subsidies and leveling the playing
field for the emerging competitive market in electric energy.
The emphasis is on the word &quot;first.&quot; Aside from SEPA,
WAPA and SWPA, the federal government plays an active role in
the electricity business by owning and/or operating the Bonneville
Power Administration (BPA) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).
It also influences the market by excluding municipal, co-operative
and other publicly-owned utilities from paying federal taxes and
by providing subsidized loans to rural electric co-operatives
through the Rural Electrification Administration: a trilobite
that somehow forgot to become extinct.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Among obsolete federal power programs, TVA
and BPA are certainly the largest: together they represent almost
80 percent of all federal power, and about 6.5 percent of all
power produced and marketed in the United States. However, it
is not their size alone that makes their privatization much more
complicated than SEPA, SWPA and WAPA. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">TVA's ambitious nuclear program has turned
out to be a classroom example of what &quot;stranded costs&quot;
look like in the real world - out of nine nuclear units built,
only two are currently operating, and TVA has been extremely reluctant
to write off the remaining seven. Deferred assets and construction
in progress total $15.7 billion, which is almost 50 percent of
TVA's total assets. On the other side of the balance sheet there
is another devil, $22.2 billion of long-term debt owed to bondholders.
Add to this a totally dominant position inside the &quot;fence&quot;
and you have one of the most complicated privatization projects
in the federal government. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">However, TVA is only one of the most complicated
privatization projects. Although BPA was somewhat more successful
in its participation in Washington Public Power Supply System
(WPPSS) nuclear program (one of three plants is currently operating),
it has a debt burden inherited from that program on the order
of $7 billion (or 44 percent of total assets). In addition to
that, BPA has become deeply involved in a salmon protection program,
which currently costs Northwest power consumers about $450 million
a year. This is a cost that will be difficult to recover in a
competitive marketplace, and it makes the real value of BPA much
lower than it may appear from its financial statements. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Because of various implicit subsidies and the
deferred recovery of some capital costs, TVA and BPA have been
able to keep their rates fairly low. This does not mean, however,
that we can simply extend our warrant plan to the &quot;big brothers&quot;
of federal power. Their enormous stranded costs and horrific financials
will make devising a workable privatization plan an even greater
political (and financial) challenge. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Despite future complications, we should move
now to take the first step. Privatizing the New Deal's Power Marketing
Administrations makes sense. Their original mission to help with
regional development was accomplished with the suburbanization
of America. Today, PMA's leave taxpayers with the bill to provide
subsidized power to the rich, distort and hinder competition and
productivity in the electric energy market, and are a large source
of frozen assets that could be used for federal deficit reduction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Privatization can become politically viable
by using a method that creates direct benefits for stakeholders
in the PMA's. End-users of PMA power, worried about rate increases,
can be given the chance to earn actual monetary profits during
the sale of PMA's. Environmentalists, fishermen and boating companies,
worried about who controls the dams and reservoirs, can be given
that control themselves. It is time to replace the PMA's with
a new approach that empowers, and enriches, Americans. It is time
to turn the lights out on subsidized federal power.</FONT>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial">AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL FOR
CREATING POLITICAL SUPPORT<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Block-Shadegg privatization plan attempts
to generate political support for PMA privatization by creating
a strong interest group in its favor.  The plan does this by turning
potential opponents - those end users of PMA power who might see
rate increases after privatization - into supporters by ensuring
they obtain significant monetary benefits from the PMAs' sale.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The logic underlining this solution was <I>not</I>
recognition of &quot;property rights&quot; vested in federal subsidies;
we do not believe there is a legal entitlement to subsidized PMA
power.  We based our plan on an understanding of the political
decision making process.  Thus we recognized that groups which
perceive they will lose from policy are often able to stop change,
even if the change is produces net benefits for the country as
a whole.  For instance, concentrated special interests have been
able to get policies passed that produced net losses (i.e., farm
subsidies, electricity regulation, the minimum wage), leaving
dispersed and unorganized groups (i.e., general taxpayers, electricity
consumers, the unemployed) with the bill.  Those who would be
harmed by a policy do not always have the political organization
or clout to defend their interest. The challenge facing policymakers
now is to use the same mechanism for quite the opposite purpose:
Concentrate the benefits from a desirable policy change in the
hands of a well-defined interest group in order to make the desirable
change happen. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is possible that warrant plan we outline
may not be the best way to privatize the PMA's. It is possible
that interest groups other than warrant beneficiaries would be
even stronger supporters of privatization. Outlined below are
two alternative ways to politically approach privatization. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">One possibility would be for Congress to distribute
proportionally to all taxpayers warrants for all three PMA's,
implicitly giving them back &quot;their&quot; investment. Such
a plan may create political interest (and support among Members
of Congress) even in states without PMA's. As there are about
114 million taxpayers (warrants would be given only to those individuals
who filed personal income taxes in a given year), it would mean
a gain of about $47 for each taxpayer (strike price set at BG).
 Thus far more people would receive some direct financial benefit
under this plan than those 11 million end-users of PMA power.
 In addition, from the potential buyers' point of view, it actually
may be easier to contact 114 million people as a general public
instead of focusing on very specific group &quot;hidden&quot;
among others.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The disadvantage of distributing warrants equally
across all taxpayers is that the actual gain per taxpayer is not
very attractive.  Thus, it may be better to focus on residential
consumers of PMA power, bypassing the commercial, industrial and
public sector consumers. The warrants for a specific PMA would
be distributed equally among those households who ultimately consume
PMA through their municipal, cooperative or public utility.  If
the strike price remained at BG, the gains to each household would
be:<BR>
</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial">$356 for SEPA</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">$673 for SWPA</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">$488 for WAPA<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This is a significant amount of money per household,
and would likely generate substantial political support for PMA
privatization.</FONT>

these charts did not cover all end users (as opposed to the data

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The total Market Value of WAPA is $5.182 billion,
and the Strike Price Discount is 0.481, which implies that $5.182*0.498
= $2.581 billion will be captured as gains (or value of warrants)
by end users. In 1993, the total WAPA revenues from power sales
were $606,319,000. In the same year, the City of Biggs, California,
purchased power from WAPA for $129,313. This means that 0.02133
percent (129,313/606,319,000) of all gains will accrue to the
residents and businesses in Biggs; in dollars, this represents
$2.581 billion * 0.02133 percent = $550,488.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">In some special cases, other adjustments were
necessary.  Specifically:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">In calculating the gains of TVA's end users
(TVA is one of SEPA's customers), only those end users who buy
power directly from TVA were counted as eligible for warrants.
Those who buy TVA (and consequently SEPA) power via their muni
or co-op were not included in our estimates. </FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Similarly, when calculating purchases of
PMA power by munies or co-ops (except those operating in TVA service
area), only direct purchases and purchases from wholesale public
or cooperative utilities were included. Thus, our calculation
does not include cases such as where a PMA sells to an IOU and
then the IOU sells to a muni that also buys directly from a PMA.
It is a policy question where to draw the bright line in calculating
warrant eligibility. We never go beyond one intermediate sale
in our calculations. </FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">For some co-ops, the only information available
to us was PMA power (measured in MWh) as a share of total power
needs.  To estimate how much power (measured in $) they actually
bought from the PMA's, we multiplied the physical share of PMA
power by their revenue from total sales to ultimate customers.
This would be an exact estimate if all munies and coops were buying
PMA power as well as other power for the same prices and if they
did not charge any markup on the purchase price. To adjust for
at least some of the inaccuracies of such an estimate, we multiplied
the estimated PMA power purchases of all co-ops for which we did
not have the exact data by a coefficient that transformed them
so that the sum of both directly available and estimated power
purchases was equal to total PMA sales. These numbers were then
used as an  input in the gains calculation. </FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Block examined how legislation (H.R. 3790)
introduced by Representative Dan Schaefer (R-CO), chairman of
the House Commerce subcommittee on energy, measures up to the
principles, and concluded that the Schaefer legislation does not
go far enough in terms of deregulation, fails to take a skeptical
enough view of Federal regulation, and contains some anti-competitive
provisions such as those mandating costly renewable energy sources.

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a recent study, Block, who heads the Foundation's
project on &quot;Creating Competitive Markets in Electric Power,&quot;
argued that a better approach to energy deregulation this year
would be to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
because it is hindering state efforts to reform energy markets.
 The study, <I>The Competition Revolution and the Market for Energy</I>,
argues that PUHCA repeal would get deregulation off to an immediate
start.<BR>

<h2>Reasserting States' Rights</h2>

<b>An Interview with Gov. Mike Leavitt</b>
<P>
<i>American Civilization speaks with Governor Mike Leavitt of Utah about the
Conference of the States: An Action Plan to Restore Balance in the Federal
System. As co-chairman of the National Governors' Association, Leavitt is
leading an effort among governors and state legislatures to restore the
balance of power between the national government and the states.</i>
<P>
<br>
<b>AmCiv</b>: What is the Conference of the States and what are you trying to
accomplish?
<P>
<b>Gov Leavitt</b>: Americans feel alienated from their national government and
want government decisions that affect their lives made locally or at the
state level. What we are trying to do is create a forum that would
demonstrate the states' resolve to take back from Congress the powers that
rightly belong to each of the states.
<P>
We are currently trying to get a resolution passed in each state that
authorizes them to send delegates to the Conference, where they will
examine proposals to restore the balance in the federal system. Currently
we have 35 states where a resolution for participation in the Conference
has been introduced in their legislature, and we expect the remainder of
the states to do the same.
<P>
<b>AmCiv</b>: Are you getting any resistance?
<P>
<b>Gov Leavitt</b>: We have had little serious resistance so far. In Colorado we
had a skirmish, because a real far right group called the Patriots is
worried about constitutional conventions in general, and they worry that
somehow this will turn into a constitutional convention, and exploit the
constitution -- but they're the only opposition thus far. It would be
impossible for this to turn into a Constitutional Convention.
<P>
<b>AmCiv</b>: What happens next, after the states have chosen delegates to attend
the Conference?
<P>
<b>Gov Leavitt</b>: They'll be two meetings. The first one will be just a
convening meeting, when we'll elect officers, establish by-laws and the
priorities of the agenda. This will be in July. Then in October we will
meet in Philadelphia, where the delegates will consider, refine and vote on
ways of correcting the imbalance in the federal system.
<P>
Any item receiving the support of the delegates will be included in the
States' Petition, which will be an action plan for change. It will be the
highest form of communication between the states and the Congress, and it
will gain its authority from the sheer power of the process the states
followed to initiate it. It shouldn't be taken lightly because it will
symbolize the states' seriousness to restore balance in our system.
<P>
<b>AmCiv</b>: What types of items do you expect to be on the Petition?
<P>
<b>Gov Leavitt</b>: We are establishing this in a way that limits any attempt to
make this a vehicle to deal with some of the more divisive issues -- school
prayer, federal lands, immigration, any of those issues that would become
so specific that we'd lose the capacity to agree on. We'll be excluding
those issues from the discussion.
<P>
In my assessment we'll likely focus on three areas as the primary means of
change. The first would be a state initiated amendment process, where you
invert the current process and allow as an alternative means of amending
the Constitution 38 states to actually initiate an amendment, instead of
just the Congress. This levels the playing field, because currently states
cannot initiate amendments except at the extraordinary step of a
Constitutional Convention. I mean, certainly the Founders intended the
states to have a role in amending the Constitution, to be able to initiate
it through the conventional process. But that has proven so unworkable,
impractical, that it has never been done.
<P>
Another topic that's generating a lot of interest and might become part of
the States' Petition is a proposal made in 1980 by, ironically, Bruce
Babbit. The idea would be to have two-thirds of the states have the power
to, in essence, sunset any federal law except those dealing with foreign
affairs or national defense. It provides the states with a mechanism to
remove onerous burdens imposed by the central government.
<P>
A third area that I think people will be interested in talking about will
be this whole area of unfunded mandates. And I think there's a lot of folks
exercised about that. A good model for this is the Safe Drinking Water Act.
<P>
<P>
Initially it was 40 pages long. They're re-authorizing it now, and it's
about 800 pages. As a 40 page document, it was a very successful law; as an
800 page document, its burdensome.
<P>
But let me be clear. The Conference of the States isn't about who is going
to do welfare, or who is going to do Medicaid, or who's going to take care
of transportation. This is establishing a framework that creates checks and
balances -- that restores the checks and balances.
<P>
<b>AmCiv</b>: Congress is very friendly to states, and doing some really good
things. But they're focusing on day to day issues that are very
controversial, not on the structural long-term reforms that will create
balance in the system.
<P>
But we don't know if we're going to have a state friendly Congress six
years from now, or ten years from now. The Conference of States, then, is
an opportunity to put into place those long-term reforms that will maintain
the proper balance. It is about more than day to day issues.
<P>
<b>Gov Leavitt</b>: Correct. Also, it is non-partisan and the Conference will be
paid for out of state appropriated money, not political contributions.
Right now we're just a speck on the radar screen, but when the States'
Petition passes the Conference and it goes back to the states, we hope
people then will engage in actively encouraging grassroots support for its
passage in the 50 state legislatures. And if 75 percent of the states can
agree on certain articles of the States' Petition, then we'll send it to
Congress as notice of our seriousness.
<P>
The whole idea is to create a process that is so deliberate, and so arduous
in nature that it becomes the single highest form of communication between
the collected states and the Congress, something so unequivocal that it
cannot be denied as the will of the people.
<P>
<b>AmCiv</b>: While you're here, let's switch subjects for a moment and talk about
the idea of block grants, which is a topic of much discussion in Congress
these days.
<P>
The problem we see with block grants is that they are ultimately next
year's temptation to micro-manage. There was a great quotation in The New
York Times where a Republican staffer in Congress is quoted as saying that
what these governors want us to do is leave the money on a stump in the
forest in the middle of the night, so they can run off with it and do what
they want.
<P>
<b>Gov Leavitt</b>: That's exactly what we want.
<P>
<b>AmCiv</b>: But what happens if you get a Democratic Congress six years from now
-- and it won't just be Democrats -- the instinct to micro manage is
endemic to the federal government?
<P>
<b>Gov Leavitt</b>: Ultimately what you have to do is move the capacity to tax
back to the states. If you could take a block of programs that cost X, and
essentially shift the responsibility for them to states, and at the same
time reduce federal income tax by X (or maybe a bit less than X so that you
are getting some deficit reduction out of it) and then just invite states
at the same time to increase their taxes to whatever degree they desire or
need to meet their responsibilities.
<P>
In this way you take away from Congress the ability to micromanage. It is a
far more permanent change than block grants.

<title>Analog to Digital--That Is the Issue, Not Telecommunications -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h1>Analog to Digital--That Is the Issue, Not Telecommunications</h1>
<p>
<b>By G. A. Keyworth, II, Chairman</b>
<i>Remarks at the National Policy Forum's Megaconference<br>
on Telecommunications Law Reform: Reinventing Competition<br>
March 8, 1995<br>
Washington, D.C.</i>
<p>
Since I'm privileged to speak early on the agenda, let me begin with some
general perspectives on the whole issue of telecommunications law reform.
First, there is something terribly wrong with the whole language of the
debate. Look at the confusion the term "superhighway" has caused. With this
analogy to centrally planned, limited-access arteries it's hardly a
surprise that the new bogeyman of anti-process is the information have-not.

<P>
There's new life given to the anachronism of "universal service," as if
there were no new technologies blurring the cost-gap between urban and
rural telephony or, alternatively, as if we were discussing subsidizing
television viewing. Even the meaning of the word "competition" is softened
in that debate, sort of like golf, with various handicaps passed out to
contenders--by bureaucrats. One would almost think that regional phone
companies and cable-TV companies were still "natural monopolies" or that
the widespread erosion of barriers to entry was merely a myth. (Just ask
<a href = http://www.ibm.com>IBM</a>!)
<P>
Interpreting a central theme of Nick Negroponte's excellent and insightful
new book Being Digital, these are analog solutions to problems that are
inherently digital. This interpretation is much more, I believe, than an
arcane technical distinction. Analog communications are fundamentally
different than digital communications. The means of analog communications
are specific to each application, like wires for voice, broadcast for
radio, or even bicycles for newspaper delivery. In short, analog
communications are a monopolist's and regulator's dream. Digital
communications, however, by their nature, merge applications, such as
voice, TV and data on a single fiber, or paging and voice on a single
cellular radio system. Digital communications are a monopolist's and
regulator's nightmare.
<P>
The analog world is one where economies of scale still prevail, where to
have an installed base and to be big is to be successful; conversely, the
digital world is composed of narrow, but tall, niche industries, ruled by
Darwinian competition for each new product generation, and where and
installed base is as often a disadvantage as an asset. In short, the
digital world looks like today's computer industry, and the more
far-sighted communications companies recognize it as a factor in their
future, too.
<P>
Yet the debate over telecommunications reform sounds suspiciously analog.
This fundamental distinctions between the nature of yesterday's highly
regulated analog telephone industry, and tomorrow's digital communications
is largely absent in that debate. In fact, I would characterize virtually
all of the government's efforts at reform to date as analog. Somehow, we
need to change the language of the debate, and we need to pursue reform
that is digital in nature, drawing from the one role model we have--the
computer industry.
<P>
The societal objectives we seek in this endeavor are, of course, enhancing
economic growth and empowering individuals. And, again, what better role
model do we have than the computing sector. The race for leadership in
computing, concern over which was largely responsible in the 1980s for
making the word competitiveness part of our daily lexicon, is, for the
moment, over. And we Americans won that race. No "Fifth Generation Computer
Project" in Japan nor "Eureka" program in Europe affected the outcome, at
least not as was intended. Although hotly contested, we won that race "fair
and square," simply by providing the value customers wanted, at an
affordable price. And not least, we won by being a nations of people quick
to adapt to a new technology. The reward was good jobs, and rejuvenation of
our wealth generating machine. But it also gave new meaning to that second
objective--the empowerment of individuals. It gave us the hacker, a computer
-empowered individual who is both productive, and very American. It gave
stimulus to self-employment, and enabled the decentralized organization.
<P>
The computer industry is the industrial personification of things
digital--as things are becoming but not as they were. Moreover, it has
shown us just how well equipped we are, as a society, to confront progress,
with optimism. But the communications industry remains, in the view of most
Americans, far more as things were, not as things are becoming. And I'm
afraid that too much of today's telecommunications policy debate adds fuel
to the flames of that perception.
<P>
As I delve into the rich media treatment of telecommunications policy and
the information superhighway, I am often left with the impression that
breaking the local access monopoly in voice telephony, and adding a few
hundred more cable channels, with a dash of interactivity, will somehow,
inexplicably, lead us to a better world. The problem is that the hardly
dynamic metaphor telecommunications fails to support the promises, and the
far more dynamic metaphor of computing, that could, is notably absent.
<P>
Let me try to describe two ways people view computing. One perspective has
computing, whether in the guise of PCs, High Definition or Direct Broadcast
TV, 32-bit games, or embedded in Automatic Teller Machines or assembly
lines, as the technology that is reshaping our time. While some older
people are still intimidated by the mere work "computer," young people take
them for granted. And everyone equates computing with today, not yesterday.
Another sees computing as the most dynamic part of our job- and
wealth-generation-- machines, an American success story that is giving new
vigor to manufacturing, distribution, as well as to our rapidly growing
service sector. Either way, people view computers, increasingly, as the
essential tools of our time. And it is not such a big step to show those
same people that connecting all those computers together into a digital
communications system is simply the next, logical step. To me, that's the
"beef" of the telecommunications debate, and the challenge in
telecommunications reform.
<P>
Let me use two examples to show how the content of the debate needs to
change if we are to make real progress toward "digital legislation." One
pertains to the apparent fascination with managing how regional telephone
companies, long distance operators, cellular operators, and cable-TV
companies will offer new services, and compete with each other. This
fascination seems to pervade the FCC and much of The Congress--and not only
among Democrats. The basis for that fascination stems from those analog
tenets--that big is strong, and that an installed base is an unfair
advantage. The counter-argument, from digital experience, is that digital
technologies are moving too fast to predict rejuvenating effects of new
technology. The digital fascination would fasten upon making entry to new
players easier. To me, this is far more worthy of creative solutions, and
more consistent with real-world digital experience, than searching for new
regulatory tools to manage competition among current players.
<P>
My second example is more general: It is the obsession with controlling
hardware as the means to ensure competition. And the focus on bandwidth is
one of its more disturbing manifestations. This, too, stems from analog
tenets--the belief that more information, rather than better information,
is the main benefit of a next-generation telecommunications system. Here
let me invoke what I call the "30-30 rule" --that we humans can take in
information at only about 30 megahertz through our eyes or, even slower, at
30 kilohertz through our ears. Bandwidth is important to machine-to-machine
communications, but it is the computer, in some form, whether PC, PDA,
digital-phone or digital-TV, that will continue to determine the "match"
between bandwidth and the inherent limitation of the 30-30 rule. As
bandwidth explodes, and as digital connections become pervasive, the demand
for computers to provide a better "match" will remain the driving force
shaping digital communications. WE pay for human features, such as
resolution, portability, and ease-of-use, but the demand for bandwidth is
more elusive.
<P>
Those twin societal goals of enhancing economic growth and empowering
individuals are best addressed by thinking about how to make available all
those new services that are enabled by digital communications--connecting
computers--not just by the proliferation of bandwidth. This aspect of
digital communications is not benign; It means that application software,
more than hardware or system software, will be the differentiating factor.
<P>
And, in a truly competitive environment, that means that that's where a
large measure of future communications' profits will come from. It makes
the case for opening the doors to new entrants even more pertinent.
<P>
In the recent issue of Reason magazine, Peter Huber has outlined, clearly
and succinctly, the major elements for a telecommunications reform debate
that could, for the first time, lead to "digital legislation." His basic
assumptions there is that "Monopoly is indeed a nasty thing. The biggest
monopoly in town is always government........To fix monopoly, you have to
go after and disable the worst monopolist, government itself." To his
article, I would just add this additional point: Opening the door to new
entrants, especially in the local loop, should be an overarching objective
of any digital legislation. Moreover, in debating how to best accomplish
that, we must examine closely the computer industry's experience.
<P>
I leave you with one thought. Setting aside Judge Sporkin's legitimate
concerns, do you think Microsoft or Intel would be American companies if
computing had been regulated as communications is toady, or even as current
legislation pending would have it? Or do you think America would today
dominate the computer industry if new entrants had been inhibited? I do
not.

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2>
<h3>HOLLYWOOD STEREOTYPES</h3>
<p>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>

     Hollywood--through both movies and television--does a good job of typecasting many entities and groups
throughout American society.  But three of the most egregious examples of Hollywood stereotyping involve its
images of blacks, families and Christians.<p>

     For blacks, the typecasting is especially deplorable.  In fact, because the stereotyping for blacks has gone
unchecked for so many years, many people mistakenly believe these images represent reality.  In movies and on
television, the images for blacks are extremely limited.  In films, black males are cast as either criminals, gangsters,
drug dealers or pimps, and females are usually the girlfriends of these male deviants.  The notable exception to this
pattern in films today is actor Denzel Washington, who is described in this edition of National Minority Politics by
writer Stanley Crouch as a modern-day Sidney Poitier.<P>

     Television for black images is hardly better, as Americans see blacks largely in comedic roles--sitcoms.  In
other words, seen through Hollywood's myopic prism, blacks are viewed in two theatrical extremes: comedies and
tragedies.  The depth and breadth of everyday drama, in which most blacks lead ordinary lives, is nearly nonexistent
in Hollywood productions. <P>

     Images of the American family are slightly better, but still outside the norm.  Motion pictures focus
relentlessly on family dysfunction and divorce, while television programs broadcast the virulent message that kids
know better than their old-fashioned and irrelevant parents.  In addition, commercial television regularly and
powerfully encourages casual sex, espousing the underlying message that sensuality is most satisfying when it is
shared outside of marriage, and that long-term relationships only serve to lessen the pleasure of the partners.<P>
     An analysis of television programming by S. Robert Lichter, Linda Lichter and Stanley Rothman reveals
that in addition to a spectacular increase in the amount of erotic activity in prime time, the context in which that
behavior occurs has shifted dramatically.  Prior to 1969, their tracking studies turned up references to sex outside of
marriage in only one out of every thirty shows on television's nightly lineup.  More recently, extramarital
experiences appeared in one show in six, and they report that the ratio "continues to narrow."<P>

     Another key element in the entertainment industry's attack on the family involves its relentlessly negative
portrayal of marital relationships.  In Hollywood's view of the world, marriage is an institution that is outmoded,
oppressive and frequently dangerous. <P>

     But no notion has been more aggressively and ubiquitously promoted in films, popular music and
television than the idea that children know best--that parents are unscrupulous, phony idiots who must learn decency
and integrity from their enlightened offspring.  Witness the animated FOX network program "The Simpsons," in
which the children wrestle with contemporary problems while getting sincere but useless, perhaps even detrimental,
advice from their parents.<P>

     Then there's Hollywood's abysmal treatment of people holding spiritual or religious beliefs.  A 1994
Harris poll showed almost all Americans believe in God (95 percent) and in heaven (90 percent).  Approximately
four out of five adults (79 percent) describe themselves as Christians.  More surprising than the total numbers
perhaps are the numbers of people who say they are not Christians who believe in some uniquely Christian beliefs.<P>

     Yet, we wouldn't know it from what we see in movies and on television.  Maybe this is due to the dearth of
religious conviction or affiliation among those who produce and create programming.<P>
  
     A 1983 Public Opinion survey of 104 of the most influential leaders of television's creative community
showed a full 45 percent who claim no religious affiliation whatsoever and an astounding 93 percent who say they
seldom or never attend religious services.<P>

     In an October 1991 interview with a Catholic newspaper in New York, veteran television producer John
Prizer conceded, "The lack of religious commitment on the part of people in Hollywood is quite astonishing.  I can't
think of a director or actor or writer under 45 who goes to church or synagogue."<P>

     Film critic Michael Medved, in his book, Hollywood vs. America, suggests that this lack of participation in
religious activities may account for many of the bizarre portrayals of men of God in film.<P>

     "Whenever someone turns up in a contemporary film with the title "Reverend," "Father," or "Rabbi" in
front of his name," writes Medved "you can count on the fact that he will turn out to be corrupt or crazy--or
probably both."<P>

     Since the only committed Christians many movie makers see regularly are television evangelists, they do
not get a balanced picture of what members of the clergy do on a daily basis.  The movie executives and producers
are more familiar with Jimmy Swaggert than they are with the working clergy in their local communities.<P>

     And there are more examples of religious imbalance in Hollywood.  In a 1992 study, professors from
Northwestern University, the University of Dayton, and Duke University Medical Center evaluated more than one
hundred productions on the four major networks for their religious content and images.  <P>

     They concluded that only 5.4 percent of the characters had an identifiable religious affiliation--although 89
percent of Americans claim affiliation with an organized faith.  In summing up their report, the researchers
concluded: "Television's treatment of religion tends to be best characterized as abuse through neglect."<P>

     This edition of National Minority Politics explores the subject of Holly-wood stereotyping.  As mentioned,
New York writer Stanley Crouch explains the historical evolution of black images in films and television, from the
early 1900s to the present.  Family Research Council president Gary L. Bauer discusses Hollywood's typecasting of
families and Christians.<P>

     After reading the commentaries by Crouch and Bauer, one may ask what can be done about these
inaccurate portrayals.  There are at least two answers.  One, we can let Hollywood know our displeasure through
calls and letters to producers, directors and script writers.  Two, we can affect the ratings of undesirable
programming by simply watching more appropriate programs or turning off the tube altogether.<P>

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><p>


<h3>CAN ALAN KEYES WIN?</h3>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>
Alan Keyes, as the conventional wisdom would have it, is the quintessential also-ran in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.  He's never been elected to public office, holds beliefs which would be characterized by some as "far right, hosts a syndicated radio talk show and served in the Reagan administration.  He's a committed Christian (Catholic) and is strongly pro-life.<p>

Oddly enough, that description fits, almost to a tee, another presidential candidate--Pat Buchanan.  The only difference is that Buchanan made a run for
the presidency in the 1992 election cycle. But that was Buchanan's first bid for office.  Keyes has run twice before, for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, and lost.  Yet he
got just as big a percentage of Republican votes as Buchanan did three years ago.<p>

It appears Keyes is one of those kinds of candidates whose role in the campaign
is hard for the media to pinpoint. Therefore, they simply choose to ignore him.<p>

When Keyes first announced his candidacy, I received several calls from media representatives who wanted to know my opinion of his national political debut.  They just couldn't understand how Keyes could be anything other than a "black" candidate.<p>

"Isn't he running to galvanize black Republicans?" one reporter asked me in a telephone interview.  When I responded that Keyes' support was coming primarily from pro-life advocates, most of whom were white Christians, the reporter seemed dumbfounded.<p>

Because of the way our national political campaigns have been waged in the past, she just could not envision a black candidate getting significant support from  anything other than black voters.  She expected Keyes to be sort of a Republican
Jesse Jackson.<p>

In reality, I told the reporter, Keyes is making a smart move.  There are presently not enough blacks in the Republican Party (in national polls, only 5 percent identify themselves as Republicans) to make that much difference in the primary process.<p>

But pro-life voters number in the millions and have a disproportionate impact during the GOP presidential primaries.  They are well-organized and passionate about their cause.  And many believe Keyes is the best vehicle for channeling that passion into clout at the 1996 Republican convention.<p>

In fact, when Keyes speaks at conservative or Republican events, he always revs up the crowd and leaves them wanting more.<p>

Keyes may have significant grassroots support but, so far, that support does not
show up in national polls.  In every national poll of registered Republicans I've seen, he either receives 1 percent support or not enough to even register on the radar screen.<p>

But polls can be misleading.  Several of the Republican primaries are in the form of caucuses, which give candidates like Keyes--who don't have a lot of name identification but have spirited supporters who are willing to stick with their guy (or
gal) during the primary process--an edge.<p>

In 1988, Sen. Bob Dole won the Republican vote in Iowa, followed by Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, who won almost 25 percent of the vote and
pushed then-vice president George Bush into third place.  Robertson's showing
enabled him to grab the spotlight.<p>

A big question this year is how this large, powerful bloc of conservative Christian voters who backed Robertson in 1988 will break in 1996.<p>

If Keyes can do reasonably well in some of the early caucus states and stay in
the race through at least the first round of contests, he and his supporters may have
an impact on shaping the debate at the convention.<p>

If he does, success will have its price.  Thus far, Keyes has not received very much media scrutiny because he is not considered a major player.  However, as other presidential candidates can confirm, being toward the front of the pack takes its toll.
Media start delving into the backgrounds of candidates they consider "viable," digging up dirt and, in many cases, casting a shadow on a person's reputation where none existed before.<p>

In Keyes' case, the fact that he paid himself several thousand dollars a month out of his campaign funds during his 1992 senate race will raise eyebrows.  And the former
ambassador still has a campaign debt left over from that election. Lingering campaign debts are certainly nothing new in politics.  But media have a way of making indiscretions or mistakes appear worse than they actually are.<p>

Yes, Keyes has a tough row to hoe.  His campaign faces a Catch-22.  If voters believe he can't win, they'll likely cast their ballots for someone else to avoid "wasting"
their votes.<p>

Whether or not he wins, he may have already succeeded in one regard. His candidacy demonstrates that a black politico can run nationally on the basis of ideology or issues, rather than race.<p>

This edition of National Minority Politics includes an exclusive interview with
the candidate himself.  To give added insight into how he's faring with the party
faithful, Sharon Brooks Hodge, NMP's social/cultural correspondent, followed
Keyes around during the North Carolina Republican convention.  Hodge spoke
with those who support Keyes, to find out why, and she also talked to those
who are skeptical, to get their take on his campaign.<p>

Finally, Deborah Burstion-Donbraye,  a Maryland writer and former media relations specialist during the Reagan administration, assesses Keyes' impact from the
state where he ran his two Senate campaigns. Burstion-Donbraye says the
candidate is "still unspoiled by compromises."<p>

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><p>
<h3>Saving our Cities without government Programs</h3>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>
<p>
<p>
One of the real tragedies of modern times is the lack of a  
historical perspective by those who were born in the late 1960s  
and 1970s concerning Americans' abilities to solve their problems  
individually, and with the help of family, friends and neighbors.   
Our sense of community and neighborhood has been lost, and young  
people today have little or no knowledge of how things were  
before a lot of community functions were usurped by local, state  
and national governments.  
<p>     
Often when I encounter young people and we get into a  
discussion concerning issues like welfare reform, job training  
and assistance to the poor, I present the argument that these  
issues can best be addressed with a greater emphasis on the  
private sector and neighbor helping neighbor.  The involvement of  
the federal government has been expensive and, in some cases,  
detrimental, resulting in unintended consequences.  
<p>
But these young adults often give me a puzzled look.  It  
seems they have no concept of how problems can be solved without  
the establishment of a government program.  And this should come  
as no surprise since, in their lifetimes, we have approached most  
national issues in this manner.  
<p>
Those of us who were born in the 1950s and before should  
consider ourselves lucky, because we remember how neighbors  
helped each other and did not rely upon the government for basic  
needs.  I can remember how our family would take clothes we had  
outgrown to needy neighbors, and share food with them as well.  
<p>     
Our church played a major role in the community also, as  
parishioners would contribute whatever they could spare to help  
those who were less fortunate.  Hardly anyone we knew was well  
off financially; most were from middle class and working class  
families.  But collectively those items and monies donated made a  
difference for a lot of families during hard times.  
<p>
Young people today simply have no memory of this sort of  
thing; in fact, it's totally foreign to their sensibilities.   
They've bought into the liberal notion that we should first look  
to the government when we encounter an obstacle.  
<p>
For example, if a young person needs a job, setting up a  
government job assistance program is the way most liberal  
politicians would approach it.  The bureaucrats' method is to  
establish a special agency just for this purpose.  Identify those  
teens who need jobs, identify those employers who might be  
hiring, hire analysts to study the results, and administrators to  
police the project.  This is very expensive.  
<p>     
The conservative approach is to have a parent, local teacher  
or neighbor encourage that young person to look for work on his  
own, in his own neighborhood.  He or she can even become  
entrepreneurial, offering babysitting, yard work or cleaning  
services to people in his or her community for an agreed upon  
price.  Or he or she can ask a local merchant or small business  
owner if they need assistance during the summer months and after  
school.  
<p>     
No bureaucrats involved, no expense to the taxpayers and,  
more importantly, the young person learns an important lesson in  
the process--how to sell his or her skills while seeking  
employment.  But it is interesting that, in the current political  
environment, those of us who advocate local solutions are accused  
of lacking compassion.  It seems that compassion is no longer  
measured by how effective a system or process is, but by how much  
money is taken from a large pool of taxpayers to address a  
problem, even if the solutions do not work.  
<p>     
As author Marvin Olasky wrote in his book, The Tragedy of  
American Compassion, the problems "seem intractable because so  
many things, costing so much money, have been tried so often  
without success."  
<p>     
In fact, it seems that the plight of the poor is often used  
as a camouflage for spending billions of dollars to make it more  
convenient to be poor, rather than showing the poor how to earn a  
middle class income.  
<p>     
There is a simple formula to upward mobility in America:  
Stay in school and get a good education; take a job, any job, no  
matter how much it pays, as a first step toward employment  
opportunities; and delay childbearing until marriage.  An  
emphasis on this common sense formula would go a lot further than  
all the government programs that we can develop over the next 20  
years.  
<p>     
Of course, there is a role for government.  There are some  
instances where government involvement is necessary, but again it  
should be a last resort, not the first option.  
<p>     
For those who are unfamiliar with private alternatives to  
public assistance, this edition of National Minority Politics  
will be a real eye-opener.  Robert L. Woodson, founder and  
president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,  
provides an insightful analysis of the difference in approaches  
between government programs and community-based initiatives.    
<p>    
Woodson is very specific about why government initiatives  
are a less desirable option than are projects derived from  
indigenous community sources.  He cites an example of a  
successful project in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of  
Washington, D.C., which he describes as a "virtual oasis" in the  
nation's capital.  
<p>
Deroy Murdock, economics and government correspondent for  
National Minority Politics, searched from coast to coast and  
found several inspiring examples of how the private sector can  
best the state in aiding the disadvantaged and building their  
communities.  One such program called Fridays in Portland, Ore.,  
is a job training project which takes no government funds on the  
notion that if welfare makes individuals dependent, it must do  
the same to organizations.  
<p>     
Murdock's findings should encourage us all to be more  
creative in our quest for a better society and rely less on  
Washington-based solutions.

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><p>
<h3>Education Revolution:</h3>
<b>Home Schooling Choice Schools find School Choice</b><p>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>

It appears that hardly anyone is pleased with the current state of our
public education system. We seem to be paying more and getting less.<p>

A few weeks ago National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores were released and revealed that national reading scores have dropped for high school seniors. Only about a third of seniors were rated proficient readers, a significant decrease from the same test two years earlier.<p>

Yet the national per-pupil average we spend to educate our children continues to increase fairly rapidly, and is now $6,100. And only 52 cents of the average dollar spent on public education gets into the classroom. Where does the rest go? Nobody knows.<p>

School systems typically have only a vague idea of how much goes where. When Christine Todd Whitman, New Jersey's Republican governor, recently instituted a new accounting system that disclosed costs, school districts discovered they were spending $3,000 to S6,000 per student every year for administration alone.<p>

A survey accompanying the 1994 NAEP test found that, compared to seniors who took the 1992 test, students were less likely to: read for fun on their own time, read more than 11 pages per day, or be asked at least once at school to discuss something they read.<p>

Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the results indicate students are spending "too much time watching mind-numbing television."<p>

And the test results get worse. About 30 percent of the seniors failed to reach even basic, which denotes "partial mastery" of the reading skills they should have. Two years ago, that figure was 25 percent.<p>

Fewer than 5 percent of any grade reached the advanced level. The decline in 12th-grade reading scores seemed almost universal -- the average scores dropped for both girls and boys; for whites, blacks and Hispanics; for private school students as well as public school students.<p>

But there was a notable trend: Scores for the top quarter of students remained the same. The decrease came from those in the middle and, most especially, at the bottom of the achievement scale.<p>

One problem may be that only students who wanted to be admitted to a top university are required to achieve, said Chester Finn, a member of the test governing board. The rest "aren't obligated to read," he said.<p>

Ten states showed significant declines in reading proficiency. No state showed significant improvement in average scores.<p>

One would think that these results would signal a receptivity for innovation and educational reform. Parents seem ripe for change.<p>

And in some cases, transformation has taken place. But it's usually on the micro, rather than a macro, level. Change comes from the bottom up, not the top down, and often meets significant resistance from teachers' unions and administrators.<p>

Take Milwaukee, which has the nation's 15th-largest urban school district, for example. While politicians and pundits make much of vouchers, or school choice, Milwaukee is the only place in the country that actually has such a program.<p>

In 1991, an unusual coalition of supporters--Republican and Democrat, rich and poor-made the voucher program law. It allows up to 1.5 percent of Milwaukee's student population, about 1,500 students, to apply for slots at 12 private schools. For each student taken in, 830 this school year, the state pays $3,209 a year. The rest is paid by parents or through fund-raising.<p>

Howard Fuller, who was appointed superintendent of Milwaukee's public schools in 1991, revolutionized the system by allowing schools to control more of their funds. Before, the central administration had power over a school's entire budget. Now, it controls roughly 80 percent, and Fuller wanted to go further.<p>

"You have to break up the monopoly," Fuller said in a Business Week interview in mid-April. "All of the adults have been organized to protect their interests. You run into union contracts, board mandates, state mandates, and the tremendous intangible--the way it's always been done."<p>

But on April 18, Fuller abruptly resigned, angrily blaming ''powerful forces of the status quo" for impeding further progress. Unions fumed over proposals to close failing schools and start charter schools free of district control. The result: inertia.<p>

There are some bright spots, however. It is clear that parents want more control over their children's educational destinies. A virtual education revolution is taking place at the community level.<p>

Many parents, like Barry Brooks of the Texas Home School Coalition, have decided to educate their children at home --with a positive outcome. Others, like Vernon Robinson of the North Carolina Education Reform Foundation, have formed grassroots organizations to fight for the implementation of charter schools and vouchers Still others, like Jacqueline Joyner Cissell, are working with other parents in Indianapolis, Ind. to make sure parents' concerns are heard by administration officials.<p>

Brooks, Robinson and Cissell each tell their stories in this month' s edition of National Minority Politics.<p>

<h2>From the Publisher</h2>

<b>VOL. 7, NO. 7  JULY 1995</b>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>
<p>
<p>
The Alan Keyes story is one which deserves a closer look.  At the beginning of the campaign season, most political analysts said Keyes would have little, if any, impact on the republican presidential nomination.  But they may be wrong.<p>

Keyes is the most credible candidate in the GOP field on the pro-family issues.  In private conversations with Christian conservatives, both black and white,the Keyes candidacy is resonating.<p>

When we attend GOP seminars and confrences, many people approach us and say positive things about the former ambassador's message and the intensity of his delivery.  his appeal is his passion for the issues -- particularly the issue of abortion.  Keyes has likened abortion to the moral dilemma faced by Republicans in the mid-1800's regarding the issue of slavery.  For Keyes, the two issues are morally equivalent.<p>

In fact, many Republicans, without prompting, tell us they believe Keyes is the only candidate who deserves their vote.<p>

But Keyes does not have the family issues all to himself.  Senate Majority Leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole struck a chord in recent weeks when he attacked Time Warner, Inc. for the violence, filth and foolishness the corporation promotes through movies and music.<p>

Dole, who is perceived as a Johnny-come-lately to this issue, has nonetheless gotten a lot of ink and air time with his attacks on Hollywood, including front-page stories in <i>The New York Times, Washington Post</i> and other major media.  Television coverage of Dole lambasting Hollywood has been prolific as well, with all major networks running stories.  Even <i>Time</i> magazine, which Time-Warner owns, did a cover story on the controversy.<p>

Although Keyes has not specifically addressed the issue of cultural images perpeuated through the media, he has been the strongest voice concerning getting the nation back on a moral course.  The question Keyes campaign operatives must be asking themselves is "How can we get this initiative back from Dole?"  The media have decided to cover Dole's approach to this issue, rather than Keyes' approach to this issue, even though Keyes was out front on the moral issues from the start.<p>

It's part of the media's tendency to declare someone a front-runner and, as a result of the declaration, give that person the majority of the media coverage.  Thus, the media's prediction becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  In this era when the majority of voters receive their information on political candidates through the media in general, and via television in particular, how can a candidate break out of the pack if he or she receives no media coverage?<p>

Can Alan Keyes win?  Only those faithful to his campaign believe he has a chance of winning the nomination.  The two-time U.S. Senate candidate will have a tough time getting back on track, particularly if he cannot get back momentum from this major issue.<p>

But Keyes has one clar advantage and that is his oratorical skills.  Frankly, he is the best speaker in the entire pack of GOP presidential hopefuls.  Given the opportunity, he can outshine all the other candidates on the stump.  Winning the nomination may be a long shot, but he'll go far in winning the hearts and minds of conservative activists who dominate the Republican primary process.<p>
<p>

<li><a name="black"></a>Rep. J.C. Watts, one of two black Republican House members and a co-chairman of Senator Bob Dole's Republican presidential campaign, has accused the party of not trying harder to win over black voters.<p>
The freshman congressman, a former all-American college football star at the University of Oklahoma, said Apr. 23 that the party would never become the majority party unless it developed a strategy to get more black and minority voters.<P>
Blacks have overwhelmingly been supporting Democrats in modern elections.<P>
"I do believe to this day, that the Republican Party will never become the majority party until we regain our legacy as a party for minority Americans," Watts said.<P>
Watts, a congressman from Oklahoma, told the conservative Heritage Foundation in a speech and question and answer period, that the party is not doing enough on an "outreach" program to get minority voters.<P>
"There has to be a long-term, orchestrated, organized effort to say where do we want to be two years from now, where do we want to be four years ago, five years ago, ten years ago," he said.<P>
He said "we must have an organized outreach strategy by the RNC (Republican National Committee), and even the think tanks," he said.<P>
Watts said the party often presents "white papers" and other ideas on attracting minorities. "But we put forth no organized effort on outreach, none."<P>
Watts, who has one of the most conservative voting records in Congress, said the Republican Party reaches out to small business people even though some differ with the party.<P>
"Should we not do the same with the black community?" he said.<P>
He suggested a Republican outreach program should stress that Republican policies in Congress such as welfare reform and a balanced budget would help black Americans.<P>
The party should act now to get more blacks into the party, he said.  He estimated that only eight to 12 percent of blacks voted Republican in 1992 and said the goal should be improved to 15 to 18 percent this year, 19 to 25 percent in the year 2000 and 30 percent in eight years.<P>
There was no immediate response from a Republican Party spokesman to the speech from Watts, one of about one dozen co-chairmen of the Dole campaign.<P>

<li><a name="florida"></a>A federal court threw out Florida's 23 congressional boundaries Apr. 17, ruling that an Orlando-area district was illegally drawn to elect a black lawmaker.  The decision shook the state's political landscape and could threaten the only three black members of Congress elected from Florida this century.  <P>
"It took us 127 years for Florida to elect an African-American member of Congress, so this is just the beginning, not the end," said Rep. Corrine Brown (D).  In nullifying Brown's horseshoe-shaped, 14-county congressional district, the judges discarded Florida's entire congressional map.  <P>
In the majority decision, U.S. District Judges Maurice Paul and Roger Vinson concluded the 3rd congressional district cannot survive the present constitutional equal protection challenge.  But they cautioned, "This decision should not be interpreted as  turning back the clock' on the gains made by African-American voters."  The panel's only black judge, Joseph Hatchett, was the lone dissenter. <P>
The ruling ordered the Florida Legislature to draw new congressional districts by May 22, or the federal panel will create a new map for the 1996 elections.  Particularly difficult will be redrawing the 3rd congressional district, which touches six others.  The Central Florida Republicans who will will inherit part of Brown's district are Reps. Fowler (4th District), Stearns (6th District), Mica (7th District) and McCollum (8th District).  Brown will serve the remainder of her term, but will have to run in a new congressional district in November.  <P>
The ruling could force legislators to address the racial balance in at least two other districts.  The other congressional districts are currently represented by Alcee Hastings (D-23) and Carrie Meek (D-17). <P>

<li><a name="franks"></a>In a new book about his life and experiences on Capitol Hill, Rep. Gary Franks of Connecticut, who in 1990 became the first black Republican elected to the House in 58 years, writes, "For too long, the African-American community has been focused on how  we have been done wrong."<P>
But current and former Congressional Black Caucus members are furious at Franks' focus in his book on how he has "been done wrong" by black House Democrats allegedly angry with his conservative views, the Hartford Courant reported April 28.  "I was absolutely shocked and dismayed when I read the mischaracterizations," former Con-gressional Black Caucus Chairman Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., now the NAACP president, told the Courant after reading excerpts of the book.<P>
Rep. Earl Hilliard (D-Ala.) called Franks a "liar," and current CBC Chairman Donald Payne (D-N.J.) said, "I never saw any organized conspiracy against him."<P>
Throughout his book, Searching for the Promised Land: An African-American's Optimistic Odyssey, which is scheduled for publication in June, Franks offers a litany of slights by black House Democrats, even saying he was "shunned" and "blacklisted."<P>
Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) frequently moved away from him at CBC lunches, Franks contended, while Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.) once shouted insults in his face while they were on the House floor.  And on a bus ride to the Capitol from the White House, where the caucus had just met with President Clinton, Franks told how alone he felt.  "I truly felt like the invisible man of the old Jim Crow South," Franks wrote.  "I sat amidst a bus full of people who literally wished I would just disappear."<P>
Franks wrote that he positioned himself in the middle of the bus and "sure enough, when everybody had settled down, there was a cordon of empty seats around me."  Franks thought to himself, "How many black people had sat like this, shunned by their own people?"<P>
Mfume and Payne remembered no such shunning.  "I remember Gary getting on the bus and engaging in a give-and-take with other members, joking with them," Mfume told the Courant.  "It's hard to imagine he sat alone; we had 40 members and the bus was not that big."<P>
Franks also charged Mfume and other caucus members attempted to silence him during the meeting with Clinton.<P>
When he arrived to the House in 1991, Franks was an important ambassador from the CBC to then-President Bush, he wrote.  But CBC members' moods changed after the 1992 election, when more blacks were elected, and at the same time, the shape of some majority-black districts came under legal fire.<P>
Franks later testified in favor of challenges to the majority-black districts that were drawn to help elect several members of the CBC.  When he arrived to testify, Franks said Brown "turned and stared coldly into my eyes."<P>
Encounters with CBC members are a small part of Franks' book, which chronicles the 43-year-old's life.<P>
Franks has received a $100,000 advance, and under House rules can keep any royalties from the book's sale.  But he said he intends to give a portion of any royalties to nonprofit groups in Meriden and Waterbury, Conn.<P>
The Courant reported that many mentioned in the book disputed the accuracy of Franks' recollections. Franks, meanwhile, said he did not want to discuss his book at this time.  "He was never treated the way he said," said Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the senior CBC member.  Payne added, "Gary thinks people pay more attention to him than they really did."<P>
But Brown, whom Franks had accused of shunning him at the luncheons, said Franks was not too far off.  "I didn't want to sit by him," she said.  "I like to sit by people of kindred spirits."<P>

<li><a name="sex"></a>A bill backed by three Republican lawmakers would keep same-sex marriage from becoming legal whatever the outcome of a controversial gay-rights case in Hawaii.<P>
A draft of the bill being circulated among members of Congress would outlaw any future gay marriages by defining marriage as a "legal union between one man and one women" in federal law.<P>
The bill, titled the "Defense of Marriage Act," sponsored by Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) also would give states the authority to reject the legality of same-sex marriages performed in any other state.  Rep. Steven Largent (R-Okla.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) are listed as co-sponsors of the bill.<P>
"Is America willing to require businesses to have family benefits for homosexual couples," said Largent in a May 8 statement, "to have children taught in school that homosexual relationships are the moral equivalent of traditional marriage, and to endorse the adoption of children by homosexual couples?  Is America willing to go down that road?"<P>
The Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim, Calif.-based Traditional Values Coalition, said he helped draft the bill in response to a court case that could make Hawaii the first state to recognize gay marriages.<P>
"This is the beginning of a cultural meltdown if you have homosexual marriage sanctioned by the court," Sheldon said May 7.  "When the federal government says homosexuality is valid enough for marriage, then you are sending a message to the children, you're sending a message to the culture and you are about ready to move yourself into a serious cultural meltdown."<P>
Gary Bauer, President of the Family Research Council, agreed.  The Defense of Marriage Act "is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation to be considered in this or any year.  This is a cultural watershed," said Gary Bauer.  "Will America move to protect marriage--the foundation of civilization--or will America become the first nation to destroy marriage?  At stake is nothing less than the future of the nation and the well being of our children."<P>
The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in May 1993 that the denial of marriage licenses to three same-sex couples was discriminatory under the state's Equal Rights Amendment.  Limiting the right of marriage to heterosexuals can be justified only if the state can prove a "compelling government interest," the Hawaii court said.<P>
The state Supreme Court remanded the case to a lower court for a trial at which the state will try to show a compelling interest.<P>
This legally and politically explosive question has touched off legislative efforts in more than half the states to counter any Hawaiian sanction of same-sex marriages.<P>
Thirty-three state legislatures have taken up bills prohibiting same-sex marriage, and eight states have passed those measures into law.<P>
The bills have been defeated, withdrawn or killed in 17 states, and measures are still pending in eight more.<P>
"The heart of family life is marriage," Bauer said.  "It brings the two sexes together in a unique legal, social, economic and spiritual union--no other relationship provides society with the benefits that marriage does.  As we have drifted from the defense of marriage, we have experienced severe social and economic problems, and now, marriage is under attack as never before.  If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken, there is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault on marriage.  No civilization has ever introduced a counterfeit definition of marriage, and those who have allowed the family to be weakened have not survived.<P>

<b>The digirati needs to learn how
to make friends and
win influence in Washington.

<FONT FACE="Arial"> For months the path finders of Cyberspace
have been apoplectic about government censorship of the Internet.
  On-line discussion groups and computer magazines have filled
gigabytes of memory with words on how the heavy hand of government
is trying to smash the new frontier.  Countless conference panelists
have railed against the ignorance of Second Wave Congressmen who
have never even been on line.  The result of all this collective
frothing at the mouth:  Absolutely nothing!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> The computer industry forgot the old adage
that how you do things is just as important as what you do. To
the dismay of us all, the government will now determine the content
of Cyberspace.  To prevent future damage to the electronic frontier,
the digirati needs to learn better the ways of Washington.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> When President Clinton signed into law the
Communications Decency Act,  which criminalizes the transmission
and posting of indecent material on line, the Internet civil libertarians
observed a day of mourning for supposedly lost free speech by
turning black the background on their web pages.  This collective
act of protest was greeted, at best, with a yawn in Washington
and, at worst, with a collective &quot;Who cares if their web
pages are black?  The fools.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> How can a group of such bright people, who
by most accounts are building the future, have been so ineffective
in their bid to protect their nascent technology - through their
insularity and holier-than-thou attitude.  Walking into the office
of a Member of Congress or the Cabinet and saying &quot;You just
don't get it&quot; is not a way to quickly make friends and win
influence.  Flooding with e-mail the offices of those few Members
of Congress who actually are on-line demonstrated how small the
Internet constituency is.  (And e-mail is a lot easier to get
rid of than an envelope.)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> The doyens of Silicon Valley need to realize
that no matter how glorious the future of Cyberdemocracy, for
the foreseeable future it is in Washington and the state capitols
where policy is made. The crucial weakness of the entire computer
industry is that for the past decade it has not had much of a
presence in Washington, let alone state capitols (where the most
onerous taxes are passed).  Cyberspace may be a world unto itself,
but it exists in the real world, and unless its leaders engage
people in the real world, those in the real world will continue
to do bad things to the electronic frontier.  The forces for regulating
speech on the Internet are real; the forces against it are virtual.
 The real will win every time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> In Washington and state capitols, entrenched
Industrial Age interests still hold sway.  As Francis Fukuyama
notes:  &quot;By definition, sunrise industries do not yet exist
and therefore have no interest groups promoting them.  Sunset
industries, on the other hand, are often big employers and usually
have vocal and politically powerful proponents.&quot;  Many hackers
need to learn how to stop frightening lawmakers and start befriending
them.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">If the Information Age means anything, it means
we must view reality in new ways.  As such, a challenge: it would
behoove the civil libertarians of Cyberspace to recognize in their
perceived enemy a natural ally.  Many supposed &quot;right wing
Christians,&quot; who are rightly concerned about morality and
pornography, are just as fearful of an authoritarian government
(for impinging on their right to freely practice their faith).
 The digirati must make peace with this supposed enemy (but not
the true statists) by showing them it is no better to have government
regulation of chat-rooms than of pulpits. (In Washington, your
opponents on a particular issue may very well be your allies on
the next debate.)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are tried and true ways of building coalitions,
and the computer industry is beginning to learn them.  Many companies
and individuals are advising the new bi-partisan and bi-cameral
Congressional Internet Caucus.  Efforts by Representative Vern
Ehlers is to teach his fellow Members about Cyberspace are being
widely supported.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The battle over the Communications Decency
Act was lost, but valuable lessons for the war were learned: 
having a sustained presence on the field and building coalitions
with unusual allies.</FONT>

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.

Shaken by Supreme Court decisions they consider hostile,
civil rights activists spelled out a strategy June 30 for
fighting back.  A main goal: Energizing jaded masses of black
people to act in what civil rights leaders say is their own
interest.
<p>     
The NAACP is staging a "national voter empowerment campaign"
that seeks to mobilize black constituents in political districts
where they comprise at least 15 percent of eligible voters but
less than a majority.
<p>     
The effort, approved in advance, is the first grassroots
response to Thursday's Supreme Court decision that using race as
an overriding concern when drawing minority districts is
unconstitutional.
<p>     
"We have to turn this pain around," said NAACP lobbyist Ed
Hailes Jr.  "Our participation in democracy is being denied."  
<p>
     
The Supreme Court's ruling was the latest in a series by the
high court this year that black activists say have chipped away
at the hard-won gains of the 1960s civil rights movement.
<p>       
Earlier, the court also jeopardized many federal affirmative
action programs by saying Congress must abide by the same strict
anti-bias standards as state and local governments.  And the
justices made it easier for school systems to get out from under
federal supervision of school desegregation.
<p>     
"I can assure you, we won't go back," said Rep. Eddie
Bernice Johnson, a Democrat whose Texas district is under
challenge.  "We know how to vote.  And we will vote.  We do it
best when we have a reason to."
<p>     
As the redistricting decision came down, the National Urban
League canceled plans to hold its 1996 convention in Los Angeles. 
It is protesting California Gov. Pete Wilson's executive order
ending state affirmative action programs.
<p>     
The league, alarmed by the high court's affirmative action
decision, has made protecting such programs its rallying cry.  By
canceling the conference--and the revenue it would have generated
for the area--the league hopes to discourage other states from
following Wilson's lead, particularly in light of the court's
decision.
<p>     
"We're not going to just express our dismay.  We're going to
do something about it," said league president Hugh B. Price.
<p>     
The NAACP campaign, set to begin in mid-July, targets
congressional seats, mostly in Southern states where majority
black districts are in peril.  Black Democrats are being asked to
lobby their representatives and state legislators about
redistricting, Supreme Court appointments and endorsements in the
1996 presidential election.
<p>    
 According to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
12 million blacks live in 113 majority-white congressional
districts in 11 Southern states.  And they've pumped up their
rhetoric too. 
<p>     
"With that kind of concentration and ratio of voters, we can
have great influence," said Washington NAACP director Wade
Henderson, coordinator of the campaign.  "It's open season on
black Americans.  We've got to start rewarding our friends and
punishing our enemies."
<p>     
The program will act in concert with efforts by the
Congressional Black Caucus and civil rights groups to add up to 7
million blacks to voting rolls.  The caucus' campaign is an
"immediate response" to the Supreme Court's decision, said Rep.
Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.).
<p>     
The goal is to "register every unregistered person in this
country, state by state, district by district, neighborhood by
neighborhood," Mfume said.  "In no way should those persons on
the other side of this (Supreme Court) decision think they have a
safe haven."
<p>     
In addition to registering voters, the caucus is working
with Democratic Party officials to ensure that black Democratic
incumbents will have their party's backing.
<p>     
"We will fight so that justice will reign in this country in
spite of the Supreme Court," said Rep. Donald Payne, (D-N.J.),
chairman of the caucus.
<p>     
But blacks who share a more conservative view say they also
have something to prove.  If conservatives say blacks can get
elected without the benefit of specially-carved out seats, they
must demonstrate this can, in fact, become a reality by getting
more mainstream minority candidates elected in 1996.  Thus, the
crucial work to be to recruit attractive conservative candidates
to run between now and then, probably as Republicans, but not
necessarily exclusively.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="Fletcher"></a>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
Arthur Fletcher, a Republican member of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, joined the 1996 presidential race July 7 urging his
party not to abandon minorities and the working class.  He is the
second black candidate to enter the race for the GOP nomination.
<p>
Fletcher, a strong advocate of affirmative action, said, "My
party has designed a top-down strategy, which says the wealthy,
the rich, the affluent belong to this party.  Anybody that
doesn't earn $35,000 a year is out of the equation."
<p>     
"It's time to stop that and say there's room for anybody who
wants to participate in the Republican Party."
<p>     
He announced his candidacy at a news conference in the
economically depressed Anacostia area of Washington.
Fletcher, who is black, has been promoting affirmative action
programs since the Nixon administration when he was a Labor
Department official.  Since then, three Republican presidents--Ford, Reagan and Bush--have appointed him to the U.S. Commission
of Civil Rights, which he chaired from 1990 to 1993.  He is 70
years old.
<p>     
He opined that GOP presidential candidates already in the
race must pander to the right wing in ways that threaten gains
made in civil rights since the 1960s.
<p>     
"There's not a ghost of a chance of their being nominated. 
Unless they engage in the race-baiting, gender-bashing tactics of
the moment," Fletcher said.
<p>     
"My concern, more than anything else, is to see to it that
the party doesn't completely end up abandoning the middle, where
the majority of the voters live, in pursuit of the nomination,"
he added.
<p>     
Fletcher first entered Republican politics in Kansas and was
vice chairman of the state GOP from 1955-57.
<p>     
In 1969, while working in Nixon's Labor Department, he
helped implement the "revised Philadelphia plan" that set and
enforced equal opportunity employment standards for companies
with federal contracts.
<p>     
He said he would finance his campaign largely by appealing
to minorities and women to send $5 contributions to his
headquarters in Kansas City, KS.
<p>     
His slogan: "Send five and keep affirmative action alive." 
With that money, Fletcher said he intends to lease a bus to
recreate the "Freedom Rides" of the 1960s to get his message out.
<p>     
"I will not be a high-flying, expensive candidate.  I'm
going to make sure the small people know I am their candidate,"
Fletcher said. 
<p>     
The former commissioner will likely have a tough time
getting press coverage and support from his fellow Republicans. 
The constituency for Fletcher's pet issues is so small within the
GOP that his candidacy is merely symbolic, at best.
<p>

<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
A new think tank recently opened in the nation's capitol to
promote self-help initiatives among black Americans.  The Center
for New Black Leadership commenced operation in Washington, D.C.
on May 1, 1995.  The Center is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think
tank devoted to reviving and encouraging traditionally effective
solutions to social and economic problems confronting the black
community.  The Center will work to encourage the development of
sound ideas and institutions consistent with the black
community's long-held commitments to individual initiative and
personal responsibility.
<p>     
The leadership of the Center consists of Directors Peter
Bell of TCF Financial Corp. in Minneapolis; Glenn Loury of Boston
University; Roy Innis of the Congress for Racial Equality;
Phyllis Berry Myers of Black America's PAC; and Shelby Steele of
the Hoover Institution.  The President of the Center is Brian W.
Jones.
<p>     
Jones is hopeful that the Center's work will perform a
function complementary to the work of the many conservative
grassroots and political organizations laboring in the black
community.  "Our goal," says Jones, "is to provide an
intellectual framework for the work of these other organizations. 
By providing a thoughtful defense of conservative ideas in the
black community, we can ensure the long-term viability of the
essential grassroots efforts already under way."
<p>    
Inquiries about the Center for New Black Leadership should
be directed to Brian W. Jones at 733 15th Street, N.W., Suite
700, Washington, D.C. 20005.  The Center's telephone number is
(202) 638-0651.

<a name="Bacon"></a>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
Congress can fight racial discrimination in the construction
industry and save billions of tax dollars by repealing the Davis-Bacon Act, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>
"This Depression-era law protects racial discrimination in
the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of
dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special
interests," says Mark Wilson, Heritage's Rebecca Lukens fellow in
labor policy.
<p>     
The 1931 law requires contractors working on federally
funded construction projects to pay workers "prevailing wages"
that are defined by the U.S. Department of Labor.  Through Davis-Bacon, the Labor Department also imposes costly and inflexible
job classification and apprenticeship regulations on contractors
seeking federal construction projects.
<p>     
"Ever since its adoption, Davis-Bacon has led to
discrimination against minorities in the construction industry,"
Wilson says.  The law has thus protected unions against
competition from outside non-unionized contractors using lower-cost itinerant labor, typically black workers from the South and
immigrants," says the former Labor Department economist.
<p>     
The result: Despite three decades of federally required
reverse discrimination and minority set-asides, black workers
still make up only 6.4 percent of the workers in the construction
industry.  By comparison, blacks make up 10.4 percent of the
total workforce.
<p>     
Black-owned firms are also kept out of federal construction
projects by Davis-Bacon, Wilson says.  "Few minority-owned firms
win Davis-Bacon contracts, and many give up trying because they
are less able to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates," he says.
<p>
Citing Congressional Budget Office estimates, Wilson says
Davis-Bacon costs taxpayers as much as $5.3 billion annually by
inflating labor costs on federally financed building projects. 
In Oakland, Calif., for example, carpenters are paid $28 per hour
on federally funded projects, compared to $15 per hour in that
city's private sector, Wilson says.
<p>     
Davis-Bacon repeal would also "free up an estimated 5
million labor hours per year that contractors now must spend
completing weekly payroll requirements that Labor Department
bureaucrats admit they ignore," Wilson says.  The cost of this
needless federal paperwork is passed on to taxpayers by the
contractor, he says.
<p>     
The only groups supporting Davis-Bacon are "building and
construction trade unions and their allies in Congress and the
Clinton administration," Wilson says.  "But Congress should be
looking out for the interests of taxpayers and all workers, not
just those who gain from the restrictive law," he says.

<img  src="red-line.gif">
<p>
When we look at the educational mess in which we find ourselves, it can clearly be traced back to the interference of politicians and liberal social theorists. For the past 30 years, these pols and academicians have focused more on racial integration, multicultural diversity, and boosting self-esteem than they have on improving academic performance in our nation's public schools. As a result, academic standards, test scores and achievement ale lower and per-pupil costs have skyrocketed.<p>

Much of the focus on the failures of public education have concentrated on inner-city schools. But suburban schools have most of the same problems, although perhaps not quite as visible to the public eye. The one advantage suburban schools have ova those in urban areas is parental involvement. Because most suburban children come from two-parent families, at least one parent is available to participate in school activities, help with homework and consult with teachers and principals.<p>

It would seem that if more parental involvement is good for students, the public school system would welcome innovative ideas which would increase parental control and choice. However, the system has self-preservation as its primary objective, rather than educating students. That's the reason for all the hand-wringing whenever options like home schooling, charter schools and school choice are proposed.<p>

Teachers' unions and organized groups, like the National Education Association, spend millions to lobby (read arm-twist) state legislatures to maintain the status quo. Some even label efforts to change the way we educate our students as racist. In the state of Texas, for example, one of our state representatives said on the floor of the legislature that home-rule will resegregate the state's school system.<p>

Has he been to a Texas public school lately (or to any other school in the U.S., for that matter)? They're already re-segregated.<p>

My first concern, as is the concern of the overwhelming majority of American parents, is not who their child sits beside in the classroom, but whether or not their child is learning basic skills to be successful in adult life.<p>

My second concern is that all students be ready to take advantage of the new opportunities a good education will provide, as we prepare to compete internationally with compares in Europe and the Pacific Rim.<p>

Some wonder why Asian students (both in America and in Asia) tend to perform m better on standardized tests than do Americans. Could it be that Asian parents exercise more control over their children's academic performance, and place more significance on education?<p>

We Americans tend to place a great deal of emphasis on sport perhaps much more than is warranted All we have to do is observe the interest in this month's National Basketball Association playoffs. There are basketball courts in nearly every residential neighborhood and most evenings, when the weather cooperates, we see young men "hooping" on the courts. I wonder if they spend the same amount of time studying as they do sharpening their dunking skills?<p>

I encourage parents to instill in their children the idea that one can be a good athlete <b><i>and</i></b> a superior student.<p>

Hollywood and television are permeated with class, racial, gender, religious and other biases.  The more
time people spend watching television and movies, the more their impressions of the world seem to resemble
those of the self-created world of the media.<p>

     Stereotyping of blacks in the media is fairly well-known, although still influential in shaping images. 
Blacks are usually portrayed in films as either crooks, pimps, informers or persons needing assistance from the
government.  Television is not much better.<p>  

     In fact, in a book by Michael Parenti titled Make-Believe Media, the author describes black shows as
being slanted "toward the ridiculous with no redeeming counter-images."<p>

     And there are subtle alterations in these images.  As Parenti notes, when blacks are portrayed as
criminals, they often have leading roles.  When portrayed as police, they are more often in subsidiary roles.  "For
a while," writes Parenti of films in the 1980s, "no African-American male could survive to the end of a film."<p>

     While the stereotyping of blacks in Hollywood is rather obvious, the stereotyping of families and
Christians is not as easy to detect, but is harmful nonetheless.  Television programming and movies in the 1950s,
1960s and even 1970s more often included a nuclear family with father, mother and children fully aware of their
respective roles.  Adultery was depicted at a minimum and, usually, the guilty party suffered the consequences of
his or her actions.<p>

     Now it seems that the nuclear family is the exception, rather than the rule, in Hollywood.  I personally
have not watched sitcoms and the bulk of prime-time television in nearly 20 years, because I find it too shallow
for my taste.<p>

     But I have it on good authority that prime-time television today, with its loveless sex and misplaced
values, have had a deleterious effect on our culture.  Programs like ABC's "Roseanne" flaunt time-honored
values by putting a positive spin on homosexuality, premarital sex, illegitimacy, parental disrespect and anti-Christian bigotry.  Another ABC show, "My So-Called Life," focuses on life through the eyes of a 15-year-old
girl with a bisexual pal.  FOX programs "Married With Children" and "Martin" are risque with steamy sexually
themed storylines.<p>

     Daytime television is even worse as the programming line-up consists primarily of soap-operas with
virtually no happily married couples and sexual promiscuity run amok, along with sleazy talk shows which leave
nothing to privacy.<P>

     And media attack anyone who objects to the values--or lack thereof--they promote to our children as
right-wing, extreme, mean-spirited or dangerous.  Remember Dan Quayle?<P>

     Those of us who care about media stereotyping need to let our voices be heard.  Selective buying
campaigns and boycotting advertisers are one way to get Hollywood's attention.  But we need to take it a step
further.  We must develop our own media and promote positive images of ourselves.  Only then can we bring

<h2>The fall campaign</h2>
</center>
<P>
In the final months of the campaign, there are certain orienting
landmarks--the Labor Day kick-off, September debate negotiations,
the debates themselves, and the grueling last-ditch effort as
the candidates strive for those few additional votes.  While the
candidates seem to be ricocheting around the country in no particular
pattern, the distribution of campaign resources is determined
by <b>electoral math</b>.  
<P>
<center><a href="fall.jpg"><img src="fall.gif" alt="Timeline" border="0"></a></center>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As outlined in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, the
president is chosen not by direct popular vote, but by electors
from each state.  A state has a number of electors equal to its
number of congressmen and senators.  (The District of Columbia
also has three electors, bringing the total to 538.)  In most
states, the popular vote winner takes all the electors.  For example,
even if a candidate wins California by a margin of less than 1
percent, he will gain all of the state's 54 electors.  Thus the
campaigns' strategies revolve around winning states that will
add up to a minimum of 270 electoral votes.  Some are seen as
pretty sure bets, some are tightly contested &quot;play-hard&quot;
states, some are possibles, and some are essentially unwinnable.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The campaigns are not only targeting particular states, but they
are trying to reach particular people within those states.  A
general election campaign is a battle for the attention of a relatively
small audience.  The rule of thumb in presidential campaigns is
that about 40 percent of those who turn out will vote for the
Republican candidate no matter what and another 40 percent will
vote Democratic no matter what.  Major resources during the fall
campaign are devoted to reaching and swaying the remaining 20
percent of the electorate--persuadable swing voters.  
<P>
<ul>
<b>Group A  </b><br>      
<ul>Will vote for the candidate almost automatically.  </ul>  
<P>
<b>Group B</b><br>
<ul>Will not vote for the candidate no matter what.</ul>
<P>
<B>Group C</B>
<ul>Swing voters; can be persuaded.
</ul></ul><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politicians think of the electorate in terms of three groups.
 The first group will vote for their candidate almost automatically.
 The second group will not vote for their candidate no matter
what.  The third group are swing voters.  This model can also
be applied to races with many candidates; for example Group A
could be Perot, Bush, or Clinton backers.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To attract the persuadables, candidates generally move toward
the middle, toning down the more extreme elements of their messages
that they had used to appeal to party activists during the primaries.
 They may run television spots and concentrate media efforts in
media markets with large numbers of persuadable voters.  The ads
one sees in this time are designed primarily to influence people
who have not made up their minds.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Extensive resources are devoted to persuadable voters, but the
candidate's base (Group A) must be mobilized as well.  Some supporters
may need a bit of a nudge to get them out to the polls.  By narrowcasting
specific parts of the candidate's message to constituency groups,
the campaign can energize these people.  Then, as Election Day
approaches, get-out-the-vote efforts gear up to produce a big
turnout.
<p>
In 1994 and 1995, there was much speculation that one or more
credible independent or third-party candidates might emerge to
challenge the Democratic and Republican nominees.  Among those
mentioned were Colin Powell, Bill Bradley, Jesse Jackson, Lowell
Weicker, and Ross Perot.  Libertarians were also optimistic that
the ongoing reexamination of government would give their candidate
a boost.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The presence of a credible alternative to the major party candidates
adds a degree of uncertainty to the race, causing people to reassess
their support and increasing the competition for swing voters.
 Regardless of the number of candidates, the goal of each campaign
remains the same: go after the undecideds and mobilize supporters.

<h2>Debates</h2>
<small><a href="#points">Points to consider when watching a debate</a></small>
</center>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest event of the fall campaign is the series of
nationally televised presidential debates.  These first occurred
between Nixon and Kennedy in 1960, and they have been regular
fixtures since the Ford-Carter exchanges in 1976.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While there is no requirement that the presidential candidates
meet, debates in the fall are almost inevitable because it will
likely harm a candidate if he or she is seen to be blocking them.
 The campaigns have the final word when it comes to the debates.
 Much posturing and intense negotiations take place as each campaign
strives to achieve the most favorable format and schedule.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the campaigns set the terms, there are other interested
parties.  First, there is the public.  How meaningful the debates
will be depends heavily on the rules arrived at through the campaigns'
negotiations.  A debate can reveal the candidates' positions and
their differences, or it can devolve into a scripted exercise
bordering on &quot;a joint press conference.&quot;  In 1992 the
Bush and Clinton camps agreed to allow Ross Perot to participate
in the debates, but the Libertarian candidate, who had qualified
for the ballot in all fifty states, was excluded.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nonprofit Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), established
in 1987, has emerged as the organizer of general election debates.
 The Commission is co-chaired by former heads of the Democratic
and Republican parties and is thus open to criticism.  Former
Rep. Tim Penny described it as &quot;a creature of the two major
parties.&quot;  In addition to the CPD, the networks and the League
of Women Voters have put forth credible debate proposals in recent
presidential elections.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any event, the debates are high-stakes events.  Voters who
have not yet made up their minds can be won and lost depending
on what transpires.  The drama of direct confrontation attracts
an immense television audience.  In 1992, viewership for the three
presidential debates ranged from 85-97 million, and the vice-presidential
debate attracted 74 million viewers.

 <H3>Points to consider when watching a debate:</H3>
<P>
<ul><li>First, listen to the moderator explaining the format at
the outset of the debate.
<P>
<li>Who is the debate sponsor?
<P>
<li>Who is on the stage and who isn't; what criteria were used
to select participating candidates?
<P>
<li>Who asks the questions?  Is there a single moderator or
a panel?  Are the questioners network anchors, more obscure journalists,
non-journalists or even members of the audience?
<P>
<li>Is there a live audience and, if so, who is in it?  A live
audience and interruptions for applause can significantly change
the tempo of a debate.
<P>
<li>Is the subject matter confined to one area such as the economy,
or is it less focussed?
<P>
<li>What is the time limit, if any, on candidate responses and
rebuttals?  From one to two minutes is common.
<P>
<li>Is the set unobtrusive or does it distract?  What camera
angles are used and what are the most frequent shots?
<P>
<li>At the end of the debate, before the commentators tell you
what happened, write down your impressions.  What in your view
were the key moments and why were they important?  
<P>
<li>Finally, see how the media cover the debate, both in immediate
post-debate commentary and later in broadcast and print news.
 Frequent aspects of coverage are &quot;who won&quot; discussions
and reactions from voters.

<h2>What makes a president</h2>
</center>
<P>
A presidential election is a defining moment for the nation. 
At the outset, a dozen or so hopefuls may offer themselves to
the voters as leadership material.  Only one will emerge as each
party's nominee.  A unique set of qualities and traits, in tandem
with a fortuitous unfolding of events, allows a successful candidate
to make the leap from the crowd.
<P>
<b>Leadership</b><br>
<ul>
Leadership entails not only setting a direction but possessing
the skills to see to it that one's ideas are implemented.  In
The Prince, Machiavelli wrote, &quot;There is nothing so perilous
in its outcome nor uncertain in its success as the introduction
of a new order of things.&quot;  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Choosing a president is a personal decision.  In general, our
assessments of a candidate's character figure prominently.  Is
the candidate independent, arrogant, flaky, courageous?  Character
questions go to a deep level, beyond ideology or positions on
issues.  For this reason, campaigns often seek to raise doubts
about an opponent's character.  (&quot;Do I trust this guy?&quot;
 &quot;Is he stable?&quot;)
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Deutsch, a public communication analyst in Northern Virginia,
states that a candidate must convey three attributes at the same
time.  Familiarity means we perceive the candidate is like us.
 Appeasement means we feel the candidate cares for us as individuals.
 Power means we see the candidate as being more than any one ordinary
person; he or she is somehow in control of events.  Applying these
simple criteria, one can get a good idea of how a candidate will
fare regardless of what the public opinion polls of the moment
are saying.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thinking back to 1992, for example, Bill Clinton probably fulfilled
the above criteria better than George Bush.  Bush was portrayed
as being somewhat out of touch with ordinary Americans; an example
was the widely reported incident of the supermarket scanner. 
As for appeasement, there are numerous stories of Clinton's ability
to listen to people and ask thoughtful questions.  In terms of
being more than an ordinary individual, during the course of his
bus tours Clinton met with thousands of people and gained a unique
understanding of the nation.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Ideology counts</b>
<P>
<ul>
An ideology provides a consistent framework for addressing the
broad spectrum of issues.  Some of the candidates have clearly
discernable ideologies or political philosophies, while others
rely more on polls and behave more as opportunists.  Ideology
may be more important during the primaries, when people are choosing
among a bevy of candidates, than in the general election when
leadership attributes are particularly important.
</ul><P>
<center><h3>Who wins?</h3></center>
<P>
There have been numerous instances of candidates who have been
built up prior to the campaign failing to do well (John Glenn
in 1984 or Gary Hart in 1988).  Other candidates are much admired
but fail to get through the primaries (Bruce Babbitt in 1988 or
Paul Tsongas in 1992).  Rather than referring to another mindless
poll, think about some of the factors at work:
<P>
<ul><li><b>Television</b> has elevated the importance of external appearances.
 Historically, a candidate's physical appearance may have made
some difference; for example it is recognized that taller candidates
may have an advantage.  In the television era, a candidate's <a href="images.html">ability
to perform well on the medium of television</a> is fundamental to
his or her political success.  The candidate must have no &quot;edges&quot;
that will jar viewers.  In 1992, for example, Bush often appeared
ill-at-ease, while Clinton moved around with the ease of a television
show host.
<P>
<li><a href="process.html"><b>The nominating process itself</b></a>, while designed to be neutral, does
favor certain types of candidates.  For example, some potentially
solid candidates are discouraged from running by fundraising demands.
 It is true that all the candidates must play by the same rules,
but one can see that different rules would produce different outcomes.
 A closely grouped succession of primaries requires that a candidate
run an expensive media campaign.  Caucuses, by contrast, tend
to favor candidates who can organize at the grassroots.  
<P>
<li><b>Incumbency</b> can be an advantage for the president both in terms
of symbolism and concrete actions.  An incumbent president has
an edge in conforming to one's internal image of a leader because
he is surrounded by the trappings of office.  He arrives on Air
Force I, he gets &quot;Hail to the Chief,&quot; and he speaks
from a lectern with the presidential seal on it.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The incumbent can also take steps during the campaign to &quot;buy&quot;
support.  For example, in 1992, at the beginning of September,
President Bush announced an increase in subsidies for wheat exports
and the sale of 150 F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan.  These and
other actions caused Detroit News writer James Gannon to label
him &quot;a flying fountain of federal aid&quot; and the Washington
Post to compare him to &quot;a department store Santa Claus in
December.&quot;  Incumbency has a downside too.  After a party
has been in power for a number of years, it may grow complacent
or be afflicted by various scandals; people start thinking about
change.
<P>
<li><b><a href="context.html">The historical and economic context</b></a> in which an election campaign
is fought has an important effect on the outcome.  Had communism
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union not collapsed during the
Bush tenure, the dynamics of the 1992 campaign might have been
very different.  Coinciding with the end of the Soviet threat,
the Clinton-Gore ticket presented voters with the question of
whether they were ready for a younger generation of leadership.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The state of the economy is particularly significant.  Ray Fair,
a professor at Yale University, has even developed an equation
that &quot;explains votes for president [in the general election]
on the basis of economic conditions at the time of the election.&quot;
 Fair writes, &quot;The two economic variables that seem most
important are the growth rate of real per capita GNP in the six-month
period prior to the election and the rate of inflation in the
two-year period prior to the election.&quot;  In the 1992 campaign,
lackluster economic performance in Bush's term clearly undercut
his re-election bid.
<P>
<li>With the historical and economic context and the candidates set,
<b><a href="genl.html">a well-run campaign</a></b> can also make some difference in the outcome
of an election.  A good campaign organization sets the agenda
and the terms of debate.  The 1992 contest was not about foreign
policy--Bush's terrain--but revolved around the domestic economy,
as in, &quot;It's the economy, stupid.&quot;  Exactly how much
of an effect a campaign can have is a much-debated point, but
most observers agree that Bush's campaign was poorly managed,
while Clinton's team avoided the mistakes of past Democratic efforts.
<P>
<li>Finally, there is always the <b>element of chance</b>.  The best-laid
plans, the most careful positioning, and the soundest campaign
organization can all be knocked awry by an unexpected event.

<P>
<h2>The Process</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>Candidates</b>  
<ul>More than 150 candidates have registered with the
Federal Election Commission to run for president.  The pack of
presidential hopefuls presents a wide range of experience and
motivations.  Some have served in politics for more than thirty
years; others have never run for public office.  Some have a well-defined
political philosophy, others are more pragmatic, and still others
may be running to draw attention to a single issue.  Some are
able to raise tens of millions of dollars and build elaborate
campaign organizations, while others have put up a few thousand
dollars to run a campaign out of their own homes.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To actually appear on a ballot in a particular state, however,
a candidate must meet that state's criteria.  Ballot access rules
vary from state to state.  New York's rules were among the most
restrictive.  To fully compete in the New York Republican presidential
primary, a candidate had to obtain 1,250 signatures from each
of the state's 31 congressional districts (a few districts needed
less than 1,250).  In itself the task of getting 30,000 signatures
would be a straightforward proposition, but the party had arcane
rules that allowed petitions to be disqualified for the most minor
infractions.  By contrast, New Hampshire requires candidates to
file a declaration of candidacy &quot;not more than 74 nor less
than 60 days before the presidential primary&quot; and to pay
a fee of $1,000.  Candidates also need to provide information
on their delegates and alternates.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some individuals, whom the media have identified as &quot;presidential
material,&quot; survey the political landscape and decide not
to run, whether for family reasons, because they feel they do
not have the &quot;fire in the belly,&quot; or because they do
not feel they can meet fundraising demands.  These figures of
speculation often attract as much attention as declared candidates.
 Those who do decide to run announce their bids and set about
raising money and positioning themselves for the intense primary
period.</ul>
<P>
 
<P>
<b><a href="iowanh.html">Primaries and Caucuses.</a></b>  
<ul>While there are a range of political
parties to choose from, the two-party system is a solid feature
of American politics.  The Republican and Democratic parties,
by virtue of tradition and their vast resources, dominate the
presidential selection process.  From February to June, state
Republican and Democratic parties conduct primaries or caucuses
to select delegates to the national nominating conventions. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The series of presidential preference primaries and caucuses has
an almost circus-like air as the candidates race from state to
state trying to gain the attention of the media, pick up momentum
and win delegates.  Caucuses are a multi-step process for choosing
delegates that starts with meetings at the precinct level and
leads up to a state convention.  The caucus system is mostly confined
to smaller states and places a premium on grassroots organizing.
 In primaries, by contrast, the campaign has a media-intensive
orientation and delegates are distributed according to popular
vote.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Caucuses formerly were the dominant method of selecting delegates,
but the primary has come into increasing favor over the past two-and-a-half
decades as the parties have sought to open up the process.  Turnout
in primaries tends to well below 50 percent of eligible voters.
Caucuses, because they are more time-consuming, attract only the
most active party members.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In order to vote in a party's preference primary or participate
in a caucus one must be a registered voter.  Frequently one must
also be registered as member of the party.  Registering to vote
is a simple procedure, although each state's rules vary somewhat.
 In general a person must fill out a form stating that he or she
is a United States citizen, is 18 years or older and has a permanent
home in the locality in which he or she wishes to vote.  Some
states require that a person choose a party; others do not.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chaotic primary system is uniquely American; in most other
countries the parties choose their leaders in a closed process.
 As Republicans and Democrats grab the media spotlight, smaller,
third parties are also choosing their nominees.  Finally, a candidate
can run as an independent, bypassing the party route altogether
and qualifying for the November ballot by petitioning to get on
the ballot.  While Ross Perot did this in 1992, tremendous resources
were needed to make it happen in all fifty states. 
</ul><P>
 
<P>
<b><a href="conv.html">Conventions</a></b>  
<ul>During two separate weeks in August, delegates gather
at the Republican and Democratic national conventions to choose
the parties' nominees.  Conventions formerly served as decision-making
bodies, but in recent decades the outcomes have been a foregone
conclusion.  The convention allows the party to present its ticket
to the national television audience and is in a sense a giant
ad for the party.  The convention also approves the party platform.
</ul><P>
<b><a href="elect.html">Election Day</a></b>
<ul>Fresh from the conventions, the Democratic and
Republican nominees enter the second phase of the election--the
fall campaign.  They are joined by third party and independent
candidates who, despite their best efforts, are generally marginalized.
 Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican candidates crisscross
the country focusing their resources on winnable states that will
enable them to reach the required 270 electoral votes.  The campaigns
each spend tens of millions of dollars on advertising campaigns.
 A series of high-stakes presidential and vice-presidential debates
and efforts to mobilize supporters (Get Out The Vote) lead up
to Election Day.  As provided for by Article II of the Constitution,
Congress has set Election Day as the first Tuesday following the
first Monday of November.
</ul><P>
<b>The Electoral College</b>  
<ul>One of the most misunderstood features
of American presidential elections is the Electoral College. 
The President is not selected by direct popular vote.  On Election
Day, when a voter chooses a particular candidate, he or she is
actually voting for that candidate's electors.  The Electoral
College system, although decried by many as an anachronism, is
prescribed by the Constitution.  Each state has a number of electors
equal to its number of Senators and Representatives and the District
of Columbia has three for a total of 538.  The electors meet about
a month after the election in the 50 state capitols.  In most
states they are bound to vote in a bloc for the popular vote winner.
 Only when the results of Electoral College voting are transmitted
to the President of the Senate and one of the candidates has achieved
a majority (270), does the outcome of the election become official.

<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A comparable situation would be if, in the election of a student
body president, each class had a number of representatives based
on its size--say one for every seven people.  The class would
vote, and the results would be tallied.  If Joe Smith won, all
of the class representatives or electors would be committed to
Smith.  They would meet a month later at the teacher's desk and
vote for Smith.  The results from each class would be then transmitted
to the Vice Principal's office and counted to determine the new
president.
</ul><P>
 
<P>
<b><a href="trans.html">Seal</a></b>  
<ul>Despite the Electoral College procedure, it is almost always
clear from the popular vote count who has won the election.  In
the transition period, the winning candidate, now the President-elect,
shifts from campaign mode to shaping the new administration. 
Elaborate festivities build up to Inauguration Day, which is set
by the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution on the 20th day
of January.  The swearing-in ceremony completes the transfer of
power and the new (or second-term) administration is underway.
 The election process is complete--except for the analyses which
will go on for several years more.  Those who are thinking about
running in the year 2000 start to engage in a few preliminary
musings!

<center>
<a href="http://www.virtent.com"><img src="votelogo.gif" border="0"></a>

<P>
<h2>Context</h2>
</center>
<P>
The historical context in which an election occurs is as important
as the qualities of the candidates and the rules of the nominating
process in determining its outcome.  In 1992 for example, the
end of the Cold War tilted the playing field away from George
Bush, the candidate with recognized foreign policy experience.

<P>
A number of factors will set the context for the 1996 campaign.
<ul>
<li>The <b>state of the economy</b> is always at the forefront in presidential
elections.  People vote their pocketbooks, and if the economy
is strong a plurality may well opt to re-elect President Clinton
regardless of any qualms they may have about his character.  
<P><li>The year-long debate over the Clinton health care plan and the
subsequent Republican surge in the 1994 midterm elections have
led to a thorough re-examination of <b>the proper role of the federal
government</b>, what some are terming &quot;the second American revolution.&quot;
 If not a revolution, the conservative advances certainly suggest
a major realignment.  The welfare state and programs instituted
by Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s are undergoing thorough scrutiny.
<br>
<P><li><b>The 1994 elections</b> gave Republicans control of both the House
and Senate for the first time in 40 years.  After November 1994,
Republicans held thirty governorships, including eight of the
nine biggest states (only Florida withstood the tide) and the
key Mideastern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.  From
a narrow political point of view, the Republican wins have expanded
the friendly territory available to the Republican presidential
nominee during the fall campaign.  
<br>
<P><li>The <b>discontent</b> that first emerged in the electorate during the
1990 elections does not appear to be dissipating as a result of
the activities of the Republican Congress.  Inaction on matters
such as term limits and campaign finance reform and underlying
uncertainties about economic security may remain.  Voter frustration
could turn against the Republican Congress, be channeled into
a third party or independent presidential candidacy, spark renewed
local activism, or manifest itself in ways as yet unseen.
<P><li>Surface political currents should not obscure some of the <b>deeper
issues</b> facing society.  Widely differing perceptions of the O.
J. Simpson trial and the October 1995 Million Man March on Washington
showed that substantial work remains to be done to improve race
relations in this country.  Others have expressed more general
concerns about community.  In a much-discussed article &quot;Bowling
Alone,&quot; Robert Putnam drew attention to decreasing levels
of individual participation and involvement. 

<P><li>Half a dozen years into the post-Cold War era, <b>foreign
policy and national security issues</b> appear to have lessened in
importance.  Unrest in Bosnia, China, and some of the states of
the former Soviet Union could again move these concerns to the
fore.  And, in an increasingly interconnected world, less conventional
threats including terrorism, man-made mishaps, and global environmental
problems cannot be ignored.
<P><li>America finds itself in the midst of the <b>Information Revolution</b>.
 E-mail allows us to stay in touch with family and friends and
the World Wide Web provides instant access to material on everything
from phylogenetics to political candidates.  Yet while we are
connected to all this information, there is at times a sense of
disconnection.  More than fifty years after the end of World War
II, heading into a new millennium, many voters believe it's time
to overhaul some of the institutions and ways of doing things
that have evolved in these past decades.  In this context, then,
the candidates will offer their prescriptions and the 1996 campaign
will unfold.

<h2>Pre-primary period</h2>
</center>

<P>
In a sense, following developments in the pre-primary period is
like watching athletes do their warm-up exercises before a race.
 There is a lot of speculation, and one can make some useful observations,
but there is no telling what will happen when the candidates face
real voters.
<P>
The 1992 campaign did not get fully underway until September 1991
because President Bush's popularity after the Gulf War deterred
most Democrats from making a move.  For 1996 the situation is
quite different.  President Clinton's perceived weakness and the
frontloading of the primary schedule prompted many Republican
candidates to start their activities within a few months of the
1994 mid-term elections.  Republican challengers will have had
about half a year longer to build their organizations, raise money,
and hone their messages than did their Democratic counterparts
in 1992.  
<P>
<center><a href="preprim1.jpg"><img src="preprim1.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
The first step in launching a presidential bid is &quot;testing
the waters.&quot;  The potential candidate talks with friends
and colleagues, seeks advice from a number of sources, makes some
thoughtful speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire, and gauges the
reaction.  He or she weighs current responsibilities and the prospects
of success (winning the nomination or shaping the debate) against
the toll a campaign will take on his or her personal life.  At
this point some decide to bow out.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those who decide to proceed and want to start <a href="financ.html">raising and
spending money</a>, the next step is to establish an exploratory committee
or file a statement of candidacy.  During this time, the candidate
will have a detailed plan drawn up that outlines his or her strengths,
weaknesses, and strategy.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The announcement speech or announcement tour is one of the most
symbolic events of the campaign.  In a carefully selected location
before a carefully prepared backdrop, helped along by crowds of
cheering supporters, the candidate launches his or her quest.
 Announcement speeches are typically replete with references to
family, God, and country.  The candidate presents his or her vision
of the country's problems and its future.  Oftentimes footage
shot at the announcement speech will appear in campaign videos
or ads.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the next six months to a year, the candidates are out making
the rounds at various party gatherings, seeking support from activists,
holding fundraising events, and working to generate favorable
media coverage.  Aside from activists and political reporters,
however, most people are paying scant attention. 
<P>
<center><a href="preprim2.jpg"><img src="preprim2.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
The major challenge candidates face in the pre-primary period
is to establish <B>credibility</B>.  The three main ingredients
to credibility are stature, money, and campaign organization.
<P>
<blockquote>
<b>Stature</b>
<ul>Candidates without previous service in high elective
office have generally not been selected as nominees by the major
parties.  For the most part, successful Democratic and Republican
presidential candidates have come out of governors' offices or
the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives.  Candidates from
outside the political domain are rare; Eisenhower was a notable
exception. Lack of political experience often counts as an automatic
first strike against a candidate.  In fact, however, it is not
so much experience, but stature that counts.  A candidate who
repeatedly delivers substantial, well-received speeches will garner
favorable reviews and gain the support of party activists looking
to find someone who is &quot;presidential material.&quot; 
</ul>
  
<P>
<a href="financ.html"><b>Money</b></a>
<ul>Fundraising is sometimes referred to as the first
primary.  Money will be particularly important in the 1996 campaign
because of the compressed primary schedule.  Early on, Senator
Phil Gramm set the stakes by spreading the word that he would
raise $20 to $30 million before the first contest, the Iowa caucuses.
 Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander vowed to match Gramm.  Raising more
than $70,000 a day requires a lot of $1,000-a-plate dinners. 
Contributors are essentially investing in what is an untested
commodity, for there is no telling how well the candidates will
do when they face the voters.  Fundraising demands have discouraged
a number of well-qualified presidential prospects from running.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Campaign organization</b>
<ul>The battle for talent, in which
candidates seek to attract big-name media consultants, fundraisers
and pollsters to their campaigns, starts even before the announcement
speeches.  After building the core, candidates work to line up
endorsements from elected officials and party activists in key
primary states.  Meanwhile, their organizations generate shows
of support at myriad party gatherings and straw polls.  (Straw
polls are votes put on by state party organizations that have
no effect on the selection of delegates and are basically exercises
in hype.)  While the candidates circulate at the &quot;cattle
shows,&quot; their campaign organizations play up positive news
stories and attempt to douse negative ones. 
</ul>
</blockquote>
<P>
In its early stages, a candidacy can be compared to the tender
shoot of a sprouting seed; a spate of negative publicity can cripple
it and small problems may be indicative of difficulties to come.
 The successful candidate must demonstrate stature, fundraising
strength and organizational ability in the pre-primary period.
 Based on these three factors, the media determine that some candidates
are &quot;credible&quot; or &quot;serious&quot; and have a chance
winning the nomination.  The rest are classified as second or
third tier candidates, although not a single vote has been cast.
<P>

<ul>
<B><a href="http://www.cityvote.org">CityVote</a></B>.  The nonprofit CityVote organized a &quot;national
urban presidential primary,&quot; held on November 7, 1995 in
about 20 cities across the country in conjunction with local elections.
 CityVote sought to focus attention on the problems of America's
cities.  Its &quot;primary&quot; was not part of the nominating
process and had no impact on the selection of delegates.  Nonetheless
as a national event, occurring three months before the Iowa and
New Hampshire contests, it did draw some attention.  CityVote
had also planned four nationally televised candidate debates for
October and early November, but the &quot;major&quot; candidates
declined to participate.

<h2>Iowa and New Hampshire</h2>
</center>
<P>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary offer presidential
candidates an opportunity to engage in retail politics and to
refine their messages before moving to a more media intensive
mode later in the campaign.  
<p>

<center><a href="iowanh.jpg"><img src="iowanh.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iowa and New Hampshire zealously guard their first-in-the nation
status.  Indeed, Iowa law requires that the Iowa caucuses be held
eight days before any other state's delegate selection process.
 When Delaware Republicans sought to move their 1996 primary to
within four days of the New Hampshire primary, New Hampshirites
took severe umbrage.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iowa and New Hampshire are not typical states.  Iowa has about
1.7 million registered voters, but only a few hundred thousand
turn out at the Republican and Democratic precinct caucuses. New
Hampshire, with a population of just 1.1 million, is one of the
most Republican, whitest and wealthiest states in the nation.
 Iowa's and New Hampshire's importance in 1996 will be greater
than ever because of the compressed primary schedule.  Carl Cameron,
WMUR-TV's (Manchester, NH) political reporter, says that his state
will act as &quot;a sprinter's starting block.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What the candidates seek from Iowa and New Hampshire is momentum.
 In 1976, Iowa gave Jimmy Carter a boost.  As for New Hampshire,
since 1952 no man--except Bill Clinton--has won the presidency
without first winning the state's primary.  In 1992 Clinton came
in second to Paul Tsongas with 25 percent of the vote, but was
able to claim a measure of victory as &quot;the comeback kid.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One cannot discuss the New Hampshire primary without mention of
the state's two biggest media outlets.  <a href="http://www.wmur.com">WMUR-TV Channel 9</a>, an
ABC affiliate, and the Union Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News
wield tremendous influence.  WMUR-TV's weekday newscasts reach
over 290,000 adults each weekday.  The candidates go to great
lengths to get coverage from the station which has a national
reputation for its coverage of politics.  The Union Leader, with
a daily circulation of 70,013 and a daily adult readership of
189,000, has broken many candidates over the years and for utra-conservatives
the paper's endorsement is a crown jewel. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the first contests, Iowa and New Hampshire receive a disproportionate
amount of news coverage from the national and international media.
 William C. Adams, a professor at George Washington University,
put together a map for the 1984 campaign showing the sizes of
the states in proportion to the amount of campaign coverage they
received.  New Hampshire, with a 1984 voting age population of
just 722,000, was as big as the 19 westernmost states including
California and Texas, states with a voting-age population in the
tens of millions.  1996 should follow the 1984 pattern.

<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Iowa and New Hampshire first-in-the-nation tradition is now
well established, but it does raise questions of fairness.  These
two states with such small populations have a huge influence in
the nominating process, while millions of voters in later contests
sometimes find that the nominees have essentially been selected.

<h2>The rest of the primaries</h2>
<small><a href="#dates">1996 Republican Primary Dates</a></small>
</center>
<P>
In the past, party elites controlled blocks of delegates and brokered
conventions determined the party nominees.  In 1960, for example,
John Kennedy competed in primaries in just two states -- Wisconsin
and West Virginia.  Following the tumultuous 1968 Democratic Convention,
however, the Democratic party instituted reforms designed to ensure
full participation and a fair reflection of presidential preferences.
 In many instances, Republican rules were changed by default as
the Democratic reforms were written into state election codes.
 As a result of the changes, presidential preference primaries
have proliferated as the major way of selecting delegates to the
national conventions.
<P>
<center><a href="primarie.jpg"><img src="primarie.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today the road to the nomination is a candidate-centered, <a href="images.html">media-driven
affair</a> that at times resembles a traveling circus.  Flinging the
candidates hither and yon across the country, the primary system
allows time for only the shallowest of campaigns in some states
(thereby requiring expensive media campaigns), and it leaves millions
of voters in late primaries with little say in the selection of
the nominees.  The 1996 primary season promises to be one of the
most frenetic ever.  Many states have moved the dates of their
primaries forward in an effort to have a greater say in the nominating
process.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conventional wisdom suggests that the frontloaded, compressed
schedule could produce a Republican nominee by the end of March,
as 70 percent of the delegates will have been chosen by then.
 More remote scenarios postulate that none of the candidates will
achieve a majority of the delegates and the matter will have to
be decided at the convention.  Meanwhile, the Democratic primaries
are expected to be a mere formality.
<p>
Although this year's primaries will unfold so rapidly as to appear
a blur, there are certain highlights to look for and moments when
the momentum can shift.  States in some parts of the country have
scheduled their primaries on the same day, creating mini-regional
primaries: the March 5 Yankee primary, the March 12 Southern primary,
and the March 19 Rust Belt primary.  The Republican March 26 California
winner-take-all primary is an entity unto itself.  Finally, if
one of the candidates does wrap up the Republican nomination early,
the three or four months leading up to the convention will be
a pivotal period.
<P>
As chaotic as the primary season appears, there are rules.  At
the national level, the parties set broad rules that they hope
will result in a nominee who can win in November.  Within the
framework of the national rules and requirements of state election
codes, each state party sets its own rules for qualifying delegates
to the national conventions.  Meeting all the different states'
filing requirements poses a significant challenge to the campaigns.
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republican rules for selecting delegates differ from those of
the Democrats in several important respects.  The Democratic party
has adopted an elaborate set of national rules, while Republican
rules allow the state parties more latitude in how they select
their delegates.  In a number of states such as California, Republicans
still use the winner-take-all system, a vestige of the old structure.
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dominant method for selecting delegates is the primary.  Closed
primaries are restricted to registered party members.  In an open
primary, any registered voter can vote, so that members of one
party may try to influence the outcome of the other party's primary.
 In nonbinding, or beauty contest primaries, the delegates are
selected by other means. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Caucuses are a multistage process that starts in precinct or district
meetings and concludes with a state convention.  Caucuses require
more active involvement than do primaries.  Participants cannot
just take a quick trip to the polling booth; rather they must
be willing sit to through one or more meetings.  Candidates who
can effectively organize grassroots support often do well in caucuses,
but the system is used primarily in smaller states.
<P>
Turnout in presidential primaries is generally low.  The Committee
for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonpartisan, nonprofit
research organization based in Washington, found that in 1992
only 33,637,075 of 171,003,000 eligible Americans voted in the
presidential primaries, a 19.6 percent turnout.
<P>
The American system for choosing the party nominees is uniquely
convoluted.  Starting in the bleak winter landscapes of Iowa or
New Hampshire, candidates must put themselves through a grueling
four-month series of state primaries and caucuses.  The process
tests the candidates in many ways, including their ability to
raise money, deliver the same speech countless times, and look
good on television.  For those potential leaders not willing to
put themselves through these trials, there remains the option
of waging independent or third-party campaigns in the fall. However,
the Democratic and Republican nominations remain the surest path
to the White House.

<h2>Conventions</h2>
</center><P>
In a sense, the national conventions are giant ads for the parties,
huge 4-day television spots.  Although they formerly served as
decision-making bodies, the party conventions have become more
like coronations.  Seeking to convey unity and harmony to the
television audience, party officials work to resolve or paper
over differences in advance of the convention.  The result is
a dearth of news.
<P>
<center><a href="convent.jpg"><img src="convent.gif" alt="Timeline" border="0"></a></center>
<P>
Despite their reduced role, conventions are not just meetings
of people with silly hats; they continue to fulfill a number of
important functions.  They provide a venue for party activists
from across the country to get reacquainted and do some networking.
 The diverse interest groups that make up a party's constituency
are represented, and each tries to get its individual message
out.  Fundraisers congregate at various receptions, luncheons,
and dinners.  Attracted by the presence of 15,000 media representatives
from across the country and around the world, other groups try
to grab a few seconds of air time or lines of print.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hosting a party convention provides a big economic boost to a
city, and there is spirited competition for the privilege.  The
Democratic National Committee announced its selection of Chicago
in August 1994; the convention will be held at the United Center
from August 26-29. Republicans announced their choice, San Diego,
in January 1995; their convention will unfold at the San Diego
Convention Center on August 12.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The money to put on the major party conventions comes largely
from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, paid for by the
checkoff on Federal income tax forms.  (In 1992 the Democratic
and Republican National Conventions each received $11.4 million
from the U.S. Treasury; these numbers will be adjusted for inflation
in 1996.)  In addition, host committees in each city work with
volunteers and businesses to see that a proper welcome is given
to delegates and media personnel.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the formalities of the convention is adoption of the party
platform.  In the months preceding the convention, the party conducts
a series of hearings at which various interest groups are given
the opportunity to express their views.  Then the platform is
drawn up.  As Theodore White observed in The Making of the President
1960, the final document is largely a rhetorical exercise.  White
wrote that, &quot;...in actual fact, all platforms are meaningless:
the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience
of the candidate the party chooses to lead it.&quot;  Nonetheless,
each campaign highlights the gross faults and glaring distortions
in the other party's platform.  In 1992 for example, the Clinton
campaign produced &quot;The 1992 Republican Platform: An Annotated
Version,&quot; while the Bush campaign came up with a &quot;Platform
Comparison--Faith in Individuals versus Faith in Government.&quot;
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A successful convention can provide a boost for the candidate
heading into the fall campaign (&quot;convention bounce&quot;),
while a divisive one can undermine morale in the field.

<h2>Election Day</h2>
</center>
<P>
On November 5, 1996, an election campaign that has been underway
for almost two years draws to a close.  The candidates, exhausted
by last-ditch efforts to rally up votes, are among the approximately
100 million citizens turning out at polling places across the
country.  
<P>
Also on the ground are thousands of interviewers surveying a sample
of the voters who have just cast their ballots.  Exit poll results
are a major feature of election night coverage.  They provide
a window on the concerns of voters as well as useful information
on gender, race, age, and other variations in voting behavior.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Controversy has arisen over the networks' use of exit polls to
project winners before the polls close.  Critics argue that early
projections of winners discourage voters from turning out.  In
1985 the networks pledged to Congress that they would refrain
from declaring winners in a state until the polls in that state
closed.  As a result, a less-than-adequate situation exists where
reporters have information but are bound not to relate it.  By
midafternoon on November 3, 1992, exit poll data showed that Clinton
had won big in the Electoral College.  NBC President Michael Gartner
observed in a post-election <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article that,
&quot;Everybody knew who the winner was but the people.&quot;
 
<P>
Election night is a major production for the networks' news divisions.
 Often they will construct a special set dominated by a big electoral
map and filled with lots of monitors.  The anchor and his in-studio
team analyze and relate the results, while other correspondents
report from the candidates' headquarters and from tightly contested
races around the country.  The evening draws to a close with concession
and victory speeches.

<h2>The transition period</h2>
</center><P>
As is taught in high school government classes, the president of the United States is not selected by direct popular vote, but by intermediaries known as electors.  The electoral system is outlined in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1804, which significantly modified original provisions contained in Article II.  All told there are 538 electors.  The manner of selection of electors varies, but they are generally chosen by congressional district.  Each party presents a slate of electors, usually people with longstanding party ties.  In all states, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, the winner of the popular vote takes all the electors.
<P>
<center><a href="trans.jpg"><img src="trans.gif" border="0" alt="Timeline"></a></center>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The formal process of making the election official begins when governors in each state issue certificates of ascertainment which confirm the results and electors.  Then, on December 16, 1996, (the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December), electors will meet in each state capitol.  They will vote first for president and then for vice-president, and the vote will probably be unanimous.  Certificates of vote from each state are then sent to the United States Senate, where they are officially opened, counted, and ratified in early January.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event that none of the candidates has a clear majority, the election goes into the House of Representatives.  This has only happened twice, most recently in 1824, although there was talk in June 1992 that a good showing by Ross Perot might throw the election into the House.  A second problem with the electoral system is that the popular vote winner can actually lose the election as a result of electoral math.  This last happened in the Hayes-Tilden contest of 1876.
<br>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the Electoral College system is denounced as an archaic and anachronistic holdover, to abolish it outright would require a constitutional amendment.  President Carter pushed to introduce direct popular vote during his administration and Ross Perot argued for direct popular vote in 1992; some states have also considered replacing their winner-take-all rules with the split-vote system.  However, until the Electoral College produces another untoward outcome, there is unlikely to be any sustained move to change it.
 <P>
Beyond the Electoral College formalities, what happens in the transition period obviously depends upon whether President Clinton is re-elected or not.  Should Clinton gain a second term, one may see actions designed to convey a sense of renewed activity.  Possibilities might be a Cabinet re-shuffle or a mega-event comparable to his 1992 Economic Conference.  Planning and preparations for the inaugural will begin.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should President Clinton be defeated, the new president-elect and his team must make effective use of the roughly seventy-five days until the inauguration.  Expectations are high.  The one-time candidate must assume a "presidential" aura, and, amid euphoria and exhaustion, responsibility looms.  Charles Jones, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, says that the campaign revolves around one person, the candidate; afterwards the challenge is "attaching that person to the government."  The president-elect and the transition team make crucial decisions about personnel, policy and logistics.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A certain amount of tension in this period is inevitable.  People who have worked hard on the campaign now see others being brought in to manage the transition.  There is much jockeying for position, and resumes proliferate.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the business of creating or re-forming an administration proceeds, preparations for the ceremonial side of the transfer of power are underway.  Inaugurals are exercises rich in symbolism.  From a practical standpoint, the Inaugural Committee also can be a good place to put some of the former campaign people.  Several days of inaugural festivities lead up to noon on January 20, 1997, when the oath of office will be administered.

<h2>Images</h2>
</center>
<P>
Modern politics revolves around good visuals.  On many days, fleeting
images on television or a quick glance at the front page of the
newspaper may be all the information we get about the campaign.
 A candidate who holds up a chart or chooses a symbolic setting
to deliver a speech stands a better chance of catching the media's
attention--and yours.  While style alone cannot sell a message
lacking in substance, it can significantly boost a message's effectiveness.
<P>
If you go to a campaign event in person, your impressions of that
event may bear little connection to the mediated reality presented
in the nightly news or in the next day's newspaper.  Factors such
as camera work, editing, and the context in which the images appear
all combine to create a new reality.  Hans Kepplinger, an academic,
has in the past few years devised a &quot;model of presentation
impacts&quot; which provides a useful tool for understanding and
analyzing mediated images.  Kepplinger argues that as a viewer
is exposed to footage of a politician over time he or she will
develop an &quot;optically induced stereotype&quot; of the figure.

<P>
<h2>Language</h2>
</center>
<P>
A campaign generates a plentitude of words.  While there is a
fair degree of overblown rhetoric, obfuscation, and partisan sniping,
occasionally one of the candidates delivers a finely crafted speech
with a beginning, middle, and end.  In his recent book The Inarticulate
Society, Tom Shachtman argues that there is a &quot;crisis in
eloquence.&quot;  Politicians' concern with getting their soundbites
in the news may be one of the factors contributing to this decline.
<P>
The use of language in labeling merits some attention.  Labeling
people and subjects helps us to get a fix on them.  While some
labels such as &quot;former governor&quot; are harmless, others
such as &quot;pro-life&quot;/&quot;anti-choice&quot; and &quot;pro-choice&quot;/&quot;pro-abortion&quot;
are ideologically charged.  
<P>
In a press release, bombast can sometimes be amusing.  For example,
one of the National Rainbow Coalition's JaxFaxes refers to Senator
Dole as &quot;Consummate Washington insider, deal-maker, cynic,
affirmative action race-baiter and leading Republican presidential
candidate Sen. Robert Dole (R-KS).&quot;  A weekly sheet put out
by the Dole campaign describes Lamar Alexander thusly: &quot;Lamar
Alexander, a former Southern Governor like Bill Clinton&quot;
<P>
Reporters, seeking to be objective and fair, must be careful not
to pick up this kind of charged language.  Sometimes the biases
carried by different words can be more subtle.  For example, Jesse
Jackson argues that when speaking of affirmative action debate,
&quot;quotas&quot; and &quot;preferences&quot; are incorrect;
affirmative action is, he says, about &quot;goals, targets, and
timetables.&quot;

<h2>Statistics</h2>
</center>
<P>
In an election year the latest numbers on unemployment, inflation,
factory orders, housing starts, etc. are often hyped/downplayed
as evidence of the success/failure of government programs and
policies.  It seems as if a politician can find a statistic to
support just about any viewpoint, and for that viewpoint there
will also be a set of statistics that directly contradicts it.
 
<P>
Dr. David Murray, research director of the nonprofit, nonpartisan
Statistical Assessment Service (STATS), argues that some numbers
are better than others.  Data arising from studies that do not
follow accepted procedures and methodology should be discounted.
 An estimate is an educated guess and much depends on the assumptions
made.  Estimates can be derived from a close study of existing
data or they may be off-the-cuff flights of fancy.   
<P>
Statistics can be twisted in ways big and small.  STATS literature
observes that, &quot;Advocacy groups regularly use the media to
pollute the policy debate with misleading or invented statistics
about purported social and economic problems.&quot;  Bad numbers
are a serious problem in public policy debates as they generate
much confusion.
<P>
One must pay close attention not only to the source of the numbers,
but also to the definitions used.  For example, an article may
cite numbers of &quot;missing and abused children,&quot; &quot;missing
children,&quot; or &quot;children abducted by strangers.&quot;
 The difference between these groupings can range from more than
a million to less than a thousand.  Murray states that every statistic
is an answer to a question; the trick is to identify the right
question.  The bottom line with numbers is to look carefully at
the labels that go with them and then to consider the underlying
argument they are being used to make.

<P>
<h2>Cutting Through the Blizzard of Messages</h2>
</center>
<P>
This is a checklist of questions to ask yourself to better get to the root of the numerous statements you will hear during the upcoming elections.
<ul>
<h3>What is the ultimate source of the information?</h3>  
<ul>
A candidate.
<br>Someone in or affiliated with one of the campaigns.
<br> An expert, a think tank, or government statistics.
<br> An interest group.
<br> An ordinary citizen or voter expressing an opinion.
<P></ul>
<h3>Is the source credible and the information believable and
complete?</h3>
<ul> Clearly, when considering information from a partisan source,
one must be  careful.<br>
 The facts cited may be true, but present only part of the picture.
</ul><P>
<h3>Is this information relevant?</h3>
<ul>
 A lot of charges fly hither and yon during a political campaign.
 One needs  to ask not only if a specific charge is true, but
also whether it affects a  candidate's capacity to set a direction,
implement policies, respond to  difficult situations, and be an
effective leader.
</ul><P>
<h3>What are other, opposing sources saying about the subject?</h3>
<ul>
 Seeking out three or four different points of view is a good
way to clarify  one's own thinking on an issue.
</ul>
<h3>Is there some aspect of the debate that is not being represented?</h3>
<ul>
 The campaigns may not be addressing some of the more difficult
issues, and  the media do occasionally suffer from blind spots.
</ul>
<h3>What do I think?</h3>
<ul>
 Difficult problems usually do not lend themselves to quick solutions.
 Each  of the approaches put forth may have some merit.  Which
do you think is  best, and why? 
</ul></ul>

<html><head><title>VOTE AMERICA:  Watching Campaign Ads</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="tile.gif">
<blockquote>
<center>
<a href="http://www.virtent.com"><img src="votelogo.gif" border="0"></a>
<P>
<h2>Watching Campaign Ads</h2>
</center>
<P>
The campaigns spend vast sums to develop, produce, and air television
spots.  In the 1992 general election, about two-thirds of the
Bush and Clinton campaigns' funds went into advertising.  All
told, the Bush, Clinton, and Perot campaigns spent a total of
$133 million on television advertising in the fall.  Television
ads offer very highly refined versions of a campaign's messages--in
a sense they are &quot;pure&quot; message--and as such they merit
close attention. 
<P>
For television ads to be effective they must <B>fit within a broad
communication strategy</B> so that the same message is being presented
by the different parts of the campaign.  In an era of rampant
channel surfing, good political ads <B>stand out from the clutter
of commercial advertising and programming</B>.  Their <B>technical
quality</B> must be such that viewers are not paying attention
to poor lighting or sound, but to the message.  They must be <B>believable</B>.
 Devices used to achieve credibility include news clips, documented
statistics, endorsements, testimonials by ordinary citizens, and
the use of formal office settings.  And, very importantly, a good
ad <B>strikes &quot;a responsive chord;&quot;</B> it causes the
viewer to smile or tap his foot.
<P>
Consultants can make use of many different types of images in
putting together a campaign ad.  If the candidate performs well
on camera, he or she may be prominently featured.  Other ads use
stock footage and still photos of children in classrooms, people
at work, and so forth.  Clips of the candidate's opponent are
central to many attack ads.  Viewers draw meaning from the surroundings
the candidate is in, the people he or she is interacting with,
and the types of clothes he or she is wearing.  However, pictures
alone do not make a good ad.  Producers of political ads are skilled
at using all of the <B>aesthetic fields</B>--light and color,
space, time and motion, and sound to create and enhance moods.
   
<P>
It is easy to denounce 30-second spots as &quot;soap bubbles&quot;
or &quot;dirt&quot; that reduce the level of debate and manipulate
viewers' emotions.  It can also be argued that they distract us
from the real issues.  The principal problem with advertising
is not the blatantly wrong or false ad, but the many ads that
shade the truth.  Advertisements often attack a candidate on one
or two specific points, devaluing the sum of his or her record.
 While consultants argue that negative ads &quot;make democracy
work&quot; by educating people about the candidates, attacks may
also contribute to a cynical electorate.  Finally, complex problems
simply cannot be discussed in 30 seconds.
<P>
<ul>
<li>When you see or hear an ad consider what sort of appeal
it is making (logical, emotional, ethical, fear), what its purpose
is (bio, define the opponent, respond to an attack and launch
a counterattack), and whether it is fair.   
<P>
<li>If you come across an ad that is not fair or bends the truth,
respond.  Let the campaign and the station that airs it know exactly
what the fault is.
<P>
<li>Look in newspapers and news programming for ad watches,
in which reporters present and analyze the campaigns' ads. 
<P>
<li>Play theater critic.  Has the consultant made good use of
the aesthetic fields--light and color, space, time and motion,
and sound?  Is the ad effective?  Why or why not?
<P>
<li>Think about what program the ad is airing on and what audience
the campaign is trying to reach. 
<P>
<li>Keep track of the spots the candidate has been running in
the course of the campaign and try to discern major themes.

<h2>Be a better news consumer</h2>
</center>
<P>
Careful regard to one's news and information sources is more important
than the actual quantity of news one takes in.  Catching the 6:00
news or reading the newspaper doesn't always result in a complete
understanding of the issues. 
<P>
Even if you do not read the newspaper daily, there are steps you
can take to better assess the information that is out there.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Look beyond familiar news sources and consider how other
news organizations are covering the campaign.
<P>
<li>Think about whether your newspaper or news sources devote
well-defined and organized space/time to the campaign or whether
their focus could be improved.
<P>
<li>Pay attention to the sources used in news stories: is the
information coming from someone affiliated with one of the campaigns,
an interest group, an expert, a voter?
<P>
<li>The media provide versions of the truth.  There may be aspects
of an event or situation that are not being reported on at all,
or that are not being covered sufficiently.
<P>
<li>If you think your preferred media outlets can do better,
contact them and let them know specific ways in which you think
their coverage can be improved. (Is their coverage disorganized?
 Are they running to many horse race polls?)  In general, news
organizations are happy to find out that people are paying attention,
provided the input is well thought out.

<h2>Follow the Money</h2>
</center>
<P>
In April 1995, the New York Times Magazine ran a cover story on
Republican presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander with the headline
&quot;To Run for President, He Needs to Raise $77,000 a Day.&quot;
 Sen. Phil Gramm, another leading Republican candidate, says he
has the &quot;the most reliable friend that you can have in American
politics, and that's ready money.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given all the attention to fundraising in the lead-up to the primaries,
one might get the impression that money, rather than sound ideas,
is what makes a credible candidate.  The role of money in politics
has long been problematic, not just here in the United States,
but in democracies around the world.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system of presidential campaign finance in effect in the U.S.,
while not without its imperfections, is relatively simple in its
broad outlines.  During the primaries, partial public financing
provides qualifying candidates with matching funds from the U.S.
Treasury.  In the general election, candidates who agree to forgo
private money are fully funded.  The parties are also granted
money to put on their national conventions.  The money for these
payments comes from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, which
is filled by the $3 check-off on individuals' federal income tax
forms and administered by the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
and the U.S. Treasury Department. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1974, in the aftermath of Watergate, Congress created the FEC
and established the current system of financing presidential elections,
including contribution limits, spending limits, disclosure requirements,
and public financing.  Public financing was introduced to address
several concerns:
<P><ul>
<li>The disproportionate influence (or the appearance of influence)
of wealthy contributors;
<P>
<li>The demands of fundraising that prevented some candidates
from adequately presenting their views to the public; and
<P>
<li>The increasing cost of presidential campaigns that effectively
disqualified candidates who did not have access to large sums
of money.
<br>
<small>Source: FEC.  <I>Report of the Presidential Public Funding Program</I>
(April 1993).</small>
</ul>
<P>
Public financing has recently come under increasing attack.  Participation
in the check-off has steadily declined.  In 1993, because of a
projected shortfall in the fund, Congress increased the check-off
to $3, up from the previous $1 level.  For 1993 returns, participation
in the tax form check-off was only 14.5 percent, despite a public
education campaign.  Given the fact that much of the money distributed
from the Fund goes to buy 30-second television spots, one can
understand why some people hesitate to take part.  In a June 1995
column, George Will described the program as &quot;an entitlement
for politicians, funded in a mendacious manner.&quot;  Sen. Mitch
McConnell (R-KY) has also been a harsh critic of public financing.
 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Federal campaign finance laws have not been significantly changed
since 1979, and other shortcomings have become apparent.  For
example, the $1,000 contribution limit has never been adjusted;
by 1992, accounting for inflation, $1,000 was worth only $350.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some would raise or do away with contribution limits altogether
(when you think about it, the idea that you as an individual can
only contribute $1,000 to a campaign is a pretty strong restriction,
but it was upheld by the Supreme Court in the famous 1976 Buckley
vs. Valeo decision).  At the opposite extreme, one has the example
of Jerry Brown.  In his 1992 Democratic primary campaign, Brown
issued a sweeping indictment of the role of money in politics,
limited himself to $100 contributions and ran a guerilla-style,
grassroots campaign.  On the downside, one can see that operating
under such conditions, politicians might actually have to spend
more time raising money than they do now.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another obvious problem with the current system is soft money.
 Corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals can contribute
unlimited amounts to the parties, provided the money is used for
state and local &quot;party-building&quot; activities.  Broad
interpretations of what exactly constitutes &quot;party building&quot;
have opened the soft money loophole.  Fred Wertheimer, former
head of Common Cause, has written that soft money &quot;threatens
to render meaningless all federal limits on campaign contributions
and to destroy the integrity of the presidential campaign finance
system.&quot;
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Enforcement is another weakness.  Former Democratic national chairman
Robert Strauss observed in a 1992 &quot;Frontline&quot; program
on PBS that, &quot;People are not really worried much about violating
the FEC rules.  They figure, 'What the heck, the election will
be over six months before it [a complaint] ever comes up' &quot;

<P>
<B>Primaries</B>
<ul><P>
<I>Eligibility</I>. To qualify for matching funds, a candidate must raise
$5,000 in each of 20 states, consisting of contributions of $250
or less from individuals.  This $100,000 threshold is intended
to distinguish candidates with broad national support.  Candidates
must also agree to abide by spending limits, keep acceptable records,
and undergo a detailed audit.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After eligibility is established, contributions of $250 or less
are matched dollar for dollar with money from the Treasury.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the 1992 prenomination period, the U.S. Treasury dispensed
$43.4 million to 12 candidates.  The maximum amount any candidate
could receive was $13,810,000.
<P>
<I>Spending limits</I>. The Federal Election Campaign Act established
limits on how much a campaign may spend prior to the convention.
 In 1992, the national spending limit was $27.62 million (this
is the original 1974 level of $10 million adjusted for inflation).
 </ul>
<P>
<B>Conventions</B>
<ul><P>
Each major party receives money from the U.S. Treasury to put
on its convention.  In 1992, the figure was $11.048 million.
</ul><P>
 <B>General Election</B>
<ul><P>
If a presidential candidate pledges not to accept private contributions,
he or she receives public financing in the general election. 
In 1992, the Bush and Clinton general election campaign committees
each received $55.24 million ($20 million adjusted for inflation)
from the U.S. Treasury.  Perot did not ask for public funds. 
He contributed more than $60 million to his campaign.  
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supplementing the federal grants to the campaigns are several
other sources of money, including &quot;coordinated expenditures&quot;
made by the political parties to support their nominees and soft
money which often goes to voter registration and get-out-the-vote
efforts.

National Minority Politics - Editor's Roundup - October 1995</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>October 1995</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>

	In former Sen. John Danforth's (R-Mo.) book, <i>Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas</i>, the author explains how the youngest justice on the U.S. Supreme Court was able to get through the grueling final days before the Senate voted to confirm his nomination.  Danforth writes that Thomas collapsed emotionally under the onslaught.  "[Thomas] felt quite certain that no job, even one on the Supreme Court, was worth the feelings of annihilation he was experiencing," writes the retired senator.
<P>
	Danforth watched, counseled and consoled Thomas as he slowly and dramatically made his way back from the depths of utter hopelessness and self-doubt.  In the book, Danforth describes an unforgettable scene, in his office, in which the two couples, the Danforths and the Thomases, held hands and prayed for God's strength for Thomas, who had no strength of his own left.
	<P>
There is no doubt in my mind that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has had to call upon that same divine strength on numerous occasions since his Supreme Court confirmation in 1991.  Since then, at least two unflattering books have been written about Thomas and the sexual harassment charges brought by Anita Hill, both by journalists.  <P>

	<i>Capitol Games</i>, written in 1992 by Timothy Phelps, the <I>Newsday</I> reporter who broke the Hill allegations, and Helen Winternitz, supposedly presents a behind-the-scenes investigative report, but their view is obviously slanted in Hill's favor.  According to the authors, they document how Thomas "positioned himself as a black conservative in Washington," and "how the radical Right backed his cause."<P>

	The other tome, <I>Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas</i>, was written by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter.  The book cleverly attempts to paint Thomas as having an obsession with pornography and, by extension, being more likely to sexually harass his female employees. <P>
 
	But, interestingly, the writers only interview women who corroborate their assertion and do not interview the dozens of women who disagree; in other words, journalism with an agenda.  And Mayer and Abramson make the incongruous claim that "while the Republican senators defended Thomas, the Democrats were impartial factfinders, not Hill advocates."  It's no small wonder that Thomas declines all media interviews.<P>

	Besides being disparaged by book writers, Thomas has been harshly criticized and caricatured by leaders of the civil rights establishment.  Although many of them are men of the cloth, they appear to have little Christian charity for the associate justice.<P>
	Dr. Joseph Lowery, in his president's address to the 1995 convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, described the Supreme Court as having "three white males, one white female, and a whatchamacallit." <P>
 	On Sept. 12, political gadfly Rev. Al Sharpton and a few dozen ministers joined other protesters and picketed near Clarence Thomas' home.  Sharpton claimed this demonstration was in response to Thomas' Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action and majority-minority congressional districts. <P>

	The New York preacher appears to blame Thomas solely for the high court's opinions.  If Sharpton was consistent, which he generally is not, he would have picketed at the homes of all the Supreme Court justices who sided with the majority in those cases.  But Sharpton's objective was not consistency, but to question Thomas' "blackness."<P>
	Rep. J. C. Watts, a freshman Congressman from Oklahoma, says Thomas will likely have to labor under a double standard for years to come.  "I don't think Clarence Thomas will ever be treated fairly or will be judged by a level standard," Watts said in an August interview.<P>
	"There is a different standard that Clarence Thomas and most black conservatives will have to live by," Watts added.  "But I think it is very important that we continue to tout our message, because there are many people in the minority community who agree with us."<P>

	Three of those who agree, and also know Thomas personally, are included in this month's edition of <I>National Minority Politics</i>.  Armstrong Williams, who has known the associate justice for more than a decade and worked with Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as his confidential assistant, details an exclusive conversation he had with Thomas after the recent court session ended.<P>

	John N. Doggett III has been a friend to Thomas for nearly 25 years.  The two were law students together at Yale University in the early 1970s.  Doggett, a Texas lawyer and business owner, testified on Thomas' behalf at the confirmation hearings.<P>

	Brian W. Jones, president of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Center for New Black Leadership, met Thomas in the early 1990s.  "My first encounter with Thomas came during my senior year in college," writes Jones, who is in his late 20s.  Thomas had just been appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court by President Bush.<P>
	These three columns are some of the most revealing ever written about Thomas and his approach to the law, from people who know his personally, rather than from armchair psychiatrists who are ideologically opposed to the Supreme Court justice.<P>

<h3>June 1996</h3><p>

<p>


<b>DOES AMERICA NEED A THIRD PARTY?</b><br>
   Support for a new, or third, political party is at an all-time high.  In the 1930s, support ranged from 13 to 14 percent of the populace; in the 1990s, between 55 to 65 percent back the notion of a third party, and 38 to 45 percent of voters are independent, not wedded to either major party, according to a recent poll conducted by the Gordon S. Black Corporation (GSBC).
<p>
   The polling firm's explanation for the increase in the market size of potential third party voters is that the major parties have moved progressively to the political left and right, thus leaving a vacuum for the concerns of moderate voters in the political center.  Politics, as does nature, abhors a vacuum.
<p>   
Still, the GSBC survey reveals even more fascinating findings.  A majority of voters (59 percent) say the current incumbents will never reform the political system; an overwhelming majority (79 percent) say special interest groups have more influence than voters; 74 percent say Congress is largely owned by special interest groups; and 44 percent say if Democrats and Republicans continue to run things, we will never get real reform.
<p>
   Perhaps even more telling, 61 percent of voters say they would vote for the candidates of a centrist reform party as opposed to Republicans and Democrats.
<p>   
But America still has a long way to go before it has a viable third party from which candidates are elected at all levels of government.  And the reasons are numerous.
<p>   
First, most voters are in the habit of voting for either Democrats or Republicans and these voting habits, or patterns, will not be easily changed.  The strongest possibility lies with younger Americans, who also are much less likely to vote than are their parents and grandparents.
<p>
   Second is the issue of credibility.  Because third parties and their candidates are considered to have little, if any, chance for victory, voters believe they may be wasting their votes if they cast it for these candidates.
   <p>
The concept of the wasted vote was expressed repeatedly by media during the 1992 presidential campaign when Perot ran as an independent candidate.
<p>
   Noted journalist Sam Donaldson's comments on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Oct. 25, 1992, provides a glaring example of the media's standard position concerning the Perot campaign.
<p>   
"Well, let me tell you something about this election," said Donaldson.  "Some people say,  Vote for who you like best, even though they don't have a chance to win.'  I think that's wrong.  I think life is full of tough choices that are always--often second and third choices because the first choice doesn't make any sense."
<p>   
Later during that same broadcast, Donaldson added, "You can vote for a loser if you want to.  Now, you know--but if you want to have an impact on the election, there is a choice between Clinton and Bush."
<p>
   The idea of a vote for Perot being a wasted vote was repeated so much by the media that the Texas businessman felt compelled to address the issue in the presidential debates and in his 30-minute infomercials.
<p>
   This brings us to the third reason why it will be quite a while before third party candidates actually have a credible shot at political races.  Media generally dismiss them as "not viable" and provide them with little or no media exposure.  Thus, voters are not familiar enough with third-party challengers to make an informed decision one way or the other.  Their only option is to pick from among the tried and true--Democrats or Republicans.
<p>
   Fourth, and perhaps most important, is the issue of money, which has been described as the mother's milk of politics.  Currently, our political system is skewed in favor of the two major parties in terms of financial resources candidates and the two parties receive from the Federal treasury.
<p>
   The Federal Election Commission will give $12 million to each of the two major political parties for their 1996 presidential nominating conventions.  In addition, both the Clinton and Dole campaigns have received in excess of $12 million each in Federal matching funds during this election cycle.  The only third party presidential candidate who has received matching funds thus far is John Hagelin, nominee for the Natural Law Party, who has received $246,961.
<p>
   This edition of Headway includes commentaries by three individuals active in the political arena.  Reginald Jones, a New Jersey political commentator and part-time radio talk show host, says he's a conservative Republican who has been disillusioned by some of the GOP's political shortcomings.  Jones, however, believes the answer is to improve the two parties, not build a third one.
<p>
   Richard Toliver, who has written a number of commentaries for Headway in the past, is former southwest regional director for United We Stand America.  Toliver has some words of wisdom for the Reform Party, summarizing his comments by writing, "The Reform Party must be able to relate to those who are still denied an opportunity to achieve the American dream."
<p>
   Finally, Harry Browne is a presidential candidate running under the banner of the Libertarian Party.  He makes the case for why voters should take a look at his party and chose him as their alternative to the Democrat and Republican standard bearers.

WASHINGTON REPORT

<ul><li>GOP presidential contender Alan Keyes finally got the national television exposure he has been working for throughout his campaign, although not exactly the kind he might have hoped for.  After twice trying to force his entry into the studios of WSB in Atlanta to crash the candidates' Mar. 3 debate, Keyes appeared on several national talk shows the following morning, including ABC's "Good Morning America," and said, "This is a disgrace to American democracy, but it's also a threat to the freedom of this country.  Party bosses or media bosses should not be allowed to select candidates in America."<p>
     Keyes added:  "This was an effort to manipulate the outcome and force the people. . .to vote for certain candidates by refusing to allow them to vote for others."<p>
     Keyes, who, along with other Republican candidates including Senator Richard Lugar, was not invited by the television station to debate, was taken into custody by police when he attempted to enter the studio a half-hour before the debate was set to begin.  Throughout the day, the former United Nations ambassador and a group of supporters had staged an extended fast in five pup tents set up on the studio's front lawn.
     <p>As Keyes was taken away by police, his supporters shouted, "Let him speak.  Let him speak."  Keyes was not arrested; rather, he was driven a short distance and released, whereupon Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell picked him up in his Lincoln Town Car.
    <p> Bill Nigut, WSB-TV political reporter and debate panelist, noted that other GOP candidates also weren't invited.  He said the station had no intention of reconsidering its decision not to invite Keyes.  In a written statement issued later, WSB-TV said inviting the top four vote getters offered Georgia voters "the most substantive debate."
    <p> However, in the future, the station and other organizations sponsoring debates would do well to establish the criteria before hand--and make the specifications public.
    <p> Despite single-digit support in nearly every state and an accumula-tion of less than 10 delegates, Keyes has vowed to stay in the race until the San Diego convention in August.  "Our commitment is to get out our message and spread our moral agenda," he said.
<p>
  <li>Elijah Cummings, the candidate with the most political experience, television ads and money, easily beat 26 other Democrats in the primary race to succeed Kweisi Mfume.  Republicans selected Kenneth Kondner, a dental technician.
   <p>  Cummings, a lawyer who has spent the past 13 years in the state House of Delegates, becomes a virtual shoo-in for election in Maryland's 7th District, where 83 percent of voters are registered Democrats.
   <p>  Though some had thought the Democratic race was up for grabs because of the crowded field, just two candidates split more than 60 percent of the vote in the Mar. 5 election.
   <p>  Cummings got 37 percent while the Rev. Frank Reid III, stepbrother of Mayor Kurt Schmoke, was second with 24 percent.  State Sen. Delores Kelley was next with 10 percent.
    <p> Knodner, 57, who ran unsuccessfully against Mfume three times, won the Republican nomination with 45 percent.
    <p> The voting, held in conjunction with the state's presidential primary, was the first congressional primary of the 1996 season.
    <p> Cummings, 44, raised more than $220,000--twice that of Reid--and spent it on a last-minute TV advertising blitz.  He promised to make crime fighting his top priority if he wins the general election.  Actually, the 7th District nominees will run in two elections--April 16 to serve the remainder of Mfume's term, and one Nov. 5 for the regular two-year term.
     <p>"We have a situation where people are afraid to come out of their houses," Cummings said.  "Eighty-five percent of all our crime problems stem from drugs."
     <p>In Maryland's seven other congressional districts, incumbents breezed to renomination.
     <p>Mfume, former head of the Congressional Black Caucus, was in the middle of his fifth term when he announced in December that he was taking over the presidency of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, based in Baltimore.
    <p> Mfume is one of 43 House members--27 of them Democrats--who are not seeking reelection this year.  Democrats would need to take 23 seats away from the GOP to regain control of the House.
Benjamin Chavis, national director of the Million Man March and ousted executive director of the NAACP, is asking local organizers of the march to raise an additional $150,000 to cover unpaid bills incurred by the march's national office.
     <p>According to a report in the Chicago Tribune, the appeal was included in a Feb. 2 letter from Chavis to local march organizers in some 350 cities inviting them to a meeting in Chicago.  It asked each city's local organizing committee to "make a minimum contribution of $1,000" by Feb. 24 "National Meeting of LOCs," or to bring the money with them.
     <p>The request came as a shock to many who helped raise money before the Oct. 16 event and then contributed what some thought to be millions more at the march.
     <p>Some local leaders were especially surprised that Chavis would expect them to donate more money or solicit contributions when national organizers have yet to produce a promised audit on march expenses.  "Until we get an accounting, we can't talk about any money--period," said Earl Hollis, a member of Chicago's local organizing committee.
     <p>Chavis said march organizers have paid $1.4 million in expenses for the march, though he would not specify what they were.  He said that the $150,000 debt comes from bills that didn't arrive until after the first of the year.
     <p>"The letter was an upbeat letter because we're pleased that we were able to meet 95 percent of the bills from money raised at the march and prior to the march and since the march," Chavis said in a Tribune interview.
     pHe said the audit has been delayed partly because of the late-coming bills.
     <p>Rev. James Demus, a co-chairman of Chicago's organizing committee, said he is prepared to launch a local fundraising campaign that may include letters to the 50,000 or more men who attended the march from the Chicago area.
    <p> But there clearly is resistance on the part of some march participants to bail out the national office.
    <p> Much of it is because the small-scale local efforts across the country that have carried out the work inspired by the march have virtually no ties to the national office and do not feel beholden to it.
    <p> "If they don't have enough money, let them worry about the money," said Bob Wilburn, president of Million Man Ministries, a group that has started at the Chicago-area Park Manor Christian Church.  "We've gotten together now a group of men that are doing something."
    <p> That attitude violates the spirit of the march, said Earl King, the Midwest Director of Chavis' National African-American Leadership Summit. "This is the first time ever a march has been paid for (solely) by African-American people," King said.  "This is about self-respect.  We have to be together in unity."
     <p>Despite the financial controversy surrounding the march, Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan continues to receive credit for his role in spearheading the march.  Farrakhan was in Washington, D.C. Mar. 14 to receive the 1995 Newsmaker of the Year Award from the National Newspaper Publishers Association at the National Press Club.  The association, representing about 200 black-owned newspapers, said Farrakhan was selected primarily for the vision he showed in putting together his Million Man March on the Washington Mall last year.
     <p>But Farrakhan received a letter recently from the U.S. government, which did not include good news.  The Treasury Department's Foreign Assets Control Office sent a letter in February advising the Nation of Islam minister that presidential orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act prohibit U.S. citizens from spending U.S. currency in several countries, including Libya and Iran among those visited by Farrakhan.
<p>
   <li>The forgotten patriots of the Revolutionary War, black men both free and slave who fought for liberty, may finally be remembered in a memorial on the National Mall--unless time runs out.
    <p> The nonprofit group raising funds for the memorial trumpeted its largest contribution ever on Feb. 29, a $1.5 million corporate commitment, and promised to get the rest, reported the Associated Press.
    <p> The decade-old project still needs $5 million more by October, or it risks losing congressional approval and its coveted site on the Mall, between the monuments to Washington and Lincoln.
     <p>In past years, the effort has been plagued by missteps and internal dissension.  Architect Marshall E. Purnell, who has been working on the plans from the beginning, said several times he feared the project would collapse.
     <p>"I've thought that on and off a lot," Purnell said, "but I refused to accept it.  It's too important an idea."
     <p>Approved by Congress in 1986, the monument would honor more than 5,000 black soldiers and sailors who fought in the Revolutionary War, as well as black men, women and children who helped build the colonies.
    <p> An escaped slave, Crispus Attucks, was the first American to die in the Revolution.  But organizers say many Americans have no idea that black soldiers fought alongside whites for independence.
    <p> A combination of two curved walls and sculpted figures by artist Ed Dwight, it would be the nation's second-largest bronze artwork, after the Statue of Liberty.
     <p>General Motors Corp., an early supporter of the project, donated $400,000 on Feb. 29 and pledged to raise $1.5 million more.
    <p> To meet its Oct. 27 deadline, the foundation must raise all the needed money and obtain final design approval, an expensive and time-consuming process.  The foundation missed two earlier deadlines and was granted extensions by Congress.  There is no guarantee of yet another extension.
     <p>Donations are accepted by telephone at 1-800-888-9811, or can be mailed to the Black Patriots Foundation, 1612 K St., N.W., Suite 1104, Washington, DC 20006.

<a name="intro"></a>
&quot;Power-Hungry companies will be able to wheel for deals in
the future.&quot;  This is a headline not from <i>Financial Times</i>
or the <i><a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a></i> but rather from the <i>Charleston
Gazette</i> and it's about Appalachian Power Company and Monongahela
Power Company. On the same day the <i>Providence Journal-Bulletin</i>
carried a story about <i>Narragansett Electric's</i> proposals
to &quot;introduce competition in the sale of electricity in Rhode
Island.&quot;
<P>
Talk of competition in the electric utility industry is breaking
out all over the country.  This is no longer simply an idea discussed
in the ivory towers of academia or by &quot;policy wonks&quot;
in Washington or even Brussels.  This is what regulatory commissions,
utilities and big power users are talking about across America.
 Those whose business it is to know about electricity are all
talking about competition.   According to the cognoscente the
question is no longer if competition is coming to electric markets
but rather when it will come and how it will come.
<P>
Electric energy is a big industry in the U.S.  We are home to
nearly one-third of all the installed electric generating capacity
in the world.  Our investor-owned utilities have assets in excess
of $500 billion and total sales of electric energy are nearly
$200 billion a year.  Which is all in the way of saying we ought
to be very deliberate in the way we think about change in this
industry.  Change is coming, and while it is unproductive to resist
these market forces, managing the change, and developing transition-easing
strategies can pay large dividends.
<P>
The crucial public policy issue at this point, especially at the
federal level, is how we should restructure the rules of the game
so as to make the most of the current opportunity.  What would
be unfortunate would be a regulatory reform process that the major
players, i.e., the utilities and the regulators, resisted.  While
no regulatory change of this magnitude can preserve the status
quo for all participants, it can be a process in which all participants
 have an opportunity to take advantage of the change.  Reform
can be structured more like a market driven process where participants
can adjust and move, and less like a traditional bureaucratic
change that resembles a bolt of lightening both in its speed and
limited scope for mitigation.
<P>
Market discipline is far superior to bureaucratic regulation and
the federal government should be in the position of doing all
it can do to foster the substitution of market regulation for
bureaucratic regulation. FERC, PUHCA, PURPA and in the 1992 Energy
Policy Act were developed in the context of bureaucratically regulated
electric power industry;  all need major revision and, in some
cases, outright repeal.  The structure of the electric power market
is going to change and the federal government should be out ahead
laying tracks rather than simply being a passenger or, worse,
an obstacle to a more competitive market in electricity.
<P>
<a name="activities"></a>
<h3>The Project and Its Activities</h3>
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation is in the business of creating
replacement models to current federal regulatory bureaucracies.
 Examples of current projects include; an FCC replacement project
and a medical innovations project designed to replace the FDA.
 (See enclosed newspaper clips relating to these projects.)
<P>
What the Foundation is proposing to undertake with this project
is the design of an operational model which would provide the
legal structure necessary to create a vastly more competitive
electricity market.
<P>
<B>Creating a Competitive Marketplace:  </B>Our first task will
be to develop a policy agenda for the federal government aimed
at eliminating artificial constraints on the structure, scope
and activities of electric power producers.  For all its market-style
trappings, the bureaucratic regulation of electric power in the
United States is a close cousin of socialist central planning.
 The Soviet planners structured their industries to make them
easier to plan for; they vertically integrated at every opportunity,
they limited product availability; and they opted for large single
enterprise industries whenever possible.  Regulators and their
supporters in the U.S. behaved quite similarly, i.e., they attempted
to control industrial structure in ways that facilitated regulation.
 The Public Utility Holding Act (PUHCA) may have made some sense
as a structural limitation on utilities in 1935.  It makes little
sense in the current regulatory environment and will be even more
damaging in a competitive environment.  PUHCA is not an isolated
example.  PURPA, for all the positive, if unintended, effects
it has had on opening up the wholesale electric market, is also
a relic from the era of bureaucratic regulation.  We intend to
analyze all of the major structural and behavioral restrictions
placed on electric power producers by the federal government and
develop a feasible plan for the elimination of redundant and dysfunctional
restrictions.
<P>
<B>Leveling the Playing Field:</B>   Both for reasons of equity
and efficiency, we intend also to turn our attention  to the issue
of public ownership of electric utilities, especially federal
ownership of generating capacity.  The participants in the process
are unlikely to take seriously the federal government's claim
that it is out to reform the electric power industry unless it
is willing to address the issue of public power.  Right now, more
than seventeen percent of all electric energy generated in the
U.S. is produced by the federal government or the electric cooperatives.
Subsidized power, whether through a marketing authority or through
a governmental corporation like TVA, poses a problem in a competitive
environment.  Private producers who have to cover all of their
costs and cannot borrow at subsidized rates will be at a competitive
disadvantage with respect to these governmental entities.  Moreover,
it is the taxpayer who is financing a playing field tilted against
private enterprise.  The taxpayer is burdened either with outright
subsidies to these government enterprises, or more indirectly,
by providing subsidized capital to the customers of these government
utilities.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has recognized at least the fiscal
aspects of the problem. In their FY' 96 budget, they propose to
privatize four power marketing administrations (Alaska, Southeastern,
Southwestern, and Western) while they will net almost $4 billion
next year.  Moreover, the Administration suggests converting the
Bonneville Power Administration into a government corporation.
The fate of the Administration's proposal is very uncertain; historically,
proposals to privatize the federal government's power activities
have not fared well.
<P>
Our contribution here will be to develop a privatization plan
that recognizes the interest group nature of this political process
and  is designed to be accommodating enough to have a serious
chance of making it through the Congress.  Subsidized power has
a powerful constituency and only by recognizing this and crafting
a plan that attempts to deal with the subsidy issue can any privatization
proposal make it through the legislative process.  There has been
a substantial amount of privatization in the rest of the world
during the past decade, and we will draw on that experience to
help design an action plan for privatizing federal power production
and transmission.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Power:  </B>Although not ordinarily associated with
the issue of competitive electric supply, the nuclear regulatory
efforts of the federal government have a profound  effect on the
electric power market and will effect the course of any deregulation
effort.  Utilities with large nuclear capacity and those that
might benefit from such capacity may face special difficulties
as the market for energy becomes more competitive.  Existing regulatory
policy has all but eliminated the promise of nuclear power in
the future.  In the context of a thorough transformation of economic
regulation of power production and distribution, it is time to
revisit the nuclear regulatory issue.  
<P>
<B>Building a Competitive Market:  </B>Finally, we will assess
the central operational issues that arise in the development of
a &quot;state of the art&quot; competitive market in electric
energy.  Specifically, we will consider what the federal government's
role should be in developing:  (1) open entry to buy, sell and
transmit power; (2) a computerized regional dispatch of electric
energy that is based on property rights -- rights to inject or
withdraw power, rights of transmission access, rights to invest
and claim the benefits (or incur the losses) that accrue to such
investment; (3) a spot market for electric energy with both demand
side and supply side bidding; (4) contractual instruments that
allow market participants to transfer risk but not power; and
(5) a system of &quot;model&quot; or distance pricing.
<P>
The practical problems of moving from the current bureaucratically
regulated industry and balkanized transmission grid to a market-disciplined
system with a transmission grid that is essentially a competitively-ruled
joint venture are immense.  The so called &quot;stranded investment&quot;
problem and the related &quot;stranded contract&quot; problem
have to be resolved.  Mechanisms must be designed to ease the
transition to competition by firms that have operated and invested
in a sheltered regulatory environment.
<P>
<B>Remaining Issues:  </B>Much of the talk now is how the utilities
will need to &quot;protect&quot; the residential rate payer in
the era of competition.  The assumption seems to be that only
the large users of electricity will be able to play the competition
game.  Some of this talk may simply be subterfuge aimed at enlisting
homeowners in an effort to protect utilities; but most is likely
to reflect conventional wisdom.  There really does not appear
to be any reason why the benefits of competition must be restricted
to large users.  As part of this project, we will investigate
what the federal government might to do encourage the development
of competitive supply for households.  What we have in mind here
are not subsidy programs, but rather creating a market structure
where the government helps create the property right system and
rules of the game that encourage the development of competitive
provision of electric power to the small user.
<P>
We will also considered the federal government's purchases of
electric  power and the ways theses purchases can stimulate the
development of competition.  For example, the government may be
able to create model demonstrations to competitive electric markets
from which regulators and law makers can learn.
<P>
<a name="structure"></a>
<h3>Program Structure</h3>
<P>
 
<P>
 The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation will provide overall direction
for the project and will have ultimate responsibility for the
final product.
<P>
<B>Project Team:</B>  The team working on this project will include
economists and lawyers with expertise in regulated network industries,
privatization, institutional design, restructuring, and experimental
economics.  Included on the team will be:  Dr. Michael K. Block,
Professor of Law and Economics, University of Arizona (Project
Director); Dr. Thomas Lenard, Senior Fellow and Director of Regulatory
Studies, The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation; Dr. Vernon Smith,
Regents Professor of Economics, University of Arizona; Dr. Steve
Rassenti, Research Director, Economic Science Laboratory, University
of Arizona; and Dr. Richard Geddes, Associate Professor of Economics,
Fordham University.
<P>
<B>Advisory Committee:</B>  The project will be assisted by an
advisory committee of experts from academia, the utility industry,
and the public policy community.  These experts will provide continuous
input and guidance as the project progresses.
<P>
<a name="schedule"></a>
<h3>Project Schedule</h3>
<P>
<B>I. Project Design:</B>  This project will be conducted in three
phases: The first phase of the project will involve background
research and outreach within the electric power community, selection
of members for the Advisory Committee as  well as research on
reform proposal on PUCHA and related issues.  The second phase
of the project will involve research for the preparation of a
reform proposals on public power and on nuclear energy regulation.
 The third and final phase of the project will involve research
for preparation of a reform proposal on facilitating a competitive
market in electricity.
<P>
<B>II. Timing:  </B>The project team will work with the Advisory
Committee to produce a Draft Proposal on reforming electric industry
regulation (PUCHA etc.) to be circulated during the fall of 1995.
 This term will also prepare Draft Proposals in reforming public
power and nuclear regulation for circulation during the spring
of 1996 and a Draft Proposal on establishing a competitive market
in electric power to be circulated during the fall of 1996.
<P>
The PFF proposals will be the subject of a number of conferences
during the project period including a major conference on the
competitive electric power market proposal will be held during
the winter of 1996.
<P>
<B>III. Public Education:</B>  The project will involve a substantial
effort to educate civic leaders, public interest groups, academic
and intellectual leaders, the electric energy community and the
public at large about the need for reform.  Through press briefings,
op-eds, appearances on television programs, participation in conferences,
testimony before Congressional committees and similar activities,
PFF will seek maximum exposure for the proposal and its underlying
rationale.

<h1><center>Medical Innovation Project</center></h1>
<p>
Civilization is poised to make major strides in medicine and health. These
advances have the potential to dramatically increase both life spans and quality
of life, while at the same time reducing the cost of health care. Yet all of this
progress and our ability to realize fully the benefits of these advances is
threatened by an outmoded regulatory framework.<p> 

The Foundation's Medical Innovation Project seeks to replace the current process
by which new drugs and medical devices are brought to market in the United
States. Under the leadership of Dr. Louis Sullivan, former Secretary of Health
and Human Services, the Medical Innovation Project is well advanced in its
efforts to develop a much more privately focused system to make sure that
beneficial drugs and medical devices are brought to the market while still
ensuring their safety and effectiveness. <p>

The MIP is currently designing, in complete and comprehensive form, ready for
implementation, a new process by which new drugs and other medical technologies
are tested and made available to consumers for the early part of the 21st
century. A major thrust of the project is to explore avenues for dramatically
increasing the role of the private sector in the testing and certification
process and, accordingly, shifting the government's role to one of oversight of
the process rather than operations per se. <p>

<h2>The Future of Medical Innovation: A New Approach For Bringing Medical Products to Market</h2>

<b>By Thomas M. Lenard, Ralph A. Epstein, Robert D. Tollison, W. Kip Viscusi
and William M. Wardell</b>
</center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction and Summary</h3>

The United States is the world's leader in biomedical research:  in public sector
spending through the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies;
in private sector research and development; in the dramatic scientific
discoveries that all this research has produced; and, in manufacturing the drugs,
diagnostics and medical devices that apply these breakthroughs to improving human
health.  It has, however, become increasingly difficult to bring these beneficial
new medical products to the market.<p>

<a href="#references">Numerous studies</a> provide convincing
evidence of the discouraging effect our current regulatory structure has on the
development of new products. Americans obtain access to fewer new drugs and
devices and receive them later than they should.  America's procedures for
bringing new products to patients are among the slowest and most expensive in the
developed world, and it is now routine for new drugs and devices to be available
in other countries before they become available here.<p>

Sick patients need safer and more effective medical products--drugs, diagnostics
and devices.  However, these products are not being brought to the market in a
timely manner because the development process for new medical products in the
United States has become increasingly lengthy, expensive and complex.  In the
case of drug development, for example, the number of new chemical entities
entering clinical research and those ultimately approved for marketing has not
increased over the past 30 years, despite a ten-fold real increase in the
industry's research expenditures and stunning scientific advances, such as the
emergence of the whole new field of biotechnology.1  Although there are many
reasons for this stagnation, U.S. regulatory demands and delays are very
significant factors.<p>

There is a general consensus among the American public, as well as the regulated
pharmaceutical and medical device industries, that the fundamental premises
underlying the current drug and device approval processes are sound--that medical
products should meet appropriate safety standards, defined in terms of the
relationship between benefits and risks; that they should produce the therapeutic
effect and perform as claimed; and, that they should be evaluated by qualified
experts on the basis of adequate data.  There is also, however, widespread
concern among both industry and patient representatives about the
innovation-inhibiting effects of the way these standards have been implemented. 
This concern began soon after enactment of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act of 1938, and increased greatly after passage of the 1962 Amendments to the
Act.<p>

The fact that most of the significant reforms still have not been adopted,
despite a drumbeat of almost identical recommendations over more than three
decades, suggests that this system will not be able to reform itself.
The essential criticism of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is that the
procedures it has established to implement its statutory mandate are too costly,
complex, time-consuming and unpredictable.  The result is that safe and effective
products are delayed in reaching consumers.  Numerous blue ribbon panels have
examined these issues, most recently the Commission on the Federal Drug Approval
Process (MacMahon Committee, 1982); the National Committee to Review Current
Procedures for Approval of New Drugs for Cancer and AIDs (Lasagna Committee,
1990); and, the Department of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on the
Food and Drug Administration (Edwards Committee, 1991).  Each of these panels
recognized the need for a faster and less costly drug development process.  In
1991, the Vice President's Council on Competitiveness distilled the best of the
panels' recommendations and made them the basis of a Bush Administration
initiative.  The fact that most of the significant reforms still have not been
adopted, despite a drumbeat of almost identical recommendations over more than
three decades, suggests that this system will not be able to reform itself.<p>

Safety is a twofold concern.  Keeping dangerous medical products off the market
promotes safety, but keeping beneficial products off the market has the opposite
effect.  Depriving patients of beneficial products imposes significant costs on
them in the form of morbidity, reduced quality of life, lost wages, longer
hospital stays and, even, loss of life.  In this regulatory context, more
stringent regulations are not necessarily safer.  Indeed, every FDA Commissioner
in the last 30 years has publicly acknowledged that the failure to approve
important new products can be detrimental to the public health.2<p>

Under America's current system, the only route to market for a new drug or device
is through the FDA.  Standard economic theory predicts that a certification
monopoly, such as the FDA, will raise the cost for approvals, while limiting
their quantity.  The FDA's status as a government entity creates an additional
imbalance in the incentives faced by the agency.  Manufacturers, not the FDA,
receive any gains realized from the earlier approval of medical products.  Yet if
problems arise from earlier approval, the FDA bears immediate costs in the form
of a public outcry, sensational media coverage and being grilled by Congressional
overseers.  Thus, one expects to see what we in fact observe--a very strong
incentive to keep unsafe products off the market at the expense of also blocking
beneficial new products.<p>

The system as now configured deprives patients of life-saving and life-enhancing
products that never come to market because the overall costs of innovation have
been driven too high.<p>

What are the effects on the drug and device industries of delegating the approval
process to a risk-averse agency operating in a political environment?  Here
again, the expectation is exactly what the empirical record reveals.  The return
to research has fallen and become more uncertain, resulting in less domestic
product development.  We also observe "approval arbitrage,"  whereby companies
concentrate their R&D efforts overseas where the regulatory burden is less
onerous.  The high regulatory costs and increased uncertainty also deter new
entrants into the drug and device industries, reducing the pool of capital
available for funding new research.  Ultimately, the system as now configured
deprives patients of life-saving and life-enhancing products that never come to
market because the overall costs of innovation have been driven too high.<p>

The slowness of the FDA process for approving products already on the market for
new uses deprives patients and their doctors of critically important information
for long periods of time--long after the scientific evidence is available that a
treatment may be beneficial for a particular condition.  The biomedical research
industry is an information industry, and the FDA's principal functions should in
one way or another be related to getting more information to doctors and the
public.  Yet manufacturers are prohibited by the FDA from disseminating much
valuable information about their products.  Roughly half of all drugs, including
many of those for children, are prescribed for unapproved "off-label" uses,
because doctors believe the evidence shows they are effective in such conditions.
 
The FDA prohibits manufacturers from marketing drugs for these uses until full
evidence is available, presented and reviewed (just as for a new drug).  But such
"supplemental" New Drug Approvals have a low priority for review at the FDA, and
sometimes take longer than for a new drug.3  Thus, for example, manufacturers
cannot circulate to physicians the results of National Institutes of Health
studies of off-label cancer treatments.  At the same time, however, a
pediatrician who withheld a drug from a sick child simply because it was not
labeled for that indication could be subject to a charge of malpractice.4<p>

Yet manufacturers are prohibited by the FDA from disseminating much valuable
information about their products.<p>

The regulation of drugs and medical devices can only be justified to the extent
that there is a net benefit to patients.  With this in mind, the authors of this
report propose a new institutional arrangement to ensure the safety and
effectiveness of new drugs and medical devices.  Our proposed system would
separate oversight of the drug and device development process from the
government's role in maintaining and enforcing legally mandated safety and
effectiveness standards.  The latter functions would be retained in the
government.  Oversight of a product's movement through the various stages of the
development process and review of the scientific studies obtained would be moved
to the private sector, performed by experts at centers of medical excellence and
other private entities licensed by the FDA to ensure they meet necessary
standards and qualifications.  Manufacturers of drugs and devices would have a
choice of organizations to oversee their product's development in light of the
applicable standards.  Competition among these organizations would produce a
lower-cost, faster and higher-quality drug and device development and review
process.  The competitive oversight process would be performed under the same
framework of safety and effectiveness standards as currently exist (in the case
of drugs), or a revised, more rational set of standards (for devices).  This
proposal would expedite the development and approval process for health-enhancing
new products while not compromising safety or government monitoring of the
required safety standards.<p>

<h2>The Revolution in Medical Knowledge and Technology 5</h2>

Rapid advances in information technology are transforming many industries, and
nowhere is that more evident than in medicine.  The combination of computers,
sensors, and imaging systems--CAT and PET scans and MRI--are replacing invasive
procedures and "exploratory" surgery.  Microscopic cameras and microscopic tools
are making Fantastic Voyage seem not so far fetched.  Already, physicians have
tested a "virtual colonoscopy" that couples a virtual-reality imaging system with
a CAT scan.  Without inserting an instrument, the physician can "fly" through the
patient's colon on screen, searching for signs of disease.  In addition to
creating such medical devices, data processing capabilities promise to allow far
more efficient tracking of treatments and outcomes for large numbers of patients,
allowing successful medical strategies to be identified.<p>

This rapid pace of progress in information technology is more than matched by the
explosion of knowledge about the genetic and molecular foundation of life--a
result of the application of the new biotechnology.  This new knowledge provides
us with a far better understanding of the causes of diseases, and a far better
ability to design treatments or prophylaxis.  We can identify a "typo" in an
individual gene and are learning how to correct it.  We are beginning to
understand the complex mechanisms by which genes are turned on and off, and how
cancer, autoimmune and other diseases result when these mechanisms go awry.<p>

This proposal would expedite the development and approval process for
health-enhancing new products while not compromising safety or government
monitoring of the required safety standards.<p>

Modern medical technology enables us to know far more than was previously
possible about the causes and likely remedies for a wide range of illnesses. 
Identification of genetic defects has expanded exponentially; already, two
children with Severe Combined Immune Deficiency6 have been treated with
corrective genes.  The recent identification of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene may
make possible a similar gene therapy approach.  Gene therapy is also being
attempted for cancer, a disease with genetic components.  For more than a decade,
patients have been treated with the protein products of human genes--such as
human growth hormone and human insulin--which are manufactured by genetically
modified organisms that produce the human protein.  There are several advantages
to using microorganisms to manufacture human proteins.  One major advantage of
many of these genetically engineered biologicals is that they can be made to
match perfectly the human version (so that diabetics can use human, rather than
pig, insulin).  In addition, there is no chance of contamination with
adventitious agents, such as viruses (as can be the case when the same product is
obtained from animal or human donors).  Even when the source of the drug is
cultured mammalian cells, sensitive techniques derived from the new biotechnology
permit the detection of even small amounts of contaminants.<p>

When human donors must be used--as is still the case with blood and other organ
transplants--biotechnology supplies sensitive diagnostic tests to identify known
dangerous contamination or tissue mismatch.  New biotechnology-based tests for
exposure to HIV-1 and the hepatitis viruses are essential to assuring the safety
of the U.S. blood supply.<p>

Despite skyrocketing research and development budgets, there has been no
corresponding increase in the flow of new drugs and devices to the market.
Genetic engineering brings special advantages to the production of vaccines.  In
the past, a pathogen most often was either killed or genetically weakened before
being administered.  On occasion, such as the first vaccine for Hepatitis B, the
vaccine was purified from an undesirable source--the pooled plasma of patients
with chronic active Hepatitis.  These preparations required careful quality
control to ensure that each individual batch was both active (as an immunogen)
but contained no adventitious agents.  The new biotechnology allows us to
construct vaccines that do not depend on whole microbes.  Instead, key
components, such as the surface antigen of the Hepatitis B virus, can be
manufactured synthetically through biotechnology.  The new biotechnology thus
offers several alternatives that make vaccines safer and more effective.  For
example, the first genetically engineered Hepatitis vaccine consisted of a single
protein highly purified from baker's yeast, which had been genetically
programmed.<p>

In addition, improved understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of the
immune function has made possible therapies for various auto-immune diseases, as
well as offering the possibility of enhancing the immune response to infectious
agents.<p>

Human gene therapy--the substitution or modulation of genes in a patient's
tissues--offers the possibility of correcting genetic defects, as well as new
kinds of therapies for malignancies, blood dyscrasias, infectious diseases, and
heart disease.<p>

Biotechnology also provides tools for identifying and studying the pathogens that
cause infectious diseases.  While satisfactory progress against AIDS has been
frustratingly difficult to achieve, scientists are vastly more knowledgeable than
they would be without the tools of the new biotechnology.  Other biotechnology
applications in medicine include diagnostic applications based on monoclonal
antibodies and DNA probes, biopolymers or synthetic tissues used for implants,
prosthetics and other clinical uses.<p>

<h2>From Laboratory to Patient--Research and Development in Medical Innovation</h2><p>

Despite skyrocketing research and development budgets--with industry spending $14
billion and NIH spending $11 billion annually--there has been no corresponding
increase in the flow of new drugs and devices to the market.7  The industry's
research spending, after adjusting for inflation, is ten times the level it was
in the early 1960s.  In contrast, the output of approved new molecular entities
has not increased since the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962, and remains far
below the pre-1962 level.  In the medical device field, the number of premarket
approval applications decreased from 78 in 1990 to 40 in 1993, while the time for
approval increased from 609 to 823 days.8  These are sobering facts, in the face
of the large increases in research budgets and the availability of totally new
sciences, such as biotechnology and powerful computing, since the early 1960s.<p>

To the extent that we reduce regulatory costs, we increase the flow of capital to
this market and hence the flow of beneficial new products to physicians and
patients.<p>

The discovery and development of pharmaceuticals and medical devices is a
time-consuming, uncertain process that requires years of expensive laboratory
work, pre-clinical and, ultimately, clinical testing.  It now takes approximately
15 years to bring a drug to the market, at an average cost that has been
estimated at close to $400 million.9  Only a small fraction of laboratory
investigations yield a compound suitable for animal studies, and only a small
fraction of those are in turn promising enough to warrant clinical testing in
humans.  Many years of costs are incurred before there is even a slight chance of
patients receiving new medicines and of companies earning returns on their
investment.  This is of special significance for start-up companies, such as the
many small biotechnology and device firms, which have no products bringing in
revenue while they invest heavily in researching new products.<p>

The enormous uncertainties associated with the R&D process are dominant factors,
not only for biotechnology firms, but for the medical technology sector
generally.  At the most basic level is the scientific risk associated with the
research.  Researchers cannot predict in advance what is going to work, how well
or when.  If the science does work out in some form, and a product can be brought
to market, what will the conditions of the market be?  How much competition will
there be, here and abroad?  Will other scientific developments quickly make this
new product obsolete, perhaps even before it is ready?  Investing in intellectual
property carries its own particular risks, since investors cannot be sure that,
years later, they will still own that for which they paid.  Talented individuals
represent significant assets and cannot be indentured.  Only patentable
inventions have secure value, and the patent process has its own risks and
limitations<p>

Additional uncertainty can be created by government or private health-care
financing rules.  Patients may not have coverage for new treatments (regardless
of whether they are approved by the FDA).  Or the price paid by health care
programs may be too low to fully recover research and development costs.<p>

On top of these significant scientific and market risks, the FDA approval process
creates its own major uncertainties, with respect both to ultimate approval and
the time and expense required to get there.  FDA negativity at any stage of the
process can reduce the value of a firm and raise its effective cost of capital
overnight, especially for small companies without diversified (or even marketed)
product lines.  These regulatory uncertainties reduce the returns from research
and development in the pharmaceutical and device sectors and, therefore, the
number of new therapeutic products that can be developed by individual companies
and, through the investment climate that results, the industry as a whole.<p>

Many costs and risks are intrinsic to the product development process itself. 
regulatory costs are the only component of development costs over which society
exercises control, and some of these costs are clearly avoidable.  To the extent
that we reduce regulatory costs--and the drag they exert on innovation--we
increase the flow of capital to this market and hence the flow of beneficial new
products to physicians and patients.<p>

<h2>From Helping to Hindering the Market--A Brief Historical Review of Drug and Device Approval</h2><p>

Pharmaceuticals regulation always has been appropriately concerned with
information.  Sellers of medical products frequently know more about their
products than buyers, and this can be harmful to the proper functioning of the
market.  But over the years the focus of drug regulation has shifted, from trying
to correct this information asymmetry to the regulator becoming a central
participant in the basic processes of generating and disseminating information
throughout the major phases of a product's development and marketing.10<p>

Attention must therefore be focused on the FDA's approval and oversight criteria
for the NDA and IND processes, respectively, rather than simply focusing on the
final review period.<p>

The purpose of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the first major piece of drug
legislation, was to provide consumers with accurate information about the quality
of products they were purchasing.  False and misleading claims about drugs and
their contents were prohibited, and manufacturers were made liable for
adulterated or misbranded drugs.<p>

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 established the requirement for
the government to be notified before a drug could be marketed.  Manufacturers
were required to test for safety in animals and humans and submit those test
results to the FDA for review.  If the FDA did not disapprove within 60 days, the
drug was cleared for marketing.  The process was far shorter and the FDA's role
more limited than now.<p>

The Drug Amendments of 1962 ushered in the current regulatory regime for drugs. 
First, they required that manufacturers provide premarket evidence of
effectiveness as well as safety.  Second, and most importantly, they changed the
drug approval process from premarket notification to premarket approval.  The FDA
is required to explicitly approve a New Drug Application (NDA) rather than simply
let it become effective through inaction.  Although not required by the
legislation, at this time the FDA decided to exercise control over the clinical
testing phase by issuing new regulations requiring that sponsors submit to FDA a
notice of claimed exemption for an investigational new drug (IND) before entering
into clinical testing.<p>

Thus, the 1962 Amendments marked a major change in the FDA's role in
pharmaceutical regulation--from essentially being a reviewer and evaluator of
information to playing a central role in the conduct of clinical research,
through specifying in great detail the goals of clinical research and the manner
in which it is practiced.  FDA now judges in detail the protocols for the
clinical trials undertaken prior to the NDA, evaluates the data and may require
additional testing.  After approval, the FDA regulates what manufacturers can say
about their products, by ensuring that statements do not venture outside the
approved "label."<p>

There are two kinds of mistakes government reviewers can make:  (1) approving a
product that turns out to be dangerous; and, (2) blocking or delaying a product
that would have been beneficial.<p>

For almost 40 years after the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
of 1938, there was little governmental regulation of medical devices, because of
the general view that drugs and devices are fundamentally different.  Drugs
generally are responsible for specific clinical effects.  Devices more often are
part of a system and usually have no specific clinical effect by themselves. 
Thus, the purpose of an antibiotic drug is to cure an infectious disease and
proof of its effectiveness requires the completion of well-controlled clinical
studies.  The pump that delivers the antibiotic has no specific therapeutic
properties, and cannot be evaluated primarily by clinical experiments.  Rather,
there needs to be assurance that the device will perform as claimed by the
manufacturer.  Devices are thus generally judged by how well they conform to the
manufacturer's description and to established standards.<p>

The process of innovation in devices is also quite different from that of drugs. 
Each drug is a unique compound.  Except for dosage form, drugs are not modified
after they are synthesized or discovered.  Any modification in the structure of a
therapeutic compound produces a brand new entity which needs to be tested anew. <p>

Innovation in devices, on the other hand, is generally incremental.  Experience
in use often suggests very small changes which cumulatively allow for significant
improvements.  A successful drug will remain on the market for many years, while
a successful device may undergo improvements almost continuously.  The rapidity
of device changes has increased as more and more functions are controlled by
software, which is relatively easy to modify.  <p>

For these and other reasons, device regulation throughout the developed world has
differed qualitatively from drug regulation.  The 1976 amendments to the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act marked the beginning of systematic federal
regulation of medical devices.  The law divided devices into three classes. 
Class I devices, which the authors of the law thought would apply to most
devices, were required to have accurate labeling and an orderly manufacturing
process.  No governmental permission was required before marketing.  Most other
devices were placed in Class II.  Such devices also had to conform to
governmentally approved performance standards.  The manufacturer was required to
notify the government before marketing but advanced permission was not required. 
Finally, a small number of devices for which conformance with performance
standards was not sufficient, were required to have prior governmental permission
to allow marketing.<p>

The institutional pressures faced by FDA do not recognize that equal weight
should be given to the costs to patients when beneficial products are kept off
the market.
Most devices have gone through a process that applies to devices that can be
shown to be "substantially equivalent" to products already on the market--the
"section 510(k)" process.  Such devices are put in the same class as the older
predicate device and allowed to come to market.  While the 1976 law merely
required that the manufacturer notify the FDA of this "substantial equivalence"
90 days prior to marketing the device, the FDA has used its power to gradually
convert this "notification" process to an "approval" process and more and more to
extend the 90-day period.  Truly new devices have been placed in Class III and
required to undergo a premarket approval (PMA) process which, with the passage of
time, has become more and more like a drug approval process.  The 1990 amendments
codified what had become FDA practice, making explicit that the FDA had to
approve all devices prior to marketing.<p>

Recognizing the inverse relationship between the length of the approval process
and the effective remaining patent life, and in response to evidence that the
average effective patent life for products subject to the FDA review and approval
process was declining as the development process lengthened, Congress passed
legislation in 1984 increasing patent life for pharmaceuticals and medical
devices for up to five years.  At the same time, Congress gave FDA the authority
to approve abbreviated NDAs for generic drugs, after the period of market
exclusivity expired.  The result was a substantial easing of the requirements for
the approval of generic drugs.<p>

An important corollary of the current drug approval process is that manufacturers
are precluded from disseminating any information on the effectiveness or safety
of their products, unless such data have been included in an approved NDA. 
Similar restrictions apply to manufacturers of medical devices.  Adding new
information to a drug "label" normally requires submitting a supplemental NDA. 
These usually are low priority items at the FDA, since the product is already on
the market, and may take longer than NDAs for new products.<p>

Physicians, however, are free to prescribe approved products for applications
other than those in the NDA, and it is estimated that roughly half of all drugs
are prescribed for "off-label" uses.11  Nonetheless, manufacturers are not
allowed to refer to any published studies, including refereed journal articles or
textbooks, in their promotional materials or to sponsor educational symposia
about new uses.  They cannot, therefore, tell you or your doctor about research
results on such subjects as the effects of aspirin on heart attacks or of
estrogen on cancer.12  Device manufacturers face comparable restrictions in the
kinds of hands-on demonstrations they can offer physicians.  These restrictions
deprive doctors and their patients of valuable information.<p>

<h2>The Development Process for Drugs</h2>

The development of new drugs is undertaken by a sponsor, which typically is a
drug firm, but also can be a federal agency, hospital, clinic or research
institution.  After the synthesis or discovery phase, development generally
begins with the screening of a great many chemical compounds in laboratory
animals to determine possible therapeutic activity and toxicology information.<p>

The percentage of drugs that are first available in the United States is low.
When laboratory and animal studies suggest that a compound may be therapeutically
promising, the sponsor submits an IND to the FDA in order to begin clinical
testing, which introduces the drug into humans for the first time.  The primary
criterion for permitting clinical research to start is whether the overall
risk/benefit considerations warrant research on human subjects.  Currently, the
IND "approval" process occurs in two stages--a review by the FDA and an approval
by an institutional review board (IRB).  All institutions at which clinical
research is performed have IRBs responsible for reviewing whether it is safe for
patients to participate in the clinical study, whether any risks are justified by
the potential benefits, and whether the rights of the patients as experimental
subjects are protected.<p>

At this stage, the FDA also assesses the safety of the proposed research,
performing a comprehensive review of the sponsor's physico-chemical studies of
the product's identity and purity, the animal safety data and the details of the
proposed clinical trial, particularly the dosage proposed.  During the remainder
of the clinical research phase, the FDA continues to review proposals and data in
these three critical areas--physico-chemical, animal and clinical--and, if asked
by the sponsor, advises on an IND program that may result in a successful NDA
submission.<p>

The clinical trial process for drugs consists of three phases.  Phase I trials,
which involve a small number of healthy adults, are designed to elicit
information about "the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drugs in
humans, [and] the side effects associated with increasing doses."13  These tests
are largely intended to provide information pertaining to the product's safety.<p>

If the phase I trials are successful, the sponsor proceeds to phase II trials,
which involve testing the drug on individuals who suffer from the disease or
condition targeted by the drug.  The phase II trials are "conducted to evaluate
the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in
patients with the disease or condition under study."14  In addition, these trials
are intended to assess whether there are unacceptable adverse side effects
associated with the drug.<p>

If the phase II trials show some evidence of therapeutic effect, the sponsor
proceeds to phase III clinical trials involving a larger number of patients who
also have the specific condition or disease addressed by the drug.15  At the
conclusion of this phase, the sponsor submits the NDA, which is a compendium of
all the available data regarding the performance of the drug relating to its
safety and effectiveness.  The NDA must also include information pertaining to
the proposed labeling for the new drug.16<p>

He indicated that American patients are sometimes receiving therapies that are
two-to-three generations behind those available in Europe, Canada and Japan.
The studies performed during the development of a compound are submitted to the
FDA in three sections:  chemistry, manufacturing and controls; pre-clinical; and
clinical.  The clinical section, containing the human safety and effectiveness
data, is clearly the most important.<p>

In evaluating the NDA, the FDA must ensure that the product complies with the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requirements pertaining to safety, and that
"substantial evidence" of effectiveness be demonstrated.  This stage of the drug
approval process is often quite lengthy.  In many cases, delay arises because the
FDA requests new information from the sponsor.<p>

A large part of the NDA review is devoted to ensuring that the data are valid,
representative, correctly analyzed and reported; and to making the final
risk-benefit judgment.  This critical decision determines whether safety and
effectiveness have been demonstrated in the overall treatment group or in any
appropriately identified subset, and what therapeutic claims, directions, dosages
and warnings are to be included in the labeling.  While the evaluation process is
in principle straightforward, it may be complicated by a number of factors,
including the volume of data submitted, the variety of expertise needed to assess
the data properly and the subtleties involved in the balancing of risks and
benefits.<p>

In the long run, most NDA submissions (over 80 percent) are eventually approved
by the FDA, although final approval frequently comes after considerable time,
negotiation and the submission of additional data.17  Reduction in this time,
while desirable, will not greatly affect the overall time required for drug
development, review and approval.  Attention must therefore be focused on the
FDA's approval and oversight criteria for the NDA and IND processes,
respectively, rather than simply focusing on the final review period.<p>

<h2>Adverse Effects of Regulatory Oversight, Control, and Review</h2>

These effects cannot be remedied by tinkering with the current system, because
they reflect a systemic problem.  The skewed institutional incentives faced by
FDA will always cause the agency to err on the side of keeping products off the
market.
The goal of regulatory review of new medical products is to block ineffective or
dangerous products while permitting beneficial ones to go forward.  There are two
kinds of mistakes government reviewers can make:  (1) approving a product that
turns out to be dangerous; and, (2) blocking or delaying a product that would
have been beneficial.  While both types of mistakes impose serious consequences
on patients, they are not viewed as equally serious by regulators.  Victims of
the first type of mistake, approving a product that turns out to be dangerous,
often are very visible, provoking Congressional hearings, public outcry,
sensational media coverage and perhaps damage to the careers of FDA reviewers. 
This "Congressional-fishbowl syndrome" provides a strong disincentive to approve
something that has even a remote potential of having unexpected negative effects.
 Mistakes of the second type, however, often go unseen.  Victims of a delay in or
disapproval of a beneficial product are not readily observed.18  The costs in
terms of morbidity or mortality of the second type of mistake, therefore, are not
readily apparent and are difficult to quantify.  These factors conspire to create
strong incentives for reviewers to err on the side of conservatism and caution,
and to require an overabundance of proof before approving new products.<p>

A regulator can always ask for additional information and increase statistical
precision by requiring additional testing.  And this may improve the chances of
detecting problems in a new drug or medical device, although the returns from
additional data gathering diminish sharply at some point.  The institutional
pressures faced by FDA do not recognize that equal weight should be given to the
costs to patients when beneficial products are kept off the market.<p>

There is a substantial consensus by students of the regulatory process that the
1962 Amendments have slowed the rate of pharmaceutical innovation.  A series of
studies by prominent researchers found that the 1962 Amendments and ensuing
regulations had a significant adverse effect on the introduction of new chemical
entities, after controlling for the influence of other factors.19  Recent data
indicate no diminution in the burdens imposed on the development of new products:<p>

The time required to bring a new drug to market, including pre-clinical testing,
clinical development and regulatory review increased from a low of 6.3 years in
1963-1965 to a high of 16.1 years in 1988-90--an increase of 156 percent.20  The
average time, from synthesis to marketing, for a U.S.-approved new chemical
entity had risen to 15 years by the early 1990s.21<p>

There is evidence of similar burdens from the review process for medical
devices:22<p>

The number of PMA medical device approvals declined steeply in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, falling from 46 in 1988 to a low of 12 in 1992, before rising to 26
in 1994.  At the same time, the average approval time increased from 337 days in
1988 to 823 days in 1994.
During the same period, average review times for premarket notifications
[510(k)s] increased from 78 days in 1988 to 216 days in 1994.<p>

International comparisons provide additional evidence:23<p>

The percentage of drugs that are first available in the United States is low. 
Only 27 percent of drugs approved during 1987-92 were first introduced here; 54
percent were available in a foreign market one or more years before becoming
available here, and 12 percent were available more than 10 years before U.S.
approval.24<p>

While 58 percent of biopharmaceutical products approved in the United States,
Europe or Japan through the middle of 1992 originated in the United States, and
47 percent were first subjected to clinical testing here, only 18 percent were
first marketed here.25<p>

Average development times for pharmaceuticals, including clinical testing and
review times, are 77 percent higher in the United States than in other countries
(9.2 vs. 5.2 years).26<p>

In 1992, the average PMA approval time of 663 working days was more than twice
the time needed in Europe and Japan.27<p>

Medical device manufacturers are increasingly locating research and manufacturing
facilities offshore.  For example, the CEO of a major medical device
manufacturer--responsible for developing pacemaker technology--recently reported
that virtually all of his firm's major products are now being developed, tested
and produced overseas, and, most importantly, are available to patients elsewhere
much earlier than here.28  He indicated that American patients are sometimes
receiving therapies that are two-to-three generations behind those available in
Europe, Canada and Japan.<p>

"[T]he regulation of new drugs by the FDA...has undoubtedly been the most
thoroughly investigated and studied program of government regulation in history."
The largest corporations can, to some extent, absorb and adapt to excessive
regulatory requirements.  But such requirements are most harmful to the hundreds
of small, entrepreneurial companies that make up America's early-stage
biopharmaceutical and medical device industries.  The discovery process in drugs
and devices has flourished most in small, entrepreneurial firms.  Biotechnology
and certain types of medical devices are all particularly suited to the discovery
genius of gifted individuals, and the venture capital community has been quick to
identify such talented idea people and get their companies started.  In the field
of biotechnology alone, more than 1,300 small U.S. companies have been founded to
create products.  Likewise, in the medical device industry, 88 percent of
companies have fewer than 100 employees, while the average expenditure on
research and development as a percent of sales is more than twice that of the
average of all manufacturing companies.29<p>

These companies must cope with a product development process and extremely
detailed set of requirements that have evolved over 33 years of interaction
between the FDA and the large drug companies.  Small companies cannot survive in
an environment where the clinical research and regulatory affairs departments of
large pharmaceutical companies may each have more people than the average biotech
or device company.  The costs and regulatory barriers to entry that are
manageable to a large drug company are untenable to a small one.<p>

These effects cannot be remedied by tinkering with the current system, because
they reflect a systemic problem.  The skewed institutional incentives faced by
FDA will always cause the agency to err on the side of keeping products off the
market.<p>

<h2>A Review of Reform Proposals</h2>

The existing regulatory structure, given the institutional pressures and
constraints under which it operates, cannot be relied on to reform itself.
There have been literally scores of studies into the process by which new medical
products are brought to market, leading one prominent student of the FDA to
observe that  "[t]he regulation of new drugs by the FDA...has undoubtedly been
the most thoroughly investigated and studied program of government regulation in
history."30 <p>

Of the numerous inquiries over the past half century, the more recent ones--the
1982 MacMahon Report (of the Scheuer-Gore Commission on the Drug Approval
Process), and the reports of the Lasagna Committee (1990), the Edwards Committee
(1991) and the Council on Competitiveness (1991)--stand out because of the
qualifications of their panel members, and the depth in which they studied the
problems in the system.  The themes that run through these reports include the
following:<p>

There should be a devolution of the FDA's monopoly over drug and device
evaluation and testing to private sector entities.  This should include
deregulation of early clinical research and an expanded role for IRBs and other
independent oversight bodies of the IND process; expanded use of advisory
committees and other outside experts in the NDA oversight and evaluation process;
and, external review and evaluation of the data in NDAs.<p>

The FDA should be limited by the statutory definition of "substantial evidence,"
and not go beyond it.  The agency should expand approval of drugs on the basis of
"surrogate" endpoints.  There should in general be a more flexible, clinically
relevant interpretation of the approval standard, including expedited approval
for important new drugs, in some cases combined with increased post-marking
surveillance oversight and review process.<p>

The FDA should institute process and management reforms that improve its handling
of the oversight.<p>

The uniformity of the main reform themes sounded by outside review bodies
indicates a widespread consensus on the part of industry, patient groups and
other students of the FDA that substantial problems exist in current system.  The
FDA has substantial flexibility within its current statute to develop and adopt
major reforms.  The fact that this has not occurred--even when the agency itself
has proposed reforms (as in the case of the 1991 Council on Competitiveness
proposals)--suggests that it is not possible for the current system to reform
itself.  Indeed, as discussed elsewhere in this report, the tendency has been for
the efficiency of the FDA's review functions to deteriorate, rather than to
improve.<p>

This paper's recommendations are aimed at the core set of problems that the
distinguished panels have identified, and thus are in the mainstream of
regulatory reform proposals of the last quarter century.  We differ, however, in
recognizing what experience has shown to be the case--that the existing
regulatory structure, given the institutional pressures and constraints under
which it operates, cannot be relied on to reform itself.  True reform requires a
new institutional arrangement for bringing medical products to market.<p>

<h2>A New Approach for Bringing Drugs and Medical Devices to Market</h2>

Any proposal for change should recognize that patients have come to rely on the
third-party stamp of approval that the FDA now confers, signifying that benefits
and risks have been appropriately evaluated and balanced.  Patients will demand
to be equally comfortable with any alternative arrangements.
Any proposal for change should recognize that patients have come to rely on the
third-party stamp of approval that the FDA now confers, signifying that benefits
and risks have been appropriately evaluated and balanced.<p>

Because of the important differences between the pharmaceutical and the device
industries and the ways they have been affected by government regulation and
failures in government systems, we are proposing for them somewhat different
approaches to reform.  The functioning of the pharmaceutical industry has been
impaired by the way the FDA has interpreted and enforced the legal standards,
rather than the standards themselves.  This has resulted in needless
expenditures, delays and roadblocks in the availability of new therapeutic agents
in this country.<p>

The situation with respect to medical devices is somewhat different, as the
standards themselves are flawed.  The 1976 statute (and its later amendments) did
not create a set of logical, consistent requirements.  For example, the 1976 law
created a class of devices (Class II), whose regulation was predicated on
performance standards which did not exist and have never been developed.  Despite
these problems, the system worked well initially, providing relatively smooth
access to the market for low- and medium-risk devices, and only subjecting a
small portion of devices to a premarket approval process.  In recent years,
however, the FDA has created additional requirements for devices, without
providing adequate objective guidelines.  The result often has been regulatory
gridlock and an unpredictability that greatly discourages capital investment and
product innovation.<p>

The proposals we outline below reflect the differences between drugs and devices.
 For drugs, we propose retaining the existing standards, but adopting a new
system for their implementation.  The device approval system needs both a new set
of standards as well as a new method of implementation.  During the last several
years, the European Union has developed a rational regulatory framework.  We
propose that we adopt the best features of this system.<p>

A new framework for bringing new drugs and medical devices to market should
achieve several objectives.  It should:<p>

maintain or improve existing safety and efficacy standards, and thereby maintain
the present level of public trust in the products on the market;
continue to provide for independent review of new products, indicating that the
necessary data have been gathered and evaluated, and that benefits and risks have
been appropriately balanced;
retain the FDA stamp of approval, providing a check that proper procedures have
been followed and standards met;
facilitate the application of cutting-edge scientific knowledge and talent to the
review process; and,
foster competition and management efficiency in the research, development and
oversight process for reform to be meaningful and lasting.<p>

The result should be a far more efficient system that encourages innovation while
maintaining the public's trust.<p>

We believe our proposals achieve these objectives.  Our proposals use the
expertise available in the nation's centers of medical excellence in the
development and approval process by authorizing qualified bodies to perform the
oversight and review functions currently performed by the FDA.  These qualified
bodies would be subject to government standards and oversight, but would compete
to satisfy the mandatory requirements more efficiently and at lower cost.  The
result should be a far more efficient system that encourages innovation while
maintaining the public's trust.<p>

Under our proposal, the FDA would license private entities called Drug (or
Device) Certifying Bodies (DCBs) to assure that these institutions possess access
to the necessary technical expertise (in-house or otherwise), have the necessary
management systems and are not subject to conflicts of interest.31  Sponsors of
products would retain DCBs instead of the FDA to oversee their product's
development according to the applicable statutory standards.  DCBs could draw on
the expertise of, or even be located in, existing centers of medical excellence. 
In the case of cancer therapy, for example, nationally recognized centers, such
as Memorial Sloan Kettering, M.D. Anderson, Roswell Park and Fred Hutchison,
would be prime candidates to participate in the process.<p>

In this way, the drug development process can be opened to a wide range of
skilled individuals and institutions that can perform oversight and review
functions, consistent with maintaining rigorous statutory standards.
National recognition as a medical center would, however, be neither necessary nor
sufficient to qualify as a DCB.  Drug Certifying Bodies would need to supplement
clinical expertise with the services of key experts qualified in the drug
development sciences--including chemistry, biopharmaceutics, biometrics, and
pharmacoepidemiology.  Nor would a DCB need to be in an existing medical
institution.  For example, a company like the Mitre Corporation, which already
has performed the NDA review function (see discussion below) would be a prime
candidate to be a DCB.  The key requirements would be that it meets the licensing
criteria of skills, management and freedom from conflict of interest.  In this
way, the drug development process can be opened to a wide range of skilled
individuals and institutions that can perform oversight and review functions,
consistent with maintaining rigorous statutory standards.<p>

For devices, which must conform to a very large set of design and production
standards, DCBs would more likely be found among recognized testing bodies rather
than among academic medical centers.  Such bodies are currently used for
specialized testing (e.g., electromagnetic radiation), conformance with quality
assurance standards (e.g., ISO 9000) and for qualification for European Union
marketing.<p>

In the case of pharmaceutical development, private entities already have
performed (and perform today) all functions involved in this process, except the
final approval step.  This includes clinical development programs, NDA
preparation and, in the case of seven supplemental "effectiveness" NDAs delegated
for review in 1992 as a pilot project to the Mitre Corporation, the penultimate
review step.  Any of the institutions that currently offers clinical research
services can obtain access to the management and scientific skills necessary to
monitor and review INDs and NDAs.  These institutions include academic health
centers, other hospitals, some managed care organizations and contract research
organizations (CROs).<p>

The development of the CRO industry in recent years illustrates the ability of
the market to fill rapidly this type of need when necessary.  CROs perform a
variety of services for sponsors, including taking charge of the entire drug
development process--from laboratory to NDA submission--either by themselves or
by subcontracting out parts (such as toxicology) that they do not normally
perform in house.  In addition, there is a range of small specialized CROs.  All
these firms follow applicable FDA and other regulations.  There are even
contractors whose sole business is to audit studies and programs, usually for
sponsors, but sometimes for the FDA.<p>

Clearly, an individual CRO could not both develop products and be a DCB, because
of conflict of interest problems.  The same sets of skills are applicable,
however, and the development of CROs illustrates that this expertise is available
in the private sector, along with the key management abilities required for the
performance of these complex tasks.  Arguably, the design, execution and written
presentation of a good IND/NDA program is a much more difficult effort than the
review of it.<p>

Competition between firms would inevitably produce a lower-cost, faster and
higher-quality development and approval process.
An important element of the system we propose is the separation of the
government's current dual roles of review/approval role and enforcement. 
Enforcement, a function more appropriate to a public sector agency, would be
retained in the government.  Reviewing the scientific studies associated with a
new medical product would be moved to the private sector, which, as discussed
above, can assemble the expertise necessary for the task.  The process would,
thereby, be opened to competition.  This framework would encourage the
application of subject-specific, cutting-edge scientific expertise tailored to
individual drug approval projects.<p>

The proposed system would retain government standards and oversight.  Drug
Certifying Bodies would be guided by the same general safety and efficacy
standards for new products as currently exist, and Device Certifying Bodies would
be guided by a new set of rigorous standards (explained in more detail below). 
The DCBs would, however, have flexibility in attaining those standards, and
competition between firms would inevitably produce a lower-cost, faster and
higher-quality development and approval process.  Manufacturers would be required
to hire a licensed certification firm to bring a new product to market.  A final
government review and approval step would also be retained.  There would,
however, be a strong presumption that private certification decisions would not
be overturned without substantial cause, because the private certifiers have been
licensed and operate under government oversight.<p>

Note that this mechanism differs significantly from a system in which the FDA
maintains its current role, but tries to inject competition by contracting out
more of its review functions.  Relative to the current system of in-house
reviews, competitive bidding for FDA review contracts might yield some
efficiencies.  But the FDA's certification monopoly would remain essentially
unchanged.  The FDA would still have the incentive to add costs and time to the
review process, either through requirements imposed on its contractors or through
the procedures followed after receiving the contractors' reports.<p>

<h2>How the Process Would Work For Drugs</h2>

As discussed above, the FDA regulates new drugs at two key points in the
development process, which provide the agency with substantial influence
throughout the process.  First, sponsors are required to obtain approval to begin
clinical trials by submitting an IND application to the FDA, and the agency then
continues to oversee the sponsor's clinical program through regular reports and
other mechanisms.  After the clinical studies are completed, sponsors submit a
NDA to the FDA for its approval.<p>

Under our proposal, sponsors of individual drugs would hire and deal with a DCB,
not the FDA, throughout the development process.  The DCB would have full
responsibility for overseeing and advising on all aspects of the development and
review of individual drugs--from the pre-IND stage through NDA approval.  The
process is outlined and compared to the current process in Figure 1.<p>

A government agency should not simultaneously have regulatory authority over, and
be in competition with, private entities.<p>

The DCBs would apply existing regulatory standards.  The current standards for
clinical research, protecting human subjects and data integrity, and safety and
effectiveness of new drugs are set out in the IND and NDA regulations.  These
documents are clear and can be applied by appropriately constituted outside
review groups.  DCBs could adopt many of the reform recommendations that the FDA
has failed to implement, without changing its existing standards.  Barriers to
early clinical research could be lowered; NDAs could more often be approved on
the basis of reasonable surrogate endpoints; and, post-approval studies could
more often substitute for or supplement pre-approval studies.  All of these are
consistent with the major recommendations made by the distinguished review panels
over the years, and none require any dilution of the existing safety and
effectiveness standards.<p>

When a drug receives preliminary approval by a DCB, the DCB would document the
basis for the approval in a "summary basis of approval" report, which would be
submitted to the Commissioner of the FDA.  This report would document the basis
for the DCB's conclusion that the NDA meets the statutory standards for approval.<p>

Because the DCBs would be licensed by the FDA and subject to its oversight, there
would be a strong presumption that their approval would not be overturned.  The
proposed procedures allow for an FDA veto, however, if the FDA finds the new drug
unsafe or ineffective.  The FDA would review the DCB's own analysis of the data,
and would not be authorized to request new data or testing.32  The FDA would have
to exercise its veto within a fixed time period (e.g., 90 days) after which the
drug would automatically receive FDA approval.<p>

In the event of a FDA veto of a DCB's approval, the sponsor would have the right
to appeal to a specially constituted board of experts operating under government
auspices.  The proceedings of this appeal would be public.<p>

Note that, once this regime is fully established, the FDA could not itself
perform the functions of a DCB.  This is because the FDA would perform licensing
and oversight functions for DCBs, and because the FDA would retain a final
sign-off role in the approval process.  A government agency should not
simultaneously have regulatory authority over, and be in competition with,
private entities.<p>

During the transition, however, the FDA could continue to review products, and it
is important that the transition be structured so as not disrupt the process for
products already in the FDA pipeline.  After a date certain, the FDA's review
function would be expected to cease.<p>

Both the FDA and the DCBs would have a role in postmarket surveillance.  Both
would receive adverse incident reports and both would have authority to recommend
that a product be removed from the market.<p>

<h2>How the Process Would Work For Devices</h2>

The current U.S. system of device regulation is not based on a consistent set of
standards.  Rather, almost all devices go through the 510(k) process, under which
a device can be marketed if it can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a
predicate device already on the market.  The criteria for establishing
substantial equivalence are not, however, well defined by statute.  Moreover,
clear criteria never have been developed for assigning devices to the various
classes, or for the standards that should be applied to each class. <p>

The proposed procedures allow for an FDA veto, however, if the FDA finds the new
drug unsafe or ineffective.
The European system of device regulation, based on the European Council Directive
93/42/EEC of June 14, 1993 addresses these problems.  The Directive contains a
set of general principles to which manufacturers must adhere, including a set of
essential requirements for all devices.  The need for additional requirements
depends on the class the device is in.  Classes are numbered I (least control),
IIa, IIb and III (greatest control).33  In general, low-risk, non-invasive
devices are in Class I, high-risk implanted devices in contact with the central
circulatory or nervous systems are in Class III, with intermediate devices in
Classes IIa and IIb.  In all cases, manufacturers may choose from alternative
methods to demonstrate compliance with the standards.  In general, recognizing
the diversity of medical devices and device companies, the Directive allows the
choice of conforming to various combinations of design examination, production
testing and design and production quality assurance standards, as are appropriate
to assure the safety of the type of device in question.  The emphasis is on
assuring that the device performs in accord with its design requirements.  For
Class I devices, the manufacturer may simply self-declare compliance with the
essential requirements.  For all other devices, the manufacturer must retain an
independent government-certified notified body to certify compliance.  Actual
premarket approval of the specific design of the product (with original or
referenced clinical data) is required only for Class III products.
The substantial tort liability exposure of the pharmaceutical industry is
particularly striking because it is coupled with very strict regulation of the
products themselves for safety and effectiveness.<p>

We propose adopting the best of this system.  Device Certification Bodies (DCBs)
would be licensed by the FDA.  Manufacturers of Class I devices would be able to
self-certify that they have complied with a rigorous set of basic internationally
accepted procedures and objective standards.  Manufacturers of Class IIa, IIb,
and III devices would require a licensed DCB to certify their compliance with a
progressively more stringent set of standards and procedures.  For Class III
devices this would include a mandatory detailed assessment of the product design
itself.  The FDA would review the DCB's design certifications to ensure that
appropriate standards were referenced.  The process is outlined and compared with
the current procedures in Figures 2 and 3.  For all cases there would be a
FDA-administered postmarketing surveillance program to guard against unforeseen
product failures.   <p>

<h2>Product Liability Issues</h2>

Lawsuits against the pharmaceutical industry have long been among the most
prominent liability cases.34  This is not a reflection of corporate
irresponsibility, but rather of the fact that pharmaceutical products are
intrinsically involved in individual health and in the treatment of patients,
many of whom will experience adverse outcomes and even death during the natural
course of their treatment.  The product's use, coupled with the stringent nature
of liability standards, has led to a substantial liability burden that is
unproductive.  For example, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that high
product liability costs were largely responsible for shutting down American
research on oral or parenteral (non-barrier) contraceptives.35<p>

The substantial tort liability exposure of the pharmaceutical industry is
particularly striking because it is coupled with very strict regulation of the
products themselves for safety and effectiveness.  The premarket approval process
for pharmaceuticals is much more extensive than regulation of other consumer
products, such as automobiles, that also generate considerable risks.<p>


By imposing costs on the tortfeasor, the liability system generates incentives
for efficient risk avoidance as well as compensation for accident victims.  There
is a general consensus, however, that the tort system is an inefficient way of
providing compensation.  Litigation costs for both plaintiffs and defendants are
often quite substantial--far higher than usual insurance administrative costs. 
In addition, tort liability forces consumers to, in effect, purchase insurance
through higher prices for coverage that they would not purchase voluntarily. 
Pain and suffering damages and punitive damages are chief among the items for
which individuals would not voluntarily purchase insurance.
Tort liability costs have led manufacturers of certain products simply to
terminate production and leave the marketplace, even where the product occupies
an important niche.<p>

Tort liability can, however, be an efficient way of inducing firms to produce
safe products, but its role in that regard should depend on the other societal
institutions in place.  If the risk level and adequacy of warnings are addressed
through a regulatory structure that ensures that the level of precautions is
efficient, there is no deterrence rationale for having tort liability.  To the
extent that the FDA regulations achieve the social objective of efficient control
of risk, it is duplicative to also perform this function through additional tort
liability.  An obvious exception is when critical information is withheld from
the regulatory agency so that the regulation cannot be set in an ideal manner.<p>

Government regulations can of course be set either too leniently or too
stringently.  The fact that a regulatory program exists does not necessarily
imply that there is no role for any supplementary social institution, such as
tort liability.  In the case of the FDA, however, the general consensus in the
literature on this issue is that the regulations are at least adequate and, to
the extent that there is any divergence from optimality, perhaps excessively
stringent with respect to the promotion of product safety.  Because of this, one
would not want to further deter companies from introducing beneficial new
products through additional tort liability sanctions.<p>

The effects on pharmaceuticals of not having a regulatory compliance defense have
been quite striking.  Tort liability costs have led manufacturers of certain
products simply to terminate production and leave the marketplace, even where the
product occupies an important niche.  An example is the product Bendectin, an
anti-nausea drug for pregnant women.  After dozens of successful defenses against
claims of drug-induced birth defects, the manufacturer simply ceased production. 
Similarly, vaccine manufacturers have exited the market, increasing concentration
in that market, and raising prices well in excess of the inflation rate.  Since
1968, the number of vaccine manufacturers in the United States has dropped by
over 50 percent.36  The U.S. markets for vaccines for polio, rubella, measles,
mumps and rabies are each now controlled by a single producer.  Similar
monopolies exist for many pediatric vaccines as well.37<p>

In contrast to the treatment of pharmaceuticals, the Medical Devices Amendments
of 1976 preempt claims against medical devices.  Indeed, in the recent 1995 case
of Michael v. Shiley, Inc., the court ruled that the 1976 amendments preempt
actions involving negligence, strict liability and breach of implied warranty for
medical devices.38  What is striking about this legal shield, in contrast with
the treatment of pharmaceuticals, is that only a small fraction of devices (i.e.,
those in Class III) are subject to formal premarket approval.<p>

Deterring innovation and promoting market exit is not desirable if these actions
are the result of sanctions that are not linked to a provision of an efficient
degree of safety but in fact are imposed on the firm even if appropriate safety
standards have been met.<p>

One possible counter argument to the regulatory compliance defense is that after
a drug is approved, it may turn out to have adverse effects that were not
anticipated.  However, the task regarding the review of the product for safety
and effectiveness is to make the best judgment possible at the time the product
is marketed.  If new information becomes available to indicate that the product
presents risks greater than initially believed, then the company should be held
responsible for acting upon this new information in a responsible manner.<p>

This way of dealing with new information is the approach taken in Europe with
respect to medical devices in which companies have a "development-risk" defense. 
A company is free of liability in the tort liability regime in all European Union
countries other than Luxembourg if it can show that the "state of scientific and
technical knowledge at the time when [it] put the product into circulation was
not such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered."  This state
of information defense, coupled with a requirement that companies meet the
applicable regulatory standards, ensures that an efficient degree of product
safety be provided both at the time of the product's introduction as well as
throughout the product's life.  Once this has been assured, there is no
additional rationale for augmenting these safety incentives, at least from the
standpoint of risk prevention.<p>

Although regulatory compliance should be a defense against all tort liability,
there is an even stronger argument that punitive damages (above and beyond
compensatory damages) are not warranted if a firm has fulfilled all its
regulatory obligations and has not withheld information from the regulatory
agency.  Once the efficient level of safety has been provided, punitive damages
are not innocuous.  Imposing punitive damages will deter companies from
developing products that are especially vulnerable to large punitive damage
awards, such as oral or parenteral contraceptives, or products intended for
pregnant women.  Similarly, companies will have an incentive to exit the market
altogether in an effort to avoid punitive damages, as has been the case with
vaccines and Bendectin.  Deterring innovation and promoting market exit is not
desirable if these actions are the result of sanctions that are not linked to a
provision of an efficient degree of safety but in fact are imposed on the firm
even if appropriate safety standards have been met.<p>

The framework we propose would make the "off-label" issue much less of an issue,
because it would strengthen the incentives for manufacturers to submit their
products for supplementary approvals.<p>

Except for medical devices, there is currently only minimal recognition of a
regulatory compliance defense.39  With respect to pharmaceuticals, there are only
five states thus 
far--Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Utah--that have provided for a FDA
regulatory compliance defense against punitive damages.  There has been no
federal punitive damage defense, although provision for one is frequently
included in draft bills.<p>

There is no rationale for continuing the distinction between pharmaceutical
products and medical devices in this area.  We propose going beyond the
regulatory compliance defense with respect to punitive damages for FDA-approved
products.  As long as current regulatory standards are maintained, there also
should be a regulatory compliance defense with respect to liability more
generally.  This would make the regulatory compliance defense the same for
pharmaceuticals as it is for medical devices.  The premarket approval system is
much more stringent for pharmaceutical products--and will remain much more
stringent--than for most medical devices.  The criteria involved ensure the
safety and effectiveness of the product based on the best available state of the
information at the time.<p>

The principal requirements for advocating a regulatory compliance defense for any
revised FDA drug or medical device approval process are that the new process
maintain the current safety standards and continue to establish a uniform
warnings vocabulary.  Provided that these two conditions are met, this policy
should be applicable to different institutional structures.<p>

Within the context of this proposal, the DCBs could potentially be exposed to
liability.  If this liability were considerable, it would discourage entry into
the market by responsible entities who were reluctant to assume a large liability
burden or expose their existing assets to such lawsuits.  Although such companies
could have a government contractor defense, this defense in all likelihood would
be limited.  We propose the establishment of a shield against strict liability
lawsuits for DCBs, but that they be liable to lawsuits for negligence.<p>

<h2>The Off-Label Issue 40</h2>

Restrictions on the dissemination of information on off-label uses currently
affect not only the direct distribution of promotional materials, but also drug-
and device-company sponsorship of educational conferences for physicians and
patient groups, to whom it has become a very serious concern.<p>

There are three principal ways to address this issue:  (1) retain the current
restrictions; (2) relax the current restrictions, but establish new rules to
decide what manufacturers can say about their products; and, (3) eliminate all
restrictions.  The first alternative seems clearly unsatisfactory, because it
both repudiates the peer-reviewed medical literature as a means of disseminating
information to the medical community and deprives physicians and their patients
of valuable information.  The second alternative would require the establishment
of new rules to determine which studies and which journals have sufficient
scientific merit to allow information from them to be disseminated.  These rules
would be difficult to develop.<p>

The framework we propose would make the "off-label" issue much less of an issue,
because it would strengthen the incentives for manufacturers to submit their
products for supplementary approvals.  Under the current regulatory system, the
effective cost of submitting products for supplementary approvals is relatively
high.  The FDA has little incentive to give a high priority to supplemental NDAs,
and sponsors have a limited incentive to submit them.  Under the proposed system,
we expect that the costs of submitting products for supplementary approvals would
be significantly lower.  DCBs would have the incentive and the resources to
process supplementals efficiently and in a timely manner.  Some DCBs might even
specialize in supplementary approvals.<p>

Because only products used in approved uses would be eligible for the regulatory
compliance tort liability defense, sponsors would have a strong incentive to
submit products for supplemental approvals.  They would not have a regulatory
compliance defense shield for off-label uses.<p>

<h2>Reaping the Benefits of Biomedical Knowledge</h2>

As a nation, we spend tens of billions of dollars on medical research each year,
the major share of it conducted in the private sector.  The body of knowledge
relevant for medical innovation is increasing at a rapid rate, providing growing
opportunities for therapeutic advances.  In particular, the
"informational-cybernetic paradigm" of modern molecular biology offers the
promise of greater medical gains aimed at the causes of many diseases, not just
their symptoms.41<p>

Our citizens must be confident that they are reaping the benefits of the vast
research establishment our nation has erected--a flow of medical products that
are safe and the best available.  They and their doctors must also be sure they
can obtain the information necessary to make choices about their medical care.<p>

Designing a new system to bring pharmaceuticals and medical devices to the
patient more efficiently is a complex problem, involving interrelated scientific,
economic, institutional and legal issues.  The sectors that create new medical
knowledge are diverse, as are the products they create.  We believe the model
suggested has the flexibility to accommodate this diversity and nourish the
creative process, so that patients will have the innovative new medical products
they need.<p>

<li>The off-label product usage issue is quite complex.  Physicians are not
required to disclose to patients that drug therapies are off-label.  The usage of
drugs for off-label purposes has been the subject of litigation with respect to
insurance reimbursement.  The courts have ruled, for example, that Medicaid
coverage could not exclude AZT therapy for certain classes of AIDS patients even
though such therapy was an off-label usage.  Similarly, high dose
chemotherapy-autologous bone marrow transplants are off-label usages, but
nevertheless some courts have ruled that Blue Cross-Blue Shield must reimburse
such therapies.  Indeed, the New York law expressly forbids insurers from
excluding off-label uses of cancer drugs under certain conditions.  For
discussion of these issues, see Christopher (1993), and Walsh and Pyrich (1994).

threat of litigation remains for new vaccines not covered by the act, such as the
chickenpox vaccine.<p>

<title>Plan to Replace and Improve FDA Approval Process Unveiled -- PFF</title>

<h1>Plan to Replace and Improve FDA Approval Process Unveiled</h1>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
June 19, 1995<p>
Contact: Rick O'Donnell, (202) 484-2312</b></br>

<p>

The Progress & Freedom Foundation today introduced a plan to privatize many
functions of the Food and Drug Administration's drug and medical device approval
processes. The proposal would give experts at centers of medical excellence and
other private entities, licensed by the FDA, oversight of new products' movement
through the various stages of development.<p>

"This plan maintains our current high standards for safety and effectiveness, but
would expedite the process by which health-enhancing new products reach
patients," said Louis Sullivan, M.D., former Secretary of Health and Human
Services and chairman of the Foundation's Medical Innovation Project advisory
committee. "The experience of European countries has demonstrated that
non-government entities can play a very positive role in getting safe and
effective products to patients."<p>

The proposal, "The Future of Medical Innovation:  A New Approach for Bringing
Medical Products to Market," would separate oversight of the drug and device
approval process from the government's role in maintaining and enforcing legally
mandated safety and effectiveness standards. New private sector organizations,
certified by the FDA, would compete to offer a faster, lower-cost approval
process while ensuring that new medical products meet current standards.<p>

"Bureaucratic delays and political inertia have for too long prevented common
sense reform," said Jeffrey A. Eisenach, president of the Foundation.  "Every day
the current system stays in place is another day Americans die needless deaths
and suffer senseless pain.  It's time to replace the current system with one that
makes sense for the 1990s and the 21st Century."<p>

Crafted by The Progress & Freedom Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think
tank, the study was released for public comment and will be refined and expanded
in light of additional findings. The study was researched and produced by a
working group whose members include:<p>

<ul>

Thomas Lenard, Ph.D., Senior Fellow and Director Of Regulatory Studies at the
Foundation<p>

Ralph A. Epstein, M.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and Professor of
Anesthesiology, University of Connecticut<p>

Robert Tollison, Ph.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and Duncan Black
Professor of Economics, George Mason University<p>

W. Kip Viscusi, Ph.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and George G. Allen
Professor of Economics, Duke University<p>

William M. Wardell, M.D., Ph.D., Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation and President,
Protein Engineering Corporation and Wardell Associates International<p>

</ul>

"Many of our drug and medical device companies are able to offer products to
patients in Europe years before they ever receive FDA approval," said co-author 
Wardell.  "Not only does this cause needless suffering and death by denying
patients the benefits of effective medical technology, it hinders many of
America's major industries, thus slowing economic growth and job creation."<p>

The report proposes a new framework for bringing drugs and medical devices to
market, including:<p>

<ul>

<li>Decentralizing the product approval process to encourage innovation and reduce
costs and delays;<p>

<li>Making the approval process more predictable and less subject to bureaucratic
whim and delay; and,<p>

<li>Shifting the cost of the approval process from individual taxpayers to the
corporations that develop and market drugs.<p>

</ul>

"There is a widespread consensus on the part of industry, patient groups and
other observers of the FDA that substantial problems exist in the current system.
True reform requires a new institutional arrangement for bringing medical
products to market, not just tinkering around the edges," said Lenard.<p>

The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a non-partisan research and educational
organization dedicated to creating a positive vision of the future founded in the
historic principles of the American Idea, and to detailing the policies needed to
achieve that future.<p>

<h2>From the Publisher</h2>

<b>VOL. 7, NO. 8 AUGUST 1995</b>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>
<p>
<p>

Over the past two decades, numerous research projects have been conducted concerning the plight of the cities. A myriad of magazine articles, newspaper editorials and television programs have been produced. Countless books on inner cities, edge cities and outer cities (suburbs) have been written also. In fact, public hand-wringing by social scientists and policy analysts about the crises in our urban areas has almost become a national pastime.<p>

Most of what has been written seems to be fairly clear about the problems of the cities, but few, if any, analyses appear to have ideas about solving cities' problems, especially without government programs.<p>

Much of the discourse about the pathologies which exist disproportionately in our major cities--be they unemployment, drug abuse, crime, teen pregnancy, illegitimacy, family breakdown, welfare dependence, poor education, etc. -- flows from the premise that, whatever the problem, there is a government program that can solve it.<p>

Elected officials at the municipal, county, state and national levels have submitted innumerable funding proposals for social welfare, housing, transportation, education, job training, drug treatment and small business projects, believing that money alone can solve the problem. But few have turned to what we call community-based problem solving.<p>

Community-based problem solving is one of the primary tenets of our magazine's political philosophy. We promote the ideal that, rather than look to the federal government to solve local problems, such as crime and education, we can and should develop solutions in our local communities.<p>

Let me explain how this works. First, residents in a community begin meeting with their neighbors to discuss specific problems. They form several groups to examine different aspects of the problem, then group leaders meet and develop a plan. Their planning development may include meeting with leaders from other nearby communities to exchange ideas and see how resources can be shared.<p>

The leaders then begin marshaling the resources to implement their plan, all at the local level. These resources may come from local businesses or the residents themselves. Government involvement should be a last resort, but can be sought if necessary.<p>

Community-based problem solving is bottom up, instead of top down. It operates at the grass roots level and uses a minimum amount of resources because there are no layers of bureaucracy.<p>

Once citizens start operating at the community level, they'll begin asking themselves why they need a big, expensive, intrusive, overbearing federal government in the first place. This is part of the devolution process we're seeing in Washington with the 104th Congress, although it is meeting great resistance from those who don't have faith in citizens to solve their own problems.<p>

When we solve our problems on a local level, then we can truly reduce the size of the bloated federal government. Wouldn't it be nice to stop sending so much of our money to Washington to Support distant bureaucrats who are eager to micro manage our lives? Would it be great to have a smaller federal government in exchange for lower taxes, less regulations and more responsibility at the local level? I think so, what about you?<p>

<h2>Renewing American Civilization</h2>
<P>
<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="40%" VALIGN="top">
For 30 years, America has experienced declines in many of the most basic measures
of cultural health, from out-of-wedlock births, to crime rates to voter turnout.
These developments have coincided with the explosive growth of bureaucratic
government ("the welfare state") and the emergence of a radical challenge to some
of the most fundamental principles of American thought.<p>

Since September 1993, a serious, substantive alternative to this approach has
been offered on over 60 college campuses throughout America in the form of a
college course: "Renewing American Civilization." Developed and taught by
Congressman Newt Gingrich, who holds a Ph. D. in History from Tulane University,
the course is dedicated to describing the underlying principles of American
Civilization and applying those principles to the challenges facing America in
the 1990s and the 21st Century -- including specifically the replacement of the
welfare state with an "opportunity society." <p>

In March, Mr. Gingrich completed his latest course at Reinhardt College, a small
(900 students) liberal arts college just north of Atlanta.

BRAVO, BILL ARCHER
</font></bold><br><p>
  
<font size=+1><bold>W</font></bold>ays and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer is poised to become the greatest
leader of the most powerful panel in the House of Representatives since that committee
was established in 1795.  Archer plans to remake the entire U.S. economy in his image
by writing a brand-new tax code for enactment on January 1, 1998.  With those great
stakes, and that looming deadline, Archer knows he had better do it right.<p>
  <center><bold>Serious Study</bold></center><p>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>he first step in doing something right from scratch is to study the alternative possibilities.  This Archer has begun to do with great solemnity.  On June 6-8, Archer
convened his panel to hear testimony on the national sales tax, the value-added tax
(VAT), the Nunn-Domenici USA Tax, and variants of the Hall-Rabushka flat tax, such as
those proposed by Majority Leader Dick Armey, Presidential candidate Senator Arlen
Specter, and freshman Rep. Mark Souder.<p>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>he results were instructive.  First, the only proposal that underwent direct attack
was the flat tax.  These came mostly from ranking Democrat Rep. Sam Gibbons,
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Leslie
Samuels, an Administration spokesman.  No attack was particularly credible.
  Second, despite a scolding from Archer, the Administration refuses to come up with
a plan, though rumors of White House interest in a "flatter" tax perhaps like the one
Gephardt promised in a forthcoming proposal persist.  Remember that White House
Chief of Staff Leon Panetta actually introduced a Hall-Rabushka variant of his own in
1982.  Last week the White House introduced a balanced budget plan  to the
consternation of Congressional Democrats.  Is a Clinton flat tax next?<p>
  <center><bold>No Sales Tax Bill</bold></center><p>
  
<font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>hird, there is still no actual bill for a national sales tax.  At least one bill expected in
April has failed to materialize, though Reps. Billy Tauzin and Dan Schaefer suggested
their bill might be ready soon.  Why the lag?  The exceptional workload undertaken by
this Congress may be one reason, but the vast engineering difficulties inherent in
creating a credible national sales tax may be another.  The reticence of sales tax
supporters to present any more than an outline plan recalls that of the theoreticians
who constructed the USA Tax.  So long as the proposal remained an abstract exercise,
one took it seriously.  The moment the USA Tax authors revealed their plan would
impose a 40 percent marginal tax rate on single taxpayers' incomes as low as $21,350 -
- less than the earnings of a first-year Congressional aide -- the proposal died.
  Fourth, and most importantly, all are willing to learn.  Aside from a testy exchange
between Archer and witness Jack Kemp, who incurred the Chairman s displeasure by
forthrightly stating that a VAT would  Europeanize  the American economy, the
hearings generally showed goodwill and serious intent by most participants.  
  Curiously, a lot of learning remains to be done.  Some members of the panel clearly
do not understand the difference between a "consumption tax" and an "income tax", or
between a "progressive tax" and graduated rates.  Archer must see that they do.  If he
is successful, his place in history is secure.<p>

<center><bold>Tax Cut Total:  $245 Billion</bold></center><p>
  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n the House-Senate Budget conference, conferees have reached agreement on an
aggregate tax cut number -- $245 billion -- but will leave specifics on most tax cuts to
committees involved in the reconciliation process.  Congress will vote on the plan next
week.
  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n announcing the agreement Thursday evening, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich itemized certain tax cuts which they believe will be enacted
with the passage of a reconciliation bill.  These include a $500 per child tax credit for most
families, capital gains and estate tax relief, IRA s for non-working spouses, small business
tax relief, and possibly some reduction in corporate alternative minimum tax.  According
to staff sources, the family tax credits would be capped but permanent.<P>  
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement will contain more detail than the typical conference report but
less detail than in the House and Senate budget resolutions and committee reports.  The
agreement will make reference in places to committee report language, but the GOP
Leadership s list of illustrative tax cuts will not be made more specific.<P>  
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement walks a narrow  line in balancing family tax relief with incentives
for savings, investment, and economic growth.  Both pro-family and pro-business tax
credits will be needed to maintain the broadbased coalition which has supported the new
GOP majority in enacting provisions of the Contract with America to date.<P>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement calls for $983 billion in spending cuts to provide tax relief while
still balance the budget by the year 2002.  Only the Commerce Department will be
eliminated, while defense spending will be up slightly.  
The agreement appears to reflect House demands for an aggregate total of spending
cuts while preserving the Senate's choices for actual spending cuts.<p>

<center><bold>Two Strikes Against VAT
</bold></center><P>  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n his testimony before the Ways and Means Committee June 7, a leading European
authority on the VAT said that a 20 percent rate would be necessary to replace the U.S.
personal and corporate income taxes.  Dr. Sijbren Cnossen of Erasmus University in the
Netherlands made two additional points which deserve further notice.<p> 
  <font size=+1><bold>F</FONT></BOLD>irst, Cnossen advocates a phase-in period during which both the VAT and income tax
would apply.  Otherwise, economic dislocations would be considerable.  Announcement
effects alone would be  enormous,  he said.<p>  
  <font size=+1><bold>S</FONT></BOLD>econd, Cnossen stated that a transactional VAT which is  unambiguously assessible 
to specific products would be necessary in order to comply with WTO provisions.  This
would apparently rule out the possiblity of a border-adjustable, subtraction-method VAT
as proposed by Rep. Sam Gibbons.<p>

likewise states that it is  not clear  whether a subtraction-method VAT could be made

<P><ul>
<li>Democrats could pick up at least
two U.S. House seats in Georgia under a new electoral map that
increases the number of black voters in several congressional
districts now held by Republicans, party officials said Dec. 15.
<P>
But before they can erase a current
8-to-3 Republican majority in Georgia's congressional delegation,
Democratic leaders will have to overcome two obstacles, including
a potential backlash among black voters.
<P>
In addition, the American Civil
Liberties Union and the Justice Department are expected to appeal
the court-mandated district lines to the U.S. Supreme Court on
the grounds that the plan flies in the face of the 1965 Voting
Rights Act.
<P>
Black politicians, irate over
the loss of two black-majority districts, are threatening to revolt
against white Democratic leaders who they say are trying to negate
minority participation in the political process.
<P>
&quot;Overall, we now have excellent
opportunities to win several new seats,&quot; said Bill Florence,
communications director for the Georgia Democratic Party.
<P>
&quot;As much as I'd like to see
the delegation reversed to 8-3 for the Democrats, I really think
it's going to wind up 6-5. Who will have the majority, I don't
know. But it should break out to be pretty much even,&quot; he
said.
<P>
In the first judicial interpretation
of a new Supreme Court standard on redistricting, a federal court
in Augusta, Georgia, Dec. 13 broke up a concentration of black
voters that put two black members of Congress in office, Cynthia
McKinney in the 11th district and Sanford Bishop in the 2nd.
<P>
The ruling by a three-member judicial
panel pitted two Democrat-appointed judges who signed the plan
against a dissenting Republican. According to the panel's map,
districts represented by Republicans Jack Kingston, John Linder
and Charlie Norwood would have substantial black populations,
opening the door to potential Democratic gains.
<P>
&quot;That would be a kind of
classic white Democratic district of the 1970s and 1980s,&quot;
said Earl Black, a political science professor at Rice University.
<P>
Democrats also believe Bishop
can win reelection in his newly constituted district. The addition
of Macon, Ga., a Democratic stronghold, to the state's 8th district
could tip the balance in their favor there.
<P>
But Republicans and black politicians
say the strategy could backfire if black voters, who make up about
a third of the state's electorate, refuse to vote. The emergence
of black pri-mary candidates also could aid Republicans by leading
to racially polarized campaigns in the general election.
<P>
Linder, who expects to be reelected
in a new Republican 11th district, believes disenchantment among
blacks will be strong enough for his party to pick up new support
from the black community.
<P>
&quot;The blacks, seeing what
the Democrats are doing to them by taking away their seats, are
going to start looking around, I'm convinced,&quot; the Republican
congressman said. &quot;We're going to go aggressively into the
black churches in just the same way black candidates have done
for years.&quot;
<P>
State Representative Tyrone Brooks,
who heads the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials,
said: &quot;The Democratic leaders and those two Democrat-appointed
judges think: 'Well, we'll realign these districts and these black
folks--they're ignorant--they're just going to go out and vote
for the Democrat on the ballot.' That is simply not going to happen.&quot;
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of Georgia
voters will appeal the court-mandated elimination of the two black-majority
voting districts.
<P>
But state officials appeared unlikely
to join the fight. A spokesman for Gov. Zell Miller said the governor
did not favor an appeal, saying the case already has cost Georgia
$1 million in legal fees.
<P>
There was no immediate word from
the lieutenant governor and speaker of the state House, both parties
to the case.
<P>
Laughlin McDonald, regional director
of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he will ask the same
judicial panel to stay the ruling on behalf of district voters,
black and white. But he expects to have to appeal the judge's
decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
&quot;The plan offends basic fairness
and justice,&quot; said McDonald. &quot;We cannot predict the
future, of course, but we think we've got very strong arguments
to present to the Supreme Court.&quot;
<P>
McDonald called the panel's decision
&quot;retrogressive&quot; under the 1965 Voting Rights Act because
it leaves blacks worse off. He said the panel exceeded its judicial
power by drawing up a new electoral map rather than modifying
the former version.<BR>

<P>
<li>
The success of the Million Man March has inspired organizers to
plan an international Million Family March, the Rev. Benjamin
Chavis said.
<P>
&quot;The Million Man March brought
out a spirit of unity in the black community that was unequaled,&quot;
Chavis, former director of the NAACP, said in December after giving
a sermon at First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;It
was natural that we try to build on that success.&quot;
<P>
The event, planned for Oct. 16,
1996, will include simultaneous, satellite-linked gatherings of
black families around the world. 
<P>
Chavis has said previously that
the anniversary of October's Million Man March on Washington will
be observed internationally.
<P>
Chavis, who helped organize this
year's march with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, said
the Nation of Islam will also be involved in next year's project.
<BR>

<P>
<li>
Longtime Texas Rep. E. &quot;Kika&quot; de la Garza announced
Dec. 18 he will not run for a 15th term in the House next year,
saying he felt it was time to serve the public from a different
venue.
<P>
&quot; I feel I can continue outside
of elective office to make a contribution,&quot; de la Garza told
a crowd assembled at the Mission, Tex., Chamber of Commerce building.
<P>
&quot;Helping people is in my
blood and this will never change,&quot; he said. &quot;There are
many more things I would like to do and I want to do them while
I am in good health and young enough--so now is the time.&quot;
<P>
De la Garza, who was first elected
to Congress in 1964, is the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture
Committee.
<P>
He joined several other House
Democrats who have this year stated their intentions to beat a
path to retirement as the party adjusts to minority status in
the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.
<P>
De la Garza told the crowd he
believed 1996 would likely be a watershed in the Congress, as
the battle over the balanced budget is likely to continue well
into this year.
<P>
The congressman, now 68, estimated
it would take all his effort and energy to join that fight.
<P>
&quot;We will work to reduce the
deficit, balance the budget, and at the same time protect Medicare,
Medicaid, health, education, and basic programs for the poor and
elderly,&quot; he said about what will be his last year in Congress.
<P>
&quot;I feel I have to devote
all my energies to this effort and cannot let a campaign detract
from it,&quot; de la Garza said.
<P>
The Republicans now enjoy a 236-197
advantage in the House, with the chamber's one independent, Rep.
Bernie Sanders of Vermont, frequently voting with the Democrats.
<BR>

<P>
<li>
Rep. Walter Tucker III resigned rather than face expulsion after
his conviction on extortion and tax evasion charges, but he admitted
no wrongdoing.
<P>
The second-term Democrat said
in a Dec. 12 letter to several officials that he &quot;unfortunately
was not judged by a jury of my peers and in my opinion, did not
receive a just verdict.&quot;
<P>
However, Tucker said, &quot;itwas never my intention to put the Congress through a vote on expulsion
if I were convicted.&quot;
<P>
Tucker, 38, said his resignation
was effective Dec. 15. Gov. Pete Wilson has called for a special
election on March 26 (same day as the primary elections).
<P>
After announcing his resignation,
Tucker endorsed his wife Robin as his successor. He called his
wife the &quot;person who I know will help this community unify&quot;
and said she has the &quot;heart of the community.&quot; 
<P>
Robin Tucker said her agenda would
include &quot;intensifying efforts to make the 37th District's
streets safer; protecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security
benefits, and improving economic conditions.&quot; She said, &quot;I
am ready to fight for this community, I am ready to stand for
this community, because I know there is something better for this
community.&quot; 
<P>
But Royce Esters, head of the
Compton branch of the NAACP, &quot;dismissed the announcement&quot;:
&quot;We need to get people who are qualified to run for these
offices. They are trying to keep it in the family. Is that the
answer to Compton's problems?&quot;
<P>
Tucker was elected in 1992 to
represent the working-class communities of Compton, Watts, Carson
and part of Long Beach in southern Los Angeles County.
<P>
He was convicted of extorting
$30,000 in bribes while mayor of Compton to support a proposed
$250 million waste-to-energy project. Tucker, who is black and
a nondenominational minister, has claimed he was entrapped by
the government because of his race and his Christian beliefs.
<P>
He is expected to be sentenced
March 18 to a few years in prison, although he faces a maximum
of 146 years and $1.9 million in fines.<BR>

<P>
<li>
A record 32 candidates--28 Democrats and four Republicans--filed
by the Dec. 26 deadline to succeed Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D), who
is resigning effective Feb. 15 to head up the NAACP.
<P>
The field includes state Sens.
Delores Kelley (D) and Nathaniel McFadden (D); Dels. Clarence
Davis (D), Elijah Cummings (D), Salima Mariott (D) and Kenneth
Montague Jr. (D), plus several clergy members, including Baltimore
City Register of Wills Mary Conaway (D) and Rev. Frank Reid III
(D), who leads a 10,000-member church and is the brother-in-law
of Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke (D). 
<P>
The seat has historically been
held by a resident of West Baltimore City, but with a large field
and redistricting that extended the congressional district further
into East Baltimore and Baltimore Co., nothing is certain. 
<P>
The only major candidate with
ties to Baltimore Co.--where nearly a third of the vote lies--is
Kelly. Mfume said he did not think he would make an endorsement.
The special primary is scheduled for Mar. 5.<BR>

<P>
<li>
Freshman state Sen. Henry Stallings II (D) will run for the seat
held by embattled Rep. Barbara-Rose Collins (D-Mich.). Collins,
a former state House representative and Detroit City Council member
who replaced labor activist George Crockett in Congress, has served
Michigan's 15th Congressional District since 1990.
<P>
Detroit analyst Mario Morrow said
the 56-year-old Collins may be ripe for defeat, noting a House
Ethnics Committee investigation into how she has spent office,
campaign and scholarship funds.
<P>
The Aug. 6 primary is tantamount
to winning election in the heavily Democrat district. Other announced
Democrats include Detroit attorney Godfrey Dillard. The filing
deadline is May 13. </ul>

<ul>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="colin"></A>During the past month, family members of Colin 
Powell, who is often touted as a potential running mate 
for the presumptive GOP nominee, Senator Robert Dole, 
have been vocal about their feelings concerning the 
retired general being on the Republican ticket.<P>
Alma Powell says she was frightened by the attention 
generated when her husband was considering a run for the 
presidency--including hate mail and strangers ringing 
the doorbell.<P>
"A black man running for president is going to be in 
a dangerous position," she told Ladies Home Journal in 
its May issue.  "I did not want him to run," she said.  
"I told him that from the very beginning."
"I dont want to describe the hate mail weve 
gotten," Mrs. Powell added.<P>
"You think everybody loves Colin Powell.  Everybody 
doesnt like Colin Powell.  One day I got two letters--
one telling me what a wonderful man I was married to and 
how much the country needed him; the other said Colin 
Powell is a scum bag and proceeded to list all his 
evils."<P>
She added: "Im a very private person and it was all 
a little scary.  Strangers would ring the doorbell and 
ask for Colin."<P>
One man who showed up "said he had driven all the way 
from Florida to beg him to run for president," Mrs. 
Powell recalled.  When asked how he knew their address, 
"the man said hes read that we lived in McLean, Va., so 
he had just poked around the neighborhood, asking 
questions.  That makes you very vulnerable."
She said her husband could accomplish more as a 
private person than as a government official.<P>
A few weeks earlier, Michael Powell, Colins son 
said: "If he didnt want the top job, why should anyone 
think he would want the second job when, in my opinion, 
he could have had it all.  Why would he want to play 
second fiddle?. . .He firmly believes he does not want 
to do this now."<P>
For his part, the retired general has said repeatedly 
that he is not interested in the number two slot.
But some old political hands have said that "if Dole 
presses, Powell could resist only so long."  But Mickey 
Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican and former member of 
Congress, said:  "The point will come when he cant say 
no because he is a man who responds to duty."  But 
sources close to the family said that there was still no 
compelling reason for Powell to run for vice president.<P>
One family friend reportedly said:  "I dont think 
its sufficient to say for Republicans to fail to regain 
the White House [it] is a national disaster. . . Whats 
in it for him?  He doesnt need money; he doesnt need 
any of them.  They have nothing to give him, nothing to 
offer him.  Any decision he makes is based on pure 
conviction."<P><A NAME="tenn"></A>
<LI>Saying he wants "to go out on top," Democratic 
Congressman Harold Ford announced Apr. 11 he would not 
seek re-election to a 12th term.
The Tennessee Democrat joins 27 other House Democrats 
and 17 Re-publicans who have decided to retire from the 
House while a record 13 senators, including five 
Republicans and eight Democrats, are making an exodus 
from the Senate.  <P>
Fords departure creates an open seat and clears the 
way for his Republican challenger, Rod DeBerry, to pick 
up where he left off in the 1994 election.  DeBerry 
received 42 percent against Ford in 1994 and is running 
for the seat again this year.  Tennessees 9th 
Congressional District includes most of Memphis and a 
small part of suburban Shelby County.<P>
"I want to go out on top.  I think the public opinion 
polls show Im stronger than ever in my career," said 
Ford when he announced his retirement.<P>
But Ford, 50, said that after 22 years in Washington, 
it was time for a new face to represent Tennessees 
ninth district and that it was time for him to return to 
Memphis and be a part of that city.<P>
Ford has rarely faced a serious challenge for re-
election.  He was indicted on federal bank fraud charges 
in 1987 and was re-elected three times before he was 
acquitted at trial in 1993.<P>
The Democratic congressmans attempt to pick his 
successor--his 26-year-old son, Harold Jr.--has placed 
him at odds with Mayor W. W. Herenton, who says the 
younger Ford lacks the experience to represent Memphis 
in Congress.  Ford Jr. is about to graduate from the 
University of Michigan law school.<P>
Herenton has accused Ford of using "his political 
clout to exploit the economically downtrodden and divide 
the city for his political gain."  The Memphis mayor is 
organizing a committee to find an alternative candidate 
for the Democratic primary in August.<P>
While nepotism is practiced regularly in politics, it 
has had limited success in Congress as far as electing a 
retiring Congressmembers spouse or children.  Most 
recently, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has never held 
elected office, helped his son, Jesse Jackson, Jr., get 
elected to Congress from Illinois.  But Rep. Walter 
Tucker III (D-Calif.), who resigned in December rather 
than face expulsion after his conviction on extortion 
and tax evasion charges, failed in getting his wife 
elected to his seat, even after he endorsed her as his 
successor.<P>
<A NAME="SJC"></A>
<LI>The Supreme Court handed the Republican Party of 
Virginia defeat March 27, ruling that it must get 
clearance under the Voting Rights Act to charge a fee to 
delegates who want to attend a nominating convention. 
The 5-4 decision also allowed three former University of 
Virginia law students to file suit in federal court on 
the grounds that the $45 fee charged for the 1994 
convention which nominated Oliver North amounted to a 
poll tax.  <P>
Two of the students who challenged the fee refused to 
pay and did not attend the convention; one was given 
money by the North campaign and did attend.  E. Duncan 
Getchell, Jr., an attorney for the Virginia GOP, said he 
hopes that as the law continues to develop in this area 
that the views of the dissenters will prevail. <P>
The high court overturned an earlier decision made in 
federal court, which held that the federal clearance 
only applied to primaries, not nominating conventions; 
the court found the convention to be tantamount to a 
primary.  Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, wrote one majority opinion, while 
Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day OConnor and David 
Souter joined in separate opinions to complete the 
majority.  Dissenting were Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia 
and Clarence Thomas. <P>
Thomas and Scalia accused the majority of trampling 
political parties freedom of association.  But the 
practical impact of the decision may be limited because 
only Virginia and Alabama, among states subject to pre-
clearance, authorize party conventions for choosing 
nominees. <P>
This year the Virginia GOP is scheduled to have a 
primary.  The choice of whether to hold a primary or 
convention is given to the incumbent in Virginia, and 
Sen. John Warner (R) chose a primary, a choice widely 
regarded as one that enhances his chances of getting the 
nomination against the opposition of more conservative 
party leaders.<P>
<A NAME="church"></A>
<LI>As a result of the efforts of Edmund Peterson, 
chairman of Project 21, a Washington, D.C.-based public 
policy group promoting conservative black leadership, 
several Republican members of Congress have signed and 
forwarded a letter to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno 
urging her to investigate the bombings of black churches 
in the South which have occurred over the past few 
years.<P>
"We are gravely concerned over news reports of a wave 
of church burnings in several southern states," began 
the letter, which was dated Mar. 1.  "Eleven churches 
have been vic-timized by arson since last December 22, 
and a total of nineteen churches have been burned since 
the beginning of 1995."<P>
"We urge you to mobilize the resources of the Justice 
Department, to the extent possible under the law, to 
help state and local law enforcement agencies apprehend 
and convict the perpetrators of these acts," the letter 
continued.<P>
The letter was signed by several GOP Congressmen from 
Southern states, including Reps. Sue Myrick of North 
Carolina, Curt Weldon of Florida, Lindsey Graham of 
South Carolina and Charlie Norwood of Georgia.  Others 
signing the letter included Reps. J.C. Watts and Steve 
Largent of Oklahoma, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho and James 
Talent of Missouri.<P>
Peterson, who has been pleased with the response of 
the legislators to his request thus far, said action by 
Congress is imperative.  "We must not forget that 
churches are more than buildings; when churches burn, a 
piece of our freedom is also extinguished in flames of 
hatred."<P>
<A NAME="perot"></A>
<LI> The most recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll showed 
Ross Perots current support is younger, poorer and less 
educated than they were in 1992--and that could be bad 
news.  The poll shows he is losing support among those 
most likely to vote: older, wealthier and more-educated. 
Perots support is down to 16 percent from the 19 
percent he received in 1992, but is growing among women 
and minorities, which his supporters argue indicates 
Perots message is resonating among a broader spectrum 
of the electorate.  Perots recent speeches on college 
campuses in Texas and Florida are part of an effort to 
attract younger voters who seem to be gravitating more 
towards Perot than they did in 1992. <P>
Reform Party Director Russ Verney called college 
campuses "fertile territory," because they are populated 
by first-time voters with no party allegiance.  Young 
voters also tend to be most frustrated with Congress 
failure to pass a balanced budget amendment, reform 
Medicare and Medicaid and approve term limits.  Young 
voters are also concerned about corporate downsizing and 
international trade deals they fear have shifted jobs 
abroad.<P>
Democrat pollster Peter Hart said:  "All I would 
simply tell you is it is a very different electorate 
that is going to be with Ross Perot in 1996 than was 
there in 1992 and a lot of these new voters would be in 
Bill Clintons column if Ross Perot were not on the 
ballot."  <P><A NAME="cc"></A>
<LI>Nationally syndicated radio talk show host and 
outspoken urban activist Rev. Earl Jackson has been 
named National Liaison of Christian Coalitions Urban 
Development Program.  Jackson will play a lead role in 
explaining the mission of the pro-life, pro-family group 
to minority voters and will work to expand the 
distribution of the Christian Coalitions non-partisan 
voter education material in African-American churches 
across the country.<P>
"We have been working for years to carry our message 
into minority churches," said Ralph Reed, Executive 
Director of the Christian Coalition.  "With Rev. Earl 
Jackson on the team, our urban development program will 
reach even greater numbers."<P>
Jackson, a Baptist minister, Harvard Law School 
graduate and host of the nationally syndicated radio 
talk show, "Earl Jackson Across America," started work 
with the Christian Coalitions Urban Development Project 
at the end of March.<P>
Presently, there are 250,000 churches distributing 
Christian Coalitions non-partisan voter education 
literature.  Approximately 10 percent of those churches 
are minority houses of worship.<P>

WASHINGTON REPORT

<ul><li>Black conservative groups said January 15 they are working closely with Congress to develop legislation that brings back traditional family values and improves the government's approach to 
helping the poor.<p>
&quot;The year 1996 has the potential to go down in history as the year of real change in government policy,&quot; said Star Parker, president of the Coalition on Urban Affairs, at a press conference in downtown Los Angeles.<p>
In response to a Black Contract with America sent to Congress by black conservatives in early 1995, House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed a Minority Issues Task Force to organize hearings and policy development on minority issues.<p>
The task force developed the Project for American Renewal, which outlines several family and community empowerment bills scheduled for congressional votes by mid-spring.<p>
One example is the Family Reconciliation Act, which requires counseling and a waiting period for divorces involving children under 12 years old, and eliminates public funding for divorce except in cases of abuse.  The government-funded Legal Services Corp. provides help to the poor for divorces.<p>
Jesse Peterson, founder of the Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny, said the black community needs to focus on the family and teach children to work and be self-reliant, not depend on government programs like welfare.<p>
&quot;People who are on welfare should be required to work--we need to move away from having government do everything, since it rarely does anything well,&quot; Peterson said.<p>
Peterson said conservatives in Congress realize the current system is &quot;a miserable failure&quot; and are suggesting a more grassroots effort to help single parents through their family, church and community.<p>
Another bill would allow low-income families to receive vouchers that enables them to send their child to the public or private school of their choice, instead of forcing them to attend academically poor inner-city schools.<p>
&quot;Granting parents the ability to choose the best school for their children is the best measure we can take to improve the quality of education in the public schools,&quot; said Americans for Family Values founder Ezola Foster.<p>
&quot;It is the first and most important step to take,&quot; said Foster, who is also a Los Angeles public school teacher.  &quot;Not surprisingly, it is not the liberals but conservatives in Congress who are proposing we take this step.&quot;<p>
Edmund Peterson (not related to Jesse Peterson), chairman of the black leadership group Project 21, said he and the other black conservative leaders chose Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday to discuss their political agenda to encourage people to reflect on issues of family 
values.<p>

<li>The Justice Department said Feb. 7 that it is investigating whether fires set to black churches in Alabama, Tennessee and unspecified other states were racially motivated.  &quot;We take these matters very seriously,&quot; says the department's Myron Marlin.<p>
Arsonists have damaged at least 17 churches in Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas since January 1995.<p>
Pro football star Reggie White is an associate pastor of Inner City Baptist Church in east Knoxville, Tenn., which was destroyed Jan. 8.  Arsonists left racist messages at the scene.  The 124-year-old Salem Baptist Church near Fruitland, Tenn., had been set ablaze a week earlier.<p>
Edmund Peterson, chairman of Project 21, a Washington, D.C.-based public policy group  promoting con-servative black leadership, addressed a letter to Republican members of Congress asking them to speak out as public servants against &quot;this threat to the religious rights of millions of Americans.&quot;<p>
 	&quot;In the past, the press has portrayed Republicans as uncaring of minorities and their concerns,&quot; the letter continued.  &quot;This is an opportunity for Republicans to prove them wrong once again.&quot;<p>

 <li>	As Washington policymakers struggle to find solutions to America's major social problems, they should consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving them, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.<p>
In a paper released January 25, Patrick Fagan, an expert in family and social issues at Heritage, says nearly every major study on the impact of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social problems.  Religion, the majority of studies onclude, &quot;is the resource 
that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation,&quot; according to Fagan, the William H.G. FitzGerald fellow.<p>
Fagan presents a summary of the social science literature, which reveals that religious practice strengthens the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal moral judgement; and inoculates individuals against such social problems such as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, 
crime and divorce.<p>
&quot;Renowned historians and philosophers have always known that the character of a social order is, in larger part, determined by its religious roots.  Social science cannot prove that religion, or religion in any varying expressions, is true. But the professional literature of the modern social sciences has shown religious practice to have positive social consequences,&quot; Fagan says.<p>
Another important study of strong families, conducted in the 1970s and 1980s by a pair of University of Nebraska professors, found that &quot;84 percent of these families identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families.&quot;  The same study also indicated that 
&quot;parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidance.&quot;<p>
Ongoing studies by Arizona State University West demonstrate that religious belief and practice encourage optimism among socially at-risk children.  Among the findings: Students who attend church weekly or more frequently are more optimistic about their futures; have better relationships with their parents; are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals; and are more likely to see themselves in control of their own futures, not as victims of oppression.<p>
Armed with such evidence about the positive benefits of religious practice, Fagan says it is time for policymakers to stop ignoring the role religion plays in the welfare of the nation.  &quot;Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births and their resultant effects, such as huge social 
and economic costs, this research should be of major interest to policymakers,&quot; he says.<p>

<li> The House voted Jan. 31 on a bill that would create a $5 million private school choice program in Washington, D.C.<p>
Low-income students would be eligible for private school scholarships of up to $3,000 a year for tuition and $1,500 for after-school activities "to enhance their achievement," according to a summary of the deal finalized by House and Senate negotiators.<p>
One key change from the House bill would give Washington's city council veto power over the parameters for allocating scholarships, the summary said.<p>
Students whose family income is below the poverty level would qualify for $3,000 scholarships, and students whose family income is 85 percent above the poverty level could get up to $1,500 for tuition.<p>
&quot;It will give these kids and their parents a choice that they've never had. This will also, in my opinion, be the catalyst to transform the district's public schools into better educational institutions,&quot; said Rep. James Walsh (R-N.Y.) chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
the District.<p>
But Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said he was concerned the bill would set a national precedent.  &quot;As soon as this bill is passed, you are then going to see organizations with an ideological agenda who will begin to pressure each and every school district in the country to follow the same model.&quot;<p>
The 2,000 vouchers are a small element of a 14-point reform package that is designed to arrest the appalling deterioration of the District's public schools.  Despite annual expenditures of $9,549 a year on each student, more than 50 percent of the district's high school seniors are 
functionally illiterate when they graduate.  Several local officials, including three city council members and the superintendent of schools, support the vouchers as a last-ditch effort to save some students.  Other reforms in the bill include the creation of 10 independent charter schools 
and a public boarding school, along with a requirement that students not be promoted to the next grade if they aren't prepared.<p>
But the voucher provision has attracted the ire of the National Education Association, which views the concept of parental choice with disdain.  Its favorite Senate Republican, Jim Jeffords of Vermont, grimly refused up until recently to let the entire D.C. appropriations bill out 
of a committee unless vouchers were stripped out and put to a separate vote.  But Senator Jeffords didn't count on the determination of D.C. parents and choice supporters.<p>
The D.C.-based Center for New Black Leadership noted that Senator Jeffords supported an existing voucher program in Vermont at the same time he was blocking similar opportunities for District children.<p>  
Two black parents, Karen Walker and Zaneta Simms, traveled to Vermont to accuse the Senator of &quot;standing in the schoolhouse door and telling black children they can't get in.&quot;  A group called the Coalition to Educate America flooded Vermont airwaves with radio ads featuring a plea from the two D.C. parents.<p>
Senator Jeffords called the ads &quot;garbage&quot; and said they had no effect on him.  But shortly after they began hitting the airwaves he accepted a compromise that gives the D.C. city council veto power over whether any money can be used for vouchers.  An attempt to strip vouchers 
from the bill failed in the House on a vote of 232 to 180.<p>
The Senate will vote on this measure on or around Feb. 27.  &quot;Now it is up to Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole to ensure there are enough votes for the bill,&quot; says Kevin Teasley of the Coalition to Educate America.</ul><p>

<h2>A Progress Report on
The Future of Energy Transmission</h2>
<i>October 17, 1995</i>
<P>

<h3>Experimental Economics in Electric Power Deregulation</h3> 
</center><P>


In an effort to understand how to create competitive markets in electric energy, The Progress & Freedom Foundation recently arranged for a workshop in computerized economic experiments at the Economic Science Laboratory (ESL) at the University of Arizona.
<P>
Participants, seated at their own computers, were given self-paced instructions for a simple double auction experiment. They were divided into two groups, buyers and sellers, who could trade a fictitious commodity. The sellers were given information about their costs of production and buyers were given information about  their opportunity for reselling the fictitious commodity. Each individual had an opportunity to make a profit by receiving revenue greater than his/her costs (or purchase price) or incur losses by receiving revenue less than his/her costs (or purchase price). Each participant was free to trade several units each period and the experiment lasted ten (10) trading periods. Buyers sent their bids and sellers sent their offers via a computer network, and any participant could accept outstanding bids or offers.
<P>
After this experiment, the workshop director, professor Vernon Smith, explained the principles of experimental economics and the use of experimental methods as an analytical tool for assessing the success of various price mechanisms and institutions in achieving economic efficiency.
<P>
Following the discussion of the double auction experiment, the participants returned to the laboratory where they were involved in a second, more sophisticated experiment (this time with actual monetary payoffs) that simulated real-time trading in an electric power network. 
<P>
The participants in this experiment were divided into two groups.  One group was involved in an experiment with inactive or passive transmission ownership. The second group was involved in an experiment with active transmission owners. In the first group, the participants were divided into those who generated power and those who consumed power. The participants who generated power each were given information about their costs and transmission losses. Those who consumed power were given information about their resale possibilities. Participants were paid their profits, i.e. difference between their costs and revenues. In the second group, there were generators, consumers and some participants who actually owned transmission assets. 
<P>
Through twenty trading periods, buyers and sellers submitted both quantities of power they wanted to buy/sell and the prices they were willing to pay/accept for it. In the second group transmission owners also submitted offers. The computer algorithm or central dispatch calculated the optimal (i.e., value maximizing) prices and allocations and communicated them back to the subjects who could continuously make adjustments in their bids and offers.
<P>
What participants learned from the experiments both present and past, as well as from the discussion that followed, was the impact different market structures and institutions (i.e., the presence of power marketers, transmission line constraints, possibility of demand side bidding) have on both market efficiency and on the distribution of profits among groups of agents.
<P>
There was a discussion on the long-term versus spot markets for power and the difference between financial and physical contracts for power delivery. ESL is developing a market model where all physical flows are organized around the spot market. This is a concept based on property rights (i.e., rights to inject, transmit and withdraw power within the transmission network).
<P>
Another property rights question addressed was the difference between trading power through the pool or via bilateral contracts among generators, transmitters and consumers. The topic centered on the enforcement of property rights in a proposed pool mechanism.
<P>
Next came a discussion of the so-called "stranded investment" problem. Vernon Smith presented his proposal on this issue: A fixed (but declining) annual fee charged during a transition period to all utility customers. The fee would be calculated each year so as to reflect the utility's current depreciated value of "stranded" assets. This solution might resolve the utilities' stranded investment problem without distorting price signals and without creating any barriers to customers wishing to switch to more efficient producers.
<P>
There was nearly unanimous agreement among the participants that additional experimental work on a number of policy issues including pool versus bilateral trades and active versus passive transmission pricing would provide useful input into the public debate over electric energy policy.
<P>
The ESL experiments were the kick-off event for PFF's project on "Creating Competitive Markets in Electric Energy."  They were part of a two-day technical workshop held September 19 and 20, 1995, in Tucson. The participant group consisted of industry representatives and PFF staff. The objectives of the seminar were: 
<ol>
<LI>to introduce the industry representatives to the power of experimental economics, and in particular the ESL variant of this technique, to inform the debate concerning deregulation of electric power.
<LI>to provide industry representatives with PFF's overall conception of regulatory reform and of the transition to a more competitive electric industry; and,
<LI>to provide a forum in which industry representatives and the PFF study team (including Vernon Smith and his group) could discuss technical details concerning the institutional framework necessary to create competitive electric energy markets and the policy issues surrounding them.
</ol><P>
In addition to the ESL experiment, the workshop heard from Charles Bayless, CEO of Tucson Electric Power Co. and Lewis Harris from Edison Electric Institute. Bayless talked about a fast track to a competitive industry and Harris discussed the recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by FERC concerning transmission pricing and stranded costs and proposals on recovery of stranded investment. 
<P>
<i>This progress report was prepared by The Progress & Freedom's "Creating Competitive Markets in Electric Energy" project, led by senior fellows Michael Block and Thomas Lenard.<P>
 This is a progress report on The Future of Energy Transmission Project, which is designing a replacement for the current Federal regulatory regime that places artificial constraints on the structure, scope and activities of electric power producers.  Introducing true competition to the electric energy industry in the United States will greatly enhance American productivity and competitiveness by lowering the costs of a vital resource for America's business and families.

<body>
<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>April 1996</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>


     It is a widely held conception that our two-party political system, with its attendant peaceful transfer of executive power, makes it one of the world's most stable and reliable.  Yet, with this stability, a significant portion of the American electorate has become restless, feeling that neither major party is filling the bill.  <p>
     In our February edition, we examined the Republican Party's apparent lack of balance in advocating getting the federal budget's house in order with an equal compassion for the less fortunate.  In this edition, we examine the Democrats' resistance to changing the way the federal government works, and a myopic view that all problems can be solved by simply implementing new government programs or instituting more expansive government regulations.<p>
     A classic example of the Democrats' proclivity for the status quo is contained in a Feb. 27 speech delivered by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt to the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C.  The theme of the Missouri Congressman's remarks was job and wage insecurity, in particular, and the American economy in general.  Gephardt stayed true to form regarding the Democrats' world view and political approach.<p>
     First, the Democrats' strategy is to frighten the American public or capitalize on already existing fears.  In Gephardt's speech he described the "endangered middle class," implying that our nation's huge middle class is on the verge of extinction.  He also said "an estimated 1,200 Americans los(e) their jobs every single day," implying that they remain perpetually unemployed thereafter.<p>
     Yet, Clinton and Democrats have recently taken credit for millions of new jobs created since Clinton took office and a falling unemployment rate.  In other words, they are trying to have it both ways. 
     Second, while frightening the American public, Democrats identify the culprits causing such public angst as either Republican policies, "the rich," or "deep cuts" in programs which, in most cases, are not cuts at all, but simply decreases in the rate of growth.<p>
They then convince the American public that Democrats, through government programs and policies, can, in Gephardt's words, "guarantee a good life."  Based on Biblical teachings, even God does not guarantee us a good life.  But somehow Democrats want us to believe that they can. 
     <p>The President made a similar assessment in a Mar. 17 speech before the United Jewish Appeal, in which he said the government should "guarantee the American dream to everyone who wants it."  
   <p>  Democrats just don't understand that a guarantee and a dream are, by definition, mutually exclusive.  Also, dreams are individual, so how can the government guarantee each individual the dream he or she desires?
     <p>Another characteristic of the Democratic approach is that it operates under a false premise.  In the party's scenarios, business owners are always evil and workers are always virtuous.  Having served in both capacities for nearly equal amounts of time, I can honestly say this is completely inaccurate.
     <p>There are business owners who bend over backwards to protect their employees jobs and wages, and there are workers who are downright lazy and incompetent.  But the Democrats' scenarios never allow for the broad spectrum represented on both sides of the worker/management divide.
     <p>In his speech, Gephardt concluded that our political system is unresponsive, leading people to turn away from politics altogether.  But, truthfully, our political system and our politicians over promise and, when they don't deliver, people, in turn, become cynical.  The House Minority Leader is himself, perhaps unwittingly, an example of the very thing that is wrong with the system.  According to him and his fellow Democrats, the solution is always more government, but they consistently ignore the costs and impact of their proposals.
     <p>The principle that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, seems to completely escape the realm of the Democrats' understanding.  It appears that they think their policies are enforced in a vacuum; that there is no resultant impact on corporate behavior, worker behavior or consumer behavior.  Either they are naive or ignorant, neither of which is a desirable trait.
     <p>For example, one of the proposals Gephardt advances as a solution to worker insecurity is to bar the federal government from offering contracts to companies that do not offer basic health and pension benefits to workers.  This sounds good, but it will have at least two immediate impacts.
    <p> One is to increase the dollar amount of all federal government contracts, since corporations which have generous benefits packages also charge higher prices for their services or products.  Another impact is that is will eliminate most small businesses from doing business with the federal government, since they generally cannot afford to provide health and pension benefits until they increase in size, revenues and profits.
    <p> In this edition of Headway, three contributors critique the Democratic Party.  All three have been Democrats themselves at one time or another, but two left the party within the last several years precisely because of its seemingly congenital attachment to government solutions.  The other calls himself a "lifelong, yellow dog Democrat," who is proud of the programs Democrats developed in the past and seems to be hopeful that the American public will turn to them in the future if times get tough.

<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p><ul><li>The Million Man March spearheaded by Nation of Islam
Minister Louis Farrakhan and Benjamin Chavis, former executive
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, is now in the history books.
<P>
According to U.S. Park Police, a throng of 400,000 mostly black
men filled the Capitol lawn and beyond on Oct. 16, making it the
fourth-largest demonstration in Washington, D.C. history. March
organizers, however, dispute the government's figures, and plan
to file a lawsuit to get the figures corrected to, what they believe,
is closer to one million.
<P>
It is always difficult to gauge large crowd figures such as these,
but, from appearances, it seems that the march organizers are
probably correct that the figure was underestimated.
<P>
At any rate, the massive showing of black men who attended for
various reasons--nearly all of them positive--heartened supporters
and convinced many skeptics that, even with the presence of Farrakhan,
much more was gained than lost.
<P>
Most black conservatives did not support the march initially,
precisely because of the controversial Muslim leader's involvement
and the potential for increased racial division as a result of
the march. But, it appears that most of them were swayed, not
by Farrakhan, but by the sincerity and purpose of the men who
participated in the historical event.
<P>
&quot;You can denounce Farrakhan until the cows come home, but
you cannot argue with the fact of how he has improved the quality
of lives of men in these inner cities--something that the churches
have not done for quite some time,&quot; said syndicated radio
talk showhost Armstrong Williams during a FOX Morning News interview the
morning
following the march. &quot;We all can be better people as a result
of what happened, because it was very peaceful--and I think it
will make a difference in this country.&quot;
<P>
The real test of the march's success, however, will be what takes
place in communities across the country in coming weeks and months.
March participants vowed to go back to their neighborhoods as
more responsible and committed citizens, registering their friends
and families to vote and being more determined to give something
back.
<P>
If they do, indeed, get more involved in uplifting their communities,
it will be reflected in decreased crime figures, increased education
rates and the formation of more intact families.
<P>
Interestingly, since the march, the mainstream media has been
scratching their collective heads to determine whether Farrakhan
is now the leader of black Americans. As has been the rule in
the past, they appear obsessed with selecting one individual as
the leader of all black people, perhaps because this means they
only have to interview one person when they want to know what
&quot;black America thinks.&quot;
<P>
They just don't get it. Blacks are just as diverse in their opinions
as are other groups and one single leader will not suffice.
<P>
<p><a name="comm"></a>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p><LI>Before the ink was dry on stories concerning the march,
liberals were quick to call for yet another presidential commission on race
relations. The request, which was in the form of a letter to President
Clinton, was signed by a well-meaning, but misguided, bipartisan
cast: Democrats Charles Schumer and Charles Rangel of New York,
John Lewis of Georgia, and Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District
of Columbia, and Republicans James Leach of Iowa and Bill McCollum
of Florida.
<P>
Many references have been made to the Kerner Commission report
which revealed (surprise, surprise!) that the nation was moving
toward two separate, unequal white and black societies. The commission
was created by President Lyndon Johnson after several urban riots
in 1968.
<P>
Politicians tend to call for commissions on subjects with which
they prefer not to handle directly. By getting a commission to
study the problem, they can appear to be doing something without
actually doing anything.
<P>
In the 1960s, liberals spent federal funds to find out what any
thinking person on the street could have told them: Our country
began as two separate nations-one based on slavery and the other
based on ownership. To have an expensive government study tell
us the obvious is not only wasteful, but absurd. What we need
to find out is how do we pull it all together, and neither a study
nor a poll can give us the answers.
<P>
As is typical of liberal ideology, rather than deal with the problem,
let's spend the taxpayers' money to find out what we already know.
What America needs is not more studies, but better national leadership
that can not only facilitate a national discussion, but can do
so without scapegoating or patronizing blacks, and without making
whites feel guilt-ridden about a past they cannot change.
<P>
The only thing any of us can change are the present and the future.
As we examine the cast of potential presidents, the ability to
unify the nation should be at or near the top of the list of qualifications.
<P>
Before the establishment of such a commission is even considered,
the American public has the right to know: Who will conduct the
study and what will be their premise? And, more important, how
much will it cost?
<P><p><a name="powell"></a>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<LI>Colin Powell's potential presidential candidacy may be
impacted by the not-guilty verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial,
but analysts differ as to whether that impact will be positive
or negative. Commenting on the verdict shortly after it was announced,
Powell said &quot;The trial showed the judicial system works.&quot;
<P>
He prefaced his remarks by saying, &quot;I don't know that we
should go into a huge national debate about this. We've got to
move on.&quot;
<P>
But he went on tot say &quot;that the different reactions to the
trial from blacks and whites is something 'we should not walk
away and forget about.'&quot;
<P>
&quot;It should be troubling not to me but to all America that
there is still polarization,&quot; said Powell. &quot;The same
America that gave 'an incredible opportunity to me as a black'
still leaves many citizens trapped by their circumstance.&quot;
<P>
GOP consultant Eddie Mahe says, &quot;It will increase the great
healer-a role that is exquisitely difficult for him or anyone
else to fill.&quot; And Democratic consultant Tad Devine says
&quot;this could be a golden chance for Powell.&quot; &quot;Voting
for a black candidate can be a tremendous act of self-affirmation
for white voters, if there is a black candidate whose values they
share,&quot; said Devine.
<P>
A GOP strategist, however, was reportedly spreading the idea that
this undermines the case for Powell candidacy since whites will
now be less likely to vote for a black candidate. Some black analysts
were also skeptical.
<P>
&quot;Whatever he says-even if he splits the difference-he's going
to lose something on both sides. . .This may be a
defining moment for him,&quot; said Howard University political
science chairman Ronald Walters, on Powell and the verdict.
<P>
Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory wrote that &quot;one of
the many consequences of the earthquake verdict is that people
talk of beseeching [Powell] to lead them over the chasm.&quot;
But CNN political analyst Bill Schneider disagreed: &quot;When
racial polarization intensifies, it hurts Democrats and it helps
Republicans, unless Republicans are seen as creating it or exploiting
it.&quot;
<P><p><a name="chicago"></A>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<LI> With former Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-Il.) beginning a five-year
sentence for sexual misconduct, 14 candidates--10 Democrats and
4 Republicans--met the OCL 9 filing deadline in preparation for
the Nov. 28 special primary and Dec. 12 general election.
<P>
As for the primary, Senate Minority Leader Emil Jones is viewed
by many as an early favorite. Jones has the backing of Chicago's
infamous Democratic machine and, thus, his name will appear atop
the Democratic ballot. Jones has been endorsed by local party
officials and has long ties to Mayor Richard Daley.
<P>
However, State Sen. Alice Palmer is giving Jones a run for his
money (see &quot;Featured Politico&quot; interview ). She has
received the endorsement of a group of African-American men of
various religious, social, economic and political backgrounds.
They stated that the 2nd Congressional District will be &quot;politically
safe under her leadership,&quot; and urged all prospective candidates
to join them in supporting Palmer.
<P>
All the leading Democratic candidates appeared at an Oct. 9 debate.
Calling himself the &quot;voice of a new generation,&quot; attorney
Jesse Jackson, Jr. reportedly displayed some of the rhetorical
flair of his famous father.
<P>
&quot;I'm tired of Monty Hall politics: Let's make a deal,&quot;
said the younger Jackson. &quot;We can't stop the importation
of $200 billion worth of drugs into our country, but we can stop
one cigar coming in from Cuba.&quot;
<P>
But it will take more than homilies and witticisms for Jackson
to break out of the pack. He carries both the baggage and the
connections of his father, who, despite having a genius for espousingcolorful rhetoric, has yet to be elected to any post other than
that of the largely symbolic D.C. &quot;shadow&quot; senator.
<P>
During the debate, Palmer spoke out against casino gambling and
reductions in Medicaid funding, while stressing that her campaign
is about mobilizing people.
<P>
State Rep. Monique Davis promised to hold regular town meetings.
She was endorsed by former Rep. Gus Savage, whom Reynolds defeated
in 1992. Savage's 12-year career in the House was riddled with
charges of absenteeism, blatant incomplete campaign finance disclosure
statements, nepotism, sexual harassment and bigotry against whites
generally and Jews specifically.
<P>
No Republican has won the seat since 1950.
<P>
The 2nd Congressional District includes much of Chicago's old
South Side industrial area plus many suburbs to the south. About
two-thirds of its people live in Chicago, in widely separated
neighborhoods. Two-thirds of the district's voters are black,
and most are middle-class.
<P><p><a name="ga"></a>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<LI>Rep. Bill Jefferson (D-La.) quit the Louisiana governor's
race Sept. 19 and threw his support to fellow Rep. Cleo Fields
(D-La.) In return, Fields pledged to support Jefferson in next
year's open Senate race to succeed retiring Sen. Bennett Johnston
(D).
<P>
Jefferson's decision was seen as a big step toward solidifying
the state's black vote-about 28 percent of Louisiana's registered
voters-and thereby increase the chances of a black candidate making
the gubernatorial runoff.
<P>
The field for the Oct. 21 governor's election drops to 16 candidates,
all of whom appear on the same ballot, regardless of party. Should
no candidate win a majority, there will be a Nov. 18 runoff between
the two top finishers. What will be the effect of Jefferson's
pullout? Here's a look at the most
 recent poll of the governor's race:
<P><PRE>
 Ex. Gov. Buddy Roemer 		(R)	33%
 Treasurer Mary Landrieu 	(D)	13%
 Lt. Gov. Melinda Schwegmann 	(D)	12%
 Rep. Cleo Fields 		(D)	8%
 State Sen. Mike Foster 	(R)	6%	
 Rep. Bill Jefferson 		(D)	5%
 Undecided/Other			23%

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Why would a &quot;Hoosier&quot; concert pianist
interrupt his musical careeer to found a Washington think-tank?</FONT></B>
<P>
by Laurence Jarvik<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By any measure Dr. Balint Vazsonyi has had a remarkable
life. A refugee who fled his native Hungary after the failure
of the 1956 revolution, he is a concert pianist who has performed
on four continents, including the complete cycle of Beethoven
sonatas in New York, London, and Boston. He is also a historian,
professor, businessman, producer and host of  television documentaries
on Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, a cultured man of the
world who has lived in Budapest, Vienna and London. Yet at the
same time he is a middle-American family man, a loving father
and husband who studied at Florida State University in Tallahassee,
and who taught music at Indiana University in the 1970's and 80's.
His favorite film is Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,
he once ran for mayor of Bloomington on the Republican ticket,
and his favorite television program is  Seinfeld.  Last year he
moved to the Watergate apartments and became director of the Center
for the American Founding at the Potomac Foundation in McLean,
Virginia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Very few Americans have the special gifts Vazsonyi
possesses.  &quot;Balint was a very gifted young pianist when
I knew him at Florida State,&quot; recalls Ellen Taafe Zwilich,
today Carnegie Hall's Pulitzer-prize winning composer-in-residence.
When he performed in London The Times declared, &quot;Beethoven
himself might have played his sonatas much as Mr. Vazsonyi did.&quot;
Daniel F. McDonald, president of the Potomac Foundation, recruited
the pianist for his team of experts after hearing Vazsonyi speak
and play at the Smithsonian Institution.  &quot;He  represented
a special intellectual resource,&quot; he said.  &quot;There's
no one else like him.&quot; McDonald backed Vazsonyi's plan for
the Center for the American Founding because he felt it was important
to &quot;frame policy dialog in terms of the most fundamental
considerations&quot; -- the Constitution and the founding principles
which inform it, principles which have been incorporated into
something Vazsonyi calls his &quot;Reaffirmation of the American
Founding,&quot; a document which has been signed by scores of
public figures.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We therefore resolve actively to oppose those practices
which are in direct contradiction to the American Founding and
reaffirm our commitment to its basic principles,&quot; reads the
conclusion to the document Vazsonyi has circulated to the nation's
policy elites and thousands of ordinary citizens across America
who have heard him on radio talk shows.  He calls his reaffirmation
campaign &quot;Re-Americanization&quot; in a September 1996 National
Review article. And his efforts are beginning to pay off. The
1996 Republican platform contained a commitment to the American
Founding. And there may be Congressional hearings on the American
Founding in the next Congress if Vazsonyi has his way. He calls
his political agenda simply &quot;American&quot; and says the
issues at stake are neither Democratic nor Republican; rather
they are the fundamental principles which undergird what he sees
as the unparalled success of this nation over two centuries. In
the National Review Vazsonyi declared: &quot;By the other side
I do not mean true Democrats: indeed many of them  might seize
the moment to reaffirm their American foundations. No: I refer
to those whose ideas clearly derive from opposing doctrine.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>The opposing doctrine, says Vazsonyi, &quot;has 
worn many labels -- all variations on socialist philosphy.&quot;
Socialism depends on dividing people: Hitler used race and nationality,
Lenin and Stalin mostly class. The outcome is the same. Germany
and Russia oppressed Vazsonyi's native Hungary for many years,
and his family experienced persecution under both regimes.  He
perceives no real difference between the various forms of tyranny
he endured and sees a continuous struggle between their forces
and the free world. World War I, World War II and the Cold War
were, in the Vazsonyi analysis,  episodes in a century-long attempt
by socialist forces to achieve world domination, opposed consistently
by English political thought representing freedom and respect
for the rights of the individual.  English has given us the word
fairness,&quot; he says. &quot;No other language has yet come
up with even a translation of this word.&quot; He has presented
this perspective in newspaper articles, journals of opinion, and
faxes titled &quot;The Vazsonyi Analyis&quot; as well as in speaking
appearances at venues as varied as the International Monetary
Fund, the National Press Club, the Library of Congress, the Leadership
Institute and the International Platform Association.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Vazsonyi's most important essay, written for the
Potomac Foundation in 1995, is called &quot;The Battle For America's
Soul.&quot; It traces the origins of America's founding principles
to English political thought, and the current proliferation of
group rights mostly to German philosophy. The latter has acquired
bridgeheads in the media and the entertainment industry, and undermined
the traditional political health of American universities. Vazsonyi
speaks from personal  experience on college campuses.  He was
a professor of music at Indiana University and later dean of music
at the New World School of the Arts in Florida. While teaching
at Indiana in 1991, Vazsonyi confronted an organizer who arrived
on campus to co-ordinate opposition to Desert Shield  for a left-wing
group called &quot;the Committee Against the War in the Middle
East.&quot;The Bloomington Herald-Times did not identify C. Clark
Kissinger as anything other than an &quot;author.&quot; Vazsonyi
investigated and discovered that not only were there no books
by this Kissinger in his University library, but that he was a
professional anarchist whose ideal was the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
The lcoal paper did not disclose that the &quot;peace&quot; group
teach-in featured books by Marx and Trotsky, nor that a student
spokesman defined himself as &quot;a Marxist.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Outraged at the deception by the only newspaper in
his community, Vazsonyi organized a &quot;Stand Up for America
Alliance.&quot;  He confronted then-Congressman Frank McCloskey
at a town meeting and took issue with what he thought were McCloskey's
irresponsible statements against U.S. government policy in the
Gulf. Vazsonyi found himself greeted with applause and enthusiasm
by the crowd. He was approached to run for Mayor of Bloomington
as a Republican, a town as liberal as Berkeley, California or
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Although he lost, Vazsonyi had caught
the political bug. He started sending out faxes to his friends
and acquaintances that they called &quot;V-grams,&quot; containing
his perspective on political developments. He joined the Potomac
Foundation as a fellow in 1993, and in 1995 moved to Washington
to oversee the Center for the American Founding, carrying his
struggle to the heart of the American Leviathan.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>Inside the Council on Foundations &quot;Fishbowl&quot;:
How Foundation Executives Wash Each Other's Brains</FONT>
<P>
by Laurence Jarvik<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The foundation world is deeply into self-examination.
 A num ber of recent events _ President Clinton's signing of the
welfare reform bill, passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative,
the bitter legislative struggle over the Istook amendment to limit
federally-subsidized lobbying, and Republican retention of both
houses of Congress _ have led top foundation leaders across the
country to return to the query first posed by Admiral Stockdale:
&quot;Who am I?  Why am I here?&quot;  Since the May 1996 annual
gathering in Atlanta of the Council on Foundations [see <I>Foundation
Watch </I>vol. 1, no. 5 &quot;The Council on Foundations Message
to America: The Era of Lady Bountiful is Over'] foundation staff
and executives have been meeting, and meeting, and meeting.  They
have gathered together in affinity groups and planning sessions,
attended workshops and made on-site visits, and endlessly reconfigured
conference table and chair arrangements to facilitate dialogue,
optimize understanding, and in general decide what to do next.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>attended an unprecedented &quot;National Symposium
on Foundations and the Public Sector&quot; held in the Dupont
Circle Hotel in Washington, D.C. on November 14 and 15.  We were
also at an October session of the Communications Network in Philanthropy
in Detroit.  Not-for-profit self-scrutiny is further on display
in the latest publications from the foundation world.  See, for
example, Gerald Freund's new book <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy
</I>which chastises foundations for their insularity and urges
them to recognize and support talent [see review by Robert Huberty
on page 7]. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In the methods they are adopting to confront what
they see as a threat to their legitimacy, the foundation aristocracy
is repeating the mistakes of group-think which helped create the
initial pattern of problems they confront and that have generated
so much anxiety.  Indeed, their choice of guru, former Federal
Trade Commission Chairman Michael Pertschuk, insures the continuation
of what Heather MacDonald characterized as a pattern of &quot;Destructive
Philanthropy&quot; in a recent <I>Wall Street Journal </I>article.
 Pertschuk, who now heads a Washington organization called the
&quot;Advocacy Institute,&quot; encourages nonprofit support for
liberal political advocacy _ precisely the type of activity drawing
the attention and ire of the Republican majority in Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></I>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>THE GODFATHER  OF ADVOCACY<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Michael Pertschuk is not as well known as Ralph Nader
and he has less public visibility than Common Cause founder John
Gardner or Fred Wertheimer, the group's campaign finance lobbyist.
 But wherever an observer inquires into foundation and nonprofit
advocacy of government social welfare programs Pertschuk's imprint
is today visible.  More than any of the others, Pertschuk _ who
earns a $71,000 annual salary from the Advocacy Institute _ represents
the view that the purpose of philanthropy is to use private dollars
to leverage tax revenues for left-of-center causes. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk has been called &quot;the Grover Norquist
of the Left&quot; by those familiar with his activities.  He helped
draft the strategy which defeated Robert Bork's nomination to
the Supreme Court, and he has been a consultant to the American
Cancer Society in its fight against the tobacco industry _ work
he began over thirty years ago as the coordinator of the Surgeon
General's first conference on Smoking and Health. More recently,
he assisted ABC News producer  Deborah Leff become president of
the Joyce Foundation  [see vol.1 no.6, &quot;How does the Joyce
Foundation deal with dissent? Squash  it!&quot;].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A  prep school graduate who attended both Yale University
_ as an English major, Pertschuk studied with <I>All the King's
Men</I> novelist Robert Penn Warren _ and Yale Law School.  Coming
to Washington in the Kennedy administration, Pertschuk served
for about a decade as chief of staff to Senator Warren Magnuson
(D-WA), chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee.  Magnuson
was in his dotage near the end, and Pertschuk's power and influence
over legislation before the Committee grew so great that he gained
the reputation of being &quot;the 101st Senator&quot; and enjoyed
the social clout that accompanies power in Washington.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk currently lives in the fashionable Northwest
section of the city and his children attended the Georgetown Day
School, an expensive academically prominent private school in
the Capital, alongside spawn of the Graham family, owners of <I>The
Washington Post</I>.  Pertschuk was named chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission in the Carter Administration.  In his ironically-titled
memoir <I>Giant Killers</I> (Norton, 1986), he boasts of enjoying
lunch at the pricey Four Seasons restaurant on the expense account
of a founding member of Washington's exclusive Congressional Country
Club.  His plutocratic habits extend to a taste for fine cigars,
which he smokes discreetly, inasmuch as he is professionally committed
to the anti-tobacco lobby's attempt to ban smoking in public.
 Pertschuk told <I>Foundation Watch </I>that he now only smokes
on hikes far from civilization and &quot;at my daughter's wedding.&quot;
 (James Miller, the FTC chairman during the Reagan administration
and Pertschuk's successor, recalls, &quot;When in fact he smoked
cigars, he made a point of not smoking in public, or when the
TV cameras were around.  But he smoked cigars.  I smoke cigars,
too.&quot;)  As a consultant to the American Cancer Society, Pertschuk
co-ordinates global anti-smoking programs.  Invited to acknowledge
this small personal weakness, Pertschuk retorts that his opposition
is to large corporations that profit from harmful products, not
to smoking<I> per se</I>.  By such ideological logic are Cuban
cigars preferable to Marlboro cigarettes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> When he was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission
Pertschuk tried to ban television advertising to children, a move
that earned him the sobriquet &quot;the national nanny&quot; in
a critical <I>Washington Post </I>editorial. Pertschuk dismisses
the <I>Post</I>'s criticism, claiming that the paper's opposition
was motivated not by its editorial  commitment to free speech
but by the corporate self-interest of its parent company, the
owner of television stations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This instinctual opposition to corporations is inherent
in Pertschuk's mind-set.  He searches for the vicious corporate
self-interest in every private sector act while attributing a
noble public interest to every nonprofit sector act.  Indeed,
this is the assumption that underlies Pertschuk's Advocacy Institute.
 Co-chaired by veteran Common Cause lobbyists David Cohen and
Kathleen D. Sheeky _ and supported by the Ford Foundation, the
Joyce Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Nathan Cummings
Foundation, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the New York Community
Trust, the Tides Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
and the Florence and John Schumann Foundation (headed by Bill
Moyers's son, John) _ the Advocacy Institute spends some $2 million
annually running workshops, training sessions, and networking
activities for foundations and &quot;community&quot; organizations.
 Its mission statement declares its political objective, &quot;strengthening
the capacity of social and economic justice advocates to influence
and change public policy.&quot;  Despite decades of misguided
social spending, Pertschuk remains blind to the failures of federal
government programs and foundation support for nonprofits who
promote it.  When asked about the Great Society's ignominious
War On Poverty, he only responds that its initiatives &quot;were
not fully funded.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> One might go so far as to say that the Advocacy
Institute's sources of funding suggest a self-interested reason
why Pertschuk won't publicly criticize his patrons and the failure
of their initiatives, to use his own method of analysis.  Pertschuk
knows how the bread of advocacy is buttered.  The Institute's
1995 annual report states &quot;the largest grants to the Institute
come from private foundations.&quot;  If the priority of foundation
giving were direct provision of services rather than advocacy,
the first casualty would be the Advocacy Institute.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's uncritical attitude toward the mandarins
of philanthropy was manifested at the three-day meeting of the
Communications Network in Philanthropy in Detroit on October 9-11.
 He was there to inform public relations staffers from the foundation
sector about the &quot;threats&quot; to their activities and to
recommend how they could be overcome.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>A GATHERING OF  GIANTS<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> By words the mind is excited and  the spirit elated,&quot;
read the quote from Aristophanes gracing the cover of the program
packet for the 1996 Communications Network in Philanthropy Fall
Conference.  Hosted by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation of
Flint, Michigan, the conference was held at the Atheneum Hotel
in Detroit's Greektown.  This was the venue for the annual gathering
of public relations officers who belong to the &quot;affinity
group&quot; of the Council on Foundations, and those in attendance
represented the giants of philanthropy. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Among those present were emissaries of the biggest
of the big foundations: America's largest, the $7.5 billion Ford
Foundation, was represented by vice-president Robert Curvin. 
Karen E. Lake, director of communications, carried the flag for
the $6 billion W.K. Kellogg Foundation.  Victoria D. Weisfeld
was there; she is outgoing president of the Communications Network
in Philanthropy and Senior Communications Officer of the $4 billion
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  And so was Raymond C. Boyer,
director of communications for the $3 billion John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation.  <I> </I></FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The meeting participants found themselves in a focus
group led by Richard Harwood, whose private consulting company
has been a major beneficiary of so-called &quot;public journalism
grants from the Pew and Kettering foundation. In another event
they heard  from Hedrick Smith, the former <I>New York Times </I>Moscow
correspondent -- who was pinch-hitting for <I>U.S. News and World
Report </I>editor James Fallows, a last minute cancellation. Smith's
anti-Republican PBS election special &quot;The People and  the
Power Game&quot; had received significant support from the funders
represented in Detroit (the event hosts, the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation, had given his show a quarter of a million dollars).
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  <I>Foundation Watch</I> was there as well, as an
invited speaker at a closing-day panel called &quot;Foundations
Under Scrutiny.&quot;  This panel allowed the foundation communication
chiefs to hear themselves attacked from Left and Right.  The other
speakers on the panel included the Hudson Institute's Michael
Horowitz, who, as a Reagan Administration official at the Office
of Management and Budget, tried some fifteen years ago to end
federal funding of advocacy groups, and Robert Bothwell, director
of the liberal National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.
 The conservative criticisms were strong, with Horowitz accusing
foundation officers of being &quot;little better than thieves&quot;
who worsened the plight of the poor by diverting resources from
the needy to themselves.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The <I>Foundation Watch</I> presentation, subdued
by comparison, asked those assembled to consider the advantages
of a more even-handed approach to funding controversial public
issues.  Bothwell, who had recently received a $30,000 foundation
grant to study conservative foundation activity, singled out the
Pew Charitable Trusts for special criticism, arguing that they
so micromanaged their grant projects that independent thought
became almost impossible.   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> It is doubtful, however, whether any of these criticisms
were taken to heart.  <I>Foundation Watch</I> was privileged to
observe two days of networking, seminars, and fellowship.  Perhaps
as befits a convention of public relations spinmeisters, the purpose
of their meetings was not to change foundation behavior but to
change the perception of foundation behavior.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> There was one critical session at which we were
not present.  However, materials concerning the session are available,
and they offer perhaps the most significant evidence of the failure
of the foundation sector to understand that more is at stake than
public relations imagery and perceptions.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the first day of the Detroit conference, Wednesday,
October 9, the Communications Network in Philanthropy held its
business meeting and election of officers.  This was followed
by a motor coach excursion to the Detroit Zoological Institute
where the participants enjoyed a cash bar social hour, followed
by dinner and a keynote address by Michael Pertschuk.  A printed
outline of his talk, &quot;A Wake-Up Call: It's Your Turn,&quot;
discloses that he discussed neither tobacco nor children's advertising.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Foundation Watch </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>was not
present for the give-and-take.  But the outline, which is entitled
<I>A Menu of Possible Responses to Meeting the Growing Challenges
to Foundation Legitimacy</I>, invites foundations to confront
their critics aggressively with a battery of opposition research
and public relations initiatives.  Nowhere in the document does
Pertschuk suggest that the giants of philanthropy take criticism
seriously and reform their giving.  Instead, his analysis reassures
foundations that it is the critics who are to blame.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Section one, bearing the title &quot;'Opposition'
Research: define the problem,&quot; defines the problem in a curiously
self-serving way.  It identifies foundations as victims.  Point
&quot;a&quot;: <I> &quot;Keep track: who is thinking about doing
what to foundations, and when?  Organize an on-line, private information
exchange among foundation communications officers.&quot; </I>underscores
a defensiveness toward public discussion that one would not expect
of foundations that want to improve communications.  Rather than
call for increased openness, public scrutiny and accountability,
the promise made by Dorothy Ridings, the new Council on Foundations
president, Pertschuk's first recommendation is for a proprietary
exchange of privileged information.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's point &quot;b&quot; reframes an important
debate over policy into a strategy to capture political rhetoric:
<I> &quot;Do or fund research on 'defunding the left' initiatives
and rhetoric to identify percursory moves for future attacks on
foundation.  Analyze the rhetoric of the Christian Right, the
populist right, Istook, Simpson, et. al.; George Mason University,
the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation.&quot; </I> Rather
than answer conservative critics seriously on the merits of their
claims, Pertschuck  instead advocates &quot;deconstructing&quot;
their arguments. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Point &quot;c&quot; reiterates the strategy of out-talking
your critics:  <I>&quot;Develop likely scenarios for future attacks
on foundations, including rhetorical devices that demonize foundations.&quot;
 <BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Finally, point &quot;d&quot; formalizes public relations
&quot;spin&quot;:<I>  &quot;Commission polls and focus groups
designed to elicit knowledge, feelings and responsive chords so
as to gauge the success of attacks on foundations and to provide
guidance for affirmative responses.&quot;</I>  With the right
focus groups, nothing needs to change. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Building on the questionable premises of these appetizers,
the Pertschuk menu's second course is &quot;Strategic Planning:
define the goals.&quot;  The goal is to defend against change.
 Point &quot;a&quot; calls upon foundations to<I> &quot;build
broad public recognition and support, through public education,
for the role of foundations in society_free of government controls?&quot;</I>
 Of course, foundations are creatures of government control, specifically
the I.R.S. and the states that charter foundation activities.
 Service to the public interest is what asset-rich foundations
are supposed to provide in exchange for their tax-exemption .
 It is odd that Pertschuk, who would increase government control
over other parts of society, downplays the legal restrictions
currently placed on foundations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Point &quot;b&quot;: attacks what to this observer
is the reality of the Foundation sector and again urges new strategies
focused on changing perceptions:<I>  &quot;To zero in on changing
public perceptions of national foundations as elitist, unaccountable,
wasteful, illegitimate, too left, too liberal, too big.&quot;
<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's point &quot;c&quot; flatters his patrons:<I>
&quot;To build support for foundations as an integral part of
the 'independent sector' and, specifically, as public policy watchdogs
identifying private sector failures and government corruption,
inefficiency, overreaching? (The foundation as the latter day
equivalent of the old testament prophets?).&quot;  </I>When a
corporation hires a management consultant, it looks for internal
problems before it blames external conditions.  But Pertschuk's
menu of responses reverses the order.  Public criticism of foundations
is occurring not because the public fails to see the good that
foundations do, but because it disapproves of what it sees. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The menu's third section, &quot;Smorgasboard of
possible initiatives,&quot; repeats the effort to manage criticism
of the grantmaking activities of foundations with public relations
stunts. One point, however might especially interest readers of
this publication:<I>  &quot;Support an independent, investigative
'Foundation Watch' Watch.&quot;</I>  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This particular invitation to dig up dirt on foundation
critics -- specifically this periodical -- highlights the cowardice
and disingenuousness of the foundation sector in the face of criticism.
Rather than engage in civil debate over contested issues based
on facts, figures, and the historical record,  the advocates of
&quot;advocacy&quot;  prefer to sling mud at those raising questions.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  This editor told Pertschuk in an interview that
he could find out all he needs to know about <I>Foundation Watch</I>
by purchasing a subscription and reading the publication.  But
clandestine activity is a constant temptation for those with vested
interests in maintaining the <I>status quo</I>.  When invited
to contribute an article to Capital Research Center on his vision
for philanthropy, Pertschuk replied, &quot;I don't have a particular
vision for philanthropy.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Instead, Pertschuk suggests public relations ploys:
 editorial board visits, the production of videos, sponsoring
PBS and NPR programs, funding public relations campaigns through
Independent Sector, and &quot;strategic communications training&quot;
_ not coincidentally a specialty of the Advocacy Institute _ for
foundation leaders, staff, selected grantees, and &quot;'esteemed'
non-foundation leaders as spokespersons.&quot;  All are methods
which are designed to make concrete criticisms of foundations
go away, rather than receive the attention they deserve.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>THE FISHBOWL'S INNER CIRCLE<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> One needed only to wait one month to see Michael
Pertschuk's recommendations turned into action items.  The National
Symposium on Foundations and the Public Sector held in Washington
on November 14 and 15 bore all the hallmarks of the Pertschuk
influence.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Participants at the first day's session of the Symposium
seemed to be reading from Pertschuk's script. All the &quot;esteemed&quot;
foundation and non-foundation leaders were gathered together by
the Council on Foundations and by a number of non-profit groups.
 There were dozens of participants at the opening ceremonies.
 But a curious segregation occurred shortly afterwards.  On the
morning of the first day, participants were arranged into an &quot;inner
circle&quot; and an outer circle in what conference organizers
called &quot;the fishbowl.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The fishbowl was the central feature in a two-day
exercise in consensus formation that might remind filmgoers of
a scene in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate.&quot;  It was fascinating
to an outside observer.  For in their rush to confront their critics,
the foundations justified the critics' strongest claims.  The
foundations were engaging in a public demonstration of &quot;group-think&quot;
as shallow and embarrassing as it was doomed to failure.  And
the failures of the group dynamics on display in the fishbowl
reflected the failures of a philanthropy enamoured of faddish
trends in media relations and public opinion formation that were
on display in Detroit and Washington.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In the &quot;fishbowl&quot; were gathered the &quot;inner
circle&quot; _ one might call them the usual suspects _ who represented
the central committee of the liberal philanthropic establishment.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Notably absent were representatives of any conservative
foundation or organization, although at least two representatives
of the Philanthropy Roundtable -- Whitney Ball and John Walters
-- were in the room.  The conservatives later were permitted to
lead small group sessions.  But the main event was reserved for
liberals.  All others were were relegated to the &quot;outer circle.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Moderator Judy K. Chynoweth, executive director
of the Foundation Consortium for School-Linked Services, announced
that she would &quot;play Oprah.&quot;  Her language was thick
with the phrases familiar to foundation types _ she once actually
did say, &quot;Thank you for sharing.&quot;  Chynoweth would call
on individuals from the &quot;outer circle&quot; to sit briefly
in an &quot;inner circle&quot; guest chair to ask a  question
_ a procedure used to insure that the &quot;inner circle&quot;
remained secure.  Not only was she insensible to the elitism of
the enterprise, but in technocratic phrases she charged the participants
 to recognize that the session was &quot;a production meeting,&quot;
and that the participants should see themselves as &quot;assembly
line workers&quot; who were manufacturing a &quot;learning tool&quot;
in a &quot;carefully crafted process&quot; involving the &quot;construction
of small groups.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Occupants of the inner circle dutifully nodded,
then launched into tense and peculiar disquisitions on the dangers
foundations faced from a Republican Congress.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The first speaker, Joel Orosz, read aloud from a
1952 <I>American Legion Magazine</I> article describing foundations
as composed of &quot;outright communists...fellow travellers...</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>one worlders&quot; and what he called &quot; my personal
favorite: well-meaning dupes.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  That comment was greeted by condescending laughter
as Orosz outlined the failure of Congress' 1954 Reece Committee
investigations as well as the 1969 Wright Patman investigations,
which he characterized as &quot;relatively benign&quot; compared
to today's criticisms. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Waving Heather MacDonald's <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
article in the air, Orosz declared that the present situation
was &quot;more dangerous&quot; than ever, and that foundations
faced a political climate unseen since the days of Andrew Jackson.
 Jacksonian democracy, he said, regarded foundations as closed
corporations, and the danger was that foundation opponents like
those of the nineteenth century Anti-Masonic party were mobilizing
against the assembled foundations and eyeing their tax exemptions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Peter Edelman, whose judicial nomination was left
twisting in the wind by the Clinton Administration, praised conservative
foundations.  He announced that he was &quot;grateful for Scaife,
Mellon, Olin, and Bradley, the people on the conservative side
who are unabashed in their willingness to spend money on advocacy
and public policy.&quot;  The problem, he said, was that the liberal
side was letting conservative efforts go &quot;unanswered.&quot;
 To correct this &quot;imbalance&quot; was the task before philanthropy.
 Ironically, conservative foundations would assist this task because,
he said, they would be able &quot;to resist changes and to protect
the ability to advocate.&quot;  Whether Edelman was pursuing some
private joke or on to something new was unclear to this reporter.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Only Robert Wood Johnson Foundation vice-president
Paul Jellinek  said something of genuine insight during the seemingly
endless round-robin, perhaps because of  his organization's participation
in the Clinton administration's ill-fated health care plan.  He
observed that the nonprofit sector got &quot;so wrapped up in
fighting Istook that we missed the big policy debate&quot; over
welfare.  Jellinek suggested that next time foundations &quot;keep
at least one eye open&quot; for issues other than their own institutional
self-interest. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The fishbowl session ended.  Much like the family
goldfish, life eventually drained out of the panelists who tired
of the discussion.  They moved on to small group discussions which
were intended to raise &quot;questions&quot; for the larger group.
 (Social science research has determined that small groups are
most conducive to reinforcing shared opinions, which is called
&quot;consensus formation.&quot;) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The activities of the small groups were obviously
a pretext for political networking, as was apparent when the &quot;questions&quot;
were posted on the wall in the hotel ballroom.  Written in magic
marker on giant sheets of paper held up by masking tape, each
repeated the banalities of &quot;community&quot; and &quot;public
interest,&quot; &quot;accountability&quot; and &quot;the role
of the press.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> What was the meeting really about?  (&quot;Who am
I?  Why am I here?&quot;)  Sara Melendez, president of Independent
Sector, offered some hint in remarks at the first and final public
discussions of the conference.  She warned the assembled group
that Independent Sector would be investigated in the next session
of Congress by Rep. Nancy Johnson's (R-CT) House oversight committee
as &quot;payback&quot; for its advocacy efforts to defeat the
Istook amendment.  Melendez asked for their support in the coming
months. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> After cutting through all the New Age psychobabble,
here was what the National Symposium was about: creating a network
to defend Independent Sector and derail congressional oversight.
 Rally the troops, issue marching orders, and, no doubt, follow
up with memoranda and private communications which will not be
provided to <I>Foundation Watch</I>.</FONT>

<I><B>Narcissism and Philanthropy</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
by Robert Huberty<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>DEFENDING THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gerald Freund, <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy: Ideas
and Talent Denied</I> (Viking, 1996) 158 pages. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Modern liberals deny that one can know the true
and good.  But this ignorance does not stop them from wanting
to win, nor does it interfere with their desire to reward the
success of those who share their convictions, or lack thereof.
 Washington abounds with such people, who seek to dazzle through
brilliance.  The best and the brightest, as they once were called,
believe they deserve rewards and honors, and it is the thesis
of this book that they are not getting what they deserve.  Gerald
Freund, an administrator and official active in foundation affairs
for over forty years, is the former director of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; awards program.
 In <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy</I> he mourns the failure of
other foundations to appreciate the importance of grace and favors
for golden boys.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Writing for foundation insiders, Freund argues that
foundation grants are used most productively when they support
&quot;exceptional&quot; individuals of &quot;extraordinary&quot;
promise.  Increasingly, however, foundations are caught between
the forces of left and right.  Multiculturalists pounce on grants
for individual excellence to find evidence of racism and elitism,
while conservative populists abhor cutting-edge creativity.  Freund
worries that foundation officers are turning inward: they have
become sensitive to appearances and have grown self-assertive
and self-regarding (hence the book's peculiar title).  Freund
contends that the networks of talent scouts to which foundations
once turned for advice are deteriorating.  Foundation program
officers don't consult with outside experts as they once did.
 They don't seek out bright minds to explore ideas and create
programs to reward risk-takers.  Instead, they carefully screen
grant applicants through complex criteria and narrowly define
projects to fulfill specific goals.  Self-conscious of their own
professional standing (and defensive about it), foundations impose
limiting conditions on their dispensations.  The arrogance of
the insecure purseholder is making a comeback.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Freund is a former Rockefeller Foundation program
officer who handled grants to individuals and he has fond memories
of the days when program officers dispensed them freely and easily.
 He extols the example of John D. Rockefeller and his family,
who recruited &quot;the best brains they could attract to investigate
competing claims on their philanthropies.&quot;  He contrasts
Rockefeller to the narcissist Andrew Carnegie who trusted only
his own philanthropic judgment.  Freund has no sympathy for &quot;donor
intent,&quot; the notion that donors should insure that their
intentions are precise and fully observed when they establish
foundations.  He argues instead that foundations misuse their
power, not when they violate donors' intentions, but when they
are unresponsive to grant recipients' needs.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> And who are the needy?  Certainly not the recipients
of charity.  Freund is careful to distinguish philanthropy from
charity, and, one suspects, he would make the latter a handmaiden
to the welfare state.  No: philanthropy's task is to identify
the &quot;imaginative minority&quot; and &quot;superior talents&quot;
who are &quot;our most important resource.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Trapped in a New Frontier time-warp, Freund says
foundations once honored that obligation to find and help the
very best.  He commends the Rockefeller Foundation:  During the
dark days of the 1950s Dean Rusk, its president and a future Secretary
of State, supported the recruitment of talent to specialize in
international legal theory, which international legal theorists
warned was in short supply.  Then there was the Ford Foundation
under president McGeorge Bundy, President Kennedy's former National
Security Council advisor:  In 1968 Ford braved controversy by
giving individual grants to Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign
staff after the Senator was assassinated, thereby providing Peter
Edelman and others with much-needed &quot;turn-around time.&quot;
 And the Carnegie Corporation under president John Gardner (HEW
secretary to LBJ) rescued overworked college presidents of exceptional
talent by funding year-long sabbaticals, enabling them to recharge
their batteries.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Most of <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy </I>consists
of foggy tips on ways that foundations can continue to seek out
&quot;excellence&quot; and shepherd &quot;the creative spirit.&quot;
 Worthwhile grants to individuals are possible, says Freund, when
foundations pick grant selection committees whose members &quot;have
sufficient knowledge to make rigorous judgments, but one wants
them also to be generous and imaginative, open-minded, seasoned
and perspicacious.&quot;  Foundations should employ mature and
knowledgeable program officers who can offer their grantees &quot;nurturing
support and an ongoing relationship.&quot;  Foundation professionals
should be tactful, too:  &quot;Helpful when called upon but not
intrusive or prying; they do not make grantees feel they need
to express inordinate or inappropriate gratitude.&quot;   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In a book notably lacking in clarity or humor, the
ten pages Freund devotes to the origins of the MacArthur Foundation
&quot;genius&quot; awards provides some relief.  In spring 1979
the Foundation hired Freund, then a Hunter College dean, to assemble
assorted luminaries to brainstorm the purpose of the awards and
consider how to pick their winners.  The deliberations recounted
here reveal how silly bright people can be.  Jonas Salk &quot;urged
MacArthur to create a program that would enable people to train
in a discipline other than one they were in and also to create
an ambience that would encourage people to change fields.&quot;
 Unnamed others worried that interviews and written applications
might give articulate candidates an unfair advantage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Freund says nothing about the MacArthur awards'
notorious reliance on race, gender and ethnicity, and he is silent
about when and why he left MacArthur's employ as the awards' program
director.  But from other remarks it is clear that he is dismayed
by foundations' use of multicultural criteria and worried that
conservatives will attack them for it.  In an aside, he consoles
himself that a conservative Congress may hesitate to encroach
on foundation autonomy because it will not want to interfere with
the bold work of conservative foundations like Bradley and Olin.
 They, apparently, are the final defense of Camelot.<BR>

<h2>Spaceship Earth</h2>
<b>More Information</b><p>

Since its birth on Earth Day, 1970, the modern environmental movement can
claim many successes:  Air and water are cleaner; automobiles operate more
efficiently and pollute less; "smokestack" industries are more
environment-friendly than ever before.  

<P>
Perhaps more impressive than these tangible achievements is the impact the
environmental movement has had on American culture.  The vast majority of
Americans now think of themselves as "environmentalists," and most people
engage on a regular basis in some activity (e.g. recycling newspapers) that
allows them to act personally on their environmental beliefs.  The
environmental movement fundamentally changed American values on a scale
comparable to such great historical movements as Methodism and the American
suffrage movement.


<P>
<a name="enter"></a>
The original environmentalists turned to government, especially the national
government, to achieve their objectives.  The government, in turn, applied
its bureaucratic regulatory model to environmental challenges.  To protect
and enhance the environment, government issued thousands of pages of
regulations; dedicated billions of tax dollars; and required others, state
and local government as well as private citizens, to redirect billions of
dollars more to environmental protection.

<P>
While this bureaucratic, regulatory model of government coincided with many
environmental successes, it has also failed (sometimes spectacularly) to
achieve its goals (e.g. Superfund).  Even in the areas where real progress
has been made, it has often been purchased only at the price of imposing
unnecessary burdens on economic growth.  

<P>

Perhaps most damaging, the regulatory approach has hampered technological
innovation, slowing the development and introduction of new approaches that
are essential to the next generation of environmental progress.  The
regulatory approach has "frozen" the environmental agenda in the increasingly
obsolete technologies of the 1970s.  Today, the environmental movement is
mired in a static model which is fundamentally flawed for practical,
scientific and cultural reasons.  

<P>
In practical terms, the static model, imposed through innovation-hostile
regulatory bureaucracies, has dramatically slowed the introduction of
environmentally-friendly technologies that are essential to the next
generation of environmental progress.  

<P>
In scientific terms, the model is flawed because it assumes that "spaceship
earth" is a static system -- that the environment is or ought to be
unchanging -- when it is in fact highly dynamic.  The earth has changed and
evolved dramatically, even during the relatively short course of human
history.  Oceans rise and fall, species come and go, temperatures fluctuate.
El Nino -- the massive air disturbance that has fundamentally changed the
global climate during this century -- is a dramatic current example of
environmental dynamism on spaceship earth.

<P>
In cultural terms, the static model is flawed because the idea of progress --
the belief that mankind has improved in the past, is improving today, and
will continue to improve into the foreseeable future -- is inextricably woven
into the American idea itself.  For Americans, it has never been enough to
"maintain" or "sustain;" our goal has always been to improve and make better.
A culturally sustainable environmentalism is therefore not one that equates
"stewardship" with "stasis."  Instead, it must recognize the dynamic nature
of the global environment, and it must seek to channel that dynamism in a
positive direction.  American environmentalism, in short, must be about
progress.

<P>
The static approach to environmentalism is, of course, not simply a result of
a regulatory approach.  The idea of "stasis" is deeply embedded in the
political philosophy of the environmental movement.  The idea is to "protect
and preserve," to prevent "significant deterioration," to advance
"sustainable" approaches to development.

<P>
It is not enough to "protect the environment from further damage."  Within
the framework of continuous environmental change, we must seek to enhance our
air, water and other natural resources.

<P>
Having recognized environmental dynamism, we cannot help but also recognize
that the regulatory approach adopted more than a generation ago must be
replaced by an approach that releases the dynamic energies of personal and
economic freedom.  Unlike the current approach, new environmental policies
must enhance market mechanisms, property rights, local initiative and,
perhaps most important, the development and use of environmentally friendly
technologies.  Not least among these is the advancement of  progress toward
an information-age economy, which is, by its nature, dramatically less
environmentally damaging than the "smokestack" economy of the industrial age.

<P>
It is time to develop the next generation of environmental thought and
policy.   What is needed is not so much a better way of regulation but a
better way of cleaning up toxic waste dumps.  It is not enough in the eyes of
the public to abolish the old system without offering a replacement vision.

<P>
Replacing more than 20 years of environmental doctrine, dogma, ideology,
politics and policy is, of course, a massive undertaking -- and may well be
expected to take a decade or more to complete.  But the work must begin
somewhere, and while completion is many years away, we must develop a new
framework that recognizes the scientific fact of environmental dynamism,
encourages the practical dynamism of environmentally friendly technological
innovation and embraces the cultural principle of positive environmental
dynamism  -- i.e. of environmental progress.<p>

The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases-one in Georgia and one in Louisiana in which
the configuration of congressional districts designed to elect African-Americans is being
challenged.  Georgia's I 1th congressional district, represented by Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D),
and Louisiana's 4th congressional district, represented by Rep. Gleo Fields (D), were-both
"drawn to concentrate black voters."<p>

Three-judge panels  in both states ruled last t year that the 11 district-drawing state legislators
"had effectively disenfranchised whites." critics of the districts also claim that they isolate black
voters and result in the creation of other districts more likely to elect Republicans.<p>

"At some point, it's a violadon of the US. Constitution to design (political districts) . . . based on
race," said Judge Anthony Kennedy. The districts were drawn specificaily to be "safe" for black
candidates.<p>

Georgia's 11th District stretches 250 miles, "with finger-like hooks scooping up black voters in
Atlanta, Augusta and Savannah" It is 64 percent black. The <i>Monroe (La.) News Star</i>
described Louisiana's 4th District as "a racial seat-belt, slashing diagonally from the state's
northwest corner to the 'waist' where the state line leaves the Mississippi River." It is about 61
percent black.<p>

"It is not an overstatement to say that the Supreme Court's decision in the cases argued today will
likely determine the shape of AmeAcan politics into the 21st century," said National Public
Radio's Nina Totenberg.  For the court's decision in these cases will likely determine the rules for
redistricting all over the country and not just at the federal level, but at the state and local level
too."<p>

An Atlanta Journal editorial also included comments on the Supreme Court's deliberations. "Our
hope is that it will send the case back to the states and require them to redraw lines on a basis
other than race. It should also insist that the Justice Department reaffirrn the original intent of the
Voting Rights Act: Guarantee the right to vote to all, but guarantee a racial outcome to
none."<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich is researching a plan that gives District of Columbia residents full
voting representation in Congress as Marylanders. The plan, which still is in the "idea" stage,
would make the District of Columbia Maryland's 9th congressional district for federal voting
purposes only.<p>

District of Columbia residents would vote to elect a "full-fledged" congress member and would
cast votes for Maryland'stwosenators. D.C. would retain its own mayor and council, and would
not vote for governor or any other state offices in Maryland.<p>

"It's a great idea as an interim step to full statehood," said D.C. Mayor Marion Barry (D), on
Gingrich's proposal. But Maryland Republicans oppose the plan because "it would bring an
influx of Dernocrats into the race for U.S. Senate seats."<p>

Maryland GOP Chair Joyce Terhes said, "Our chances of getting a Republican senator would be
almost nil. That's a general concern . . . It's more a question of the mechanics of how to make it
work: That they would participate in congressional elections but not other elections to me just
doesn't make sense."<p>

Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans "by more than 10 to 1 in the city, which
has 367,013 voters, 289,353 of whom are Democrat" Maryland House Minority Leader Robert
Kittleman (R): "Our last race for governor was almost a tie, and we might have a chance in the
Senate next time. Hang that noose around our neck and everyone will just give up."<p>

"What the speaker is proposing would take a constitudonal amendment," said D.C. Delegate
Eleanor Holmes Norton through a spokesperson. "What he could do now is return the delegate's
right to vote on the basis of residents of the District of Columbia paying federal income
taxes."<p>

But Gingrich's proposal is just one of several ideas being brandied about on Capitol Hill to give
the District a voice in Congress. Maryland Democrat Senators Barbara Mikulski and Paul
Sarbanes support full statehood for District of Columbia.<p>

In the midst of its review of affirmative action programs, the Clinton administration defended the use of blacks-only scholarships at the University of Maryland.<p>

In a brief filed the first week of May with the Supreme Court, the administration argued in
support of racebased scholarships used to correct previous segregation at the university's College
Park campus.<p>

It did not address the larger issue of using such scholarships to diversify a school if
discrimination had not been proven.<p>

 The administration's action suggests that scholarships similar to the one in question would
survive the sweeping White House review of affirmadve action. Administration officials
caudoned against such speculations, however.<p>

"The Jusdce Department's decision to enter into the University of Maryland case is completely
separate from the internal and ongoing review that the White House is conducdng on affinnadve
action programs," Ginny Terzano, a White House spokeswoman, said May 3.<p>

The brief filed by Solicitor General Drew S. lVays on May I supports the university's appeal of a
decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va.<p>

The court ruled in favor of a Hispanic student who said the university violated his constitutional
rights when it denied him a scholarship limited to black students.<p>

The appeals court said the university had failed to prove the scholarship was necessary to correct
lingering effects of segregation When the lawsuit was filed in 1990, the campus' snzdent body
was 11.2 percent black.<p>

The Clinton administration argued that the court should have presumed the racial disparity was
the result of the campus's long history of segregation. The burden would then be on the student,
Daniel J. Podberesky, to prove otherwise.<p>

The university created the Benjamin Banneker Scholarship Program under pressure from the
federal government, which sought to compel desegregation of the College Park campus.<p>

The campus was limited to whites only by law until the mid-19SOs. Segregadon lingered there
unofficially into the late 1970s.<p>

The  university also had scholarships to attract white students to its traditionally black campuses,
and scholarships open to students of all races.<p>

The campus usually awards at least 20 Banneker scholarships each year, covering fouryears of
tuition, room and board They account for about I percent of the College Park campus' annual
financial aid budget.<p>

 Although former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey has bowed out of the 1996 presidendal race, he will "continue to hound" President Clinton and other fellow
Democrats by setting up a group to elect pro-life candidates.<p>

Casey adviser Jeffrey Bell said the ex-governor is establishing a political action committee, a
private foundadon and a lobbying organizadon, "all dedicated to furthering family issues." He
added that the orl anizations are expeckd to receive funding from some of the political donors
who pledged Casey $500,000 for his presidendal race.<p>

The Casey polidcal action committee will help fund the candidacies of federal and state
Democrats who are at odds with the party's pro-choice posidons.<p>

"There's no cessadon in the game plan," said Casey. "It's going to be executed exactly as before,
except instead of being a candidate, I'm going to be pushing all three buttons." Bell noted that
while Republicans have their own organizations for promoting prolife candidates, "pro life
Democrats feel excluded from the party."<p>

<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
 A group of black business executives said May 10 that they were forming a political action committee and hiring a lobbyist to fight efforls to eliminate or modify affirmative action
programs, including those that set aside a percentage of government contracts for
minority-owned companies, according to a report in The New York Times.<p>

"Undl now, the voice of black business has been largdy silent on the twin issues of affirmative
action and minority set asides," said Earl G. Graves, publisher and founder of Black Enterprise
magazine, at a news conference.<p>

Graves, who was joined by other black executives, said that the group was "drawing a line in the
sand" and that there would be "no retreat" on affirmative action. The gnup is made up of the
Black Enterprise 100, the largest blackowned companies in the U.S.<p>

"Until we get to the point in this country where there is truly a level playing field," said Maceo
Sloan, head of the Sloan Financial Group, "where a black business can go to a bank, for example,
and be judged, in terms of loans, on the same basis that the majority businesses in this county are
judged; where we have the same access to capital that they have and where there truly is a level playing field, we will very vigorously oppose the effort that is going on right now to
eliminate all the affirmadve action programs."<p>

Earlier this year, Congress voted to end a tax break for companies that sell television stations and
cable systems to minorities. The program came under intense criticism as a result of a proposed
sale by Viacom Inc., a New Yorkbased media giant, to a group of investors headed by Frank
Washington, a black entrepreneur from California.<p>

Critics of the sale said it was an affirmative action program intended to help minority
millionaires.<p>

But at the news conference the black executdves said that such criticism reflected a double
standard because there are several federal programs, like farm subsidies, that help wealthy
individuals and businesses.<p>

"What about all the thousands of millionaires who are majority business owners, and no one
raises the issue of that being un-American?" Graves said. UWhen we start to do it, all of a
sudden, let's change the rules."<p>

Graves said the 100 largest blackowned companies had combined sales of about $11.7 billion
last year and employed about 47,000 people, indicating that if the group could muster its
financial resources, it could have significant political impact.<p>

The executives said they had not yet solicited all the top black businesses to contribute to the
political action committee, which will be called Mobilizadon for Economic Opportunity. But
Graves said he did not think it would be difficult to persuade them to reach into their
pockets.<p>

Whether you talk about L.A or San Francisco, or Chicago, or Detroit, or Atlanta or New York,
the issues are the same," he said. "It would seem to me we're not going to have a very hard
selling point to push here."<p>

Still, with the Republican-controlled Congress aiming for cuts in the federal deficit and a
balanced budget, all programs including farm subsidies, Medicare and what some call "welfare
for the rich" are on the table and subject to reduction or elimination. This may not be the right
year to lobby for maintaining programs which do not have broad-based support among the  American electorate.

<a name="mfume"></a>
<LI>Rep. Kweisi Mfume was chosen Dec. 9 to head the NAACP, after
15 months during which the nation's oldest civil rights organization
became better known for controversy than activism.
<P>
The Maryland Democrat, who said he will leave Congress in mid-February,
said his first order of business would be to address the organization's
$3.2 million debt and change the group's administrative structure.
<P>
&quot;We're not going to sit by and watch the world change,&quot;
the former head of the Congressional Black Caucus said. &quot;We
are going to change.&quot; Mfume also said that, under his leadership,
the group would begin to place more emphasis on &quot;personal
responsibility.&quot;
<P>
Elected by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People's board in a unanimous vote, Mfume said he would seek to
cut the size of the board.
<P>
The board has been criticized for being too large and too politicized
and the organization now has more board members than staff members.
<P>
In the past, executive directors have clashed with the 64-member
board over the extent of their power, and potential candidates
for the position have blamed the board for scaring them away.
<P>
But Mfume said one of the conditions he had demanded when he agreed
to take the job was that he report to the board's 17-member executive
committee rather than the entire panel.
<P>
&quot;It is easier to assemble 17 than 64 on any given day,&quot;
Mfume said. His title will be president and chief executive officer,
reflecting his desire for more autonomy.
<P>
Mfume said he would meet with Chairwoman Myrlie Evers-Williams
to come up with a short-term and long-term financial plan.
<P>
He said that plan would include reopening the stream of donations
from corporate donors, approaching potential
<P>
individual donors such as athletes and actors for support, and
trying to increased the ranks of the NAACP's 500,000 members.
<P>
Mfume's broad-minded yet principled style could breathe much needed
life and energy into this 90-year-old group.
<P>
Mfume said he hoped his decision to leave a safe seat in Congress
for the leadership of the NAACP would encourage people to return
to the organization.
<P>
&quot;That example might say to other people that it's all right
to come back home,&quot; he said.
<P>
Many of the organization's larger donors withdrew their support
last year after allegations of financial impropriety were leveled
at former executive director Benjamin Chavis and former chairman
William Gibson.
<P>
Chavis was fired in August 1994 for committing more than $330,000
in NAACP funds without the board's approval to settle a sex discrimination
suit filed against him.
<P>
Gibson, a South Carolina dentist, was ousted in February after
accusations he double-dipped on expenses. An audit released this
summer questioned more than $112,000 in expenses he charged to
the NAACP.
<P>
The resulting drop in donations worsened the NAACP's financial
situation and forced the temporary layoff of most of the national
staff.
<P>
The NAACP now has only 50 national employees, less than half what
it had when Chavis took office.
<P>
Critics had said the search for Chavis' replacement took so long
because of a lack of qualified candidates interested in the job.
<P>
But Evers-Williams, the widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar
Evers, denied that, saying the search was not initiated in earnest
until last May when the search committee was appointed.
<P>
&quot;A search process, if it's done well, tends to take time,&quot;
she said.
<P>
The appointment will allow Evers-Williams a chance to withdraw
from the day-to-day running of the organization.
<P>
The chairmanship is a volunteer position and Evers-Williams has
performed many of the duties Mfume will assume since her appointment
in February, just three days before the death of her second husband,
Walter Williams.
<P>
&quot;I haven't had a chance to mourn my husband,&quot; she said.
&quot;I haven't stopped and it's been very difficult&quot;
<a name="jackson"></a>
<LI>Jesse Jackson, Jr. won a special congessional election Dec.
12 in Chicago to fill the seat vacated by Mel Reynolds, who quit
after being convicted of having sex with an underage campaign
worker. His victory followed his win of the Democratic nomination
Nov. 28.
<P>
The younger Jackson has tried to avoid comparisons with his famous
father during his run for Congress, insisting his campaign is
based on the issues and concerns of Illinois' 2nd District
<P>
But he acknowledged his lineage during a victory speech following
the Nov. 28 special primary election, saying his path to Washington
was paved by his father's life work.
<P>
Jackson said when he was born March 11, 1965, his father was marching
in Selma, AL.
<P>
&quot;He nearly named me Selma. He was caught up in the history
of the moment,&quot; Jackson told an amused throng. &quot;Thank
God for Mama.&quot;
<P>
 He said his early experiences in the areas of voting, public
policy, education and religion became a &quot;part of the foundation
of my being.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Dad never stopped registering voters. . .he never stopped
lifting the hopes of the people.&quot;
<P>
Jackson, 30, beat political veteran Emil Jones, 60, in the Democratic
primary to win the nomination. Voter turnout was a scant 20 percent.
<P>
Before the candidate made his remarks, an uncharacteristically
restrained Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. praised God for his son's nomination
and led a prayer session.
<P>
Jackson Jr. then took the podium to chants of &quot;Jesse Jr.&quot;
from hundreds of supporters and read a prayer in both English
and Spanish. He then pledged to work for the well-being of the
district's youth.
<P>
Jackson said he ran a forthright campaign, adhering to his lessons
from the Scripture.
<P>
Jackson, a lawyer and field director for the National Rainbow
Coalition, based his campaign on bringing jobs to the area, getting
behind Republican Gov. Jim Edgar's effort to build a third Chicago
area airport at Peotone, about 40 miles southwest of downtown
Chicago.
<P>
Jones, president of the Illinois Senate, urged voters to select
him because of his political experience despite voter sentiment,
nationwide, against career politicians.
<P>
Jones, who relied heavily on Democratic precinct workers in conducting
his campaign, said Jackson's name recognition was an obstacle
that could not be overcome.
<P>
Jackson acknowledged the criticism surrounding his lack of experience
and relative youth.
<P>
Jackson will spend only three months in Congress before facing
voters again in a March primary prior to the fall 1996 election.
<a name="schr"></a>
<LI>After 23 years of challenging the power structure in the House,
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) announced Nov. 29 she will retire
at the end of this term, in part because she was afraid of becoming
one of the House members who are carried out in a &quot;box.&quot;
<P>
Schroeder said she first thought about retiring from the House
in 1994, but is glad she struck it out for another term because
&quot;it's been important to see the Democratic Party come alive
again. I felt I was needed this year.&quot;
<P>
The former pilot, who was elected to the House at age 32, said
she has not decided what she will do in the future, but it involved
teaching, writing or working for a foundation.
<P>
Schroeder said she anticipates a Democrat can win the liberal-leaning
district covering most of eastern Denver. &quot;If I thought the
Democrats could not hold that seat, believe me, I would not be
here today. Democrats can clearly hold that seat,&quot; she said.
Denver attorney Joe Rogers, a 31-year-old black Republican who
supports abortion rights and affirmative action, announced this
month he would challenge Schroeder in the district, which gave
President Clinton 55 percent of the vote in 1992, and former President
Bush only 39 percent.
<P>
But even without Schroeder as a target, Rogers said in an interview
that the theme of his campaign will be a &quot;new generation
of leadership.&quot; He said he already has an organization of
more than 800 volunteers and expects his campaign war chest to
top $150,000 by the end of this year. &quot;This is going to be
a good fight,&quot; said Rogers, who happened to be across the
street from the U.S. Capitol at the National Republican Congressional
Campaign committee when the word came over CNN that Schroeder
was retiring. &quot;I was totally surprised,&quot; he said. Thus
far, two Democrats have said they would definitely enter the race:
State Rep. Glinda Swanson Lyle and Peter Groff, an official in
Denver Mayor Wellington Webb's administration.
<P>
Three other state representatives, all attorneys, have expressed
interest in the seat: Ken Gordon, Doug Friednash and Diana DeGette.
<P>
Denver City Councilwoman Ramona Martinez, who is currently running
for the open Colorado Senate seat in a crowded field of Democrats,
may jump into the House race as well.
<P>
<a name="tx"></a>
<LI>The state of Texas and the Clinton administration argued before
the Supreme Court Dec. 5 that the majority-black and majority
Hispanic congressional districts in Houston and Dallas are constitutional
because the primary consideration in drawing those districts was
to protect incumbent House members--not to elect blacks or Hispanics
to Congress. At issue are the majority-black seats of Democratic
Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and Eddie Bernice Johnson, and the majority
Hispanic seat of Democratic Rep. Gene Green. While a 1995 Supreme
Court decision on the Georgia congressional district map said that race
cannot be the predominant factor in drawing districts, the court
was reviewing two more congressional maps--Texas and North Carolina-to
more clearly define the standards.
<P>
The potential stakes are enormous. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said
thousands of federal, state and local elections could some day
be affected by the court's decision, expected by July.
<P>
The 1965 Voting Rights Act says election districts can be unlawful
if they deny minorities the opportunity to elect candidates of
their choice.
<P>
But in 1993, the Supreme Court ruled in a North Carolina case
that districts designed to help minority voters may violate white
voters' rights. Last June, the court ruled in a Georgia case that
such election districts must be presumed unlawful if race was
the main factor in creating them.
<P>
Lower courts struck down three urban congressional districts in
Texas but upheld North Carolina's 12-district map.
<P>
Now, the justices must decide whether race was the predominant
factor in creating those districts, and if so, whether such consideration
was justified by an overwhelmingly important reason.
<P>
Texas Assistant Attorney General Javier Aguilar argued the Texas
districts are constitutional because the lines were motivated
by a state legislature wanting to protect incumbents. Aguilar
said that if political considerations were the core motive or
predominant factor in drawing the lines, then racial considerations
by default could not be the predominant factor--thus making the
districts constitutional, even though race was used as a consideration
when drawing the lines.
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who held the swing vote in the Georgia
case, asked Aguilar if his argument meant the state legislature
could exclude blacks from majority-white districts in order to
protect a white incumbent who told the mapmakers that blacks would
not vote for him. Deputy Solicitor-General Paul Bender, representing
the administration, later told O'Connor that Democratic map drawers
&quot;weren't looking for black voters--they were looking for
Democratic voters,&quot; and that type of political gerrymandering
is constitutional. But since these districts are labeled &quot;black&quot;
districts or &quot;Hispanic&quot; districts, it appears that the
incumbent argument holds little weight.

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>May 1996</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>
There are probably as many definitions for the term conservative as there are faces on the cover of this edition of Headway.<P>
Websters defines 'conservative' as "disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., and to agree with gradual rather than abrupt change."  But, the term is also defined as "a member of a conservative political party," which, in the U.S., is the Republican Party.  And leaders of todays GOP tend to be more interested in instituting sweeping, rather than incremental changes in the way government works.<P>
New York Times columnist William Safire, in his New Political Dictionary, says a conservative is a "defender of the status quo," a definition which is also inaccurate in the current political environment.  In fact, the Democrats are bigger defenders of the status quo than are the Republicans.<P>
Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative policy organization, The Heritage Foundation, describes conservatism as an intellectual movement which, over a 30-year period, blossomed into a political movement.  "Conservatisms next step--the one were in the midst of right now--is as a governing movement," said Feulner in his seventh annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," delivered on April 11.<P>
And that may be conservatives biggest problem: As they attempt to govern, they come under relentless assaults on their motives, character and intentions by media and the opposing party, so much so that they are more easily defined by others, than by themselves.<P>
Thus, the ugly definitions of conservative abound and the term becomes synonymous with derogatory expressions such as bigot, racist, mean-spirited, extreme and radical; individuals who want to give tax cuts to the rich and cut free lunch programs for the poor.<P>
Feulner has one explanation for why these loathsome terms may be resonating in some sectors of the electorate.<P>
"Perhaps the [conservative] message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media," he says.  "Those are understandable, forgivable mistakes.  I say, learn and move on."<P>
Maybe.  But moving on will not be a simple task as long as there is confusion about what exactly constitutes modern-day conservatism.<P>
Most mainstream conservatives today would say they believe more in the genuine power of the individual than they do in the misplaced and often intrusive power of the government.  They also believe government should live within its means; that there should be a safety net for the poor and disadvantaged, but not one that leads to dependency; that the free enterprise system is the best way to ensure long-term opportunity for all; and that America should maintain a strong defense to ensure peace and freedom within its borders.<P>
But there are extreme elements which have latched onto the conservative movement which do it more harm than good, because these segments tend to overshadow the positive aspects of conservatism.  What are some of these extreme elements?  David Duke is a good example.  Duke, who is a former Ku Klux Klan member in Louisiana and two-time gubernatorial candidate, hides behind conservatism to disguise his genuine racism toward blacks and others he considers to be unworthy of equal protection under the laws.<P>
Then there are militia groups, like the Freemen of Montana, who claim to be constitutionalists and use (or misuse) portions of the constitution when it is convenient.  But they selectively ignore American laws and believe they can declare an area within Americas borders as a separate country, simply because they say so.<P>
There are others who claim to advocate a color-blind society and equality of opportunity, yet they only protest discrimination when it occurs against white males, not against blacks, women or members of minority groups.<P>
When these extreme, and usually hypocritical elements abound within the conservative movement, there is no doubt that they will become larger than life and overpower the pro-America message that is conservatisms foundation.<P>
This edition of Headway includes commentaries by three activists within the conservative movement who provide their own definitions of conservatism.  Robert Woodson, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, got involved in the conservative movement in the early 1970s, in part because he was disillusioned with liberals.  Woodson says conservatives have lost the battle of public perception, and provides his view on how this can be changed.<P>
Georgene Brazer, who is active in Republican political circles in the state of New Jersey, says true conservatism lies in the political center.  Brazer sees Ronald Reagans conservative vision as the embodiment of what is best about this contemporary movement.<P>
Clarence Carter, a former operative for the Republican National Committee, believes conservatism will labor under offensive definitions by others as long as it appears to be an exclusive, rather than inclusive, political force.  He recommends "diversifying the face of conservatism."

Some black Republican leaders want a hand in writing their party's 1996
platform, and one suggested May 19 he's prepared to demonstrate at the
national convention to make his point.<p>
     	
Leaders of the National Black Republican Empowerment Task Force, which met in Washington to write its own version of a platform, also took issue with GOP lawmakers over affirmative action and the budget.<p>
     	
"We need to be sitting at the table when the decisions are made and when
the pie is cut," said task force co-chairman Maurice Dawkins, who also is chairman of the Florida Republican Black Caucus.  "We'll get there, even if we have to demonstrate outside the convention hall" when the Republican National Convention meets in San Diego, he said.<p>
     
Maintaining affirmative action programs and business set-aside for minorities will be priorities in the
blacks' platform, said Dawkins, declining to outline specifics.<p>
     
The task force, not an official party organization, is comprised of some 30 state and local party officials, many of them veterans of the Nixon administration.  This group differs markedly from that of many of today's younger, more conservative Republicans who emphasize self-reliance and
entrepreneurship, and shun affirmative action programs.<p>
     
Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has promised blacks a voice in platform discussions.  But the task force's hopes on affirmative action are not echoed by the GOP's congressional leaders.<p>
     
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, a presidential hopeful, already has asked Senate committees to schedule hearings on affirmative action.  Another GOP candidate, Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, has
pledged, if elected, to issue an executive order ending federal hiring and contract preferences based solely on race or gender.<p>
     
"A lot of people are misled in terms of what affirmative action means," said James L. Denson, a task force member who is a New Orleans businessman.<p>
     
"We all are opposed to quotas, as such, but we're not opposed to the results of an affirmative-type program," he said.<p>
     
On the budget, Denson criticized GOP proposals to eliminate the Small Business Administration.<p>
    
"They think the SBA only helps women and minorities, but if they did their homework...they'd find that small business is the backbone of the economy," he said.<p>
     
Presidential candidate Alan Keyes and Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, both of whom are black, participated in discussions on the black empowerment platform.  Dole and Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, another presidential hopeful, sent staff members.<p>

The task force hopes to meet personally with each of the would-be presidents before submitting its
recommendations to the RNC platform committee, Dawkins said.<p>

Dawkins, a Washington-area lobbyist, opposed Democrat Charles Robb in Virginia's 1988 Senate race, but lost with 29 percent of the vote.<p>

Benjamin Chavis has fashioned a new civil rights organization from the hodgepodge of grassroots groups that participated in the "unity" summits he convened after being fired from the NAACP.<p>
     
The National African-American Leadership Summit (NAALS) has been created in response to "an eagerness" to formalize the summit meetings, Chavis said.  It plans to draw members from those outside mainstream civil rights groups.<p>
     
"I'm not trying to pull the rug out from under another organization.  I'm just saying the black community is out there in need of mobilization," Chavis said.  "We need to connect these grassroots brothers and sisters who have not been touched by these other organizations."<p>
     
The new group provides Chavis with a high-profile platform for his quasi-nationalist agenda, something he has lacked since the NAACP fired him last August for using NAACP money to
settle a sex discrimination claim without telling the board of directors.<p>
     
One of the new group's first objectives is to mobilize black men for a Million Man March on Washington,
to be held Oct. 16.  It also plans to focus on fighting to preserve affirmative action programs, black economic and political empowerment and federal aid to Africa--all elements of Chavis'
NAACP agenda.<p>
     
NAALS convened at Texas Southern University in Houston on June 9-11 to approve a constitution and
bylaws and establish rules for membership, said Chavis, who is the group's national spokesman.  It was the first summit at which the new group will operate as an official entity.<p>
     
At the Houston meeting, Chavis stressed the need for self-sufficiency, and vowed that the NAALS would not just talk the talk, but would walk the walk.<p>
     
"The summit will be economically dependent upon support from the African-American community, almost exclusively," Chavis said.<p>
     
Chavis originally said he wouldn't create another organization to continue the work he stared at the NAACP.  But he steadily took steps in that direction by convening two informal summits, one in
Baltimore the day after his firing and the other in Chicago last December.  After losing his status in such a high-profile position, it is not surprising that Chavis would try to stay in the public eye.<p>
     
"I am not at the same place I was last year on that question, obviously," Chavis said.  "There has been evolving enthusiasm and support.  I now believe that NAALS needs to be a permanent organization."<p>
     
The new group is emerging at a time of severe weakness at the National Association of the Advancement of Colored People.   The NAACP is $3.8 million in debt and is struggling to hang onto its
corporate donors.  It also is hobbled by a split between its 86-year-old integrationist mission and younger potential members who are drawn to black nationalism.<p>

<hr><a name="affirmative"></a>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

While vowing to battle GOP attempts to gut affirmative action policies, Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) also warned June 5 that White House efforts to date on the contentious issue have left black members
of Congress concerned, and suggested that uneasiness could erode much of President Clinton's base heading into the  96 presidential campaign.<p>
     
"The pres-ident runs the risk of per-manently los-ing large seg-ments of his
base," Mfume contended at a press con-ference.  He said he tele-phoned the White House and told senior Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos that CBC members "believe that we need bold
presidential leadership.  And bold presidential leadership is not a polite tap on the shoulder."<p>
     
Mfume, formerly head of the Congressional Black Caucus, now heads a caucus task force on affirmative action.  He referred to a recent New York Times story that said the White House is drafting
an affirmative action policy that, as Mfume phrased it, would put minority contracting jobs up for review as "some sort of sacrificial first step."  Mfume also said he expressed alarm that the White House has not consulted CBC members, despite the group's persistent requests for dialogue.  However, Mfume said Stephanopoulos told him White House officials will meet with CBC members to brief them on the administration's preliminary policy outline.<p>
     
But Clinton's foot-dragging may be part of a broader strategy to ease the fears of many white male constituents the Democrats lost in the 1994 elections.  A Clinton administration official said there might be some political benefit if black business executives criticized the administration's 
eventual proposals.<p>
     
"We want black businessmen to scream enough to let angry white males understand that we've done something for them," said the official, who made his comments to a New York Times reporter on the condition that he not be named.<p>
     
Mfume said the caucus also is prepared to fight GOP attempts to revise or repeal affirmative action programs, including a proposal by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fl.), who is circulating a "Dear Colleague" letter to gather support for his "Civil Rights Act of 1995."<p>
     
Canady's bill, which was introduced in mid-June, would repeal all federal laws and programs that give preferences to racial minorities and women.  In a recent report prepared for Senate Majority
Leader Dole, the Congressional Research Service determined there are 160 such affirmative action programs.<p>
     
Canady's bill also would prohibit preferences for federal contracting jobs.<p>
     
In his "Dear Colleague," which he began circulating a few weeks ago, Canady declared:  "Full compensation and redress will still be available to those who prove they are victims of illegal
discrimination.  But there will be no preferring of individuals based on their membership in a group where they themselves have not been actual victims of discrimination."<p>
     
Mfume, who indicated the CBC task force will propose its own alternative legislation, said he and other black members are prepared to negotiate with congressional Republican leaders.<p>
     
Mfume told Republican leaders that CBC members are "prepared to negotiate," but stressed "we will not have policy imposed upon us without any input."<p>
     
He also warned that protests could come in the form of economic boycotts and "demonstrations in the street."<p>

<hr><a name="dole"></a>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>


Senator Bob Dole's blistering attack on the entertainment industry is seen by analysts as a carefully planned strategy with four political goals:  Appeal to skeptical GOP conservatives; swipe at Senator Phil Gramm, who has been embarrassed by the revelation that in the 1970s his brother-in-law convinced him to invest $7,500 in an R-rated film; contrast himself with President Clinton, who has long been enamored with Hollywood stars; and identify with an issue that crosses party lines and appeals
to everyday Americans who feel the nation's moral moorings are coming loose.<p>  
     
"A lot of parents don't want their children exposed to this...trash," said GOP strategist Bill Kristol.<p>
     
Clinton strategist James Carville said Dole's strategy smacks of hypocrisy.  "He [Dole] sure is brave with people he doesn't get money from, like Hollywood," said Carville, "but very cowardly with people he does get money from, like the NRA."<p>
     
And Clinton, in his Montana town-meeting June 1 took a veiled swipe at Dole, accusing him of criticizing popular culture but not conservative extremists.  "There are some public officials in our
country who are only too happy to criticize the culture of violence being promoted by the media," said Clinton, "but are stone silent when these other folks are talking and making violence seem 
like it's OK."<p>
     
For the GOP presidential stakes, Dole's speech appeared to complete the process of converting the skepticism of his bid among leaders of the religious right to more enthusiastically consider supporting
him.<p>
     
"In every campaign, there is what Lee Atwater would say was a defining moment," said Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed.  "You can make a very strong case that Dole's Hollywood speech is such a defining moment for his candidacy.  He clearly recognizes the importance of the appeal that can be gained by making themes about the culture a centerpiece of his
campaign."<p>

<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>
<p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>      
<P>

<P>
When Republicans won control of
both houses of Congress in 1994, a significant portion of the
electorate had high hopes that, for the first time in several
decades, some fiscal restraint would be instituted by our elected
officials on Capitol Hill. Two years earlier, Ross Perot had put
the concept of a balanced budget on the table. The idea of leaving
our children and grandchildren saddled with debt that we created
was unthinkable. Now, voters thought in November 1994, we have
a new crop of leaders who will straighten things out.
<P>
At this point in the budget debate,
however, I believe it is fair to say that the Republicans have
lost the high ground. Rather than being perceived as the champions
of responsible government, many voters view the GOP and its legions
as pawns of the rich--willing to cut government programs for the
poor while leaving the programs that benefit the well-to-do largely
intact.
<P>
The Democrats have so successfully
demagogued the issue of balancing the federal budget that, any
time the Republicans propose reducing the rate of growth in programs,
a collective chorus of Democrats labels them &quot;extremists&quot;
who want to starve children and throw the elderly out into the
streets. The Democrats have simply been better at casting the
argument in human terms, making the Republicans look like cold-hearted
numbers crunchers.
<P>
Witness President Clinton's handling
of the budget negotiations. When he vetoed one of the Republican
budget proposals, the President was surrounded by young children,
as he vowed that he would not let the GOP harm those youngsters.
Granted, the children all appeared to be well-dressed and well-fed,
exactly the kind of children least likely to need government assistance.
But a picture is worth a thousand words.
<P>
Utilizing constituents as props
is one of the Democrats' best tactics. And Republicans have either
been caught off guard or simply have not mastered the fine art
of relating to the average taxpayer.
<P>
A case in point is a CNN town
hall meeting in December in which House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
participated. In my personal dealings with DeLay, I have always
found him to be a responsive, compassionate officeholder. But
he could have shown more sensitivity in his handling of the questions
asked at the meeting.
<P>
A gentleman in the audience asked
the Texas congressman, &quot;Since government employees are missing
portions of their paychecks during the Christmas season, why doesn't
the Congress forego getting paid until it resolves the budget
mess?&quot;
<P>
DeLay's response: &quot;I'm not
a government employee; I'm a 'constitutional officer.'&quot;
<P>
The audience was stunned. While
DeLay relied on the specifics of the Constitution to defend his
receiving his salary during the government shutdown, he failed
to make another constitutional observation. The Founding Fathers
never intended for our elected representatives' salaries to be
so much greater than the typical American family. 
<P>
Senators and representatives earn
$133,600 per year, nearly four times the $35,800 the average American
family earns. Their high incomes make them so far removed from
the daily lives of their constituents that they cannot relate
to their problems. Democrats compensate for this income disparity
by tauting their credentials as champions of the poor, but Republicans
don't have a shield to defend them against critics' charges that
they are arrogant and greedy.
<P>
Perhaps Republican activist William
Bennett best summed up the party's dilemma: &quot;What's come
across quite clearly is that we Republicans are smart and serious
and that we are going to shrink the government. What hasn't come
across is a lot of compassion.&quot;

(The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a not-for-profit research and
educational organization dedicated to creating a positive vision of
the future founded in the historic principles of the American idea.)<P>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

The central event of the 20th century is the overthrow of matter. In
technology, economics, and the politics of nations, wealth -- in the
form of physical resources -- has been losing value and
significance. The powers of mind are everywhere ascendant over the
brute force of things.<P>

In a First Wave economy, land and farm labor are the main "factors of
production." In a Second Wave economy, the land remains valuable while
the "labor" becomes massified around machines and larger
industries. In a Third Wave economy, the central resource -- a single
word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture,
ideology, and values -- is <i>actionable</i> knowledge.<P>

The industrial age is not fully over. In fact, classic Second Wave
sectors (oil, steel, auto-production) have learned how to benefit from
Third Wave technological breakthroughs -- just as the First Wave's
agricultural productivity benefited exponentially from the Second
Wave's farm-mechanization.<P>

But the Third Wave, and the <i>Knowledge Age</i> it has opened, will not
deliver on its potential unless it adds social and political dominance
to its accelerating technological and economic strength. This means
repealing Second Wave laws and retiring Second Wave attitudes. It also
gives to leaders of the advanced democracies a special responsibility
-- to facilitate, hasten, and explain the transition.<P>

As humankind explores this new "electronic frontier" of knowledge, it
must confront again the most profound questions of how to organize
itself for the common good. The meaning of freedom, structures of
self-government, definition of property, nature of competition,
conditions for cooperation, sense of community and nature of progress
will each be redefined for the Knowledge Age -- just as they were
redefined for a new age of industry some 250 years ago.<P>

What our 20th-century countrymen came to think of as the "American
dream," and what resonant thinkers referred to as "the promise of
American life" or "the American Idea," emerged from the turmoil of
19th-century industrialization.  Now it's our turn: The knowledge
revolution, and the Third Wave of historical change it powers, summon
us to renew the dream and enhance the promise.<P>


<h2>The Nature of Cyberspace</h2>

The Internet -- the huge (2.2 million computers), global (135
countries), rapidly growing (10-15% a month) network that has captured
the American imagination -- is only a tiny part of cyberspace. So just
what is cyberspace?<P>

More ecosystem than machine, cyberspace is a bioelectronic environment
that is literally universal: It exists everywhere there are telephone
wires, coaxial cables, fiber-optic lines or electromagnetic waves.<P>

This environment is "inhabited" by knowledge, including incorrect
ideas, existing in electronic form. It is connected to the physical
environment by portals which allow people to see what's inside, to put
knowledge in, to alter it, and to take knowledge out. Some of these
portals are one-way (e.g.  television receivers and television
transmitters); others are two-way (e.g.  telephones, computer modems).<P>

Most of the knowledge in cyberspace lives the most temporary (or so we
think) existence: Your voice, on a telephone wire or microwave,
travels through space at the speed of light, reaches the ear of your
listener, and is gone forever.<P>

But people are increasingly building cyberspatial "warehouses" of
data, knowledge, information and <i>mis</i>information in digital form, the
ones and zeros of binary computer code. The storehouses themselves
display a physical form (discs, tapes, CD-ROMs) -- but what they
contain is accessible only to those with the right kind of portal and
the right kind of key.<P>

The key is software, a special form of electronic knowledge that
allows people to navigate through the cyberspace environment and make
its contents understandable to the human senses in the form of written
language, pictures and sound.<P>

People are adding to cyberspace -- creating it, defining it, expanding
it -- at a rate that is already explosive and getting faster. Faster
computers, cheaper means of electronic storage, improved software and
more capable communications channels (satellites, fiber-optic lines)
-- each of these factors independently add to cyberspace. But the real
explosion comes from the combination of all of them, working together
in ways we still do not understand.<P>

The bioelectronic <i>frontier</i> is an appropriate metaphor for what is
happening in cyberspace, calling to mind as it does the spirit of
invention and discovery that led ancient mariners to explore the
world, generations of pioneers to tame the American continent and,
more recently, to man's first exploration of outer space.<P>

But the exploration of cyberspace brings both greater opportunity, and
in some ways more difficult challenges, than any previous human
adventure.<P>

Cyberspace is the land of knowledge, and the exploration of that land
can be a civilization's truest, highest calling. The opportunity is
now before us to empower every person to pursue that calling in his or
her own way.<P>

The challenge is as daunting as the opportunity is great. The Third
Wave has profound implications for the nature and meaning of property,
of the marketplace, of community and of individual freedom. As it
emerges, it shapes new codes of behavior that move each organism and
institution -- family, neighborhood, church group, company,
government, nation -- inexorably beyond standardization and
centralization, as well as beyond the materialist's obsession with
energy, money and control.<P>

Turning the economics of mass-production inside out, new information
technologies are driving the financial costs of diversity -- both
product and personal -- down toward zero, "demassifying" our
institutions and our culture.  Accelerating demassification creates
the potential for vastly increased human freedom.<P>

It also spells the death of the central institutional paradigm of
modern life, the bureaucratic organization. (Governments, including
the American government, are the last great redoubt of bureaucratic
power on the face of the planet, and for them the coming change will
be profound and probably traumatic.)<P>

In this context, the one metaphor that is perhaps least helpful in
thinking about cyberspace is -- unhappily -- the one that has gained
the most currency: The Information Superhighway. Can you imagine a
phrase less descriptive of the nature of cyberspace, or more
misleading in thinking about its implications?  Consider the following
set of polarities:<P>

<Pre>
<i>Information Superhighway</i>     /     <i>Cyberspace</i>

Limited Matter               /     Unlimited Knowledge
Centralized                  /     Decentralized
Moving on a grid             /     Moving in space
Government ownership         /     A vast array of ownerships
Bureaucracy                  /     Empowerment
Efficient but not hospitable /     Hospitable if you customize it
Withstand the elements       /     Flow, float and fine-tune
Unions and contractors       /     Associations and volunteers
Liberation from First Wave   /     Liberation from Second Wave
Culmination of Second Wave   /     Riding the Third Wave
</pre>
The highway analogy is all wrong," explained Peter Huber in Forbes
this spring, "for reasons rooted in basic economics. Solid things obey
immutable laws of conservation -- what goes south on the highway must
go back north, or you end up with a mountain of cars in Miami. By the
same token, production and consumption must balance. The average Joe
can consume only as much wheat as the average Jane can
grow. Information is completely different. It can be replicated at
almost no cost -- so every individual can (in theory) consume
society's entire output. Rich and poor alike, we all run information
deficits.  We all take in more than we put out."
<P>

<h2>The Nature and Ownership of Property</h2>

Clear and enforceable property rights are essential for markets to
work.  Defining them is a central function of government. Most of us
have "known" that for a long time. But to create the new cyberspace
environment is to create <i>new</i> property -- that is, new means of
creating goods (including ideas) that serve people.<P>

The property that makes up cyberspace comes in several forms: Wires,
coaxial cable, computers and other "hardware"; the electromagnetic
spectrum; and "intellectual property" -- the knowledge that dwells in
and defines cyberspace.<P>

In each of these areas, two questions that must be answered. First,
what does "ownership" <i>mean</i>? What is the nature of the property
itself, and what does it mean to own it? Second, once we understand
what ownership means, <i>who</i> is the owner? At the level of first
principles, should ownership be public (i.e.  government) or private
(i.e. individuals)?<P>

The answers to these two questions will set the basic terms upon which
America and the world will enter the Third Wave. For the most part,
however, these questions are not yet even being asked. Instead, at
least in America, governments are attempting to take Second Wave
concepts of property and ownership and apply them to the Third
Wave. Or they are ignoring the problem altogether.<P>

For example, a great deal of attention has been focused recently on
the nature of "intellectual property" -- i.e. the fact that knowledge
is what economists call a "public good," and thus requires special
treatment in the form of copyright and patent protection.<P>

Major changes in U.S. copyright and patent law during the past two
decades have broadened these protections to incorporate "electronic
property." In essence, these reforms have attempted to take a body of
law that originated in the 15th century, with Gutenberg's invention of
the printing press, and apply it to the electronically stored and
transmitted knowledge of the Third Wave.<P>

A more sophisticated approach starts with recognizing how the Third
Wave has fundamentally altered the nature of knowledge as a "good,"
and that the operative effect is not technology per se (the shift from
printed books to electronic storage and retrieval systems), but rather
the shift from a mass-production, mass-media, mass-culture
civilization to a demassified civilization.<P>

The big change, in other words, is the demassification of actionable
knowledge.<P>

The dominant form of new knowledge in the Third Wave is perishable,
transient, <i>customized</i> knowledge: The right information, combined
with the right software and presentation, at precisely the right
time. Unlike the mass knowledge of the Second Wave -- "public good"
knowledge that was useful to everyone because most people's
information needs were standardized -- Third Wave customized knowledge
is by nature a private good.<P>

If this analysis is correct, copyright and patent protection of
knowledge (or at least many forms of it) may no longer be
unnecessary. In fact, the marketplace may already be creating vehicles
to compensate creators of customized knowledge outside the cumbersome
copyright/patent process, as suggested last year by John Perry Barlow:<P>
<UL>
"One existing model for the future conveyance of intellectual property
is real-time performance, a medium currently used only in theater,
music, lectures, stand-up comedy and pedagogy. I believe the concept
of performance will expand to include most of the information economy,
from multi-casted soap operas to stock analysis. In these instances,
commercial exchange will be more like ticket sales to a continuous
show than the purchase of discrete bundles of that which is being
shown. The other model, of course, is service.  The entire
professional class -- doctors, lawyers, consultants, architects,
etc. -- are already being paid directly for their intellectual
property. Who needs copyright when you're on a retainer?"
</ul>
Copyright, patent and intellectual property represent only a few of
the "rights" issues now at hand. Here are some of the others:<UL>

<li>Ownership of the electromagnetic spectrum, traditionally considered
to be "public property," is now being "auctioned" by the Federal
Communications Commission to private companies. Or is it? Is the very
limited "bundle of rights" sold in those auctions really property, or
more in the nature of a use permit -- the right to use a part of the
spectrum for a limited time, for limited purposes? In either case, are
the rights being auctioned defined in a way that makes technological
sense?<p>

<li>Ownership over the infrastructure of wires, coaxial cable and
fiber-optic lines that are such prominent features in the geography of
cyberspace is today much less clear than might be
imagined. Regulation, especially price regulation, of this property
can be tantamount to confiscation, as America's cable operators
recently learned when the Federal government imposed price limits on
them and effectively confiscated an estimated $___ billion of their
net worth. (Whatever one's stance on the FCC's decision and the law
behind it, there is no disagreeing with the proposition that one's
ownership of a good is less meaningful when the government can step
in, at will, and dramatically reduce its value.)<P>

<li>The nature of capital in the Third Wave -- tangible capital as well
as intangible -- is to depreciate in real value much faster than
industrial-age capital -- driven, if nothing else, by Moore's Law,
which states that the processing power of the microchip doubles at
least every 18 <i>months</i>. Yet accounting and tax regulations still
require property to be depreciated over periods as long as 30
<i>years.</i> The result is a heavy bias in favor of "heavy industry" and
against nimble, fast-moving baby businesses.<P>
</UL>
Who will define the nature of cyberspace property rights, and how?
How can we strike a balance between interoperable open systems and
protection of property?<P>

<h2>The Nature Of The Marketplace</h2>

Inexpensive knowledge destroys economies-of-scale. Customized
knowledge permits "just in time" production for an ever rising number
of goods. Technological progress creates new means of serving old
markets, turning one-time monopolies into competitive battlegrounds.<P>

These phenomena are altering the nature of the marketplace, not just
for information technology but for all goods and materials, shipping
and services.  In cyberspace itself, market after market is being
transformed by technological progress from a "natural monopoly" to one
in which competition is the rule.  Three recent examples:<UL>

<li>The market for "mail" has been made competitive by the development
of fax machines and overnight delivery -- even though the "private
express statutes" that technically grant the U.S. Postal Service a
monopoly over mail delivery remain in place.<P>

<li>During the past 20 years, the market for television has been
transformed from one in which there were at most a few broadcast TV
stations to one in which consumers can choose among broadcast, cable
and satellite services.<P>

<li>The market for local telephone services, until recently a monopoly
based on twisted-pair copper cables, is rapidly being made competitive
by the advent of wireless service and the entry of cable television
into voice communication. In England, Mexico, New Zealand and a host
of developing countries, government restrictions preventing such
competition have already been removed and consumers actually have the
freedom to choose.<P>
</uL>
The advent of new technology and new products creates the potential
for <i>dynamic competition</i> -- competition between and among
technologies and industries, each seeking to find the best way of
serving customers' needs.  Dynamic competition is different from
static competition, in which many providers compete to sell
essentially similar products at the lowest price.<P>

Static competition is good, because it forces costs and prices to the
lowest levels possible for a given product. Dynamic competition is
better, because it allows competing technologies and new products to
challenge the old ones and, if they really are better, to replace
them. Static competition might lead to faster and stronger
horses. Dynamic competition gives us the automobile.<P>

Such dynamic competition -- the essence of what Austrian economist
Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction" -- creates winners and
losers on a massive scale.  New technologies can render instantly
obsolete billions of dollars of embedded infrastructure, accumulated
over decades. The transformation of the U.S. computer industry since
1980 is a case in point.<P>

In 1980, everyone knew who led in computer technology. Apart from the
minicomputer boom, mainframe computers <i>were</i> the market, and
America's dominance was largely based upon the position of a dominant
vendor -- IBM, with over 50% world market-share.<P>

Then the personal-computing industry exploded, leaving older-style
big-business-focused computing with a stagnant, piece of a burgeoning
total market. As IBM lost market-share, many people became convinced
that America had lost the ability to compete. By the mid-1980s, such
alarmism had reached from Washington all the way into the heart of
Silicon Valley.<P>

But the real story was the renaissance of American business and
technological leadership. In the transition from mainframes to PCs, a
vast new market was created. This market was characterized by dynamic
competition consisting of easy access and low barriers to
entry. Start-ups by the dozens took on the larger established
companies -- and won.<P>

After a decade of angst, the surprising outcome is that America is not
only competitive internationally, but, by any measurable standard,
America dominates the growth sectors in world economics --
telecommunications, microelectronics, computer networking (or
"connected computing") and software systems and applications.<P>

The reason for America's victory in the computer wars of the 1980s is
that dynamic competition was allowed to occur, in an area so breakneck
and pell-mell that government would've had a hard time controlling it
_even had it been paying attention_. The challenge for policy in the
1990s is to permit, even encourage, dynamic competition in every
aspect of the cyberspace marketplace.<P>


<h2>The Nature of Freedom</h2>

Overseas friends of America sometimes point out that the
U.S. Constitution is unique -- because it states explicitly that power
resides with the people, who delegate it to the government, rather
than the other way around.<P>

This idea -- central to our free society -- was the result of more
than 150 years of intellectual and political ferment, from the
Mayflower Compact to the U.S. Constitution, as explorers struggled to
establish the terms under which they would tame a new frontier.<P>

And as America continued to explore new frontiers -- from the
Northwest Territory to the Oklahoma land-rush -- it consistently
returned to this fundamental principle of rights, reaffirming, time
after time, that power resides with the people.<P>

Cyberspace is the latest American frontier. As this and other
societies make ever deeper forays into it, the proposition that
ownership of this frontier resides first <i>with the people</i> is central
to achieving its true potential.<P>

To some people, that statement will seem melodramatic.  America, after
all, remains a land of individual freedom, and this freedom clearly
extends to cyberspace. How else to explain the uniquely American
phenomenon of the hacker, who ignored every social pressure and
violated every rule to develop a set of skills through an early and
intense exposure to low-cost, ubiquitous computing.<P>

Those skills eventually made him or her highly marketable, whether in
developing applications-software or implementing networks. The hacker
became a technician, an inventor and, in case after case, a creator of
new wealth in the form of the baby businesses that have given America
the lead in cyberspatial exploration and settlement.<P>

It is hard to imagine hackers surviving, let alone thriving, in the
more formalized and regulated democracies of Europe and Japan. In
America, they've become vital for economic growth and trade
leadership. Why? Because Americans still celebrate individuality over
conformity, reward achievement over consensus and militantly protect
the right to be different.<P>

But the need to affirm the basic principles of freedom is real. Such
an affirmation is needed in part because we are entering new
territory, where there are as yet no rules -- just as there were no
rules on the American continent in 1620, or in the Northwest Territory
in 1787.<P>

Centuries later, an affirmation of freedom -- by this document and
similar efforts -- is needed for a second reason: We are at the end of
a century dominated by the mass institutions of the industrial
age. The industrial age encouraged <i>conformity</i> and relied on
<i>standardization</i>. And the institutions of the day -- corporate and
government bureaucracies, huge civilian and military administrations,
schools of all types -- reflected these priorities.  Individual
liberty suffered -- sometimes only a little, sometimes a lot:
<UL>
<li>In a Second Wave world, it might make sense for government to insist
on the right to peer into every computer by requiring that each
contain a special "clipper chip."<P>

<li>In a Second Wave world, it might make sense for government to assume
ownership over the broadcast spectrum and demand massive payments from
citizens for the right to use it.<P>

<li>In a Second Wave world, it might make sense for government to
prohibit entrepreneurs from entering new markets and providing new
services.<P>

<li>And, in a Second Wave world, dominated by a few old-fashioned,
one-way media "networks," it might even make sense for government to
influence which political viewpoints would be carried over the
airwaves.<P>
</uL>
All of these interventions might have made sense in a Second Wave
world, where standardization dominated and where it was assumed that
the scarcity of knowledge (plus a scarcity of telecommunications
capacity) made bureaucracies and other elites better able to make
decisions than the average person.<P>

But, whether they made sense before or not, these and literally
thousands of other infringements on individual rights now taken for
granted make no sense at all in the Third Wave.<P>

For a century, those who lean ideologically in favor of freedom have
found themselves at war not only with their ideological opponents, but
with a time in history when the value of conformity was at its
peak. However desirable as an ideal, individual freedom often seemed
impractical. The mass institutions of the Second Wave required us to
give up freedom in order for the system to "work."<P>

The coming of the Third Wave turns that equation inside-out. The
complexity of Third Wave society is too great for any centrally
planned bureaucracy to manage. Demassification, customization,
individuality, freedom -- these are the keys to success for Third Wave
civilization.<P>


<h2>The Essence of Community</h2>

If the transition to the Third Wave is so positive, why are we
experiencing so much anxiety? Why are the statistics of social decay
at or near all-time highs?  Why does cyberspatial "rapture" strike
millions of prosperous Westerners as lifestyle <i>rupture</i>? Why do the
principles that have held us together as a nation seem no longer
sufficient -- or even wrong?<P>

The incoherence of political life is mirrored in disintegrating
personalities.  Whether 100% covered by health plans or not,
psychotherapists and gurus do a land-office business, as people wander
aimlessly amid competing therapies.  People slip into cults and covens
or, alternatively, into a pathological privatism, convinced that
reality is absurd, insane or meaningless. "If things are so good,"
Forbes magazine asked recently, "why do we feel so bad?"<P>

In part, this is why: Because we constitute the final generation of an
old civilization and, at the very same time, the first generation of a
new one.  Much of our personal confusion and social disorientation is
traceable to conflict <i>within us</i> and within our political
institutions -- between the dying Second Wave civilization and the
emergent Third Wave civilization thundering in to take its place.<P>

Second Wave ideologues routinely lament the breakup of mass
society. Rather than seeing this enriched diversity as an opportunity
for human development, they attach it as "fragmentation" and
"balkanization." But to reconstitute democracy in Third Wave terms, we
need to jettison the frightening but false assumption that more
diversity automatically brings more tension and conflict in society.<P>

Indeed, the exact reverse can be true: If 100 people all desperately
want the same brass ring, they may be forced to fight for it. On the
other hand, if each of the 100 has a different objective, it is far
more rewarding for them to trade, cooperate, and form symbiotic
relationships. Given appropriate social arrangements, diversity can
make for a secure and stable civilization.<P>

No one knows what the Third Wave communities of the future will look
like, or where "demassification" will ultimately lead.  It is clear,
however, that cyberspace will play an important role knitting together
in the diverse communities of tomorrow, facilitating the creation of
"electronic neighborhoods" bound together not by geography but by
shared interests.<P>

Socially, putting advanced computing power in the hands of entire
populations will alleviate pressure on highways, reduce air pollution,
allow people to live further away from crowded or dangerous urban
areas, and expand family time.<P>

The late Phil Salin (in Release 1.0 11/25/91) offered this
perspective: "[B]y 2000, multiple cyberspaces will have emerged,
diverse and increasingly rich.  Contrary to naive views, these
cyberspaces will not all be the same, and they will not all be open to
the general public. The global network is a connected 'platform' for a
collection of diverse communities, but only a loose, heterogeneous
community itself. Just as access to homes, offices, churches and
department stores is controlled by their owners or managers, most
virtual locations will exist as distinct places of private property."<P>

"But unlike the private property of today," Salin continued, "the
potential variations on design and prevailing customs will explode,
because many variations can be implemented cheaply in software. And
the 'externalities' associated with variations can drop; what happens
in one cyberspace can be kept from affecting other cyberspaces."<P>

"Cyberspaces" is a wonderful <i>pluralistic</i> word to open more minds to
the Third Wave's civilizing potential. Rather than being a centrifugal
force helping to tear society apart, cyberspace can be one of the main
forms of glue holding together an increasingly free and diverse
society.<P>

<h2>The Role of Government</h2>

The current Administration has identified the right goal: Reinventing
government for the 21st Century.  To accomplish that goal is another
matter, and for reasons explained in the next and final section, it is
not likely to be fully accomplished in the immediate future.  This
said, it is essential that we understand what it really means to
create a Third Wave government and begin the process of
transformation.<P>

Eventually, the Third Wave will affect virtually everything government
does.  The most pressing need, however, is to revamp the policies and
programs that are slowing the creation of cyberspace.  Second Wave
programs for Second Wave industries -- the status quo for the status
quo -- will do little damage in the short run.  It is the government's
efforts to apply its Second Wave modus operandi to the fast-moving,
decentralized creatures of the Third Wave that is the real threat to
progress.  Indeed, if there is to be an "industrial policy for the
knowledge age," it should focus on removing barriers to competition
and massively deregulating the fast-growing telecommunications and
computing industries.<P>

One further point should be made at the outset: Government should be
as strong and as big as it needs to be to accomplish its central
functions effectively and efficiently.  The reality is that a Third
Wave government will be vastly smaller (perhaps by 50 percent or more)
than the current one -- this is an inevitable implication of the
transition from the centralized power structures of the industrial age
to the dispersed, decentralized institutions of the Third.  But
smaller government does not imply weak government; nor does arguing
for smaller government require being "against" government for narrowly
ideological reasons.<P>

Indeed, the transition from the Second Wave to the Third Wave will
require a level of government <i>activity</i> not seen since the New
Deal. Here are five proposals to back up the point.<P>

1.  The Path to Interactive Multimedia Access<P>

The "Jeffersonian Vision" offered by Mitch Kapor and Jerry Berman has
propelled the Electronic Frontier Foundation's campaign for an "open
platform" telecom architecture:<ul>

"The amount of electronic material the superhighway can carry is
dizzying, compared to the relatively narrow range of broadcast TV and
the limited number of cable channels.  Properly constructed and
regulated, it could be open to all who wish to speak, publish and
communicate. None of the interactive services will be possible,
however, if we have an eight-lane data superhighway rushing into every
home and only a narrow footpath coming back out. Instead of settling
for a multimedia version of the same entertainment that is
increasingly dissatisfying on today's TV, we need a superhighway that
encourages the production and distribution of a broader, more diverse
range of programming" (New York Times 11/24/93 p. A25).
</ul>
The question is: What role should government play in bringing this
vision to reality? But also: Will incentives for the
openly-accessible, "many to many," national multimedia network
envisioned by EFF harm the rights of those now constructing thousands
of non-open local area networks?<P>

These days, interactive multimedia is the daily servant only of
avant-garde firms and other elites. But the same thing could have been
said about word-processors 12 years ago, or phone-line networks six
years ago. Today we have, in effect, universal access to personal
computing -- which no political coalition ever subsidized or
"planned." And America's <i>networking</i> menu is in a hyper-growth
phase. Whereas the accessing software cost $50 two years ago, today
the same companies hand it out free -- to get more people on-line.<P>

This egalitarian explosion has occurred in large measure because
government has stayed out of these markets, letting personal computing
take over while mainframes rot (almost literally) in warehouses, and
allowing (no doubt more by omission than commission) computer networks
to grow, free of the kinds of regulatory restraints that affect
phones, broadcast and cable.<P>

All of which leaves reducing barriers to entry and innovation as the
only effective near-term path to Universal Access.  In fact, it can be
argued that a near-term national interactive multimedia network is
impossible unless regulators permit much greater collaboration between
the cable industry and phone companies. The latter's huge fiber
resources (nine times as extensive as industry fiber and rising
rapidly) could be joined with the huge asset of 57 million broadband
links (i.e. into homes now receiving cable-TV service) to produce a
new kind of national network -- multimedia, interactive and (as costs
fall) increasingly accessible to Americans of modest means.<P>

That is why obstructing such collaboration -- in the cause of forcing
a competition between the cable and phone industries -- is socially
elitist. To the extent it prevents collaboration between the cable
industry and the phone companies, present federal policy actually
thwarts the Administration's own goals of access and empowerment.<P>

The other major effect of prohibiting the "manifest destiny" of cable
preserves the broadcast (or narrowband) television model. In fact,
stopping an interactive multimedia network perpetuates John Malone's
original formula -- which everybody (especially Vice-President Gore
and the FCC) claims to oppose because of the control it leaves with
system owners and operators.<P>

The key condition for replacing Malone's original narrowband model is
true bandwidth abundance. When the federal government prohibits the
interconnection of conduits, the model gains a new lease on life. In a
world of bandwidth scarcity, the owner of the conduit not only can but
must control access to it -- thus the owner of the conduit also shapes
the content. It really doesn't matter who the owner is. Bandwidth
scarcity will require the managers of the network to determine the
video programming on it.<P>

Since cable is everywhere, particularly within cities, it would allow
a closing of the gap between the knowledge-rich and
knowledge-poor. Cable's broadband "pipes" <i>already</i> touch almost
two-thirds of American households (and are easily accessible to
another one-fourth). The phone companies have broadband fiber. A
hybrid network -- co-ax plus fiber -- is the best means to the next
generation of cyberspace expansion. What if this choice is blocked?<P>

In that case, what might be called cyberspace democracy will be
confined to the computer industry, where it will arise from the
Internet over the years, led by corporate and suburban/exurban
interests. While not a technological calamity, this might be a
<i>social</i> perversion equivalent to what "Japan Inc." did to its middle
and lower classes for decades: Make them pay 50% more for the same
quality vehicles that were gobbling up export markets.<P>

Here's the parallel: If Washington forces the phone companies and
cable operators to develop supplementary and duplicative networks,
most other advanced industrial countries will attain cyberspace
democracy -- via an interactive multimedia "open platform" -- before
America does, despite this nation's technological dominance.<P>

Not only that, but the long-time alliance of East Coast broadcasters
and Hollywood glitterati will have a new lease on life: If their
one-way video empires win new protection, millions of Americans will
be deprived of the tools to help build a new interactive multimedia
culture.<P>

A contrived competition between phone companies and cable operators
will not deliver the two-way, multimedia and more civilized
tele-society Kapor and Berman sketch. Nor is it enough to simply "get
the government out of the way."  Real issues of antitrust must be
addressed, and no sensible framework exists today for addressing
them. Creating the conditions for universal access to interactive
multimedia will require a fundamental rethinking of government policy.<P>

2.  Promoting Dynamic Competition<p>

Technological progress is turning the telecommunications marketplace
from one characterized by "economies of scale" and "natural
monopolies" into a prototypical competitive market. The challenge for
government is to encourage this shift -- to create the circumstances
under which new competitors and new technologies will challenge the
natural monopolies of the past.<P>

Price-and-entry regulation makes sense for natural monopolies. The
tradeoff is a straightforward one: The monopolist submits to price
regulation by the state, in return for an exclusive franchise on the
market.<P>

But what happens when it becomes economically desirable to have more
than one provider in a market? The continuation of regulation under
these circumstances stops progress in its tracks. It prevents new
entrants from introducing new technologies and new products, while
depriving the regulated monopolist of any incentive to do so on its
own.<P>

Price-and-entry regulation, in short, is the antithesis of dynamic
competition.<P>

The alternative to regulation is antitrust. Antitrust law is designed
to prevent the acts and practices that can lead to the creation of new
monopolies, or harm consumers by forcing up prices, limiting access to
competing products or reducing service quality. Antitrust law is the
means by which America has, for over 120 years, fostered competition
in markets where many providers can and should compete.<P>

The market for telecommunications services -- telephone, cable,
satellite, wireless -- is now such a market. The implication of this
simple fact is also simple, and price/entry regulation of
telecommunications services -- by state and local governments as well
as the Federal government -- should therefore be replaced by antitrust
law as rapidly as possible.<P>

This transition will not be simple, and it should not be
instantaneous. If antitrust is to be seriously applied to
telecommunications, some government agencies (e.g. the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division) will need new types of expertise. And
investors in regulated monopolies should be permitted time to
re-evaluate their investments given the changing nature of the legal
conditions in which these firms will operate -- a luxury not afforded
the cable industry in recent years.<P>

This said, two additional points are important. First, delaying
implementation is different from delaying enactment. The latter should
be immediate, even if the former is not. Secondly, there should be no
half steps. Moving from a regulated environment to a competitive one
is -- to borrow a cliche -- like changing from driving on the left
side of the road to driving on the right: You can't do it gradually.<P>

3.  Defining and Assigning Property Rights<P>

In 1964, libertarian icon Ayn Rand wrote:<ul>

"It is the proper task of government to protect individual rights and,
as part of it, formulate the laws by which these rights are to be
implemented and adjudicated. It is the government's responsibility to
define the application of individual rights to a given sphere of
activity -- to define (i.e. to identify), not create, invent, donate,
or expropriate. The question of defining the application of property
rights has arisen frequently, in the wake of oil rights, vertical
space rights, etc. In most cases, the American government has been
guided by the proper principle: It sought to protect all the
individual rights involved, not to abrogate them." ("The Property
Status of the Airwaves," Objectivist Newsletter, April 1964)
</uL>
Defining property rights in cyberspace is perhaps the single most
urgent and important task for government information policy. Doing so
will be a complex task, and each key area -- the electromagnetic
spectrum, intellectual property, cyberspace itself (including the
right to privacy) -- involves unique challenges. The important points
here are:<ul>

First, this is a "central" task of government. A Third Wave government
will understand the importance and urgency of this undertaking and
begin seriously to address it; to fail to do so is to perpetuate the
politics and policy of the Second Wave.<P>

Secondly, the key principle of ownership by the people -- private
ownership -- should govern every deliberation. Government does not own
cyberspace, the people do.<P>

Thirdly, clarity is essential. Ambiguous property rights are an
invitation to litigation, channeling energy into courtrooms that serve
no customers and create no wealth. From patent and copyright systems
for software, to challenges over the ownership and use of spectrum,
the present system is failing in this simple regard.<P>
</ul>
The difference between America's historic economic success can, in
case after case, be traced to our wisdom in creating and allocating
clear, enforceable property rights. The creation and exploration of
cyberspace requires that wisdom to be recalled and reaffirmed.
<P>
4.  Creating Pro-Third-Wave Tax and Accounting Rules
<P>
We need a whole set of new ways of accounting, both at the level of
the enterprise, and of the economy.
<P>
"GDP" and other popular numbers do nothing to clarify the magic and
muscle of information technology. The government has not been very
good at measuring service-sector output, and almost all institutions
are incredibly bad at measuring the productivity of
<i>information</i>. Economists are stuck with a set of tools designed
during, or as a result of, the 1930s. So they have been measuring less
and less important variables with greater and greater precision.
<P>
At the level of the enterprise, obsolete accounting procedures cause
us to systematically <i>overvalue</i> physical assets (i.e. property) and
<i>undervalue</i> human-resource assets and intellectual assets. So, if you
are an inspired young entrepreneur looking to start a software
company, or a service company of some kind, and it is heavily
information-intensive, you will have a harder time raising capital
than the guy next door who wants to put in a set of beat-up old
machines to participate in a topped-out industry.
<P>
On the tax side, the same thing is true. The tax code always reflects
the varying lobbying pressures brought to bear on government. And the
existing tax code was brought into being by traditional manufacturing
enterprises and the allied forces that arose during the assembly
line's heyday.
<P>
The computer industry correctly complains that half their product is
depreciated in six months or less -- yet they can't depreciate it for
tax purposes. The U.S. semiconductor industry faces five-year
depreciation timetables for products that have three-year lives (in
contrast to Japan, where chipmakers can write off their fabrication
plants in one year). Overall, the tax advantage remains with the long,
rather than the short, product life-cycle, even though the latter is
where all design and manufacturing are trending.
<P>
It is vital that accounting and tax policies -- both those promulgated
by private-sector regulators like the Financial Accounting Standards
Board and those promulgated by the government at the IRS and elsewhere
-- start to reflect the shortened capital life-cycles of the Knowledge
Age, and the increasing role of <i>intangible</i> capital as "wealth."
<P>
5.  Creating a Third Wave Government
<P>
Going beyond cyberspace policy per se, government must remake itself
and redefine its relationship to the society at large. No single set
of policy changes that can create a future-friendly government. But
there are some yardsticks we can apply to policy proposals. Among
them:
<ul>
<li><b>Is it based on the factory model, i.e. on standardization, routine
and mass-production?</b> If so, it is a Second Wave policy. Third Wave
policies encourage uniqueness.<P>

<li><b>Does it centralize control?</b> Second Wave policies centralize power in
bureaucratic institutions; Third Wave policies work to spread power --
to empower those closest to the decision.<P>

<li><b>Does it encourage geographic concentration?</b> Second Wave policies
encourage people to congregate physically; Third Wave policies permit
people to work at home, and to live wherever they choose.<P>

<li><b>Is it based on the idea of mass culture -- of everyone watching the
same sitcoms on television -- or does it permit, even encourage,
diversity within a broad framework of shared values?</b> Third Wave
policies will help transform diversity from a threat into an array of
opportunities.<P>
</ul>
A serious effort to apply these tests to every area of government
activity -- from the defense and intelligence community to health care
and education -- would ultimately produce a complete transformation of
government as we know it.  Since that is what's needed, let's start
applying.
<P>

<h2>Grasping the Future</h2>

The conflict between Second Wave and Third Wave groupings is the
central political tension cutting through our society today. The more
basic political question is not who controls the last days of
industrial society, but who shapes the new civilization rapidly rising
to replace it. Who, in other words, will shape the nature of
cyberspace and its impact on our lives and institutions?
<P>
Living on the edge of the Third Wave, we are witnessing a battle not
so much over the nature of the future -- for the Third Wave will
arrive -- but over the nature of the transition. On one side of this
battle are the partisans of the industrial past. On the other are
growing millions who recognize that the world's most urgent problems
can no longer be resolved within the massified frameworks we have
inherited.
<P>
The Third Wave sector includes not only high-flying computer and
electronics firms and biotech start-ups. It embraces advanced,
information-driven manufacturing in every industry. It includes the
increasingly data-drenched services -- finance, software,
entertainment, the media, advanced communications, medical services,
consulting, training and learning. The people in this sector will soon
be the dominant constituency in American politics.
<P>
And all of those confront a set of constituencies made frightened and
defensive by their mainly Second Wave habits and locales:
Command-and-control regulators, elected officials, political
opinion-molders, philosophers mired in materialism, traditional
interest groups, some broadcasters and newspapers -- and every major
institution (including corporations) that believes its future is best
served by preserving the past.
<P>
For the time being, the entrenched powers of the Second Wave dominate
Washington and the statehouses -- a fact nowhere more apparent than in
the 1993 infrastructure bill: Over $100 billion for steel and cement,
versus one lone billion for electronic infrastructure. Putting aside
the question of whether the government should be building electronic
infrastructure in the first place, the allocation of funding in that
bill shows the Second Wave swamping the Third.
<P>
Only one political struggle so far contradicts the landscape offered
in this document, but it is a big one: Passage of the North American
Free Trade Agreement last November. This contest carried both sides
beyond partisanship, beyond regionalism, and -- after one climactic
debate on CNN -- beyond personality. The pro-NAFTA coalition opted to
serve the opportunity instead of the problem, and the future as
opposed to the past. That's why it constitutes a standout model for
the likely development of a Third Wave political dialectic.
<P>
But a "mass movement" for cyberspace is still hard to see. Unlike the
"masses" during the industrial age, this rising Third Wave
constituency is highly diverse. Like the economic sectors it serves,
it is demassified -- composed of individuals who prize their
differences. This very heterogeneity contributes to its lack of
political awareness. It is far harder to unify than the masses of the
past.
<P>
Yet there are key themes on which this constituency-to-come can
agree. To start with, liberation -- from Second Wave rules,
regulations, taxes and laws laid in place to serve the smokestack
barons and bureaucrats of the past. Next, of course, must come the
creation -- creation of a new civilization, founded in the eternal
truths of the American Idea.
<P>
It is time to embrace these challenges, to grasp the future and pull
ourselves forward. If we do so, we will indeed renew the American
Dream and enhance the promise of American life.

<TITLE><HEAD>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - May 1996</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>MAY 1996</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	
<P>

The cover of this May 1996 edition features portraits 
of six individuals who represent the spectrum of 
present-day conservatism.  (Two of the gentlemen, Sen. 
Robert Dole (R-Kans.) and retired general Colin Powell, 
are often described as political moderates, but they 
both have support from a significant portion of the 
self-identified conservative populace.)<P>
Among those portrayed, syndicated columnist and two-
time presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan and former 
ambassador Alan Keyes are furthest to the right of the 
political spectrum.  Buchanan, who has emphasized the 
controversial issues of abortion, immigration, 
affirmative action and the exportation of American jobs, 
calls his a "conservatism of the heart."<P>  
Keyes waged his presidential campaign this year on 
the primary issue of returning America to its moral 
foundation, beginning with the restoration of the two-
parent, marriage-based family.  For Keyes, the most 
crucial aspect of this moral revival starts with 
outlawing legalized abortions, which he says is the 
single most important issue in relationship to 
everything else.<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with his championing of 
the GOP "Contract With America," has advanced an agenda 
which combines fiscal and social conservatism.  
Unfortunately, after several months of relentless 
pummeling by the media, as well as a few public missteps 
of his own, Gingrich has the highest negative ratings of 
any political figure today.  The existence of these high 
negatives, in effect, precludes his ability to carry the 
conservative banner to the American electorate.<P>
Former Congressman and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 
focuses most of his attention on the fiscal and economic 
issues of restructuring the tax system by creating a 
flat tax, cutting taxes and expanding the economy.  He 
has also concentrated much of his energy on swelling the 
ranks of the Republican Party by including more minority 
and low-income voters.  However, he has had limited 
results, though not from a lack of effort.  In fact, 
Kemp has been criticized in some quarters for even 
making an attempt to bring non-traditional voters into 
the GOP's "big tent".<P>
Dole and Powell, who are perhaps the least 
conservative of the bunch, nonetheless enjoy broad 
support among many conservatives who believe that in 
order to maintain a Republican legislative majority in 
both houses of Congress and expand majority status to 
the state and local levels, effective outreach to 
moderates and independents is essential.  Both have been 
chided by some of their fellow Republicans for not being 
conservative enough on social issues.<P>
As is the case with most political movements, 
conservatism is largely defined by its messengers.  When 
a greater proportion of these messengers are described 
as "extreme," then, by extension, conservatism itself is 
believed to be extreme as well.<P>
Much of this definition process takes place through 
the mass media.  For example, conservatives are often 
referred to disparagingly by journalists as members of 
the "far right," the "religious right" or the "extreme 
right."  Yet liberals are almost never referred to by 
the press as the "far left."  These negative 
descriptions of conservatives are planted in the minds 
of the American public to the point where they as 
presumed to be true, whether they are factual or not.<P>
Conservatives would do well to get a handle on how 
they are defined, if they hope to expand their ranks 
beyond their base of committed activists.

<title>The Lessons of the 1992 and 1994 Elections -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h1>The Lessons of the 1992 and 1994 Elections</h1>

<b>by Vin Weber [From the February 1995 <i>American Civilization</i>]</b><br>


Throughout the good times of the 1980s, when the Republicans were really
doing very well, we used to look at the polling and we found an interesting
phenomenon.<p>

If you divided the zones of public policy issues in three ways, Republicans
were able to dominate the 1980s at the Presidential level because they
owned the national security/foreign policy zone and the economic zone. On
just about any question you asked related to those two zones of issues,
people had overwhelmingly greater confidence in the Republican Party than
they did in the Democratic Party.<p>

But here is a third zone comprised of social issues. And whether it is the
environment or poverty or health care or any of those things that we think
of as domestic policy, that zone remained firmly in the grasp of the
Democratic Party.<p>

Thus while people were endorsing Republican approaches to the economy, they
continued to believe in what they had learned over the decades since the
New Deal: that government leadership should address a whole range of
problems.<p>

And while they might not have been happy with the way government was
addressing problems, they didn't see any alternative to a governmental
approach to environmental protection or the problems of the poor or
anything else to the traditionally associated with New Deal Liberals or
Great Society Liberals or the Democratic Party generally.<p>

But as long as we were winning the Cold War and the economy was strong, it
didn't matter, and so Republicans won elections at least at the
Presidential level.<p>

Then you get to the 1992 election, which all of us who are Republicans
ought to remember these days when we are euphoric about 1994. Much of the
Clinton campaign victory was owed to the fact that the public, now in a
period of some uncertainty about the economy and with the Cold War won,
rejected what they viewed as the passivity of the Republican Party, and the
Bush Administration more specifically, toward that third zone of domestic
policy issues.<p>

The Republicans were swept aside because the voters were rejecting a party
that had nothing to say, in their view, about a whole range of social
issues and perhaps even a bit about the economy because we lost some of our
edge from the 1980s.<p>

The best example of this is the health care issue. It's important to
refresh your memory; Bill Clinton did not invent health care out of whole
cloth.<p>

All of us who were in the Congress at that time and doing things like
holding town meetings had known that for years that public concern about
the issue was very real. Clinton was reacting to a genuine concern that had
been rising with the public.<p>

Why then the dramatic reversal of 1994? The health care issue and how it
unfolded over the course of 1994 tells much of that story.<p>

Again, I make the point, it's important to understand that the health care
issue was not an invented or contrived issue. It was a real serious concern
of people. After its failure legislatively, and certainly after the 1994
elections, there seems to be a sense that this was inevitable; what a huge
mistake the Clinton people made in trying to do this with our health care
system. It was clearly a mistake. But not one that was nearly as
predictable as we now might say in retrospect. Because every other time a
Democratic President has come into office and then did precisely what
President Clinton did in 1993, he succeeded.<p>

They identified a major national problem, proposed a Federal Government
solution, certainly encountered some opposition from those who were
ideologically opposed to use the Federal Government to solve problems, but
basically got their program enacted.<p>

Why did this not happen with Clinton's health care proposal leads to a real
understanding of the questions that face us today in politics. Because
again, the problem was real. But by the end of the debate, people had
rejected it. Why? Too bureaucratic. Too centralized. Too expensive. Too
much Government.<p>

Let me tell you, as popular as the program is, the Social Security system,
if it were being created out of whole cloth today, would be subject to all
those same criticisms because it is centralized and rather bureaucratic.
Yet those criticisms wouldn't have sunk Lyndon Johnson or Franklin
Roosevelt.<p>

It's a different day.<p>

And what happened was, in the 1994 election, we saw the rejection of that New
Deal liberal model of problem solving once and for all. The question now is,
"What can replace it?" A survey done by Frank Luntz for 
<a href="/pff/index">The Progress & Freedom Foundation</a> immediately
after the election bore out the rejection of that traditional model of
governmental problem solving by the voters in the 1994 election.<p>

Sixty to seventy percent of the voters in Luntz's survey consistently said
that every one of those domestic problems today is better solved by the
state or local government than by the Federal Government. And 59 percent
said they thought private charity could solve the problems of the poor
better than any level of government.<p>

A rejection certainly of centralized government and a rejection of
government as an instrument that we really haven't seen in any of our
lifetimes. That's much of the story of 1994.<p>

Now the question to me is, "How do we make sure that in 1995 we don't
simply lead to the result that we experienced in 1993?" I think we need to
remember some of the lessons of 1992 as we look forward and try to deal
with these problems.<p>

The first one is there has to be that alternative model of problem solving
that people did not see in the Bush Administration. This model must include
a serious commitment to a devolution and a diffusion of power. If we simply
try to reform the Federal approach to problem solving to be more consistent
with what we might think of as conservative values, it seems to me we are
going to come up against the public's fundamental lack of confidence in a
centralized approach to government.<p>

Welfare is probably the best example. A reform of the Federal welfare
system is not in our interest. We must put resources in the hands of other
entities so that people see an alternative model to problem solving rather
than simply the passive approach to problems that they've learned over
several generations of Federal Government dominance.<p>

That means devolving power to the states and localities. But even more
important, because government itself is being rejected even at state and
local levels, is diffusing power out from government to individuals.<p>

We need to invent a model which reflects the flattening of society, the
rejection of centralized edifices of control, which instead leads to the
empowerment, to use an overworked word, of people in their communities and
in their families to solve their problems.<p>

The second message that we should remember from the 1992 elections is a
basic economic issue. But it's important politically that we recognize an
important new reality. There seems to be a conventional wisdom that argues
that a strong economy benefits the party in power and a weak economy
benefits the party out of power. And hence, if the economy turns sour, that
certainly will finish the Clinton Administration off once and for all.<p>

I would argue that there's a different reality at work today, and it
relates directly to the dynamic of the Third Wave forces that are
transforming our society. The new reality is that a strong economy benefits
the party that is on the side of the transformation of society currently
taking place. And when the economy turns weak, the party that is warning
about the dangers of that transformation benefits.<p>

That is why Republicans just won a stunning realigning election in the
midst of a pretty strong economy. That is also why, if the economy
genuinely turns south in 1996, it will probably help the Clinton
Administration far more than it will help the Republicans in the Congress
who are arguing that now is the time to devolve power and divest the
government of most of its authority.<p>

Thus we must remember, progress will be achieved more readily when people
feel more economically secure. When people are worried about their
paychecks, they are less willing to discard the comfortable, but no longer
workable, systems designed for the Second Wave.<p>

</HEAD>

<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>DECEMBER 1995</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	
<P>
On its face, the concept of children's rights appears to be worthwhile.
After all, none of us want to see children abused by adults--be
they parents, guardians or others were are biologically unrelated,
but who wield dominance and power based on their size and experience.
<P>
However, some child-welfare advocates, usually liberal in their
political persuasion, have taken things too far. The policies
of well-meaning liberals have already resulted in the virtual
destruction of poor families and the weakening of middle-class
families by making the role of the male-husband and father-dispensable.
They are now on the road to dealing the final blow by separating
children from the one remaining parent--the mother.
<P>
Just listen to the rhetoric of so called children's advocates
like Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund. In
her speeches, Edelman, a close friend of first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, cites numerous statistics on the numbers and conditions
of poor children.
<P>
But Edelman and others like her, while perhaps well intentioned,
fail to recognize that children have no income-earning ability.
They are the responsibility of their parents, not wards of the
state. There is no substitute for loving, responsible parents,
who discipline their children-no matter what their incomes.
<P>
Government interference with child-rearing has already weakened
parental authority. Parents report instances of their children
calling (or threatening to call) Children's Protective Services--not
because of child abuse, but because of disciplinary measures they
don't like.
<P>
Children also threaten to file lawsuits when they are unhappy
with curfews and limitations on activities. Mothers raising teen-age
children alone often have difficulty maintaining control when
the government is always in the background, thwarting their control
in their own homes.
<P>
And, as we've seen in several cases over the past few years, children
are now given power within our court system to divorce their parents.
Our government has given our children, who are in our care as
ordained by God, the wherewithal to usurp our authority.
<P>
Added to this, most state governments have completely removed
teachers' authority to utilize discipline in the classroom. Unlike
classrooms of 20 to 30 years ago, students are now aware that
teachers' and principals' hands are tied by the state when it
comes to applying punishment for deeds done in school. With this
knowledge, students threaten and, in many cases, inflict bodily
harm upon teachers. This is indeed a sad state of affairs.
<P>
The primary problem we face with youth today is that many parents
no longer take an active role in child-rearing and depend on others--schools,
churches and the government-to do it for them.
<P>
Liberals have found no solution to child poverty with their theories;
but they will create a whole different set of problems if they
continue to focus on government programs rather than strengthening
the family and home environment.

<h2>Freedom to Pray and Sin</h2>

The Internet is driving the ACLU
and Christian Coalition Together<BR>
<P>
<a href="/pff/people/st.html#O_Donnell">Richard F. O'Donnell</a></B>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Prohibition became law because bootleggers,
who stood to gain economically from outlawing alcohol, quietly
supported the &quot;religious&quot; crusade against evil liquor.
Today, the forces of state control who want the government to
regulate Cyberspace quietly support the moral crusade against
pornography on the Internet. This modern day &quot;Bootleggers
and Baptists&quot; coalition has driven a stake through the traditional
civil libertarian constituency and left the ACLU crowd completely
bewildered.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress
earlier this year and now being challenged in court, criminalizes
the transmission and posting of indecent material on line. In
the year of the Republican Congressional Revolution a <I>Democrat</I>
(James Exon of Nebraska) was the prime sponsor of the censorship
act. Opponents were never able to label it purely a move by &quot;Newt
Gingrich's radical freshmen&quot; because so many Democrats supported
it (and Gingrich did not). For instance, a recent WIRED magazine
article entitled &quot;The Rogues Gallery&quot; that profiled
&quot;the legislators who helped make government censorship a
reality on the Internet&quot; didn't profile even one Republican.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Liberal legislators and President Clinton,
who normally have few problems with the ACLU and abhor the &quot;radical
Christian right,&quot; went right along with them in attempt to
increase state control. How is it legislators who voted against
efforts to ban flag burning on the grounds of free speech suddenly
voted to ban dirty pictures?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Simply put, the Democrats saw in the censorship
act a way to assert government regulation of the Internet, the
first step in letting Washington bureaucrats regulate Cyberspace
in the &quot;public interest.&quot; These liberal paternalists
intuitively favor state control in the mode of Senator Bob Kerry,
who thinks that, because the FCC regulates telephone and television
transmission, it is a natural extension of its powers to regulate
the Internet. These are members of an elite who believe that government
is in a better position than parents to determine the programming
content of television networks or in a better position than the
market and to determine the standards for emerging technology.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Defenders of free speech lost their battle
over the censorship act because, when their traditional Democratic
allies abandoned them, they were unable to get over their distaste
for moralism and recognize their new natural allies. The key to
victory for civil libertarians is understanding that moralists
(e.g. &quot;the Christian right&quot;) are <I>not</I> a unified,
monolithic front.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is a small group of statist moralists
who are seeking government power in order to impose their views
on the rest of America. They may pose a threat to free speech.
Yet most &quot;Christian activists&quot; are not interested in
imposing anything on others. Instead, they are actively <I>opposing</I>
a government that is abridging their rights to freedom of faith.
Statist moralists advocate not just a silent moment in school
but a school led prayer. Anti-statist moralists just want schools
to stop distributing condoms because it undermines the lessons
they are trying to teach their children about abstinence until
marriage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The strategic error of civil libertarians in
the fight over the censorship act was to lump together the statist
moralists and the anti-statist moralists. The latter are natural
allies of the free speechers (for the same reason the Christian
Coalition and Libertarians call the Republican party home). The
ACLU crowd was unable to create a free speech alliance with Christians
because they failed to acknowledge that attempts to limit the
availability of pornography is very American.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The legacy of the Puritans remains strong in
our nation. Throughout our history Americans have been ready to
demand conformity and to impose through law moral standards (recall
abolition - for which America went to war). Foes of the Internet
censorship lost their battle by labeling their opponents &quot;unAmerican.&quot;
Steve Guest, a network consultant who is party to a class action
suit against attempts to shut down on-line adult sites, summed
up the civil libertarian attitude when he said such actions were
&quot;violating the basic principles on which this country was
founded.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Calling attempts to regulate pornography &quot;unAmerican&quot;
does not sway many people - especially Congressmen. Moral crusades
against sinful material are as quintessentially American as individual
liberty. Civil libertarians need to acknowledge the natural place
of moralism in American life. Otherwise, they blind themselves
from recognizing their true enemy. Freedom isn't threatened by
moralism - we are free precisely because we are moral beings.
Freedom is threatened by the advocates of state control.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Civil libertarians need to reach out to anti-statist
moralists and show them that it is no better to let the government
in our computers than our churches. The way to fight pornography
is on individual computer screens, with technology that empowers
parents to determine what their children see - not what some invisible
bureaucrat or court decides is appropriate.<BR>

<p>

   The issue is often raised, particularly in presidential election years, whether or not America needs a third party.  More specifically, for the past few presidential election cycles, voters have not been completely satisfied with the nominees from both major parties and they pine for a third option.  This year is no different.
<p>
   A recent poll conducted by the Gordon S. Black Corporation revealed that 46 percent of voters are angry at both parties and 47 percent said a new party is needed.  However, the percentage of those who are angry with both parties is down 10 points from four years ago.
   Voters have a virtual panoply of third-party options.  Besides the somewhat familiar Libertarian Party, Green Party and Ross Perot's Reform Party, there are the lesser known Natural Law Party, Patriot Party, Democratic Socialists of America, Communist Party, Independence Party, Socialist Party and D.C. Statehood Party, to name a few.
<p>
   Nevertheless, the existence of so many parties with relatively small constituencies and narrow agendas poses an obstacle for the creation of a competitive third party.  The 22 percent core supporters of a new party are too diverse in their beliefs and issue positions to coalesce within a single party effectively.
<p>
   No better evidence of this exists than the hodgepodge of attendees at the United We Stand America convention in Dallas last year, which I attended.  This was the much-publicized conference to which Perot invited all of the contending GOP candidates, including Sen. Bob Dole and Patrick J. Buchanan, as well as a representative of the Clinton administration.  The lack of a resounding theme, other than anger with Democrats and Republicans, was instructive.
<p>   
Those attending ranged from opponents of NAFTA and GATT, to strict constitutionalists, to gun owner enthusiasts, to conspiracy theorists, to balanced budget advocates, to critics of the Council on Foreign Relations, to pro-lifers and pro-choicers, to even a fair sprinkling of what could accurately be described as kooks.  No common thread recurred during my conversations with conference attendees, except disillusionment with the two major parties.
<p>
   Perot's Reform Party appears to have the most momentum for now.  As this edition went to press, it had met ballot access requirements in New Mexico, bringing to 12 the number of states where the party has qualified to appear on the 1996 ballot.  The other states are California, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Minnesota.
<p>   
Petition drives are under way in 25 other states and organizers are confident the party will be on the ballot in all 50 states.  The party is in court in Arkansas, in a suit to get on that state's ballot.  Ballot access is being achieved either by placing the actual party on the ballot or through a stand-in candidate who, in most cases, will presumably be Ross Perot.
<p>
   Perhaps the threat of a viable third party will persuade the Democrats and/or Republicans to more directly address voters' concerns with substantive proposals, rather than campaign using attack ads, sound bites, wedge issues and symbolic gestures.  The quality of the campaigns waged during the coming months, or the lack thereof, should be a good indicator.

<title>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy -- PFF</title>
</head>

<br>
<h2>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy</h2>
<b>By Bruce Yandle</b>
<p>

<p>
Since around 1970, the United States and most of the industrialized world
have been engaged in a massive effort to improve and guard environmental
quality.  It is a gross understatement to say that the struggles along the
way are well documented.  Indeed, anyone who has attempted to stay abreast of
the topic has built a veritable library of hearings, books, journals and
special reports. 
<P>

What have we learned?  How can we improve?  Can we identify a better path
than the one we have traveled?  Some call for a revolution in policy.  Others
expect to see evolutionary change.  One thing is certain: there will be
change.  The reasons?  Our current command-and-control-based policy is
obsolete.  It is time to replace the 1970 centralized model that emerged when
information was costly with something that fits a world calling for
flexibility, decentralization and improved environmental protection. 

<P>
I hope for metamorphic change:  A new butterfly to replace the old
caterpillar.  I hope to see policy based on results, not inputs.  It is my
hope that our measure of success will be environmental improvement, not
technologies, suits and number of enforcement actions. First I will address
broad principles, and then use those principles to consider some flowers that
have emerged in the concrete of control.  By examining these exceptions to
the rule, we may find ideas that form some elements for a revised
environmental policy agenda.<p>

<H3><center>
Two Broad Options:  Systems and Process
</H3></center>
<P>
There are two very broad options that can be selected when a community of
people seeks to regulate collective behavior.  I refer to one option as a
systems approach.  The other, a process approach.  

<P>
The systems approach involves detailed study of key features of the
particular problem being addressed (i.e., air pollution).  Those directing
the approach seek to understand minute features of the problem, to develop
detailed rules of behavior and then to enforce those rules.  The focus is on
inputs, behavior, technology; it is what we all call command-and-control
regulation.  

<P>
Command-and-control assumes that if inputs are right, outcomes will take care
of themselves.  Monitoring is not necessary. It is a rigid, rule-filled
approach to the problem that works pretty well for static situations and
homogeneous polluters, where most important features of the problem do not
change and the pollutants being controlled do not interact with or form other
pollutants. The systems approach believes that well specified pollution
problems can be solved so long as the incentives faced by human agents have
little bearing on the outcome. Unfortunately, there are not many situations
like this in today's world.  The methods used to control automobile emissions
provide a pertinent example of the systems approach.  

<P>
In contrast, the process approach develops constraints and linkages to them
that cause individual decision makers to account for their actions.  It
focuses on broader environmental outcomes, not inputs.  Monitoring is
crucial, and community participants have an incentive to help monitor.  

<P>
The process approach is better geared for dynamic, multiple pollution
situations, where the decision makers and conditions are heterogeneous and
the cost of continuously gaining highly technical information and
implementing it is very large.  The constraints may be rules of property and
liability that give rise to costs and rewards to all who are a part of the
process.  For example, simple common law rules say polluters -- air, water,
odor, solid waste -- have no right to impose uninvited costs on their
neighbors, but that the neighbors and polluters can negotiate solutions.
  
<P>
River basin associations and multi-state compacts, which are enlarged common
law approaches, embody rules of property and law that yield incentives to
reduce the cost of meeting a community's environmental quality constraint.
River basin managers monitor outcomes.  The responsibility of paying for
damages disciplines polluters; the ability of lovers of environmental quality
to purchase more environmental quality provides some flexibility.  Outcomes
-- the river -- not inputs, are what matter in the process approach.  Indeed,
no one really cares very much about inputs other than those who sell and
service them.  
<br>
<P>
After 25 years of experience, we know that systems approaches worked
relatively well for some things in some settings.  We also know that taking a
systems approach to process problems or applying a process approach to
certain systems problems encourages frustration and generates unneeded costs.
 Sadly, it seems, the systems approach diverts attention from the goal being
sought.  Environmental outcomes are often relegated to the back seat, while
regulators drive toward input compliance.  
<P>

<H3><center>
Experience with Systems and Exceptions
</H3></center>

<P>
By and large, the United States has taken a systems approach.  Consider a few
capsules of highly stylized results:  Air quality regulators cannot readily
focus on related water pollution problems.  Hazardous waste regulators are
not allowed to make comparative assessments of priority sites and to vary
their allocation of efforts.  Property rights are bruised in an effort to
protect wetlands, which themselves are not well defined.  Command-and-control
causes endangered species to become liabilities instead of assets.  In short,
we have learned that the "one-suit-fits-all approach" works well for a static
population of identical actors, but not so well for a diverse and rapidly
changing economy.

<P>
The high cost of uniform input management has led to some creativity and
alteration of rules.  Cracks develop in the command-and-control concrete, as
individual actors try to custom tailor the regulatory suits that do not fit
so well.  At some point, after all, people become concerned about the
environment and what is happening to it.  By looking closely at what goes on
in the cracks, we may discover a positive agenda for revised environmental
policy.

<P>
Let me quickly list some evolving approaches to the goal of environmental
protection that I believe help to identify elements of a future agenda.

<P>
<ul>
<li> Facility focus with complete flexibility in achieving goals.  The Amoco
Yorktown story informs us of a remarkable experiment where EPA and Amoco
formed a partnership and did a top-to-bottom assessment of the Yorktown
refinery.  Putting command-and-control to one side, the two parties for the
first time assessed the environment.  They found that some things were far
better than expected; other things that previously received little or no
regulatory attention offered low cost opportunities for environmental
improvement.  By focusing on goals and allowing flexibility, everyone won --
the community, EPA and Amoco.  

<P>
<li> Third-party audits and open doors.  The world chemical industry has
embarked on a program called "responsible care."  The program encourages
chemical firms to form partnerships with communities, to invite third-party
audits, to show what firms are doing, how they are controlling pollution and
to illustrate how more can be accomplished if flexibility is allowed.  To
reduce the understandable fear of using third-party audits, the State of
South Carolina is considering legislation that would prevent the use of such
findings from incriminating firms and individuals where violations are
voluntarily discovered and corrected.

<P>
<li> River basin associations.  North Carolina's Tar-Pamlico River Basin
Association is North America's only operating association that brings
together point and nonpoint sources of pollution in a combined trading effort
to reduce nitrogen and phosphorous loadings in a river.  I should point out
that this approach is common place elsewhere.  Property rights and contracts
provide the vehicle.  Command-and-control simply could not do the job in
North Carolina.  EPA wiped away the systems approach, focused on the process
and allowed complete flexibility in achieving a water quality goal.  This
could not have been accomplished without the vital support of the
Environmental Defense Fund.  Again, everyone won -- the community, the
polluters, the regulators and the river.  

<P>
<li> ISO 14000 and the State of Pennsylvania.  Global markets are pushing
environmental goals with forces that sometimes surpass those of national
regulators.  The International Standards Organization, a nongovernmental
organization, assists and audits firms that seek to be ISO certified, a
contractual requirement in many cases for selling goods in world markets.
The State of Pennsylvania now accepts ISO 14000 certification as a
substitute for evidence that firms located there meet Pennsylvania standards.
The market has replaced the regulator.

<P>
<li> Superfund and the Dutch System.  The Dutch system for dealing with
abandoned hazardous waste sites has been adopted generally across all of
Europe, which has far more abandoned sites than the U.S.  The triage system
allows for some sites to be contained, not mitigated, some to be returned to
full use because of low risk, and some to be mitigated, often at public
expense.  The mitigated sites must be cleaned to the level of customary use
for the land in question.  The result:  There is no celebration of
litigation.  Sites are being cleaned.  Property rights tend to be protected
and costs, contained.<p>
</ul>

<H3><center>
Elements of an Agenda for Change
</H3></center>

<P>What does this say about an agenda?  Let me suggest the following:

<P>
<ul>
<li> Goal orientation.  Future environmental policy should place a premium on
measuring, monitoring and reporting on environmental quality.  Progress
toward specific goals, as set by communities, should be the measure of
success, not the number of suits, enforcement actions or installation of
technology.

<P>
<li> Flexibility.  Performance goals with complete flexibility for attaining
them should be the general foundation for all environmental policy, with
command-and-control occupying the default position. Innovation should be
rewarded, not penalized.  Valuable knowledge must be conserved. 
 
<P>
<li> Biological envelopes.  The larger environmental envelope that surrounds a
community of environmental users should form the zone of control.
River-basin, water-shed and air-shed associations, as well as multi-state
compacts, should be encouraged and given flexibility in accomplishing goals.
Again, the monitoring function is crucial.

<P>
<li> Community common sense.  Decision making for environmental protection
should be located where outcomes and costs matter the most -- at the level of
the environmental user.  People in communities can be trusted to protect
themselves from harm.  Those facing the problems have the greatest incentive
to find the least-cost way of dealing with the problems.  Local communities
should rise to the top of the regulatory hierarchy.

<P>
<li> Common law.  Steps should be taken to salvage common law protection of
private environmental rights.  Statutory shields against common law remedies
should be eliminated, provided the community has participated in determining
environmental goals and solutions.  

<P>
<li> Property rights.  Property rights should be respected.  When private
parties are asked to provide public benefits by altering the use of privately
held rights, they should be paid.
</ul>

<H3><center>
Final Thoughts
</center></H3>

As we consider elements for a new environmental policy, we do so recognizing
that we live in a world that faces many other compelling demands.  We hear
about health care, safety, retirement security, education and emerging
communities elsewhere that grapple with even more primitive wants and needs.
Global competition is mentioned endlessly, and it is real.  

<P>
The basic blueprints for the nation's environmental policy are now 25 years
old.  Not many things that old have survived into today's dynamic world.  We
no longer have a smokestack economy.  But we still have countless smokestack
regulations that stand in the way of effective environmental improvement.  In
prehistoric times, we are told sharks and dinosaurs lived in the same
periods.  The dinosaur, full of bones, and not very flexible, did not adjust
and adapt.  The shark, which does not have a bone in its body, only
cartilage, made it to modern times.  Our new environmental policy should be
shark, not a dinosaur.
<P>

<TITLE><HEAD>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - April 1996</title></HEAD>
<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>APRIL 1996</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	
<P>
     Our April cover visually describes the Democrats' current operating philosophy.  For the past few election cycles, voters have been pulling Democrats in the direction of limited and more efficient government which is less intrusive and less costly.  Yet, Democrats resist, opting instead for the status quo.  Present the Democrats with a problem and they will, always, present a federal government program as the solution.<p>
     A recent case in point is President Clinton's handling of the issue of domestic abuse, with his unveiling of a national 1-800 "hotline" for abuse victims.<p>
     On its face, a national domestic abuse hotline sounds like a good idea.  The thought that some poor woman is being physically abused on a regular basis by her spouse or boyfriend is frightening to women from all sectors of society.  Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, applauded the President's effort.  "[B]ecause of this president's leadership every woman in this country will have a toll-free and anonymous lifeline to safety, whenever or wherever she needs it," she said.<p>
     Sounds good so far.  But that, among other things, is exactly what is wrong with most federal social programs.  They appeal to our emotions, rather than our logic.<p>
     In this case, logic would dictate that a centralized government program administered from Washington to assist domestic abuse victims is inefficient at best, when local programs can operate more quickly and effectively, and at a lower cost.  After all, what good would it do for a woman who is being abused to call a bureaucrat hundreds or thousands of miles away in Washington?<p>
     In addition, this program exacerbates the time-honored tradition of politicians nudging citizens to look to Washington for solutions, rather than find them in their own communities.  Rather than promoting community-based problem solving, this hotline promotes Washington-based problem solving, adding to our already massive national deficit.<p>
     In fact, this hotline program could actually be dangerous.  A woman who is experiencing an abusive situation could waste precious time calling our nation's capitol, when she should be calling 911 in her local area where help is only minutes away.<p>
     And at a cost of $1 million, this hotline hardly comes cheap.  But, from all accounts, media were so busy "cheerleading" the president for his sensitivity, that they forgot to ask about whether or not the program would actually benefits those for whom it was designed.  Members of Congress were silent as well.  And who ends up holding the bag for media's and politicians' failure to do their jobs?  All of us do, as American taxpayers.<p>
     Programs like this hotline can be a ready-made source of data on social problems.  This information can then be used to justify increased funding or to dramatize an issue.  In five or 10 years, when the program's budget has multipled 10-fold and Congress examines whether the growth in spending should be cut to help the government live within its means, constituents can then point to the numbers of calls received via the hotline and declare, "If you cut this program, 10,000 women will die every year as a result of domestic violence."<p>
     Of course, they have no hard evidence to support their declaration, other than the fact that they have, by virtue of starting the hotline, funneled calls into a central location.  But these battle cries are enough to make all but the most vigilent of Congressmembers back down.<p>
     It is up to each of us, as taxpayers, to keep a watchful eye on politicians' attempts to buy our votes in the future.  Unless we refuse to keep falling for the scam repeated by our elected officials every election year, our federal deficit and national debt will only continue to spiral out of control. <p>

<title>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - October 1995</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>

<h3>OCTOBER 1995</h3>
<p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>
	Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may be one of the most maligned political figures today.  Besides being castigated for his court opinions, Thomas has had to endure attacks on his racial loyalty.
	<P>At the NAACP annual convention in Minneapolis this summer, Thomas' name was raised at virtually every session.  He was called a traitor to his community, a "pimp," and "Clarence 'I don't want to be black' Thomas."  In her opening speech, the group's chair, Myrlie Evers-Williams, read a long sarcastic poem in his honor:<P>
<blockquote>"How did his mind get so twisted<br>
And who does he think he is. . .<br>
And how can he imagine he is able<br>
To be anything but black?"<P></blockquote><P>

	In the June 26 edition of <I>Time</i> magazine, columnist Jack E. White, who is black, described Thomas as "the scariest of all the hobgoblins" in Washington, D.C.  "The most disturbing thing about Thomas is not his conclusions, but his twisted reasoning and bilious rage," continued White, as if he knows Thomas personally.<P>
	On Sept. 12, the infamous New York preacher, Rev. Al Sharpton, led a band of 600 people in a protest near the associate justice's Northern Virginia home.<P>
	Thomas was not home during Sharpton's 90-minute prayer meeting and rally.  "We are his people and we have the right to come see what we have done for him, even if he wants to act like he has forgotten," said Sharpton.<P>
	He pointed to Thomas' opinions in cases that overhauled federal affirmative action programs, voting rights and a school desegregation plan, calling Thomas an "Uncle Tom" and comparing him to the apostle Thomas, who demanded to see the marks of Jesus' crucifixion.<P>
	But Sharpton, a flamboyant publicity seeker, has it wrong.  He wants to claim Thomas' success for himself while, at the same time, bring him down to his level.  I think not.
	<P>Whether or not one agrees with Thomas' Supreme Court decisions, it is clear that he is being judged by a harsher standard than any other justice sitting on the high court.  Thomas is expected to make rulings which are in line with the civil rights establishment's agenda, even though he disagrees with their approach.  Having actually read Thomas opinions, I've concluded that he would like to bring an end to the racial categorization we have instituted for the last 30 years and bring us all into one tent of Americans--before it's too late.
	<P>Thomas may be ahead of his time.  His vision for black Americans may be one which will be reached in the next millennium, but certainly not with the help of the black elite.  In their view, blacks will remain perpetual victims.  They will never be able to compete on a level playing field, as long as they are outnumbered by white Americans.  
	<P>This distorted view not only gives no hope to today's young people, but is utterly false.  Over and over again, blacks have demonstrated that they can compete in all aspects of American life.  Thomas just doesn't want blacks to be automatically assumed to be inferior, and he rejects the notion that, in all things intellectual and economic, black Americans are simply outgunned at every turn.
	<P>I join Thomas in rejecting that notion.  And I will keep him in my prayers, as he may be paving the way for a brighter American future.
		<P>

<title>Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Almost three years ago, then presidential candidate Bill Clinton stated that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earners."  The wrong way back then, but the right way now as increasing the minimum wage is viewed as a politically popular strategy to reconnect with the Democrat's traditional base of working class Americans.<p>
While most economists agree that minimum wage increases do more economic harm than good (both for workers and the economy), President Clinton has proposed a 21 percent increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.<p>
Democratic party leaders in the Congress are also working feverishly to include a
minimum wage hike into welfare reform proposals, presumably to be acted upon this fall.<p>
Studies conducted over the past 25 years have consistently concluded that with each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, a corresponding 1 percent to 2 percent decline in entry-level employment results.  The General Accounting Office,  the Brookings Institution, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and various Presidential Commission's have all reached this universal conclusion.<p>
Even the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the "New Democrat" organization once led by the President, declared that "the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history." <p>    
As minimum wage hike proponents pose the issue as improving the living wage of lower-income workers, most businesses and their workers view minimum wage jobs as entry-level positions -- by which the majority of workers gain skills to move onto higher-paying work.<p>
An independent study in 1992 demonstrated that within a 12 month period, 63 percent of American workers at the minimum wage earned higher wages.   Not surprisingly, about half of minimum wage employees were either young adults under the age of 21, or teenagers. <p>
According to a study by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in
Washington, D.C., raising the minimum wage emotionally appeals to most Americans, but doing it would be a mistake.<p>
According to the foundation study:<p>
<ul>
<li>Raising the minimum wage will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and
destroying entry-level job opportunities.
<li>Raising the minimum wage does not generally help low-income households -- the increased income from minimum wage jobs would mostly go to families far above the
poverty level, not to poor minimum wage workers.
<li>Employers will respond to a minimum wage increase by cutbacks in hiring, reducing
workers' hours, or lowering pay and benefits and skipping pay raises -- responses that
hurt, not help, workers.
<li>A $5.15 increase in the minimum wage will result in approximately 400,000 lost entry-level jobs.  A wage increase may result in more skilled workers being enticed into the job market, but fewer unskilled job opportunities (entry-level jobs) would be available.</ul><p>
Grant Maloy, a small business operator from Orlando, Fl., testified earlier in the year
before the Joint Economic Committee on the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage.  As the owner of a wholesale foliage nursery, Maloy stated that his industry pays $5.24 for entry-level work, well above the minimum wage.<p>
"Wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other
industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.  How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay?  The answer is they can't," says Maloy.<p>
According to Maloy, minimum wage policy is insincere.  While the government expects a
business owner to pay a minimum wage, the owner himself may be making much less.  Maloy estimated that he was making about $2.00 an hour when he started his business.<p>
Surveys of the American public continue to show widespread support for increasing the
minimum wage, and in 1989 Congress overwhelmingly backed the last minimum wage increase -- more than 90 percent voted in favor of the hike.<p>
Political experts agree that if a proposal to increase the minimum wage makes its way to the House or Senate floor for a vote, it may pass.  No member in Congress wants to be labeled as "anti-worker" despite the widespread research showing the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage on those it purportedly is supposed to help.<p>
On the other hand, the public's dissatisfaction with Washington and misguided
government attempts to solve every problem may indeed resonate with the minimum wage issue as well.<p>
More importantly however, is how the public will view the President's proposal.  Is the
President proposing to raise the minimum wage to truly help the working poor?  Or will the public perceive his proposal as a political ploy to gain votes in 1996.<p>
What remains certain though, is the growing universal belief that the minimum wage
