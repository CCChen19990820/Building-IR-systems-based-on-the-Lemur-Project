<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="1">Site Contents</A><BR>
</B>The INIS website was created and is maintained by the staff
of INIS. The content of the pages is comprised of existing INIS
documents that have been prepared for presentation on the World
Wide Web, as well as original editorial text for the sections
of the website that are not a part of existing documents.<BR>
<B><A NAME="2">Site Design</A><BR>
</B>The INIS website was programmed to be as easily navigated
as possible. The Section Bar and Tool Bar appear on every page
and designed to allow access to the key parts of the site at any
time.<BR>
The Tool Bar contains links to the following facilities:<BR>
- The INIS database<BR>
- A section for sending mail to INIS staff<BR>
- A facility for searching the IAEA and INIS websites<BR>
- The Guestbook, where you may leave questions about the website
or the organization in general.<BR>
- The Help section of the website.<BR>
The Section Bar provides direct links to the main sub-sections
of the site. To change to another section, simply click on the
desired section name.<BR>
The site's graphics have been designed to be useful in identifying
the sections of the site, as well as being economical in space.
Each of the sub-sections has its own graphic, with the name of
the section and its own color scheme. The electronic documents
on the website will appear in a 'ring-binder' format similar to
that used for printed documents; they also display the INIS Logo.
<BR>
Every attempt has been made to format pages for easy printing
directly from the screen. All pages should fit comfortably on
a A4 page. If you find pages that do not print properly, please
notify the webmaster.<BR>
<B><A NAME="3">Software Requirements</A><BR>
</B>The INIS website is best viewed using a graphical web browser.
Among the most popular are:<BR>
Netscape 2.0<BR>
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">
<IMG SRC="graphic/now8.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=88 HEIGHT=31 ALIGN=right></A><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">
<IMG SRC="graphic/ie_anim.gif" WIDTH=88 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right></A>
Netscape 2.1<BR>
Netscape 3.x<BR>
Mosaic 2.0<BR>
Microsoft Internet Explorer<BR>
If you do not have one of these, please use one of the links to
download the latest version of the browser you would like to use.
<BR>
<B><A NAME="4">Netscape tips</A><BR>
</B>If you are using Netscape, here are some tips for helping
you view this web site at its best.<BR>
- In the General Section, set the browser to show the menu bar
as text only. This will give you the maximum viewing area on your
screen.<BR>
- Under Fonts (also in the Options section), set the proportional
font as Times and the fixed font as Courier. Make both size 10.
<BR>
- In the Applications Section, be sure to set the browser to use
your local program for handling a Telnet session. If you do not
have a program that can handle a telnet session, e-mail us with
the details of your computer's configuration and we will try to
point you to one.<BR>
- Set the &quot;Cache&quot; option to at least 1 MB. This will
allow Netscape to save many of the images that are necessary for
each page and re-use them rather than repeatedly downloading.
<BR>
<B><A NAME="5">Troubleshooting</A><BR>
</B>Slow loading of pages.<BR>
Slow download times can be caused by a variety of circumstances.
To maximize download times, try the following<BR>
- Set your modem port for the fastest speed that it will accept
(usually 57,600 bps).<BR>
- If you are on a dial-up link, make sure that you are using the
fastest possible modem (currently the fastest available are 28,800
bps).<BR>
- The busiest times for the INIS web server are from 9:00 - 10:00
Central European Time and from 2:30 - 4:00 CET. Connecting to
the site at times other than during these periods should slightly
increase the performance.<BR>
<B><A NAME="6">Graphics</A><BR>
</B>The graphics that are a part of the INIS site have been designed
to be minimal in terms of area on screen and in actual file size.
If you are seeing the graphics as &quot;too large&quot;, try increasing
the resolution of your monitor. (See your user manual for instructions
on how to do this).<BR>
While the graphics are an integral part of the INIS site, it is
possible to view all information with graphics turned off in your
browser. This will minimize the size of the pages that have to
be downloaded, but the actual content will not be affected.<BR>
<B><A NAME="7">Unable to Access Pages</A><BR>
</B>Because of its popularity and general interest in the scientific
community, the INIS site will be visited by thousands of people
a day. This along with the increasing amount of traffic on the
Internet in general, may cause the server to answer slowly or
to refuse a connection if it is busy. If this happens, please
continue to attempt your connection. If you find that the server
is unreachable for an extended period, contact INIS via e-mail.
<BR>
<B><A NAME="8">Broken Links</A><BR>
</B>The INIS server is constantly updated and checked for link
integrity. If you find a broken link, please report it to INIS
via e-mail.<BR>
<B><A NAME="9">Helper Applications</A></B><A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/plugins/index.html">
<IMG SRC="graphic/now8.gif" WIDTH=88 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 HSPACE=200></A>
<BR>
In order to use all of the features that are available on the
INIS website, you will need the following Helper programs. To
download the programs, click on the corresponding link.<BR>
- For reading the pdf-files you will need <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com">Acrobat Reader</A>
to view and print these printer description files .<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com">
<IMG SRC="graphic/getacro.gif" ALT="getacro.gif - .776 K" WIDTH=88 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 align=right></A>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
- ZIP is a compression format for IBM compatible PC&#180;s. You
need a special <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">utility</A> program
to open these files. Also Macintosh users can <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">unzip</A>
these files.</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Accessible only to registered users. At present the retrieval
language used to search the INIS database available at the International
Atomic Energy Agency is STAIRS. STAIRS provides two types of operators
for searching; the first are the Boolean operators (and, or, not,
xor) and the second are positional operators (adj, near, syn,
with, not with, same, not same). How to combine terms by using
these operators is explained in the &quot;INIS: Manual for Online
Retrieval from the IAEA&quot; which you will receive once you become
registered.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Please note that you might need to get Authorization from your
national INIS <A HREF="../liaison/liaison.htm">Liaison Officer</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Billing Procedures: Billing is done once a year. Users may pay in their local currency, if
the IAEA maintains a bank account in their country.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For more information, including the Registration Form, please contact
<A HREF="mailto:flory@nepo1.iaea.or.at">Ms. Rosemary Flory</A> in the INIS Section.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The database (<B>test-inis</B>) is open to all users. It aims
to provide users with insight into the content and usefulness
of the INIS Database. It contains a few thousand recently added
records and uses PLWeb as a retrieval language.<BR>

<LI>In accordance with Rule 2 of the <A
HREF=http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/glance/policy/gcrules.html>
Rules of Procedure of the General Conference,</A> the Director
General hereby notifies all Members of the Agency that the 40th
regular session of the General Conference will open at the
Austria Center Vienna on Monday, 16 September 1996, at 10 a.m.
(The Austria Center Vienna is located at Am Hubertusdamm 6, 1220
Vienna, next to the Vienna International Centre.)
<P>       
<LI>During the weekend preceding the opening of the Conference's
session (Saturday, 14 September and Sunday, 15 September 1996),
facilities will be made available for group meetings. Member
States are strongly urged to avail themselves of those facilities
with a view to achieving early agreement on organizational
matters and thereby contributing to the smooth running of the
session, ensuring -- where necessary -- that their
representatives arrive in Vienna in time to participate in
pre-session group meetings and the associated group
decision-making. Meeting rooms may be reserved through the
Secretariat's Conference Service Section (tel. no.: + 43 1 2060
21323).
<P>         
<LI>Pursuant to Rule 11, the Director General has drawn up the
provisional agenda for the session in consultation with the Board
of Governors. In the annotation to each item a suggestion is
made, for consideration by the General Committee, as to where it
should first be discussed -- in plenary or in a committee.
<P>         
<LI> Should the Director General receive, by 17 August 1996, any
request under Rule 13 for inclusion of a supplementary item in
the agenda, such an item will, unless Rule 21 applies, be placed
on a list which will be circulated not later than 27 August 1996.

He noted that the 40th regular session of the General Conference marks a milestone for the Agency as it celebrates the 40th anniversary since the statute was approved in October 1956.  In reviewing the past year, he recalled that in November of last year the United Nations General Assembly adopted the resolution commending the IAEA for its nuclear verification efforts and welcoming the measures being taken to strengthen the Agency's safeguards system.  The General Assembly further affirmed its confidence in the role of the Agency in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  He underscored the important roles of nuclear energy in many fields and the Agency's work to enhance those roles while strengthening its verification of the atom's peaceful uses. He further noted that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has been overwhelmingly supported at the United Nations General Assembly last week, and expressed hope that with its adoption, further steps would be taken in order to have a meaningful relationship between the Agency and the Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO.  He concluded by mentioning several existing nuclear-weapons-free zone treaties in various regions of the world, which he said will likely contribute to a more peaceful and secure world.  He also noted the Convention on Nuclear Safety which is due to come into force next month and the work of the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage which is hopefully moving into its final phase.  Such international efforts should help allay the misgivings of the public at large and build up their confidence on the peaceful applications of nuclear energy, he said.

<P></A>
In taking the chair, he expressed his particular gratitude to the Member
States of the Far East Group for nominating a candidate from the Philippines, 
mentioning that this honour has been conferred twice before on delegates 
from his country.  He continued by thanking his predecessor for his work at 
the last GC, and hoped for the co-operation of all delegations in the work
ahead. He continued by referring to the year 1996 as the centenary of the discovery of
radioactivity by Henri Becquerel, and to the presently expanding applications
of nuclear science and technology in medicine, industry, agriculture and the
environment, particularly in his own country, and the benefit these applications have brought. He went on to emphasize the significance of public support for nuclear applications, as well as the necessity of public understanding of risks and benefits.  Here he stated that the IAEA's contribution towards creating a nuclear weapons free world was 	increasing public acceptance of nuclear energy. The IAEA safeguards system, as well as its interaction with the nuclear test ban treaty, were showing the world how work in nuclear fields can continue.  He further said that nuclear energy can be channeled to benefit society in a changing world: world food supplies, health, sustainable development - all of these are fields to which nuclear energy can contribute and where the IAEA can and should play an important role. He closed in hoping that nuclear energy will be used for peace and development, and will ultimately help to bring peace and prosperity to humanity.

<B><I>Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, United Nations Secretary General, statement by Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli, Director General, United Nations Office in Vienna:   </I></B>
<P>
</A>
He opened by emphasizing the importance of global peace and progress and how important a role the IAEA has to play in this process. He said that nuclear weapons control is imperative and expressed gratification towards the countries that are party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  He said that in order to create a nuclear-weapon-free world, credible IAEA verification as well as a  strong political will for world peace are extremely important. The establishment of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone and the Treaty of the South East Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone (signed in December 1995) are important steps towards achieving this goal. He said he looks forward to a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, and welcomed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He appealed to all States to support this treaty and enhanced measures towards nuclear disarmament. He also mentioned the Chernobyl accident (marking its tenth anniversary this year), which has made IAEA's role in advising Member States on nuclear safety issues extremely important. The Convention on Nuclear Safety which has been signed by 63 Member States, will enter into force on 24 October (the UN day) this year, he noted, and urged Member States who have not signed it to do so soon. He emphasized the importance of the Agency's technical co-operation activities to promote peaceful uses of atomic energy for developing countries in the areas of health and food production as well as search for fresh drinking water. Such activities are particularly important in many African countries. He said it is also important for the IAEA to focus on the use of energy for sustainable development, as well as identifying environmentally sound sources of energy. 
He concluded by acknowledging IAEA's co-operation with the UN, especially in implementing relevant solutions of the Security Council on Iraq and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The Minister began by predicting that nuclear power would continue to grow in importance in the coming century because of limited energy resources and growing environmental concerns.  Japan relies on nuclear plants for over 30 percent of its power supplies.  Since the leakage accident at the Monju reactor, the national nuclear policy has undergone serious public scrutiny which should lead to a new consensus. While the nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) was not 
adopted by the Conference on Disarmament, it was adopted by the UN General Assembly and represents an historic step toward disarmament.  The IAEA should assist the CTBT Organization in implementing the treaty. Japan maintains its Non-Nuclear Principles: step-by-step nuclear disamament; the banning of all nuclear testing  through CTBT; and support for the Cut-Off Treaty. The Agreed Framework between the United States and the DPRK represents a very positive development. The DPRK is urged to adhere to the agreement and fully implement IAEA safeguards. The Moscow Summit last April set the stage for a meeting in October that will examine options for disposing of nuclear materials from dismantled nuclear weapons.  Japan urges nuclear weapons States to place such material under IAEA safeguards.  Japan also supports further efforts to create an international framework for increasing transparency in managing plutonium.  Strengthening IAEA's system of safeguards is of utmost importance and the 93+2 Programme is designed to meet this need. Japan will contiunue to play an active role in the Committee discussions to expedite formulation of an agreement on these measures. The Minister welcomed the pending entry into force of  the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which will facilitate the safe use of nuclear power and hopes that more countries will ratify it. Japan will also help in formulation of a Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.  The Moscow Summit confirmed the main safety principles and the need for international cooperation in this field. Japan is now preparing for a Tokyo Conference on Nuclear Safety in Asia this November. Japan supports work toward the eventual harnessing of nuclear fusion through the Engineering Design Activities of the International Thermonuclear Reactor. Japan contributes both human and financial resources to both the Agency's Technical Co-operation Fund and the RCA Regional Programme, which has supported pioneering efforts at the regional level in the nuclear field. The IAEA plays an essential role in the field of nuclear power and in maintaining the non-proliferation regime, and Japan will continue to play an active role in its activities. 
<A NAME="russia">

He began by referring to the Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit, at which leaders of the eight developed countries met for the first time, and at which the significant role of nuclear power in the world today and in the future was reconfirmed.  Although research must continue on various energy options including alternative energy, nuclear was seen as the most promising way.  He went on to assign top priority to the development of safe nuclear reactors for the 21st century, followed by the importance of addressing problems pertaining to utilization and disposal of radioactive waste.  Here he made specific reference to  programmes on liquid and solid waste management adopted in his country.  Another nuclear safety concern is the improvement of existing nuclear regulatory regimes, which are the subject of intense work in Russia.  He was pleased to report international co-operation in the peaceful 
utilization of materials from nuclear weapons dismantling, and made specific reference to a unique technology developed by Russia for converting weapons-grade uranium into nuclear plant fuel; surveillance measures have been co-ordinated with the USA, thus ensuring the irreversibility of the disarmament process.  The problem of utilization of plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons must still be addressed; it will be discussed at the international level in Paris next year.  One major aspect of nuclear safety still to be confronted is the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and the threat of uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear technology.  He noted that Russia had taken vigorous steps and succeeded in concentrating on its own territory all nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union.  It is also a matter of priority to the Russian Federation that a storage facility for half the Russian weapons-grade plutonium stockpile, built in co-operation with the USA, is to be placed under IAEA safeguards.  He closed by expressing his support of the IAEA's priorities and activities towards establishing a detection system for clandestine nuclear activities (Programme 93+2), and reported with satisfaction that Russia has maintained its contributions to the IAEA Technical Co-operation Fund in spite of its own complicated economic situation.  Finally, he expressed his hope that the IAEA in its programmes would take account of the recommendations made by the Moscow Nuclear Safety Summit participants.

He predicted that the 21st century would place greater emphasis on social development.  More attention will be paid to the quality of life, and peaceful nuclear applications will have an important role.  The foundations for this new era have been established through the NPT extension and the Convention on Nuclear Safety. The world community is coming to recognize that nuclear energy has an important role to play in environmental protection, and that radioisotopes and radiation applications have a bright future in which all nations can share. Over one thousand organizations in Korea use radioisotopes, and soon 40% of these will be supplied domestically. Korea has 11 operating nuclear power reactors supplying 36% of power needs, and 5 more are being built. The Korean Standard Nuclear Plant is very safe and reliable, and the efforts are extending into small and medium-sized reactors for co-generation and desalination, he said. Korea has benefitted significantly from IAEA technical co-operation projects and it is now providing support to three IAEA projects related to nuclear power.  An International Nuclear Training Center is being set up to share expertise with Member States. Korea urges Member States to join the Convention on Nuclear Safety and it will support implementation of the waste management convention in order to achieve safe management worldwide. Korea is developing an On-line Radiation Monitoring System and other regional nuclear safety cooperation channels. Korea is extremely concerned with the continuing non-compliance of the DPRK with IAEA safeguards. The Agreed Framework represents significant progress, but equal efforts must be made by DPRK. The IAEA is urged to continue its efforts toward resolution of this complicated problem. Korea feels that the IAEA Board of Governors needs to be restructured to reflect changes in the world's nuclear community over the past two decade. The Open-ended Expert Groups's work is to be commended and encouraged. IAEA Safeguards need to be strengthened, especially in the area of detecting undeclared nuclear activities. Korea has made facilities available for environmental sampling. He concluded by expressing Korea's willingness to participate actively in planning IAEA's activities in the next century and to bear its responsibility to support the continued success of the Agency.

She welcomed the indefinite extension of the NPT, urging all states to accede to it.  EU support for all aspects of the work of the IAEA on the nuclear test ban was  expressed, as well as the expectation of the rapid establishment of the CTBT Office in Vienna in order to ensure close co-operation between it  and the IAEA.  She emphasized the necessity of supporting all aspects of the IAEA's work in the field of safeguards in its broadest sense: the rapid activation of the ad hoc committee mandated last year was called for in order to negotiate the so-called "Cut-Off Convention"; further, the Agency was commended for its work with the declaration of nuclear material given by the DPRK, although concern was expressed regarding the accuracy of the report, as the IAEA had had to confront many obstacles in the course of its work there as well.  The IAEA was further called on to be vigilant in its work in Iraq, and the delegate expressed her dismay at the difficulties placed in the path of the IAEA there.  She went on to  note with satisfaction the development of  nuclear weapon free zones: in Africa (Treaty of Pelindaba), South Pacific (Treaty of Rarotonga), Southeast Asia (Treaty of Bangkok), and expressed her hope that a similar zone might be created in the Middle East.  The EU strongly supports the safeguards Programme 93+2, noting the risk of detection as a deterrent to proliferators; and also advocates use of nuclear export control measures in order to prevent proliferation of weapons.  All exporting countries were called on to accept the guidelines in Articles I and II of the NPT.  The IAEA was urged to follow up on media reports of illicit trafficking, no matter how misinformed they may be.  All States were encouraged to become party to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and she commended the work done on management of civil plutonium.  The EU will continue its support of the Agency's Technical Co-operation activities.  The IAEA was congratulated for its work on co-operation in limiting effects of severe accidents, notably  the Chernobyl accident.  The EU will help implement the Action Plan for the Ukraine, and hopes that the Chernobyl installations can be closed by the year 2000.  Nuclear safety improvements in the Newly Independent States and in Central and Eastern Europe are of particular significance to the EU, and it continues to support activities in this area.  The IAEA was commended for its work towards a global nuclear safety culture, and the Convention on Nuclear Safety, as well as towards introducing a peer review procedure.  Safety in radioactive waste management, on which a draft convention is being established, and liability and compensation in event of an accident, are matters of concern to the EU, and it urges that a conference on safety improvements be convened in 1997.  The delegate concluded her remarks by commending the IAEA for fulfilling its task in a time of financial duress, and urged all Member States to pay their contributions promptly.

She shared the views of the European Union as put forward in her address given on behalf of the EU.  She was pleased to announce the deposit of Ireland's instrument of ratification of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and urged all States to become parties to it. She went on to discuss the safe management of radioactive waste, a convention on which is now being developed. In spite of excellent progress, no consensus is found on inclusion of spent fuel or management of military waste, and the delegate put forward several options for dealing with these problems.  She expressed the hope that the next experts meeting will be able to resolve these matters.  Making specific reference to the Sellafield, UK, reprocessing plant, she expressed the problems with which Ireland is being confronted, and urged close examination by the IAEA of the entire question of reprocessing and nuclear waste management. The many ageing nuclear reactors in Newly Independent States and Central and Eastern Europe are a further cause of concern, and she encouraged  development of an international regime on liability and compensation for damage to health and environment in the event of a nuclear accident,  She closed by urging revision of the present Vienna Convention on civil liability, stating that a nuclear liability regime would find acceptance from nuclear and non-nuclear countries.

<B><I>Pakistan, Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, Chairman, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission :</I></B>
<P></A>
Mr. Ahmad opened by welcoming the Republic of Moldova as a member of the Agency. The delegate continued by regretting that the Conference on Disarmament was unable to forward a consensus text of the test ban treaty (CTBT) to the UN and supported the objectives of the treaty "which can only be realized if it wins the adherence of all nuclear capable countries". He called upon the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in South Asia and encouraged the progress achieved towards the creation of such zones throughout the world. He praised the safeguards system of the IAEA but stated that there is room for improvement and welcomed the "Programme 93 +2" as a step in this direction. In his view, the suggestions to extend the programme to countries not having full-scope safeguards are contrary to the spirit of the programme. In his view, the most significant contribution that nuclear technology can make to global peace and development is to enhance the security of energy supply for fuel deficient developing countries. He regrets that only a very small fraction of nuclear power is produced in the Third World, where sustainable energy supply systems are needed urgently. Mr. Ahmad stressed the importance of promoting a fair and accurate public perception of the benefits of the peaceful exploitation of nuclear energy. Concerning nuclear safety, he welcomed the international Convention on Nuclear Safety, soon entering into force, which Pakistan will ratify as soon as requisite national legislative and administrative procedures are completed. Regarding the technical co-operation programme, he expressed appreciation for those countries which pledge extrabudgetary contributions and pledged, at the same time, Pakistan's full target contribution for 1997. He finished by naming Pakistan's main activities related to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy such as the construction work on the Chashma Nuclear Power Project, The Karachi's plant's 25 years of safe operation, and the development of three new varieties of wheat, rice and cotton through mutation breeding. He added that his country has extended cancer diagnostic and treatment services throughout the country, treating about 240,000 patients treated every year. 
<A NAME="iran"><P>
<B><I>Islamic Republic of Iran, Dr Reza Amrollahi, Vice President of the Iranian Republic of Iran:</I></B>
<P></A>
He began by reminding the General Conference that potential for danger from nuclear weapons still exists in spite of the end of the Cold War and other positive developments.  He applauded the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, yet expressed concern that nuclear and non-nuclear "camps" develop if nuclear weapon States refuse to proceed towards annihilation of their arsenals.  He referred to the responsibility of nuclear weapon States to create an atmosphere of confidence, and asked how this should be realized when a given geographic area faced an immediate nuclear threat, as in this case the Middle East.  The delegate requested  specific classification of nuclear weapons material vis-a-vis nuclear materials for peaceful use in his call for finalization of the agreement banning production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons, and went on to reconfirm Iran's support of the implementation of the NPT in the Middle East.  He praised the will of Arab and Muslim countries to create a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East, which was  stressed at the Conference of the Arab Heads of State in Cairo.    He emphasized the role of the IAEA as the body responsible for promoting implementation of safeguards regulations. The Islamic Republic of Iran, although endowed with great fossil fuel resources and willing to support research in alternative energy forms, has made substantial investments in nuclear energy as a source of electricity, and anticipates the start of operations of Bushehr nuclear power plant, he said. He was pleased to note the benefits of the IAEA Technical Co-operation programmes to the progress of nuclear industry in Iran.  In closing, he reiterated the necessity of combatting illegal transfer of fissile materials, calling for implementation of preventive measures while drawing attention to the fact that many reports by the media may be politically motivated.  He expressed hope that such fiction not interfere with the promotion of peaceful applications of nuclear energy and legal activities in this respect.  He closed by repeating his support of the IAEA and pledging full support for its work.
<A NAME="china">
<P>
<B><I>China, Mr. Jiang Xinxiong, Chairman, China Atomic Energy Authority:</I></B>
<P></A>
He noted that the IAEA is approaching its 40th anniversary and that Confucius observed that "at 40, one begins to understand the world." For the Agency this should mean that a balance has to be struck between the peaceful use of nuclear energy and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through safeguards. China will need to rely more on nuclear power for its future energy supplies, and is currently constructing 4 additional nuclear power stations. By 2010, China's nuclear capacity should reach 20,000 megawatts. China is cooperating with about 20 countries in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and has technical cooperation and trading relationships with more than 40 countries and regions. China and France are working together on the Ling'ao power project. Canada is helping China with the power station in Quinshan.  Bilateral cooperation with Russia is under active preparation. The IAEA has provided sizeable assistance to China in power development, safety and training. China has utilized nuclear technologies in numerous fields and activities including agriculture, medicine, and industry and has learned advanced techniques thanks to the IAEA. Most significantly, IAEA's Model Project concept is now stressing benefits for end-users. By establishing the country programme framework and thematic programming, the TC Department is strengthening project management and improving efficiency and effectiveness. There remains a serious imbalance between the Agency's strengthening of safeguards and the resources available for promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  The Agency's decision-making body needs to provide more substantial support to technical co-operation. China has actively participated in discussions to strengthen the safeguards system. In these efforts, special care must be taken to ensure that the sovereignty of countries is respected. China feels strongly that the Agency should make use of and refine its own system of information collection and analysis rather than relying on the technical means of individual countries. China strongly opposes nuclear proliferation and will never help countries to develop nuclear weapons. It provides no assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. China has played a leading role in the Nuclear Safety Convention and likewise will serve in the development of the convention on safe management of nuclear waste. China's view is that the convention should be restricted to civil waste. Progress has been made on the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability and in the draft for supplementary funding but some matters of principle remain to be solved.  Provisions need to be developed so that victims in any nuclear accident are adequately compensated.  
<A NAME="lebanon">
<P>
<B><I>Lebanon, Mr. Samir Hobeica, Ambassador to Austria:</I></B>
<P></A>
He recognized the increasing importance of the Agency's role in today's world and said that since Lebanon became a member of the IAEA in 1961, it has placed complete confidence in its activities. He said that past circumstances had compelled Lebanon to refrain from complying with the several agreements of the Agency. Today, however, his country wants to correct this and make sure that it follows the requirements of the IAEA, especially in case of a nuclear accident (including early warning and emergency assistance). He further cited the example of the Nuclear-Weapons-Free-Zone in Africa and said that Lebanon looks forward to the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East. This is important for lasting peace in the region. He said that the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is the first step towards this goal, and he urged countries to do so and to comply with associated safeguards requirements.  He also spoke of several symposia held by Lebanon on the handling of radioactive wastes and encouraged the IAEA's efforts on such issues. He said that the increase in Agency resources in these fields is evidence of its active and wise policies.
<A NAME="syria">
<P>
<B><I>Syrian Arab Republic, Mr Ibrahim Othman, Director General of Atomic Energy Commission, Syrian Arab Republic:</I></B>
<P></A>
He commended the IAEA for its efforts towards the utilization of nuclear knowledge for peaceful purposes, emphasizing the necessity of protecting non-nuclear weapon States from military use of that knowledge, and went on to stress the importance of co-operation in developing countries towards their national objectives and sustainable development.  He further commended the increased efficiency and economy measures of the IAEA, going on to express his support of the Agency's work, particularly within the structure of the NPT Conference.  The delegate spoke highly of the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free-zone in Africa, drawing attention to other steps to be taken to ensure the safety of countries located in proximity to the zone. He then made reference to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, stating that it should not ignore the legitimate demands of non nuclear weapon States, as the text does not refer to the necessity of nuclear weapon States to dismantle their arsenals within a specific time frame.  He called for work to be done on the so-designated "loopholes" of the Test Ban Treaty.  The delegate feared the region would remain a hotbed of trouble and a threat to world peace if this is not done.  He found that the  imposition of stringent regulations on non-nuclear weapon States party to the  Test Ban Treaty would create an imbalance and might block the progress of nuclear technology, research and development.  He referred to amending Article 6 of the IAEA Statute, calling it a political article which should be taken care of with regard to the Middle Eastern Group.  Syria has availed itself of IAEA technology and is making good progress with several programmes; an INIS seminar will be held in Damascus before the end of 1996.  In closing, he expressed his hope that decisions taken by the General Conference would be just and unbiased, and would help protect the peoples of the world from the threat of nuclear weapons.  
<A NAME="philippines">
<P>
<B><I>Philippines, Mr. Jose A. Zaide Jr., Ambassador to Austria:</I></B>
<P></A>
He opened by mentioning the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and that his country is ready to sign it. He urged the nuclear weapon States in Southeast Asia as well as Africa to join the Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, and expressed hopes of such zones being established in other regions of the world. He said that the Philippines would like to work towards advancing peaceful use of nuclear energy, as well as strengthening international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety issues. He expressed his satisfaction over the measures taken by the IAEA against illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and other radioactive sources. He noted that in 1995, the Agency reported that nuclear material placed under safeguards was not used for military purposes, nor was other safeguarded equipment or non-nuclear material misused. However, he expressed regret over the fact that the Agency was unable to verify the authenticity of the initial declaration of nuclear material made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and urged DPRK to co-operate with the Agency in implementing the safeguards agreement. He welcomed the Agency's efforts to promote peaceful use of atomic energy to enhance the quality of life of all humans, and stressed the need for the Agency to co-operate with countries in which the nuclear infrastructure has not reached high levels. He thanked the Agency for its valuable technical assistance to the Philippines and listed the various projects his country co-hosted with the IAEA in celebration of the centennial of the discovery of the radioactivity. The Philippines Nuclear Congress will take place on December 10-12 this year to assess public response at home and abroad on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. He also listed additional areas in which his country was interested in co-operating with international organizations, especially the IAEA. These included increasing awareness of the peaceful use of nuclear energy;  benefitting from the US policy of accepting and managing foreign research reactor spent fuel; conducting research on application of nuclear techniques in detecting and eliminating the "red-tide" phenomenon which poisons marine products, endangering  millions of lives; and continuing Agency support in food irradiation in the ASEAN region. He acknowledged the generous assistance of Malaysia and Indonesia to the victims of the March 1996 tragic fire in Metro Manila. He mentioned the Philippines growing concern for the promotion of nuclear safety in Asia and suggested that a regional agreement such as ASIATOM promote co-operation on nuclear power issues, especially radioactive wastes. 
<A NAME="nigeria">
<P>
<B><I>Nigeria, Mr. Karibu Sulaiman Chafe, Minister for Petroleum Resources:</I></B>
<P></A>
He made special note of Agency efforts to strengthen technical co-operation activities, in particular through the the creation of the Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Co-operation (SAGTAC), which is elaborating a strategic plan for the Department. He also noted improvements in management of radiation safety in Member States. Nigeria supports the strengthening of Safeguards through 93+2, but new measures must strike a balance between Agency information needs and a State's need to protect its interests. Nigeria is currently considering the ratification of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and commends the progress made on the Convention on Waste Management. The signing ceremony for the Pelindada Treaty took place in April 1996 in Cairo.  Additionally, there are already fifty-one Member States of OAU which have become parties to the NPT. The nuclear weapons States that signed the Pelindaba Protocol are to be commended. Nigeria will assume the chairmanship of the AFRA regional programme at the close of the Conference and recently hosted the seventh Technical Working Group Meeting. AFRA programmes face a budgetary shortfall of $1.5 million, and Member States are urged to support these critical efforts in areas of radiation protection, human health, and other fields. Nigeria is pleased to note that almost $1.8 million in IAEA extrabudgetary contributions are being committed to the problem of illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. The under-representation of both the African and Middle East/South Asian regions on the Agency Board remains a pressing problem. The Director General's efforts to raise the representation of women and developing country representatives in the Secretariat are to be commended. Nigeria is grateful to the IAEA and China for recently supplying a miniature neutron source reactor.  It is also pleased to pledge $78,200 as its assessed contribution to the technical co-operation fund for 1997.   
<A NAME="ecuador">
<P>
<B><I>Ecuador, Mr. Cesar Villacis, Head of the Ecuadorian Delegation:</I></B>
<P></A>
Mr. Villacis opened by enumerating the many areas in which nuclear technology is applied in Ecuador on a daily basis: treatment of  illnesses, medical diagnosis, sterilization of products, agricultural and  environmental research, among other areas.  He thanked the donor countries which have made this possible. Ecuador, he added, needs to utilize its hydrological resources in a more sensible and efficient manner, and for this, it welcomes the efforts of the IAEA to produce drinking water in an economic manner. Thanks to the Agency, the Atomic Energy Commission of Ecuador has signed agreements with both the educational and industrial sectors to achieve a sustained and harmonious development. In this context, the Technical University of Machala is working on the creation of a Banana Research Institute for  the optimal performance of fertilizers and the protection of the environment. Ecuador shows its support to ARCAL activities both at the subregional and regional levels which foster co-operation in applications of nuclear energy.  The delegate welcomed the approval by the UN General Assembly of the CTBT, and called upon other Member States to make an effort to ratify it, so that it can soon enter into force for the benefit of the international community. He went on to praise the countries which signed safeguards agreements with the Agency. In this context,  he praised Chile's recent signature and looks forward to the culmination of a similar agreement by the Czech Republic. Mr. Villacis closed by thanking the Agency for letting his mission be part of the Internet access pilot plan and commended the excellent service rendered during its duration, in which it was possible to access the Agency's extensive databases.

<P>
<B><I>United States, Ms. Hazel R. Leary, Secretary US Department of Energy:</I></B>
<P></A>
A message from the US President was read: For almost forty years, the IAEA has played a critical role in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The IAEA must remain prepared for new challenges and we must strengthen the Agency's capabilities to carry out its mandate and provide it with the necessary authority and resources to combat proliferation and detect undeclared activities. By diminishing the proliferation threat, IAEA is helping to expand global collaboration in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology in medicine, agriculture, energy and many other areas. Continuing success will require close cooperation among IAEA Members during its 40th aniversary and beyond. Ms. O'Leary gave a brief US progress report. As the US President said in his 1996 State of the Union address, the most important challenge for Americans is finishing the unfinished business of the Cold War. There are three pillars of progress for US-IAEA cooperation: nuclear safety; nuclear security; and nuclear cooperation. Some examples were given of projects now ongoing in nuclear cooperation. The US is helping combat infant hypo-thyroidism in Tunisia using isotopic techniques. Isotopes are being used to treat water to make it safe and potable.  Training is helping to build capacity of women and other citizens in developing countries to participate fully in economic and social development. A woman doctor from Ghana is now in the US getting a degree in oncology thanks to the US, the IAEA and Howard University.  US collaboration with other countries in the nuclear field now extends to more than 30 countries.  Energy demand and demand for nuclear power is going to grow in the next century. But nuclear power will only expand if it is both safe and economic. And society must be comfortable with working with nuclear energy. A new report issued by the US government revealed the detailed history of US nuclear testing. A similar report was recently issued by the Russian authorities revealing a new openness concerning the nuclear past. She gave thanks to Australia for taking the lead in development of the test ban treaty and noted that India was the first country to put forward the concept of a test ban.  The USA urges the signing of this important document by all the world's nations. The US recently declared some fissile material to be excess, and the first thing it did was contact the IAEA to get it under safeguards. Tomorrow, the US, Russia and the Agency will meet to conclude new agreements to extend these safeguard activities in both countries. She further announced that the US has completed a plan for safeguarding 200 tons of excess fissile material.  An additional 20 tons will be offered over the next three years. It is now tackling the question of disposition of plutonium through three technological options. Key decisions on the choice of technologies will be made this year.  The US is also taking back high-enriched from Columbia and Germany as it was committed to doing. The Moscow Summit focussed attention on the security of material. In the DPRK, the US and IAEA have been working together to can the spent nuclear fuel under Agency Safeguards -- nearly 40 percent of the spent fuel is now so protected.      
<A NAME="bulgaria">
<P>
<B><I>Republic of Bulgaria, Mr Roumen Ovtcharov, Minister of Energy and Energy Resources:</I></B>
<P></A>
He welcomed the indefinite extension of the NPT, emphasizing the singularly important role played by the IAEA in safeguards implementation and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, a role which will promote confidence among States and strengthen security.  He made specific reference to the strengthening of the Agency safeguards system through its 93+2 Programme, and applauded the IAEA's continuing efforts to strengthen effectiveness and improve efficiency of its safeguards regime.   The delegate emphasized the high priority of safe operation of nuclear facilities, referring to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and expressing his reservations regarding the liability amounts under discussion at present.  He was pleased to announce at Bulgaria would make a voluntary contribution to the technical co-operation Fund in equivalent of US $10,000, as an expression of its support of the 1997 Agency Programme.  The delegate reiterated his country's commitment to nuclear energy, noting that 46.4% of total energy generation was of nuclear origin, and that there was no viable alternative to nuclear power as a source of electricity generation.  He went on to say that Bulgaria was undertaking all necessary steps for safe operation of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, including international studies by scientific institutes in the Russian Federation and the USA.  Safe operation remains paramount, together with the development of nuclear techniques in medicine, agriculture and industry. He expressed his gratitude to the Department of Technical Co-operation for its assistance, and mentioned the Belene plant as a pilot site for further IAEA TC activities, noting that advanced technologies for flue gases purification in thermal power plants were of particular interest to Bulgaria and hoping that the IAEA progrmme would support the proposed projects on this and other topics.  Bulgaria will host several IAEA workshops and seminars, and participates actively in other IAEA activities.  
<A NAME="india">
<P>
<B><I>India, Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission :</I></B>
<P></A>
He opened by conveying his country's pledge to pay its share to the Technical Co-operation Fund for 1997.  He praised the Agency for evolving over the past 40 years into the most scientific organization in the UN system, and for setting up various programmes in the area of nuclear applications and technical co-operation. However, the Agency still had a lot to do for sustainable development in developing countries and promote application of nuclear techniques in the fields of fresh water, food, health and environment. He said that India, whose nuclear programme is almost 50 years old, has always been committed to using nuclear power for peaceful purposes.  This year India celebrated four years of the operation of  the nuclear research reactor Apsara used for isotope production and other applications. He quoted the Indian Prime Minister's goal of an energy capacity of 20,000 MWe by the year 2020. He listed several programmes of India in the area of sustainable nuclear energy development, spent fuel processing, radiation mutation breeding, irradiation of food and nuclear medicine. India supports the Regional Co-operation Agreement (RCA) in promoting co-operation in the application of nuclear techniques in medicine, agriculture and basic sciences. He mentioned the Agency's 93+2 programme and expressed India's concern on the financial implications of the programme. He said that an over-emphasis on the policing role of the IAEA is creating an imbalance in the attention and resources devoted to Agency's other activities. He recommended that the Agency sets new goals, consolidate present positions and assess likely costs before going ahead with the programme. However, India was ready to go by the consensus on this issue. India has been extremely interested and has actively participated in the development and drafting of the Convention on Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. However, India's nuclear power programme is based on a closed fuel cycle and therefore it could not consider inclusion of spent fuel in a Convention on Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. For India "spent fuel" is a resource not a "waste". He said that most of the environmental degradation and other impact witnessed on a global scale have resulted due to radioactive waste from military activities and the Convention on Safety of Radioactive Waste Management cannot afford to be silent on such wastes. He said that India is committed to the goal of global nuclear disarmament and will continue to support the Agency's efforts in expanding the peaceful use of atomic energy. 	
<A NAME="morocco">
<P>
<B><I>Morocco, Mr. Abderrahin Benmoussa, Ambassador to Austria:</I></B>
<P></A>
Mr. Benmoussa devoted most of his remarks to underlining the importance of the amendment of Article VI which deals with the composition of the Board of Governors and justified the urgency of decision. He said that otherwise enlarging the Board will not happen soon, and that another generation of diplomats will witness the realization of a more democratic, representative, and efficient Board of Governors. Morocco has decided to offer its experience and determination to the service of the international community to try to resolve this problems which have often been presented as impossible. He continued by saying that the Moroccan proposal is the only one that insists on the need to respect the rights acquired by the States and the regional groups, that promises permanent representation to the developing countries and that clears the confusion posed by the floating seats. The delegate closed by calling upon all regional groups to take advantage of this unique opportunity, at the same time he called on each of the Member States to support the Moroccan proposal.
<A NAME="ukraine">
<P>
<B><I>Ukraine, Mr.Yuriy I. Kostenko, Minister of Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety of Ukraine, Head of the Ukraine Delegation.  </I></B>
<P></A>
He opened by mentioning that this year Ukraine celebrated the fifth anniversary of its independence and that his country was gradually heading for obtaining non-nuclear status. Ukraine strongly supports global disarmament and as required by the NPT, has completed the withdrawal of all nuclear weapons from its territory which it had inherited from the former USSR. He said that the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe into a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone will help to avoid the expansion of NATO towards the East. He said that Ukraine had already signed the NPT and its government is in the process of ratifying it. He said he was grateful to the Agency for organizing the conference "A Decade after Chernobyl".  He observed that coping with the problems of the Chernobyl accident has become an international concern. He said that the safety problems of nuclear plants could not be settled in a short time, and that important changes in legislation, economy, management as well as in the development of nuclear regulatory regimes were required. The President and the Government of Ukraine have decided to decommission the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant by the year 2000 with relevant financial and technical support. Ukraine thinks that for objective analysis and resolution of the various problems associated with the Chernobyl accident of 1986, an International Research Centre should be established to deal with the elimination of nuclear radiation accident consequences. He thanked the US and other countries for their support towards the establishment of such a centre. He said that Ukraine fully supports the convention on radioactive waste management and was satisfied by the co-operation of the IAEA with Ukraine in this area. He regretted that his country was unable to pay all of its share to the Agency's budget due to economical problems and noted that this year Ukraine had paid the IAEA $4.9 million, covering the its debts for 1993, 1994 and partially for 1995.  He supported the 1995 Annual report and expressed appreciation for the Agency's activities in promoting peaceful use of nuclear energy.  
<A NAME="uk">
<P>
<B><I>United Kingdom, Dr. John Meadway, Under-Secretary, Director, Export control and Non-Proliferation Directorate:</I></B>
<P></A>
The UK nuclear industry has undergone a successful privatization this past summer.  Nuclear power contributes 24 percent of the national energy supply. The NPT, together with the Agency's Safeguards system, constitute the world's primary assurance against the spread of nuclear weapons. The UK has taken an active part in discussions on the 93+2 Part II measures to strengthen safeguards.  Effective safeguards are a very high priority and they were a major factor in determining UK support for the Secretariat budget proposals. UK has played an important role in further development of Nuclear Weapons Free Zones through its signature of protocols to three treaties establishing such zones. The Moscow Nuclear Summit led to progress in safety, liability, waste management and security of nuclear materials.  It also gave backing to the Nuclear Safety Convention. Waste management issues are high on the UK's agenda, with one key objective to develop a repository for high level waste. He noted that progress has also been made toward an International Convention for the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. The UK applauds the progress of the Agency and the leadership of the Director General in addressing the new challenges laid down by the NPT Conference, and it will continue to work constructively with the Agency and other Member States to maintain this momentum.  
<A NAME="yemen">
<P>
<b><I>Republic of Yemen, Mr Mohsin Al-Akwa, Minister of Energy and Water: </I></B>
<P></A>
He welcomed the Republic of Moldova as a Member State of the IAEA, and referred to the significance of the General Conference, not only due to its subject matter, but also due to recent political upheavals constituting a threat to world peace.  He went on to discuss the responsibility of the IAEA to work for peace and co-operation, particularly within the structure of the CTBT, calling for unbiased implementation of safeguards to guarantee non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  He deplored the "double standard" used in dealing with some countries, which causes tension and deepens hatred and bitterness.  The delegate noted with pride how successfully Yemen had been able to resolve conflicts by peaceful efforts, thus avoiding military confrontation.  He discussed the great potential of nuclear energy to bring health and prosperity to the world, referring to electricity generation, desalination projects, new technologies, and urged the IAEA to respond to the expectations of its new members by helping them technically.  In this context, he spoke in favour of enlarging the Board of Governors to make it more representative without weakening its authority.  Yemen supports the Agency in building small- and medium-sized reactors for peaceful needs in developing countries, as well as in conducting economic feasibility studies and other programmes to benefit these countries with their growing populations.  He expressed full support of Agency efforts in fighting illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, and stated that Yemen hopes to maintain its level of co-operation with the Agency in the future.  In closing, he noted that Yemen stands ready to fulfil its obligations to the IAEA, and wished the General Conference every success in its work.  
<A NAME="vietnam">
<P>
<B><I>Viet Nam, Mr. Chu Hao,Vice-Minister, Ministry Science,Technology &Environment:</I></B>
<P></A>
Mr. Chu Hao opened by welcoming Moldova as a new member of the Agency. He continued by welcoming the Nuclear Safety Convention which will enter into force next October, and the indefinite extension of NPT. The delegate reaffirmed his country's support for complete nuclear disarmament and called upon all Member States to fully support the treaty.  He said that considering that energy demand is rapidly growing in Viet Nam, nuclear power can be a highly feasible option. Mr. Chu Hao said that Viet Nam's industrial sector  has benefitted from the Agency's Department of Technical Co-operation. He noted support for projectsusing radiation technology, especially for sterilization, using Co-60 sources and electron beam, NDT techniques, tracer technology for hydrology, sedimentology, etc. He closed by mentioning the achievements in the area of agriculture, such as radiation processing for food preservation, mutation breeding, labeled isotopes for soil-plant studies and N-15 techniques for nitrogen fixation studies. Medical applications have also developed strongly: a number of radiation sources for treatment and various machines for imaging have been used in many hospitals.
<A NAME="thailand">
<P>
<B><I>Thailand, Mr. Chuchai Kasemsarn, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
<P></A>
He opened by emphasizing the importance of IAEA Technical Co-operation Programme for his country, especially in the fields of medicine, food and agriculture, industry and environment. He said that consumption of irradiated food and fruits has increased in Thailand and thanked the Agency for its efforts in strengthening irradiation technology in food and agriculture commodities. However, he was not satisfied with IAEA's progress on the financing of safeguards. He urged the Agency to give equal importance to the technical co-operation programme  as compared to safeguards.  He said that Thailand supports the Part I of the 93+2 Programme to improve the Agency's capability in detecting clandestine nuclear activities; however, the Agency has no legal mandate on the basis of  present safeguards agreements with regard to Part II, and such measures should be cost effective and respect the sovereignty of Member States. He recognized the trend to tighten the budget in most international organizations and agencies, and applauded the Agency's efforts to maintain zero real growth in budget. He also urged all Member States to make complete timely payments to the Agency. He welcomed the various treaties signed in the past to promote Nuclear Weapon Free Zones. He said that the ASEAN countries are working towards expediting the process of ratification of the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty. He urged the nuclear-weapon States to co-operate and accede to the Protocol of the Treaty.  He reaffirmed his country's support of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and said that the Agency is well-equipped to provide technical and human resources for verification tasks under the Treaty. 
<A NAME="belgium">
<P>
<B><I>Belgium, Ms. Mireille Claeys, Minister of Foreign Affairs:</I></B>
<P></A>
Fully supporting the position put forward by the Head of Delegation of
the Republic of Ireland who spoke on behalf of the EU, she stated that Belgium had been on the Board of Governors for one year and that the time had come for discussion on amendment of Article VI.  The delegate was pleased to present a compromise involving limited increase in size of the Board.  She put forward new, expanded criteria for the definition of a significant programme as stipulated in Article VI.  The delegate expressed Belgium's full and enthusiastic support of the 93+2 Programme, reflecting briefly on the need to continue improving the system by including environmental sampling and defining different categories of plutonium.  She went on to state that the 93+2 Programme should complement the present IAEA safeguards system, not replace it.  Speaking on technical co-operation programmes, the delegate reported the success of the tsetse fly eradication project on Zanzibar, which her country supports financially; she went on to mention projects on the sterile insect technique on the African mainland and the development of new agricultural phenotypes through bio- and mutation technology.  She also made reference to Belgium's extrabudgetary contributions to Agency programmes on reactor safety in Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe.  55% of Belgium's electricity was generated by its 7 nuclear plants in 1995, and that percentage will increase when two more reactor blocks open in the near future.  Belgium produces quantities of nuclear fuel - both MOx and UO2, and endorses fully the recommendations of the European Summit (Essen, Germany, 1994) on inspection of fission products from dismantling of nuclear installations; she went on to state that particular attention should be given to the recycling of plutonium to MOx.  The problem of irradiated fuel storage is the subject of intense consideration in Belgium, and several options are being discussed, on which a report will appear by the end of 1997.  In the field of R&D, one research reactor is being renovated and will resume operation in 1997, and several other research projects are proceeding successfully.  The delegate was pleased to refer to Belgium's significant nuclear industry potential and to reconfirm her support of the IAEA's objectives and functions.  
<A NAME="opanal">
<P>
<B><I>OPANAL, Mr. Enrique Romn-Morey, Head of OPANAL, the Organization for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean:</I></B>
<P></A>
Mr. Rom&aacute;n-Morey opened by recalling the painful way in which 50 years ago the world discovered nuclear energy: Hiroshima. Today, on the other hand, we know that this form of energy can offer many possibilities when there is will and resolution to use it peacefully. He said that the Tlatelolco Treaty was the first non-proliferation treaty in the world, and its goals are to proscribe and prohibit nuclear weapons in the zone where the treaty is applied. Tlatelolco, he continued, was created thanks to the political will of the Parties in Latin America and the Caribbean and 30 years have gone by since its inception. The delegate explained that it has not been easy: three decades of intense negotiations, hard work and long waiting, but always within the transparency and good political will of its Parties. Today, Tlatelolco has reached its universality due to the signature of amendments in 1995 of the last State.  Now, he added, the treaty has been signed by 33 countries of the region, in other words, absolutely all the States in Latin America and the Caribbean, thus becoming the first nuclear-free area in the world in a heavily populated region. This example has been followed by the treaties of Rarotonga in the South Pacific, Bangkok in Southeast Asia and Pelindaba in Africa. He closed by welcoming CTBT and saying that the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have been firm on the positions they put forward through the Tlatelolco Treaty. Twenty-five countries in the region co-sponsored the CTBT resolution and absolutely all the Tlatelolco Member States voted for it thus showing that this region is consistent in its way of thinking and acting concerning nuclear disarmament.
<A NAME="tuiwe">
<P>
<B><I>TUIWE, Mr Eugeniusz Mielnicki, Secretary General of the Trade Unions International of Workers in Energy, (TUIWE):</I></B>
<P></A>
He emphasized the great interest of the TUIWE in peaceful applications of nuclear energy, particularly with regard to safety and working conditions in nuclear installations, and commended the Agency for its role in working towards non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  He went on to speak of the fears still evoked by nuclear energy in the world today, referring specifically to the possibility of nuclear plant accidents in the Newly Independent States and Eastern Europe.  On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident he was troubled to note that commercial reactors were being commissioned in Bulgaria and the Ukraine without sufficient advance testing.  He applauded, however, the intention of the Ukraine to close down Chernobyl by the year 2000.  He further requested the Agency to pay particular attention to the problem of nuclear waste and reminded the assembly of its commitment to safety of future generations, calling for the establishment of an international convention on waste repositories and safety, a task no less important than that of ensuring non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  He expressed his appreciation for the collaboration of the Agency with TUIWE, and made specific mention of nuclear-relevant TUIWE seminars held in the Russian Federation, Bulgaria,  and also referred to an international project established with the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO).  He closed by inviting the IAEA to support TUIWE with its participation and financially, and wishing the GC success in its work.

<A NAME="safrica">
<P>
<B><I> South Africa, Mr. Abdul S. Minty, Deputy Director General, Multilateral Affairs, Department of Foreign Affairs.</I></B>
<P></A>
He commended the support of States for the denuclearization of Africa through the Pelindaba Treaty and noted that four of the five nuclear-weapon States already had signed the Treaty's protocol thereby registering their commitments.  He said that South Africa is in the process of ratifying the Treaty.  His country further welcomed  progress towards nuclear disarmament and the recent adoption of the test ban treaty, which South Africa stands ready to sign at the earliest opportunity. Two technical facllities in South Africa will be participating in the worldwide monitoring of compliance with the Treaty, he said. On the matter of nuclear safeguards, he said his country supports efforts to strengthen the system and is actively participating in discussions. He underscored that South Africa considers technical co-operation to be as important as safeguards, and he stressed the need to find a broader base of funding for technical assistance activities. He noted his country's leadership role in this area, and its active participation in the AFRA regional agreement, referring to activities in areas of training and provision of experts. His country also looks forward to establishing a post-graduate training course on radiation protection with the assistance of the IAEA. Regarding nuclear safety, he welcomed the pending entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the work towards finalizing a convention on radioactive waste management. He said South Africa has recently embarked on a process to establish a national radioactive waste management policy, the draft of which should be formulated by year's end.
<A NAME="france">
<P>
<B><I>France, Mr Yannick d'Escatha, Administrator General of the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA):</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He expressed strong commitment to IAEA safeguards, and encouraged support of the safeguards strengthening programme, urging  Member States to give the Agency the authority it needs to improve its intelligence and investigation capabilities, and referring to France's readiness to take steps towards preventing proliferation beyond its borders. He applauded the conclusion of the CTBT, which France will sign soon, mentioning that  France had concluded its final nuclear testing series and was dismantling the test facilities. He thanked the Agency for sending a scientific mission to verify the minimal impact this test series has had on the environment.  He was pleased to note that France has signed both the Rarotonga and the Pelindaba Treaties, and that it has terminated production of weapons-grade plutonium and highly-enriched uranium. He welcomed the conclusions on fissile material controls and accountability and prevention of illegal trafficking in such materials adopted at the Moscow Summit, and was pleased to note that Ukrainian authorities had announced that the Chernobyl plant would be closed down before 2000. France is convinced that nuclear power is the only option for world energy demand, particularly with regard to population growth in developing countries. He went on to state that the confidence of the public must be won through transparency and safety, an area in which the Agency plays an essential part. France, having been active in the drafting of the International Convention on Nuclear Safety, noted that its implementation is now possible. This should, however, be followed by a convention on the safe management of radioactive waste, a goal which is not beyond reach. The accession of the Russian Federation to the Vienna Convention was noted with satisfaction, and he went on to praise the Agency for its commitment to technical assistance programmes on the peaceful applications of nuclear energy in spite of financial constraints. In this context he stated that France favours abandoning the zero-growth principle for the IAEA budget, and urged Member States to make their contributions in order to spare the Agency additional funding problems. He continued by offering a brief survey of the French nuclear programme, and noted that 76% of national electricity is generated by nuclear power, that safety levels were more than satisfactory, and that the National Radwaste Agency (ANDRA) had established an exemplary inventory of radwaste, which he offered as an example to other Member States. He closed in reafflrming the consistency of France's nuclear policy with that of the IAEA and the importance of international co-operation within the Agency framework.

<A NAME="mexico">
<B><I>Mexico, Ms. Roberta Lajous Vargas, Ambassador to Austria:</I></B>
<P>
</A>
Ms. Lajous Vargas opened by welcoming Moldova as a new member of the Agency and the signing of a safeguards agreement between the Agency and Chile. She noted that Mexico had ratified the Nuclear Safety Convention, and she called upon Member States to ratify the Convention.  She said that Mexico welcomed the approval of the test ban treaty at the Plenary Session of the UN General Assembly. She further expressed her country's interest in the 93 + 2 safeguards programme and said that the Additional Protocol will strengthen the non-proliferation regime and will foster trust, which will in turn allow for full nuclear disarmament. She expressed Mexico's interest in the amendment of Article VI of the Agency's Statute, and noted with satisfaction that there have been achievements to this respect. Mexico shares the opinion expressed by other delegations concerning its prompt conclusion and called on Member States to collaborate in solving differences and gear their efforts towards a solution in a way that the Board of Governors can equally represent all regions. She went on to say that Mexico is currently participating actively in most of the 17 projects carried out within the framework of the ARCAL regional programme and will continue to collaborate widely with the Agency by making use of experts and offering training possibilities. She also noted the nuclear information seminar held with the IAEA in May 1996 which contributed to the understanding of nuclear issues and technologies. She closed by 
praising the achievements concerning the efficient exchange of information and pointed out that access to Internet and the information technology plan has greatly contributed towards this goal.  
<A NAME="egypt">
<P>
<B><I>Egypt, Mr. Mustafa M. El-Feki. Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by noting that since the last session of the General Conference the IAEA has taken many steps to expand the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. An important event has been the establishment of the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone. He hoped that a similar zone will also be set up in the Middle East. He said that the security of Africa and the Middle East are linked due to the geographical and political cross-cutting between them. The Middle East has moved over the past few years to establish peace by taking positive steps in finding security and confidence building in his country and in the region. The presence of a nuclear programme on our eastern borders to which the system of safeguards does not apply creates a very dangerous situation. The position of Egypt is not directed towards any one country. It wants the removal of all nuclear weapons and promotes peace in the whole region. He urged the Agency to take further steps to establish a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East. He mentioned the second part of the Agency's 93+2 programme should avoid intrusion of safeguards systems in non-nuclear areas and not infringe upon the rights of countries to benefit from peaceful use of nuclear energy. He said that his country supports the CTBT. Egypt agrees with most of the initial draft of the treaty adopted by the General Assembly. He suggested that the Agency expand its Board of Governors in order to increase its political authority. Africa suffers from lack of representation on the Board. He expressed his appreciation for the Agency's role in spreading the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Africa and the Arab States.

<B><I>Venezuela. Mr. Demetrio Boersner, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
<P>
Mr. Boersner opened by welcoming Tlatelolco's process of consolidation and at the same time, he pledged full support to the Treaty. The delegate praised other efforts to create nuclear-free zones in Africa and wished that a similar zone be  created in other areas, especially in the Middle East. He said that Article VI of the Agency's Statute is very important and that the Board of Governors should be broadened to allow a more effective representation of countries from different geographic regions. Developing countries, he added, would be able to better fulfill their obligations towards the Agency if they had a more equitable representation on the Board, thus increasing their responsibilities. Concerning technical cooperation, Venezuela is a beneficiary and participant of a project to increase the supply of water by making greater use of groundwater. He closed by saying that in the framework of ARCAL, Venezuela is presently participating in 10 regional projects in the area of veterinary science, nuclear analytical techniques, production of pharmaceuticals, the industrial application of nuclear techniques, and other projects of high scientific and human interest.

World reaction to nuclear tests conducted over the past year show the strong global support for the CTBT. Norway is disappointed that a few countries defy world opinion 
by opposing the treaty. Norway strongly supports the safeguards work of the IAEA and the process of strengthening that is underway. It also welcomes Agency activities against the illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials. One of the most concentrated areas of civilian and nuclear activities is located just over Norway's border with Russia. Norway has launched a Plan of Action with $35 million committed to address nuclear safety and waste issues in this region. A key focus of these efforts is ensuring the safety and reducing risks at the Kola Nuclear Power Plant until the reactors can be closed. Russia and Norway are also cooperating in the transport, handling and storage of spent nuclear fuel from decommissioned submarines. IAEA has played a constructive role in promoting nuclear safety and the Convention. Norway is actively engaged in developing the convention on radioactive waste management. In Norway's view spent fuel should be covered in the convention because the risk to populations is similar to that from high-level waste. Norway is pleased that the Moscow Summit gave priority to safety in connection with nuclear energy. Norway looks forward to the final results of the Agency's International Arctic Seas Assessment Programme. While the results so far are generally positive from a environmental standpoint, Norway and Russia will establish a joint program for monitoring. A Contact Expert Group on radioactive waste management in Russia has been created with help from Norway. Nuclear energy must be properly understood and managed, and therefore Norway values the IAEA's work and capabilities in this important field.

<B><I>Sudan, Mr. Abdewahab Abdelrahim Elmubarak, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by expressing the great importance that Sudan attaches to the IAEA's activities for least developed countries and in the application of nuclear energy in the fields of agriculture, livestock, the provision of water and the protection of the environment. Also the Agency is the guardian of the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Agency has helped Sudan in maintaining its equipment and in the provision of experts and technical assistance. He urged the Agency to finance further technical co-operation programmes either from its own budget or from other reliable sources. He said that Sudan appreciates the Agency's efforts in enhancing the effectiveness of the safeguards system. But at the same time, Sudan believes that it is important to ensure some basic conditions, the most important being that the safeguards system has a global character, with a balance between the Agency's needs for information and protecting the countries' rights. In the area of the Middle East, the international community must exert every effort to fully implement the safeguards system in every country in this region. He said
that Sudan believes that an increase in the membership of the Board of Governors will expedite its work. The absence of many countries from the Board weakens the sense of adherence to its decisions and increases debate in the General Conference. As far as personnel are concerned, he said that Sudan feels that there is not enough representation of women in professional and higher posts. The developing countries have to co-operate with the Secretariat to correct this situation, he said.
<A NAME="argentina">
<P>
<B><I>Argentina, Mr. Andrs G. Pesci Bourel, Ambassador to Austria:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Mr. Pesci opened by citing Argentina's steps in the area of non-proliferation, including the agreement with Brazil for the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy, the Quadripartite Safeguards Agreement with the Agency, the ratification of Tlatelolco and NPT, and the formal entrance as a regular member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In the context of NPT, Argentina has established a demanding national system for control of export nuclear materials, equipment and technologies, and has actively participated in the plenary meeting of the Zangger Committee. He stated that at the domestic level, the nuclear share of the power system amounted to 13% of the total, with a nuclear plant load factor of 92%. Concerning other reactors, Argentina has continued the development of the low-power generation reactor, carrying out a number of tests. The construction of the third research reactor continues. Mr. Pesci underlined the importance of the School of Nuclear Medicine and the post-graduate course on radiological protection and nuclear safety. He closed by praising the ARCAL regional programme and underlining that Argentina has initiated with the Agency the implementation of Part 1 safeguards measures under Programme 93 + 2 at its nuclear facilities.
<A NAME="chile">
<P>
<B><I>Chile, Mr. Osvaldo Puccio Huidobro, Ambassador to Austria:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Mr. Puccio opened by citing the recent approval and entry into force of a safeguards agreement between Chile and the Agency, within the framework of NPT, thus meeting Chile's obligations as a Party to NPT. In this same context, he added, Chile supports the UN General Assembly resolution which approves and opens CTBT for signature, and welcomed the future establishment of the Secretariat of the CTBT in Vienna. He mentioned that his government has submitted the Nuclear Safety Convention to Congress for its study and ratification and that it supports the "93 + 2 Programme". Concerning the management of radioactive waste, Chile, with the Agency's support, has established a plant for the treatment of radioactive waste which efficiently meets present regulations. He continued to express his satisfaction about the application of advanced communication technology, such as the connection of Agency Missions through Internet. In the field of technical co-operation, Chile welcomes the establishment of the Standing Advisory Committee on Technical Assistance and Co-operation and gladly accepts the invitation to participate in it. He explained that the concept of technical cooperation demands a greater participation and compromise from the recipient
countries, which must have a greater responsibility in the selection of topics and the design and implementation of projects, thus alleviating the heavy and costly administrative burden for the Agency. He closed by saying that Chile has benefitted from the Agency's programme to eradicate the fruit fly, with an important economic impact considering the importance of fruit exports for Chile's economy.

<A NAME="holysee">
<B><I>Holv See. Rev. Monsignore Maris Zenari, Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by remembering that last year Pope John Paul II, during his visit to the UN in New York, pointed out that humanity was experiencing a great threat of nuclear war 
in the second half of the twentieth century. Apprehension about the peaceful use of nuclear energy is also present, especially since the Chernobyl accident. The peaceful use of nuclear energy has often give rise to questions on safety. He said that the Holy See followed the international conference on Chernobyl with great interest this year. He said that this conference was important to promote scientific studies of its consequences and appropriate measures for those who suffered damages. The Holy See is also satisfied with the commitment expressed in the Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit declaration to give priority to safe use of nuclear energy. He said his delegation supports all initiatives aimed at fostering global nuclear safety culture. His delegation hopes that the Convention on Radioactive Waste Management will not only cover radioactive waste originating from civilian, but also from military and defense activities. He also stressed the importance of transparent and objective information on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, as well as an open dialogue of its advantages and its limitations. The total lack of information immediately after the Chernobyl accident had very serious consequences, and even today people in that region do not believe what the authorities tell them. This has led to cases of chronic environmental stress disorder. He said it is also the responsibility of the media to refrain from evoking uncertainty and unnecessary fear and anxieties. He said that the Holy See supports the newly proposed measures of the safeguards system, which should promote nuclear disarmament. He commended the Agency's assistance towards the conclusion of Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaties in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and in South Asia and South Pacific. He concluded by quoting the words of Pope John Paul II that humans are endowed with capacities for wisdom and virtue and that difficulties and uncertainties can be overcome by responsibilities and solidarity.

<B><I>Netherlands, Ambassador Joost van Ebbenhorst Tengbergen, Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
</P>
In congratulating the Agency on its 40th anniversary, he said that over the years the IAEA's activities have become increasingly relevant to the global community, both from the environmental and political perspective. He fully endorsed the statement of Ireland on behalf of the European Union, and further called on all States to accede to the test ban treaty (CTBT) so that it would enter into force in the near future. Addressing safeguards measures, he said efforts to strengthen the system are a major contribution to non-proliferation, particularly with respect to detecting undeclared nuclear activities. His country applauds the decision to draft a model protocol to grant the Agency complementary legal authority for implementing certain safeguards measures, and it considers the strengthening of safeguards as an irreversible trend. Further desirable steps include the conclusion of a ban on the production of fissile material for explosive purposes and greater safeguarding of civil and ex-military stockpiles of fissile materials. Regarding his country's nuclear programme, he pointed to a white paper on energy policy that had been presented to Parliament which emphasizes energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. No new nuclear plants are foreseen, though the existing capacity will be maintained to keep the option open. He welcomed the pending entry into force of the Nuclear Safety Convention and progress toward a convention on  radioactive waste management, as well as on nuclear liability issues. Such developments will further contribute to the global safety culture, he said. He closed by commending the Agency's work in areas of technical co-operation for social and economic development, and by underlining the IAEA's financial situation, which he said remains worrying. He appealed to all members to pay their shares in full to enable priorities to be set and important work to go ahead.

<P>
<B><I>Hungarv. Professor Dr Gyoergy Vajda, Vice-President of the Hungarian Atomic Energy Commission:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He expressed his full support of the extension of the NPT and the finalized text of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty now ready for signature. He went on to express his support of the Agency's strengthened safeguards system, and noted that Hungary was at present implementing Part 1 of the 93+2 Programme. He commended the work of the IAEA with regard to implementation of Security Council resolutions on Iraq and called on the DPRK to co-operate fully with the Agency. Close co-operation with the Agency in problems related to illicit trafficking of nuclear materials was also called for. The delegate continued by referring to the centenary of the discovery of radioactivity and the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, going on to touch on international conventions, naming the Nuclear Safety Convention which is nearing entry into force, and the Convention of Safety on Radioactive Waste Management, early conclusion of which Hungary is already anticipating. He expressed his strong support of the Supplementary Funding Convention, to be accessible to all victims of nuclear accidents without discrimination, thus providing an overall international liability regime. Hungary recognizes the priority of safety in nuclear applications, and the delegate was pleased to note the new energy law now before Parliament, the basic principles of which comply fully with requirements of relevant international agreements. He went on to note that Hungarian regulations also call for periodic safety review of nuclear facilities, and that within the scope of the IAEA extrabudgetary programme a mission is to be held to review and assess safety upgrading at Paks nuclear plant in November 1996. In addition, a seismic re-evaluation of the Paks site had also been conducted with Agency assistance. The delegate expressed strong support of the Agency's technical co-operation programme, fully endorsing its new initiatives: fewer but better projects, Partnership in Development, emphasis on sustainability. In closing, he was pleased to announce that Hungary had pledged an amount corresponding to its share of the budget to the IAEA Technical Assistance and Co-operation Fund for 1997. He then referred to the necessity of helping the public develop a realistic approach to radiation and its many useful applications in science, technology and medicine.

<B><I>Australia, Mr. Ronald A. Walker, Ambassador to Austria and
Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by commending progress that had been made in the field of nuclear non-proliferation, especially citing the work of the IAEA relative to the NPT.  He pledged Australia's continued financial support of Agency technical co-operation
activities, despite cutbacks in its national resources for foreign and multilateral aid  He welcomed efforts to strengthen Agency technical assistance programmes and to improve management and monitoring.  He expressed support for the Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA), which he noted marks its 25th anniversary next year, and called for its extension.  He further expressed his country's interest in the Philippines proposal for establishing an "Asiatom" body.  On safeguards matters, Mr. Walker underlined his country's view that the system needs considerable strengthening to enable it to detect undeclared activities and to serve security interests into the next century.  He said the model protocol that had been drafted represents a reasonable and realistic balance between the interests of States to protect  their security and their national commercial interests. He hoped that the protocol could be finalized by year's end and urged countries to work towards that goal.  Regarding the adoption of the test ban treaty (CTBT), he pointed out that it will open for signature on 24 September.  He underlined the importance of the IAEA's role in the non-proliferation and disarmament fields, noting that its work has taken on added importance with the emergence of  new nuclear issues, such as illicit nuclear trafficking, in recent years.  He commended the Agency for its work in Iraq and urged continuing efforts to resolve matters in the DPRK.  He further welcomed the Agency's work concerning radiological assessments of nuclear test sites.  Nuclear safety issues also commanded continuing efforts, he said, and he said that Australia is nearing ratification of the Nuclear Safety Convention and that it actively supports work toward a convention on radioactive waste management and in the field of nuclear liability.  He concluded by reviewing the significant role of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization in fields of research and applications, noting expanded activities in areas of  safety, radioactive waste management, and the environment. In looking ahead to the 40th anniversary year of the IAEA, he paid tribute to outstanding leadership and expertise that has enabled the Agency to respond to challenges and attain an exceptional status among international organizations, and he urged that Member States continue to build on this solid record of achievement.
<A NAME="switzerland">
<P>
<B><I>Switzerland, Mr. Eduard Kiener, Director of the Federal Office of Energy (On behalf of Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein):</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by commending the Director General and Secretariat for the remarkable work performed under inauspicious financial conditions, and greeted Moldova as a new Member State. He went on to congratulate the Agency for its central role in organizing the Chernobyl Conference, the results of which will serve as reference material for the future. The delegate looked forward to the 1997 special session of the General Assembly on Agenda 21, adopted at Rio de Janeiro during the Earth Summit, at which the nuclear option particularly for generation of electricity will be discussed. Switzerland favours a global nuclear non-proliferation policy on the basis of international treaties, and would like nuclear weapon States to substantially reduce 	their arsenals. He also hopes that discussions on a cut-off treaty will soon begin. The delegate spoke of Switzerland's commitment to the 93+2 Programme, and of the remote monitoring pilot system now being implemented on a large scale at all Swiss installations; this would considerably lower the travel costs of inspectors, one of the goals of the 93+2 Programme. He supported the Agency in its need for information on transfer of nuclear materials and equipment, urging all States to comply with the Agency. He discussed important tasks ahead for the Agency in the field of nuclear applications, particularly as the world faces population growth and water shortages which can strain international relations. He encouraged Agency support of new technologies, particularly those not conducive to proliferation, and referred to scientific discussion of accelerator-associated reactors, an option well worth exploring. Although 39% of Switzerland's electricity is nuclear-generated, the nuclear programme is under legal attack, and thanks to the moratorium on construction of new reactors, it may not be possible to replace three functioning reactors when they are due to be decommissioned in 2010. He hoped that the political situation will be able to cope with the problem when the time comes for it to be addressed. He also referred to the problem of siting waste storage facilities, a question more political 
than technological in Switzerland. He drew attention to the depletion of financial resources of Member States, and while agreeing to accept the 1997 budget, requested that it remain at the same level in real terms for 1998. The delegate was pleased to announce Switzerland's ratification of the Convention of Nuclear Safety, and expressed his support of the progress of the Draft Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, requesting that spent fuel elements be placed within the scope of the Convention. He closed on an optimistic note by anticipating the drafting of the final version of the Convention at the 41st General Conference.

</A>
<P>
He opened by underscoring the significance of the NPT, urging all States to accede to it, and applauding the establishment of the CTBT, yet expressing concern over the non-compliance of certain States to their safeguards obligations. He commended the Agency for its work in locating and eliminating Iraq's nuclear weapon potential, referring in this context to the initiation of the 93+2 programme for strengthening the IAEA safeguards system, and noting that field trials of elements of this programme have shown no undesirable impact on normal operaffon of nuclear facilities. While welcoming the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety this year, he went on to support the work on a Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste and on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the agreed draft to a diplomatic conference to be held in 1997. He urged consideration of safety and environmental issues in all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle and in the use of radioisotopes for industrial and medical purposes, and was pleased to announce that Sweden recognizes the importance of the Agency's technical cooperation activities, to which it pledges its full share for 1997. The delegate closed by commending the work of the 1995 External Auditor, the Agency for acting on his recommendations and by wishing the new External Auditor every success.

<A NAME="germany">
<P>
<B><I> Germany, Ms. Cornelia Yzar, Parliamentary State Secretary, German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology:</I></B>
<P></A>
Associating her country with the European Union statement, she said that Germany pursues an ensured energy policy that seeks to conserve resources, protect the environment and promote efficiency. In this context, nuclear energy continues to play an important role -- providing 30 percent of current electricity supplies. Germany will likely ratify the Nuclear Safety Convention within a few months. It supports the progress made on the Waste Management Convention. German bilateral aid is focussed on nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union, in particular for the Rovno and Balakovo nuclear plants and the strengthening of regulatory authorities. Germany has worked hard the achieve the conclusion of a CTBT as a follow up to the NPT. It will also work to pursue a Cut-Off Convention. The Moscow Summit was successful in highlighting nuclear safety as a priority and in supporting endeavours aimed at subjecting sensitive nuclear materials of participating States to IAEA Safeguards. Illicit trafficking of nuclear materials remains a global problem.  Ukraine has already announced new initiatives and other countries should be encouraged. 
Germany's Federal budget will contract by 2.5 percent in 1997 and this will mean a cut in the voluntary contribution to the technical co-operation fund. Germany fully suuprts efforts to strengthen safeguards, and notes that more governments are supporting the concept of universality of 93+2. Germany was reassured by the US statesments to the Board in June that it will not seek from other countries what the US is not ready to accept for itself.   
<A NAME="kazakstan">
<P>
<B><I>Kazakstan, Mr Vladimir Shkolnik, Minister of Science and New Technologies: </I></B>
</A>
<P>
Kazakstan is a young member of the IAEA but one fully committed to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, having clearly stated in the Almaty Declaration that it did not seek to possess nuclear weapons technology and having joined the NPT in 1993.  He was pleased to announce that all weapons previously deployed on Kazak territory have been removed and that most Kazak nuclear facilities are now under IAEA safeguards supervision.  He spoke briefly of Kazakstan's nuclear potential after the breakup of the USSR, which includes uranium mining and fuel fabrication plants, as well as a fast reactor located on the Caspian coast used for both fresh water supplies and electricity generation.  The delegate referred to the special attention being given to the conversion of the former nuclear testing site near Semipalatinsk, now the Kazak Nuclear Centre, and how active co-operation with the Agency is helping to determine the consequences of nuclear weapons testing and develop methods of eliminating these effects.  He was pleased to note Kazakstan's readiness to share its considerable knowledge on sea water desalination by nuclear techniques within the framework of the Agency's programme.  The delegate expressed strong support of the IAEA safeguard systems, in particular the 93+2 Programme, and noted with satisfaction that nuclear weapon States were expanding the safeguarding of their activities and materials.  As prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and sources is a cause of concern, the delegate went on to inform the Conference that Kazakstan's export policy now complies with IAEA regulations, and it also shares the Agency's position on nuclear safety.  Kazakstan will accede to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and hopes to establish the suitable legislative framework to ensure radiation safety.  The delegate closed by encouraging development of nuclear applications, and expressed his support of the Agency's projects, which he hoped would continue to grow. 
<A NAME="ec">

<B><I>European Commission/European Union, Mr. Pablo Benavides, Director General, Directorate-General for Energy: </I></B>
</A>
<P>
Noting that the European Union as a whole is still a net importer of energy, the delegate said that it is now moving towards an integrated and more competitive market on energy matters, and that accordingly new policy was being shaped.  Regarding safeguards issues, he expressed support for the IAEA's efforts to strengthen the system, and said that it will be necessary at a future stage to define the role of Euratom under additional measures that are foreseen.  He said that the New Partnership Approach agreed in 1992 between Euratom and the Agency establishes an effective framework for co-operation, and that the EC is sure that its further implementation will enable reductions in inspection effort in the Community.  He further addressed the question of nuclear testing and the radiological assessment of the site in French Polynesia, noting that EC staff are actively participating in the study.  On matters of safety, he underscored the EC's commitment to the global safety culture and said it welcomed the high level safety issues had received at the Moscow Summit, at which the EC participated and now is involved in follow-up actions.  He noted the EC's programmes for improving the safety of nuclear plants in Newly Independent States.  Further, he said that nuclear safety agreements had been negotiated between Euratom and Russia, as well as with Kazakstan, and that negotiations with Ukraine are taking place.  He also noted that the EU has adopted a revised Directive laying down basic safety standards for health protection against dangers of ionizing radiation that is consistent with IAEA standards.  It is also seeking to resume discussions on Euratom's accession to the Nuclear Safety Convention. On the issue of trafficking, he welcomed the approaches to counteracting problems laid down at the G-7 Summit and supported the work of the IAEA in this field, noting the EU's cooperation on ways of detecting radioactive substances at borders.  After reviewing the Community's progress in areas of research and development, he addressed new agreements that had been signed for peaceful nuclear cooperation with the USA covering nuclear safety and other matters,  as well as will Argentina, covering reactor safety research, waste management, and other areas.

<P>
He opened by welcoming the Republic of Moldova as new member of the IAEA.  He congratulated the Agency for its responsible use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and providing safeguards against harmful effects of nuclear activities. He stressed the interest of all countries in joining the NPT. He welcomed the Agency's activities towards strengthening nuclear safety standards and principles for nuclear safety in nuclear installations. Countries operating nuclear power plants at low safety levels must co-operate closely with the Agency in implementing nuclear safety measures and standards. He said Macedonia also attaches great importance to the Agency's activities in the fields of waste management.

He said that this country does not have a nuclear power plant on its territory and does not plan to build one at present. Macedonia's co-operation with the Agency is oriented towards improvement of scientific knowledge and practical use of nuclear energy in medicine, agriculture and industry. He thanked the Agency for its valuable technical assistance in upgrading his country's existing equipment, treatment of animal diseases, RIA technologies in nuclear medicine and personal dosimetry. He supported IAEA's efforts for organizing regional co-operation meetings in Europe which could lead to realization of programmes of mutual interest to all countries.
<A NAME="tanzania">
<P>
<b><I>United Republic of Tanzania,  Mr. Jackson Makweta, Minister for Science Technology, and Higher Education:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by expressing gratitude towards the IAEA for its technical co-operation Programme. He said that through this programme several least developed as well as developing countries have received nuclear technology and have benefited from the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  The recent visit of Director General Dr. Blix shows what kind of importance is given to technical assistance with developing Member States. He mentioned project for the total eradication of tsetse flies by the sterile insect technique on the Zanzibar Island in Tanzania. He said that this is a good example of the "model project" concept for meeting the real needs of the end users of technology. The people of Zanzibar look forward to the tsetse free Island. Soon East Africa and Africa as a whole will be using the sterile insect technique to combat the number one pest that is keeping Africa one of the most undernourished continents in the world.  He thanked the Agency for its support to the African Co-operative Agreement for Research, Developing and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology. He said that his country supports the Agency's technical co-operation activities in the fields of radioactive waste management and nuclear safety. Tanzania also supports the NPT and the establishment the Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in Africa. He said this would hopefully lead to global nuclear disarmament. 
<A NAME="spain">
<P>
<B><I>Spain, Ms. Mar&iacute;a Luisa Huidobro, Director General of Energy:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Ms. Huidobro opened by saying that nuclear energy in her country amounted to 34% of the total electric production in 1995, and that the load factor was 85.5%.  Regarding energy policy in Spain, she mentioned that it introduced competitiveness in the electric sector through the creation of an electricity bulk market. She said her delegation supports the organizational restructuring of the Agency by creating the Nuclear Safety Department and welcomes the work toward a convention on Chernobyl radioactive waste. Spain gives special importance to efforts to improve the safety of Soviet designed nuclear plants she said.  She welcomed the success of the conference,  and added that it showed the Agency's important role as the sponsor of the exchange of experience and information about nuclear safety, radiological protection, and radioactive waste. She added that her country values the broadening of the scope of the Agency's reporting systems for nuclear incidents.  Spain gives outmost importance to the Agency's co-operation activities, and for this reason, it has increased its voluntary contribution to technical co-operation.  She closed by saying that Spain is financing various projects, and hosts scientific fellows, and organizes training courses every year, covering all the local expenses and those of Spanish lecturers. 
<A NAME="croatia">

<P>
The Ambassador greeted the Republic of Moldova as a new member of the IAEA and went on to reconfirm Croatia's commitment to the work and goals of the Agency, particularly with regard to the political changes of recent years.  She commended the technical co-operation programme and expressed Croatia's high regard for the Agency's work in the field of nuclear applications, as well as its hope for harmonization of radiation protection and nuclear safety rules with international standards. She was pleased to refer to the service Croatian institutions have offered to the IAEA in the form of expertise, training or organization of interregional training courses, and particularly applauded the Agency's programme on comparative assessment of energy sources for electricity generation.  The delegate noted that plans were being made to construct a low and intermediate waste repository for the nuclear plant at Krsko, which is owned jointly with the Republic of Slovenia.  She expressed Croatia's strong support of the indefinite extension of the NPT, hoping that NPT Conference decisions would be implemented in their entirety, and was pleased to note the overwhelming vote at the General Assembly in favour of the CTBT.  She urged negotiations on the so-called Cut-Off Treaty, and welcomed the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones in Africa and South East Asia.  The delegate supported the strengthening of Agency capabilities for the detection of undeclared nuclear activities (Programme 93 + 2), and applauded the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which Croatia has already ratified.  She hoped for further progress of the Standing Committee on Liability for  Nuclear Damage and on the preparations for a Convention on the Safe Management of Radioactive Waste.  Finally, she referred to the efforts Croatia is making to support the IAEA in spite of its own difficult financial situation, and hoped that  special consideration be given to the problems of newly established countries, particularly those affected by war.

<P>
<B><I>Slovak Republic, Mr. Josef Misak, Head of Slovak Delegation, Chairman, Nuclear Regulatory Authority:</I></B>
</A>
<P>

Slovakia welcomed the extension of the NPT and the adoption of the CTBT at the UN.  The NPT reaffirmed the role of the IAEA safeguards system. It is regrettable that the DPRK has yet to comply with its safeguards agreements. Slovakia fully supports the strengthening of the safeguards system, including the model protocol regarding Part II measures. Measures against illicit trafficking are also very important.  Slovakia relies on nuclear plants for about 50 percent of its electricity, and consumption has been rising at about 8 percent annually. Four reactors are operating at Bohunice and four more are under construction at Mochovce. The Moscow Nuclear Summit highlighted important safety concerns regarding the safety of nuclear power. All Slovakian plants are being upgraded for safety and are receiving international expertise in these efforts.  An independent State authority regulates the safe use of nuclear power. Slovakia has acceded to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and will participate in the Convention on Radioactive Waste. The IAEA has played a significant role in safety improvements in Slovakia's WWER reactors, especially through the technical co-operation programme. Slovakia is the host to a Regional Model Project on strengthening regulatory authorities. An appeal was made to all Member States to fulfill their commitments to the technical co-operation Programme, as Slovakia has done for 1996 and 1997.
<A NAME="tunisia">
<P>
<B><I>Tunisia, Mr. Mohamed El Fadhel-Khalil, Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by welcoming Moldova as a member of the IAEA. He expressed Tunisia's commitment to international co-operation. He said that Tunisia was one of the first countries to join the agreement establishing the Agency and has also signed the treaty on nuclear safety.  His country is also one of the first ones to join the Convention on Co-operation between Arab countries for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Tunisia wishes to see strengthening of activities in the area of nuclear safety and supports the establishment of a global waste management system.  He thanked the Agency for developing the pilot programme for technical assistance to Tunisia. He expressed gratitude for the support given to the AFRA programme by France, the US and OPEC. He noted that Tunisia has always made regular financial contributions to the Agency and it will make full payment to the Technical Co-operation Programme for 1997.  Tunisia hopes that IAEA's  technical co-operation activities in fellowship training will be increased.  He said that Tunisia believes that it is necessary to create a balance between the use of nuclear technology and ensuring safety from the potential dangers of using such technology. It is important to apply the safeguards system so that no Member State can violate the safeguards requirements.  He welcomes the 93+2 of the Agency, but it should establish a balance between the needs of strengthening of the safeguards and the basis of national sovereignty. Secondly, the safeguards must not increase the costs of the Agency and should function within the existing budget. It is the nuclear States that should provide the greater financial contribution, especially given the costs of the application of the safeguards system. The IAEA should also reduce the costs of the safeguards. The number of Member States of the Agency has increased considerably over the last decade. Tunisia has for a long time called for an expansion of the Board of Governors so that the African region, the Middle East and South Asia will have a more equitable representation.  Tunisia welcomes the extension of the NPT and is happy that the General Assembly of the UN has chosen to prohibit nuclear weapon tests.

<P>
<B><I>Denmark, Ambassador Joergen Boejer, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
In opening, he associated himself with the statement made by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union, going on to express Denmark's strong support of the NPT as adopted at the end of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference, and drawing the Agency's attention to the key role in implementing safeguards rules assigned to it by that Conference.  He continued by emphasizing the priority of safeguards within the IAEA, noting particularly progress made on the 93+2 Programme, and stating clearly that, whereas the objectives of non-proliferation and strengthening of international confidence justify considerable cost and effort, the burdens of complying with '93+2' are modest indeed.  He invited non-nuclear weapon States to conclude safeguards agreements, calling attention to the experience in Iraq and the necessity of comprehensive export and supply control.  He referred to the question of nuclear safety, which was the cause of Denmark's decision in 1985 not to include nuclear in its energy planning.  It was clear to him that a satisfactory solution for nuclear safety and waste storage problems has yet to be found.  The delegate commended the IAEA's work towards a fortified nuclear safety culture, making specific mention of its work in Central and Eastern Europe, yet stating clearly that for certain reactors in these countries the only solution would be shutting them down as soon as possible.  He supported efforts to develop legally binding agreements in nuclear safety and urged all countries with nuclear installations to become parties to an effective nuclear liability regime.  In closing, he was pleased to note that Denmark   welcomed the increasing attention given by the Secretariat to the improved representation of women and paid tribute to the work of the Director General and the Secretariat.
<A NAME="slovenia">
<P>
<B><I>Slovenia, Mr. Miroslav Gregoric, Director of the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration, Head of the Slovenian Delegation:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by welcoming the Republic of Moldova as new member of the IAEA.  He supported the statement made by Ireland on behalf of the EU. He said that Slovenia welcomes the adoption of the CTBT and urges all countries to adopt the treaty.  He said that Slovenia favours the Convention of Nuclear Safety, which is in the final stage of ratification in the Slovenian Parliament. The convention should be complemented by legally binding agreements in the fields of radioactive waste management. Regarding IAEA's 93+2 programme, he said that he is convinced that Safeguards will be able to prevent the use of nuclear energy for military activities. Slovenia it self has invited the IAEA International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) to review its nuclear material. Slovenia supports IAEA's continuous presence in Iraq as well as in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to carry out monitoring and verification inspections. He said that Slovenia welcomes establishment of a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in Southeast Asia as well as in Africa. He expressed concern over the Agency's finances and urged all Member States to pay their dues on time, noting that his country had always paid its contribution to the IAEA in full and on time. He was pleased that a number of States adhered to the Vienna Convention and Joint Protocol and regretted that the same progress had not been achieved on the supplementary funding convention. He said Slovenia plans to take active part in the up-coming ASSET mission which will take place at the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant. 
<A NAME="indonesia">
<P>
<B><I>Indonesia, Prof. Dr. Sumaryo Suryokusumo, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Dr. Suryokusumo opened by expressing his satisfaction about the conclusion of the Treaty on Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in Southeast Asia and hoping that the signatory States will fulfill their obligations to ratify it before the Informal ASEAN Summit in December this year. The delegate said his country attaches great importance to international instruments on safety, and has taken constitutional measures to ratify the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material in 1996, on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and on Assistance in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency in 1993. As to the technical assistance and co-operation programmes, the application of irradiation techniques has brought about new varieties of food crops with better characteristics, such as the Cilosari rice variety. Another application is on the Urea Multinutrient Molasses Blocks, which were developed through laboratory research work using tracer techniques. The delegate closed by expressing gratitude to the Agency for its support in providing assistance to the Indonesian Atomic Energy Agency, particularly in reviewing the feasibility study for the proposed first nuclear power plant in Muria Peninsula, Central Java, and by praising RCA achievements for the last 25 years. Indonesia considers that the extension of RCA for another five years is of essential importance for its national development programmes. 
<A NAME="abacc">
<P>
<B><I>Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC), Dr. Jorge A. Coll, Secretary of ABACC:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Mr. Coll opened by saying that since ABACC's establishment in 1991, its implementation has been satisfactory: 149 inspections have been carried out in 1995 and 96 in 1996. He went on to say that the developments achieved in the preparation of "Guidelines for the Co-ordination of Inspection Activities" between both ABACC and the Agency constitute an excellent example of good understanding. ABACC considers that such guidelines, inspired in the optimized use of the present safeguards system of part I of the 93 +2 Programme, will be very important in the improvement of future co-operation. ABACC will like to include the concepts of strengthening of safeguards of part I of the programme in its future plan of action. For this reason, it has sent the Agency the questionnaire about the regional systems and the management of information, and the use of advanced techniques like remote and environmental monitoring are a main concern of its Secretariat. In this context, he stated, it is important to highlight the successful co-operation between ABACC and the American US Department of Energy (DOE) for the development and application of such techniques. ABACC already participates in the international programme of remote monitoring supported by the DOE and has a reception station which transmitts data from the nuclear plant Embalse in Argentina.

<P>
<B><I> Italy, Mr. Alberto Indelicato, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
<P></A>
Mr. Indelicato said that although Italy does not have any nuclear plants, it is active in research work being developed internationally towards reaching substantial improvements in nuclear plant safety. The delegate added that the Italian Electricity Company (ENEL), for example, is participating with major European electrical utilities, in the definition of the "European utility requirement" of new generation reactors which should gradually substitute existing European reactors early in the next century. He added that the Italian Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment (ENE) is undertaking studies concerning new generation reactor systems and has recently completed experimental programmes into new components for the SBWR and the AP600, and a design of a multi-purpose modular, small reactor with enhanced safety features has been completed by ENE and the University La Sapienza."The use of such a reactor for cogeneration of electricity and process heat for desalination appears very promising, he said. He closed by saying that continuing effort is still maintained with regard to the processing and disposal of nuclear wastes from ENEL's phased out nuclear plants.
<A NAME="algeria">
<P>
<B><I>Algeria, Mr Halim Behaddellah, Head of the Delegation:</I>
</B>
</A>
<P>
He assured the conference of Algeria's full co-operation with the objectives of the IAEA and congratulated the Agency for its efforts in promoting nuclear energy and technology.  He was pleased to announce that Algeria was party to the CTBT, extension of which he hailed as a breakthrough in a period of international tension and change, and a sign of encouragement to those countries for whose economic development the peaceful use of atomic energy is significant.  The delegate went on to state that Algeria had prohibited any non-peaceful use of nuclear energy within its borders, and that its two research reactors were included in the Agency's safeguards programme; plans for a national atomic energy institute were being drawn up.  His satisfaction on the establishment of the nuclear weapon free zone in Africa (Treaty of Pelindaba) was tempered with dismay that in close proximity to Africa, the refusal of one country has made it impossible to establish a similar zone in the Middle East.  The delegate stressed the significance of a global, non-discriminatory approach to non-proliferation, which would serve to protect developing countries while not obstructing their access to nuclear technology applications for peaceful purposses.  He emphasized Algeria's support of the IAEA's 93+2 Programme, and  hailed the re-establishment of the Committee on Financing of Technical Co-operation within the framework of the Board of Governors.  The delegate closed by hoping that Article VI of the Statute would be amended to reflect the needs of developing countries for representation. 
<A NAME="canada">
<P>
<B><I>Canada, Peter F. Walker, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>

The most important issue for Canada is the near future is the CTBT.  Canada aims toward an accord prohibiting all test explosions in all environments for all time. Related to safety issues reviewed at the Moscow Summit, Canada has agreed to the concept of using plutonium in MOX fuel in CANDU reactors. Canada supports strengthening safeguards through 93+2, especially to detect undeclared materials and activities. It will work closely with IAEA on a remodified safeguards approach in Canada. It also supports the new strategic directions in the technical co-operation programme. It notes the progress being made in the nuclear desalination programme. Canada has ratified the Safety Convention and support the early conclusion of a convention on waste management. Canada has a zero nominal growth policy regarding international organizations and agreed to IAEA's 1997 budget proposal reluctantly. Canada has 20 nuclear co-operation agreements covering more than 35 countries. The nuclear industry is active in formulating waste and safety measures.  CANDU reactors are among the best performing in the world, and are being efficiently used in Korea and soon in China.
<A NAME="czech">
<P>
<B><I>Czech Republic, Mr. Jan Stuller, Chairman, State Office for Nuclear Safety: </I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by stressing the importance of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, one of the major achievements of the IAEA. He urged the Member States who had not yet adopted this convention to do so as soon as possible.  He said that in today's world nuclear power has expanded significantly: there are 476 power reactors with a total capacity of 347 GWe in operation or under construction world-wide, and nuclear power contributed 17% to total electrical generation in 1995. He noted that IAEA's support has contributed substantially to progress in the areas of nuclear medicine, ionizing radiation in agriculture and industry, as well as the water source assessment programmes. Nuclear power plays an important role in the Czech Republic. At present, about 20% of its electricity is generated at the Dukovany nuclear power plant. With the completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant, the installed capacity of its nuclear power plants will more than double. The government of the Czech Republic strictly follows the basic principles of nuclear safety and radiation protection as enshrined in international agreements and conventions to which the country is party to. Considering this, the Czech Republic has upgraded the design of the Temelin nuclear power plant and started retrofitting the VVER units in operation at the Dukovany plant. In continuing its endeavours to improve the level of nuclear safety of the Czech nuclear facilities, its parliament is in the process of discussing a new Atomic Energy Act which will supersede existing basic legal standards in this field. The new Act is based on internationally adopted principles of nuclear safety and radiation protection and complies with the respective legislation of EU Member States. He also mentioned the two-year IAEA Technical Co-operation programme started in 1995 to assess nuclear fuel, safety culture, and radioactive waste management. In 1997-98 a new model project devoted to the area of health care will be implemented. 
<A NAME="turkey">
<P>
<B><I>Turkey, Ms. F&uuml;gen Ok, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Turkey welcomes the new approach indicated by the US, the UK and France to undertake new commitments in line with the measures of the 93+2 Programme, and wishes that nuclear safeguards commitments within the programme are brought to a uniform standard.  The country hopes that the programme will be opened to implementation in 1997.  Turkey also welcomes the conclusion of the CTBT, and hopes that the countries which have objections to the principle of step-by-step disarmament would show flexibility.  Referring to the adoption of the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty, Ms. Fgen expressed the hope that the African continent would serve as a model for the Middle East.  In this context, Turkey appreciates the efforts of the DG in his continued consultations with the Middle East countries, to facilitate the early application of full scope safeguards.  Speaking of the potential risks of the Armenian reactor in Medzamor, which is situated 30 km from Turkey's borders, Ms. Fgen said that an IAEA-Turkey joint mission visiting the reactor has improved safety aspects of the reactor.  She expressed her satisfaction with the recent developments relating to the Nuclear Safety Convention, the draft Convention on Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to amend the Vienna Convention and the draft Supplementary Funding Convention.  Speaking of regional co-operation, she was pleased to inform that Turkey had been able with the support of the IAEA to establish a facility, the Cekmece Nuclear Research and Training Centre, with capacity to process radioactive waste and had demonstrated to Member States in the region the predisposal management of radioactive waste.  Turkey believes that similar regional demonstration centres should be established in other regions.  The country proposes to establish a "generalised model project scheme" taking the experience gained by the Member States into consideration where model projects are undertaken and can be adopted for other similar requests, and to establish a "shuttle-like" information exchange mechanism between the IAEA and developing Member States.  Emphasizing the importance of strengthening the collaboration with other international organisation, she appreciated the "Marine Environmental Assessment" project.  With regard to nuclear applications for water resources, she said that Turkey would be prepared to take a leading role in promoting the isotope hydrology methodologies in the region and urged the Secretariat to initiate and promote regional projects in this area too.  Expressing serious concern about illicit nuclear trafficking, she said that her country attached great importance to combating trafficking of radioactive materials and strongly supported all efforts of the IAEA in this field.  Turkey advocates the idea that illicit trafficking cannot be overcome without having an internationally binding legal instrument that would commit the parties to ensure the control and security of radiation sources and to report any loss or theft of such sources to the IAEA or other international organizations.  
<A NAME="lithuania">
<P>
<B><I>Lithuania, Mr. Jonas-Rimantas Kazlauskas, Secretary of the Energy Ministry:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by praising the Agency for drafting legal documents as well as enforcing them.  Lithuania ratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety on 12 June 1996.  However, he said that Lithuania would hardly cope with the international responsibility stipulated in the treaty without international assistance.  Speaking of the Vienna Convention on Liability for Nuclear Damage, while his country agrees that the liabilities for damage are insufficient in the existing Convention, the liabilities projected in the new Convention are too high for Lithuania and the country supports proposals related to the transition period.  Lithuania is developing legislative background for the energy sector.  Lithuania supports performances of the programme 93+2 and the EU draft of the resolution of the programme.  Lithuania has already accepted proposals expressed by the Agency related to simplified inspector nomination procedures and has established a free entrance to Lithuania.  Emphasising the importance of nuclear energy in Lithuania, where nuclear energy amounts to 85% of the total electricity production, he said that an extensive safety improvement programme was underway, and that when the programme was completed, the safety of Ignalina would improve significantly.  In this context, he praised IAEA activities directed towards arrangements of ASSET and OSART missions and the Agency's financial assistance to Lithuania's nuclear specialists.  Noting the importance of a radioactive waste management issue, especially the spent nuclear fuel disposal issue, he said that every effort would be made to acquire new technologies while investigating geological conditions and co-operating with other countries.  He drew the attention of the Agency to the fact that Lithuania still has zero representation among the staff of the Agency.
<A NAME="finland">
<P>
<B><I>Finland, Ms. Eva-Christina Maekelaeinen, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
She underscored the significance of the international agreements of the past year: the Convention on Nuclear Safety, to enter into force shortly, the progress of work on the Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and the revision of the Vienna Convention on Nuclear Liability.  She urged finalization of the implementation protocol for Part 2 of the IAEA's 93+2 Programme, and noted that the IAEA budget for 1997 represented real growth, adding that Finland has never been a stubborn supporter of the zero-real-growth principles.  She did, however, welcome measures reviewing the Agency's programme as already introduced by the Secretariat, and stressed the importance of IAEA collaboration with other international organizations working in nuclear safety issues, referring by name to the NEA of the OECD and to the EU, since the expert resources at the disposal of all these organizations will be limited.  She closed by congratulating the DG and staff and assuring Finland's full support of their work. 
<A NAME="colombia">
<P>
<B><I>Colombia, Mr. Carlos Ramn Bula Camacho, Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He welcomed the Agency's projects of technical co-operation and assistance because they strengthen Colombia's technology and scientific investigation, and added that his country has greatly benefitted from ARCAL's programmes which are an additional element in the integration of Latin America and the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. He went on to praise the Agency's efforts regarding the measures against illicit trafficking of nuclear material and other radioactive sources.  He explained that regarding CTBT, Colombia has expressed its support to the treaty and that the Colombian Constitution states that the fabrication import, possession and use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons is forbidden, as well as the introduction of nuclear waste to the Colombian territory. In this context, he said that Colombia is a Party to the Tlatelolco Treaty yet considers that its present guidelines are not enough to stop such countries that have advanced technologies from continuing their non-traditional testing in the field of computer simulation. He closed by saying that his country supports the efforts to produce drinking water in an economic manner and the use of isotopic hydrology for the management of hydrological resources. 
<A NAME="armenia">
<P>
<B><I>Armenia, Mr. Ashot Voskanian, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Noting that his country had joined the Agency in 1993, he paid tribute to the IAEA's very positive reputation in Armenia, which he attributed to its effective management and scientific and technical programmes.  He said his country supports the work to reinforce the safeguards system, and he urged that stronger measures be taken against illicit trafficking of nuclear materials.  He extended appreciation to the Agency for its assistance with respect to the restart of the  Medzamor nuclear power plant, and he underlined Armenia's commitment to safety. He said the President has appointed an independent international advisory body called the Council on Safe Use of Nuclear Energy to monitor safety measures and regulations and to advise the President directly.  Additionally, greater resources and staff are being provided to the national nuclear regulatory authority(ANRA), which further is receiving technical assistance through the IAEA.  Armenian  authorities have submitted a report to the Agency on the recommissioning on Medzamor's operation.  He said that the plant is scheduled to remain in service for only as long as it takes to put into place alternative sources of energy, which is expected after the turn of the century.
 <A NAME="qatar">
<P>
<B><I>Qatar, Mr. Saleh A.S. AL-Bouanian, Charg&eacute; d'Affaires ad interim.  </I></B>
</A>
<P>
He opened by welcoming Moldova as a new member of the IAEA. He stated that his country is a strong believer in the system of non-proliferation and in the need for all countries to adhere to the NPT, particularly the Middle East.  He called upon Member States to give full support to the Director General in the full implementation of the safeguards system, and putting all the region's nuclear installations under the Agency's control. An agreement on making the Middle East free from nuclear weapons and any weapons of mass destruction would be strong impetus to the peace making process in the region. 
<P>
The role of the Agency should also assist the developing countries in transferring advanced technologies to these countries, enabling them to make the best use of nuclear energy in the fields of agriculture, medicine, environment protection, and food conservation. Qatar attaches great importance to projects dealing with supplying water resources to arid regions, and has great expectations from Agency's efforts in using nuclear technology in exploring underground water resources. He said that a dismal share had been allocated to Arab countries, despite the fact that the nuclear technology is very beneficial to them. Qatar believes the Agency should give more importance to the Middle East Region, and promote training opportunities for nationals of the region so it can build a body of national experts capable of harnessing the possibilities of nuclear energy for peaceful uses. 
<A NAME="malaysia">
<P>
<B><I>Malaysia, Mr Ahmad Sobri Haji Hashim, Director General, Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology  Research:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
He congratulated the Director General and the Secretariat for their work in spite of financial limitations.  The delegate briefly introduced the 7th Malaysian Plan (RM7), a blue-print for balanced development for 1996-2000, with its emphasis on productivity-driven R&D and explained how restructuring of research in priority areas was helping keep pace with the needs of the national economy. one-tenth of the R&D funding for 1996 was allocated to nuclear and related technology; although electricity generation from nuclear power remains only an option, there is increasing awareness of many other applications of nuclear science and technology.  The delegate was pleased to note that Malaysia will intensify its international co-operation efforts at all levels, emphasizing not only work with developed countries but also aiming towards greater self-reliance among countries of the South.  He referred with satisfaction to the successes of the Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research, Development and Training (RCA), and applauded the signing of the Pelindaba Treaty, which established Africa as a nuclear weapon free zone.  He went on to express his support of the SEANWFZ, hoping that nuclear weapon states would also accede to this treaty to ensure nuclear non-proliferation in South East Asia.  He touched briefly on the IAEA's 93+2 Programme, and stated that the CTBT - although successfully concluded -  would benefit from a specific time frame for total elimination of nuclear weapons.  The delegate was proud to note that Malaysia has always paid its budget contributions in full and on time and encouraged other Member States to do so.  He expressed ongoing support for the idea of Partnership in Development, and hoped that Member States would avail themselves of Malaysia's expertise in non-power nuclear science and technology.   
<A NAME="brazil">
<P>
<B><I>Brazil, Mr. Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
The delegate began his address by mentioning the confidence-building process undertaken by the Brazilian Government in the nuclear field, and noted that Brazil joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group last April.  He supported informal export control regimes as a valuable tool in preventing proliferation, in addition to international treaties and conventions, and also supported the Programme 93+2 of the IAEA, mentioning that it had been Brazil's proposal to create a working group to study means of implementation.  The delegate viewed with concern the fact that some measures proposed in 93+2 might lead to discrimination between countries with comprehensive safeguards agreements and nuclear weapon States, and expressed the hope that measures adopted under 93+2 would enter into force only after having been adopted by a number of countries.  He stressed the need for a more rigid system of responsibility in application of new safeguards measures, and hoped that significant progress would be achieved in the future.  He mentioned with satisfaction the success of the CTBT, and wished it success in spite of its imperfections; he continued by expressing support of the Cut Off Treaty,  He was glad to inform members that the Convention on Nuclear Safety will soon be ratified by Brazil, and expressed his optimism regarding future negotiations for its implementation.   The delegate applauded the progress made on the revision of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability, compensation amounts of which should not be increased so greatly that developing countries are prevented from joining it.  He expressed his delegation's concern about the progress of negotiations on a supplementary funding convention, and stated support of a conference on the revision of the Vienna Convention, to be held if that situation continues.  He reiterated Brazil's insistence on preference for a regional solution for the question of supplementary funding, and urged prompt adoption of the text of the Convention on Safe Management of Radioactive Waste.  The delegate expressed his gratitude to the IAEA for its support in technical co-operation activities, and reaffirmed Brazil's support of the concept of balance between safeguards and non-safeguards activities.  He noted international co-operation between Brazil and Argentina, and closed expressing support of revision of Article 6 of the Statute as long as the relative position of Latin America is not adversely affected.
<A NAME="austria">
<P>
<B><I>Austria, Mr. Ferdinand Mayrhofer-Gruenbuehel, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
The Ambassador focused on issues of particular national concern, citing the common position that already had been outlined by Ireland on behalf of EU Member States.  On issues of nuclear arms control and non-proliferation, he detailed progressive steps that have been taken in recent years and called for greater co-ordination and co-operation in several areas, notably concerning nuclear supplies and relevant controls.  He noted that Vienna will be the seat of the new organization for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, making it the center of global nuclear verification.  He called for further steps to curb nuclear weapons, including conclusion of a cut-off agreement on fissile material production for weapons purposes.  With respect to illegal nuclear trafficking, he said that Austria has been among countries experiencing the problem and that it considers global co-operation among national authorities in charge of border controls to be of utmost importance.  He welcomed progress that the Agency was making to strengthen its safeguards system, and in areas of nuclear liability, nuclear safety, and waste management.  While Austria supported the continuous improvement of reactor safety, such improvements should not lead to the extension of the plant's fixed lifetime, he said.  He noted that by the year 2000 about 70 nuclear plants will have reached 30 years of operation, and he said Austria would welcome proposals from the IAEA on their systematic decommissioning.  He said Austria further considers the Nuclear Safety Convention to be an important model for elaborating other conventions, namely one on the safety of radioactive waste management.  Regarding technical co-operation, he said that Austria welcomes new approaches that more squarely tie projects to the context of Agenda 21 and would like to see comprehensive impact assessments of all relevant activities.

<B><I>New Zealand, Mr. Alan Cook, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>      
He began his speech by stressing on the need to strengthen safeguards, which should be an effective and reliable part of the non-proliferation system. He supported the full implementation of the Programme 93 + 2, which has a mature and balanced set of proposals. He said that for his country, the current draft protocol represents a sound and effective package of measures which strengthen the Agency's capacity to detect undeclared nuclear activities. This is fundamental to the credibility of the Agency and to effective safeguards and a precondition for a non-proliferation regime in which everyone can have faith and confidence. He said that New Zealand does not want to see any changes in the current draft protocol which might weaken it, as this is a matter that profoundly effects the security of all members, whether they have significant nuclear industries or are non-nuclear industries like New Zealand. He noted that over the past year there have been further revelations about Iraq's clandestine nuclear programme, and there have been continuing difficulties with the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea. This only underscores the need for effective safeguards. He urged North Korea to return to full compliance with its provisions and co-operate with the Agency.  In the context of ongoing nuclear disarmament, he also regarded the report of the Canberra Commission as an important contribution to identifying future goals. For New Zealand, entry into the force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is extremely important. He called the CTBT a historic event which will ban all nuclear testing for all time, an outcome which his country has been pursuing for as long the Agency exists. He said that his country attaches particular importance to the study on the radiological situation at the Muruora and Fangataufa atolls.  New Zealand welcomes the Treaty of Rarotonga, now signed by the remaining three nuclear weapon states, which provides assurances that there will never be nuclear testing in the South Pacific region. He also welcomed the establishment of the Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in both Africa and Southeast Asia. He supported the Convention on Nuclear Safety and expressed concern over the issue of shipment of nuclear material across the region's oceans. He also supported the Convention on the Safe Management of Nuclear Waste which should further enforce high safety standards. New Zealand also believes that the Convention on Liability for Nuclear Damage should provide assurances of compensation for accidents, including during sea transport.  With regards to the budget, he said that New Zealand intends to make a further extra-budgetary contribution for 1997 to the joint UNDP/RCA/IAEA project.  Finally, he concluded by mentioning that New Zealand is seeking a seat on the Board of Governors in recognition of the fact that the IAEA's non-proliferation and other activities are of increasing relevance to all countries, including countries like New Zealand without major nuclear industries.

<B><I>Belarus, Mr. Valyantsin N. Fisenka,Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
On the occasion of the IAEA's 40th year, he said that the jubilee character of the Conference turns attention to what has been achieved and what is to be done for common security and the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons.  He said Belarus pursues an unswerving policy of the reduction and complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a ban on nuclear testing.  Having rejected the right to own nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union, he noted that Belarus has raised the idea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central and Eastern Europe and that consultations are being held with countries.  He looked to the Agency for consultative services in working out the necessary legal arrangements for such a zone.  He commended the IAEA's efforts to improve safeguards, and expressed gratitude to the USA, Sweden, and Japan for their technical and financial assistance to Belarus in creating its national system of nuclear accounting and control.  Under strengthening measures being foreseen, he said that Belarus would need additional technical assistance in areas of training.  On matters of technical cooperation, he noted several projects involving Belarus, including one to upgrade radiation protection and waste management infrastructures.  He further reviewed a number of important projects that had been undertaken in connection with the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl, and he extended special thanks to the IAEA, EC, WHO, UNESCO, FAO, and other bodies for the conferences they organized, pointing out that the affected States continue to require assistance in dealing with the lasting consequences.  He called attention to proposals to create a common international centre for Chernobyl problems that would pool efforts of scientists, and the creation of a planet protection fund financed from nuclear industry activities and used for helping mitigate the accident's consequences.

<P>
She opened by welcoming the conclusion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and urged all Member States to act in the interest of humanity. She mentioned that African leaders singed the Pelindaba Treaty establishing an African -Nuclear -Weapon-Free Zone and appealed to Nuclear Weapon States to sign and ratify the relevant portion of the Treaty. She also mentioned about other establishments of nuclear -weapon-free zone treaty
and expressed their hope that other regions would consider the creation of similar zones. She expressed their observation with gratification the entry into force of Nuclear Safety Convention and took note the level of co-operation toward the early conclusion of the Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. She also affirmed her country's continued support for Agency safeguards activities. She next mentioned about the positive developments in technology transfer of isotope hydrology, sea water desalination as well as continued assistance in the area of agriculture, nutrition, health and industry in her country and acknowledged the fruitful co-operation between her country and the International Atomic Energy Agency in this area. She mentioned that of their new Gamma Irradiation Facility and utilization of Sterile Insect Technique would make a significant impact on the food and agriculture sector with continuing assistance of the Agency. In the health sector in Ghana, she mentioned about the progress in the field of national health delivery system and the Agency's model project of network of brachtherapy, teletherapy and nuclear medicine service based on major centre in hospitals. She told that Ghana would like to register her sincere gratitude for the substantial assistance of the Agency, the Peoples Republic of China and United States of America in this model project. She said Ghana also appreciated the scholarship granted by the Department of Energy of the United States of America for the training of a doctor in radiation oncology. The first research reactor in Ghana has been in full operation since its installation and commissioning in March 1995. She told it was already making an impact in her mining industry in the area of neutron activation analysis and was also used extensively in the programme of the African Regional Co-operation Agreement (AFRA). She said the nuclear technique of non-destructive testing (NTD) was also being used to provide a wide range of services in industries in Ghana. She mentioned that Ghana joined the appeal for Members States to provide the support which will make resources available for the Agency to carry out its obligation. She concluded her speech to mention that Ghana would continue to support the International Atomic Energy Agency as it addressed its various responsibilities in the face of demands for growth and development, as well as international pressures for the observance and enforcement of global peace and security.

</A>
<P>
In endorsing the statement of Ireland on behalf of EU States, he said that he would focus his comments on subjects of particular interest to Poland, namely technical cooperation, the nuclear liability regime, safeguards, and illicit trafficking.  Concerning safeguards, he voiced his country's strong support for strengthening measures, and he declared Poland's readiness to offer its nuclear institutes for safeguards needs.  Technical cooperation activities have been beneficial to his country, he said, expressing Poland's high interest in continuing implementation of the model project for purification of flue gases, which he said would provide environmental improvements for his country and neighboring ones.  He endorsed measures taken to strengthen regional technical cooperation in Europe, noting that Poland hosted a meeting of 15 countries this year on the subject of nuclear safety and radiation protection.  He said his country's keen interest in countermeasures against illicit nuclear trafficking stands behind its strong support for IAEA initiatives in this area.  On nuclear liability issues, he said Poland is vitally interested in amending the supplementary funding convention and welcomes new adherents to the Vienna Convention, and he reiterated Poland's position on several related issues.  Regarding nuclear safety, he noted that although Poland has no nuclear power plants yet, it is surrounded by countries that do have them, and it has bilateral safety agreements with seven of its neighbor and recently signed an eighth with Slovakia.
<A NAME="paraguay">
<P>
<B><I>Paraguay, Mr. Cibar C&aacute;ceres-Aguilera, President, National Atomic Energy Commission:</I></B>
</A>
<P>
Mr. C&aacute;ceres opened by stating that his country is presently participating in various projects of technical co-operation in areas like nuclear medicine, radiopharmacy, animal husbandry, nuclear analytical techniques and waste management. In the area of radiological protection, he explained, Paraguay is participating in a project on the use of nuclear analytical techniques for the country's technical development. His country is also participating in projects to improve the reproductive capacity of dairy cattle and to diagnose animal diseases. A project on the application of isotopic techniques in the study of water sources has been planned for the following biennium. This year, Paraguay has had the honor to host the 13th Technical Co-ordination Meeting of ARCAL, which had the participation of 6 Member States, Agency representatives and donor countries. He went on to praise ARCAL as the best example of integration and co-operation among countries, and added that his country took part in the first meeting of presidents of nuclear bodies of Mercosur, which took place in Argentina; in his framework, a work group was created to study the technical and economic advantages of isotopic hydrology techniques in the use of hydrological resources to deal with the problem of the Pilcomayo River.

<A NAME="cuba">
<P>

<B><I>Cuba, Ms. Rosa Elena Simeon Negrin, Minister of Science, Technology, and Environment:</I></B></A>
<P>
She opened by referring to the Helms-Burton Law, which, she explained, explicitly opposes the conclusion of the Juragu 
nuclear plant and considers an act of agression the operation of any nuclear facility on Cuban territory, thus depriving 
Cuba from the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Referring to her country's nuclear programme, she explained 
that a centre for isotopes was established, which provides more than 17 types of radiopharmaceuticals and labeled compounds.
 She went on to say that the 16 research projects for the development of nuclear techniques are included in the 7 national 
programmes which deal with health, food production and other aspects of vital importance to Cuba. The programme of 
radiological protection and nuclear safety has been fostered by Cuba and it is still aiming to restart the construction 
of Juragu. Ms. Simen Negrn closed by underscoring ARCAL's work and welcoming the next meeting of national nuclear 
authorities in her country. After signing the Tlateloco Treaty and accepting the ammendments, Cuba continues to follow the 
necessary steps towards its ratification, she said.
<P>
<A NAME="iraq">
<B><I>Iraq, Mr. Humam A. Abdul Ghafour, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research:</I> </B></A> 
<P>
He opened by congratulating the President for his election as Chairman of this conference. He strongly criticized recent 
"aggression" against his country, which he said infringed upon the integrity and sovereignty of Iraq. In reference to 
Security Council resolutions, he expressed hope that the IAEA, being a specialized professional organization, will exercise 
its mandate according to Section C of Resolution 687 in a professional manner and without being subject to any political 
influence. He noted that the IAEA had conducted since Spring 1992 preliminary activities for on-going monitoring and 
verification, quoting excerpts from the IAEA's report to the Conference on this subject. He said that Iraq had implemented 
its part of the relevant Security Council resolutions and expressed regret that reciprocal action from the Security Council 
has not been carried out yet. He concluded by stressing that the IAEA and the Conference have a human responsibility 
towards the people Iraq who have contributed significantly to the world's development in many ways. He said that the Iraqi 
people should be freed from the sanctions to be able to play their active role in contributing to world civilization and 
fostering its noble values.
<P>
<A NAME="kenya">
<B><I>Kenya, Ms. Esther Mshai Tolle, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I> </B></A>
<P>
The delegate applauded both the recent adoption of the test ban treaty and the signing of the Pelindaba Treaty in which the African Nuclear Free Zone was established.  She reaffirmed Kenya's belief in regional agreements on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy as a means of reducing tension, sustaining socio-economic growth and promoting confidence.  She referred to present over-dependence on hydro and fossil fuels, and encouraged the IAEA to support development of research reactors in developing countries to enhance technology transfer.  The delegate welcomed implementation of Part 1 of the 93+2 Programme; referring to the enlargement of the Board of Governors (Article 6 of the Statute) now under discussion, she supported enlargement for broader representation, noting that Africa's representation on the Board has been marginalized.  She discussed the benefits to Kenya of IAEA regional courses, which have been held on agricultural and animal and human health, and  thanked the Agency for its technical support, which has resulted in the upgrading of the Nuclear Science Training Center to an Institute of Nuclear Science with capacity to host regional and international training activities.  She underscored Kenya's commitment to AFRA, and reported the visit of a multi-disciplinary IAEA mission, which resulted in identification of focus areas based on analysis of social and economic sectors where nuclear techniques could be applied.  The delegate stressed the importance of the draft Kenya Country Programme Framework document for future technology transfer activities, adding that many beneficial nuclear agricultural applications, as well as nuclear techniques for assessment of water resources, will be of particular benefit to Kenya.   She hailed the increased representation of developing countries on the professional staff of the IAEA, and urged that due consideration be given in particular to women candidates.  In closing, she hoped that more international IAEA meetings would be held in Africa, and congratulated the Director General and IAEA staff for their dedication.  
<P>
<A NAME="bolivia">
<B><I>Bolivia, Mr. Enrique Meyer Medina, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I> </B></A>
<P>
He said that Bolivia ratified a safeguards agreement in 1995 as a result of its adherence to NPT and Tlatelolco. He went on to say that there are countries which are skeptical about the use of nuclear technologies, and for this, these technologies get little recognition. Bolivia wants to contribute to the dissemination of the valuable achievements of such techniques and, to this effect, it has programmed, together with the Agency, to host a seminar on policy and use of nuclear energy. He explained that the Agency's Technical Co-operation Department fosters teamwork among developing countries; a recent example was the donation/contribution offered by Bolivia to the 
Argentine Nuclear Energy Commission of two radiotherapy units with a radiation source of 5000 curies of Cobalt-60 each of which will be used in radiotherapy centers in La Paz and Sucre.
<P>
<A NAME="emirates">
<B><I>United Arab Emirates, Mr Saeed Majid Al Shamsi, Under-Secretary, Ministry of Electricity and Water: </I> </B></A>
<P>
The delegate welcomed the Republic of Moldova as a new member of the IAEA.  He stressed that the importance of the Agency had increased considerably in the past few years, and that it was well on its way to achieving its objectives of putting nuclear technology at the service of humanity.  He went on to say that the UAE find the Agency a sound and balanced forum, and its work with the Agency in the framework of the technical co-operation programme fruitful.  The delegate referred to the scarcity of water in the UAE, and was pleased to report the success of desalination projects using nuclear energy.  He spoke optimistically of  recent developments in nuclear disarmament, in spite of certain imperfections, mentioning specifically the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone for Africa and the the adoption of the CTBT by the General Assembly.  The delegate continued by stating that the present situation in the Middle East was a source of concern to the entire world, particularly as Israel still refuses to join the NPT and to put its nuclear installations under IAEA safeguards.  He referred to the threat posed by Israel's nuclear arsenal, and to disquieting news about nuclear accidents caused by nuclear waste storage, which pose a threat to the entire region.  He exhorted the international community to spare no efforts in assuming responsibility to eradicate nuclear arms from the Middle East.  The delegate supported the enlargement of membership of the Board of Governors in order for it to reflect the political changes of this decade, which should be undertaken before the issue of regional groups is discussed, wherein elements other than geographical location should be taken into consideration.  He closed by wishing  the Agency success and hoping that it would achieve its noble objectives. 
<P>
<A NAME="nicaragua">
<B><I>Nicaragua, Mr. Xavier Arguello Hurtado, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I> </B></A>
<P>
He opened by enumerating the many areas in which his country benefits from the peaceful uses of atomic energy: a radiological centre, programmes to eradicate pests, the use of isotopes to determine the capacity of geothermal fields, etc. For these reasons, Nicaragua congratulates those countries which meet their financial obligations towards the Agency and above all, the donor countries. He said his country supports the model projects, geared to benefit broader popular sectors, and in this context, it supports ARCAL and the impulse that the Agency is giving to regional co-operation in different parts of the world. In the field of staff recruitment, he welcomed Secretariat efforts to 
recruit women, and added that although the net increase of women in the Secretariat has been practically non-existent, his country recognizes the sincere efforts towards meeting this goal. 
<P>
<A NAME="namibia">
<B><I>Namibia, Ms. Nora Schimming-Chase, Head of the Multilaterial Policy Co-ordination, Ministry of Foreign Affairs:</I> </B></A>
<P>
Namibia faces numerous develomental challenges: fostering growth; reducing poverty and inequality; developing human resources; and increasing earning opportunities. Ionizing radiation and radioisotopes are being used in many fields: mining and mineral processing, manufacuring, agriculture, hydrology and primary health care. IAEA tchnical cooperation is helping in many of these: radiation protection, diagnoses of animal disease, animal nutrition, radiotherapy, and establishing a uranium database. Progress is being made in combatting Bovine Pleuropneumonia, which affects the northern parts of the country. An urgently needed radiotherapy unit should be completed by the end of 1996. Radioisotopes can be applied to numerous other problems including fighting infectious and tropical diseases, and reducing malnutrition and micro-nutrient disorders. Namibia has already benefitted from IAEA assistance in the hydrology area, and further help could be provided in the realm of seaswater desalination.  
<P>
<A NAME="israel">
<B><I>Israel, Mr. Gideon Frank, Director General, Israel Atomic Energy Commission: </I></B></A>
<P>
He opened by congratulating the President for his election as by the Conference.  He said that the new government in Israel is committed to the peace process in the region. However, this commitment to peace is not shared by everyone, as there are attempts to impede the peace process by means of terror and to acquire weapons of mass destruction. He urged the international community to assist in the peace process rather than complicating it. He said that Israel had a positive approach to prevention of global proliferation. Although the CTBT does not address some of Israel's major concern, his country has joined its broad acceptance and approved it.  He urged all other countries to join the CTBT as well. He also called upon the participants of the ACRS to renew the efforts invested in this regional endeavour of confidence building and arms control and regional security. Israel supports in principle the strengthening of safeguards and in that respect the "93+2" programme is commendable. But the programme cannot offer any lasting guarantees without the necessary political will and a system of checks and balances. Israel also attaches great importance to combating illicit trafficking and supports the Agency's activities in this field. On matters of nuclear safety, he outlined measures that are taken by the environment ministry and the AEC to ensure high standards and practices at the Dimona and Soreq research centres.  He said a course on nuclear safety is being organized at Soreq, open to all regional participants. He said that Israel hopes that in the coming months its strife-torn region will move forward in the peace process and overcome old 
suspicions and hostility. He said that the IAEA and this General Conference can support this development by putting itself squarely behind the peace process. 
<P>
<A NAME="peru">
<B><I>Peru, Mr. Gilbert Chauny de Porturas-Hoyle, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B></A>
<P>
He enumerated his country's achievements through the peaceful uses of nuclear energy: the recent establishment of a multi-use irradiation facility, a tissue bank, an inventory of the groundwater of Peru's altiplano, the consolidation of the production plans for radioisotopes, production of improved varieties of barley, and recently the approval of a project geared towards solving contamination problems caused by mining and industry. He went on to thank the Agency for having chosen Peru as official headquarters for several international training events. He closed by underscoring the participation of his country in different activities carried out by  the ARCAL regional programme.
<P>
<A NAME="myanmar">
<B><I>Myanmar, Mr. U Tun Ngwe, Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the IAEA:</I></B></A>
<P>
Myanmar is very pleased with the establishment of the South East Asia Nuclear Weapons Free Zone and feels that world community will eventually reach a consensus on a total elimination of all nuclear weapons.  In this context, the country is very much encouraged by the adoption of the CTBT.  Speaking of the nuclear safety issue, Mr. Ngwe welcomed the pending entry into force of the Nuclear Safety Convention and said that his country was also carefully considering to become a party to the Convention.  The applications of radiation techniques to improve crop yields have benefited the country.  As in agriculture, nuclear techniques are also used for disease diagnosis in livestock breeding as well as to find means of improving breeding efficiency of cattle.  Myanmar is interested in nuclear techniques to explore and manage hydrological resources.  The country has made a good start to use nuclear methods for environmental monitoring.  Myanmar uses radiation for both diagnosis and treatment and in medical research.  Nuclear applications in industry are beginning to be explored.  The country is starting to study and discuss benefits of nuclear power in the long-run.  Speaking of the radiation protection infrastructure, Mr. Ngwe said that a domestic radiation protection law would be promulgated in the near future.  He expressed his sincere gratitude with the assistance from the IAEA and members of the IAEA in general and with the co-operation of RCA members in particular.  
<P>
<A NAME="zimbabwe">
<B><I>Zimbabwe, Ms. E Kawonza, Ambassador:</I></B></A>
<P>
The delegate noted with pleasure the commitment of the IAEA to promotion of nuclear energy applications in developing countries, particularly those in Africa, and thanked the Agency for its assistance in establishing a radiation 
protection and waste management infrastructure through its TA programme.  She noted that Zimbabwe anticipates future IAEA help in agriculture, human health, water resources and management, etc., through the Country Programme Framework presently being drawn up, and offered her thanks for Agency help in the specific field of rhizobium technology, going on to thank the IAEA for giving Zimbabwe a position of priority in the development process of regional projects.  She was pleased to announce Zimbabwe would soon accede to AFRA, and spoke with satisfaction of the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in Africa this year.  Although aware of slow or non-payment of contributions to the IAEA's technical fund by the majority of developing countries, she urged that this problem not be permitted to affect promotion of nuclear technology in these countries, going on to state that it would adversely affect the progress made by the Agency to date.  She proposed that other methods of recovery of technical fund arrears be explored.  In closing, the delegate suggested that debate on privatization of nuclear plants be discussed under the auspices of the Agency, and wished the conference success in its debates on future issues. 
<P>
<A NAME="libya">
<B><I>Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mr. Ali Mohamed Kashout, Director of Information and Planning Office, Nuclear Research Centre :</I></B></A>
<P>
He began by thanking the IAEA for its technical co-operation activities in transferring technology and providing experts for peaceful purposes which are of great economic benefit for Libya. He said that his country is moving along this path despite the difficulties it faces as a result of harsh economic measures imposed on it which have caused great disruption to its economic development. The process of technology transfer is subject to an unjust blockade imposed on the country leading to technological under-development in Libya. He urged the Agency to provide assistance to countries on which such economic measures have been imposed so that they can benefit from the use of peaceful uses of atomic energy. He said that Africa suffers from a shortage of water resources and nuclear technology is capable of detecting ground water resources and desalinating sea water. Libya considers it important to continue such projects in co-operation with the Agency. He welcomed IAEA's efforts to strengthen the safeguards system. It is important to get rid of all weapons of mass destruction in the world before beginning application of the proposed safeguards system. The Libyan delegation calls for the establishment of a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the Middle East. Such a zone in Africa should be used an example to expand the use the nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. He said that Libya also calls for the revision in the representation in the Board of Governors so that it truly represents all Member States of the IAEA.
<P>
<A NAME="srilanka">
<B><I>Sri Lanka, Mr. M. Prinath Dias, Chairman, National Atomic EnergyAuthority:</I></B></A>
<P>
He opened by commending the IAEA's pivotal role in contributing to the consensus achieved at the 1995 NPT review and extension conference, and by referring to the recent adoption of the nuclear test ban treaty (CBTB).  His country considers the CTBT a concrete measure to eliminate underground nuclear test explosions and a step forward in the disarmament process; Sri Lanka has offered to make available a seismic monitoring station for CTBT verification purposes, he noted, and it expected the IAEA to make an important contribution to the Treaty's multilateral verification system.  Addressing the issue of nuclear trafficking, he said that more needs to be done, despite achievements to date, in strengthening efforts against the problem.  Measures recently proposed by the G-7 countries against terrorist actions could be a good springboard for developing moreco-operation on this score, he said.  Reviewing his country's nuclear activities, he said that a new facility is being constructed for the Atomic Energy Authority, which has given itshighest priority to radiation protection programmes.  The development of an emergency response plan is in progress, and Sri Lanka will be able to conform to basic safety standards before the end of next year.  He reviewed progress in various fields--the country's tissue bank became operational last year andnow is providing tissues to national hospitals; nuclear imaging and radiotherapy facilities are being upgraded; the use of NDT in industry is expanding, as is the use of nuclear analytical techniques; and agricultural production is benefitting from nuclear applications in various ways.  The country does not consider nuclear power as a viable option right now, though itwould be interested in small and medium sized power reactors down the line.  He concluded by noting the progress being made through
the Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA) in areas of technical co-operation, saying that it would be completing 25 years of service next year.
<P>
<A NAME="kuwait">
<B><I>Kuwait, Mr Faisal Al-Ghais, Ambassador and Resident Representative to the IAEA:</I></B></A>
<P>
The delegate stressed the importance of the IAEA safeguards system and the need to stengthen it, referring specifically to Programme 93+2 as a cornerstone of the Agency's control task, particularly regarding coverage of undeclared nuclear facilities.  He hailed the adoption of the CTBT this month as well as the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones in Africa and Southeast Asia, expressing his hope that Middle East would soon follow suit yet expressing dismay that Israel still refused to join the NPT.  He went on to deplore Iraq's persistence in belittling resolutions of the Security Council and the IAEA General Conference. As Iraq is still obstructing the work of inspection teams, the delegate found the prolongation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council to be proof of the threat posed by the regime to security in the region.  The delegate urged the Agency to keep the Iraqi nuclear file open and to  verify and monitor all import-export activities in Iraq closely.  He 
noted the close interaction between the Security Council and the IAEA in the cases of Iraq and the DPRK, and strongly supported efforts to prevent  further violation of SC resolution 688.  He suggested that the issue of modification of geographic zones be postponed until after the amendment of Article 6 of the Statute, and closed by  calling on the Agency to give fair opportunities to all countries with regard to its employment policy.

<P>
<B><I>Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Alija Lekic, Chairman of the Committee 
for Atomic Energy of Bosnia and Herzegovina:</B></I></A>
<P>
Emphasising that Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly supported and firmly 
adhered to the NPT, he requested that the IAEA's access to relevant information 
and sites be broader in the field of safeguards and that full support be given to the 
IAEA's activities in combating the problem of illegal trafficking of nuclear 
materials.  His country has asked for the support of the IAEA in several projects 
connected with the use of nuclear energy in the fields of health, environment 
protection, industry and education.  Due to the aggression and destruction, a 
number of sealed radiation sources were destroyed, some have disappeared.  
Therefore, the activities of reviewing and updating the registry of radiation 
sources are one of the highest priorities.  The re-establishment of nuclear 
medicine for nuclear-diagnostic services and upgrading of radiotherapy services 
are required.  Renewal and expansion of the application of isotopes in industrial 
non-destructive testing will be of importance in the country.  He appreciated the 
decision of the IAEA to send a fact-finding mission to Sarajevo and efforts of the 
mission.  He expressed the hope that the recommendations of the missions would 
be accepted and that the realization of the projects for the technical co-operation 
programme and technical assistance would start as soon as possible.  He also 
expressed the hope that his country would be included in some of regional 
projects connected with radiation monitoring and protection as well as human 
resource development.  The country has founded the Committee for Atomic 
Energy to co-ordinate all the activities in this field.  
<P>
<A NAME="greece">
<B><I>Greece, John A. Yennimatas, Ambassador and Resident Representative 
to the IAEA:</B></I></A>
<P>
The ambassador associated himself with the EU statement. Greece was among 
the first countries to adhere to the NPT, and the IAEA has largely met the 
expectations created by the Treaty over the past two decades. Greece supports all 
efforts to strengthen IAEA safeguards and looks forward to the implementation of 
Part 2 of the 93+2 Programme in the near future. The strengthened system should 
be able to identify precursor and research activities that would be indicative of a 
nuclear weapons programme. Greece strongly favours an end to all nuclear 
testing. Measures should also be taken to curb the spread of ballistic missile 
technology. Regional non-proliferation and safeguards arrangments are most  
needed in the Middle East Region, and 
the IAEA is urged to continue its efforts in this area. Efficient export controls 
serve to bolster the IAEA safeguards system, and Member States are urged to 
adopt systems that assist international non-proliferation efforts. With regard to 
waste management, from a legal standpoint Greece views spent fuel as waste, 
unless or until it has reached the door of a reprocessing facility. It also believes 
that a simple revision of the Vienna Convention is not sufficient to cover nuclear 
liability questions.  Greece appreciates the assistance provided by the technical 
co-operation department, though it is low compared to countries at a similar level 
of nuclear development.  Greece is practically a donor country given the great 
number of scientists trained in Greek establishments. IAEA verification functions 
will continue to expand and some administrative and structural arrangements will 
be required to meet the challenges. Greece notes that recruitment of professional 
staff from Greece and other Western European countries has fallen. It approves 
the Annual Report and Programme and Budget for 1997 and 1998 and hopes that 
zero real growth will not sacrifice the new and enlarged Agency tasks in 
safeguards, safety and waste management.  
<P>
<A NAME="saudi">
<B><I>Saudi Arabia, Mr. Saleh Abdulrahman AL-Athel, President, King 
Abdulazia City for Science and Technology, Riyadh :</B></I></A>
<P>
He opened by emphasizing the principle role of the Agency in developing the use 
of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The Agency's technical co-operation 
programme is of great relevance to developing countries. However, its financing  
has not reached acceptable levels. He urged Member States to contribute fully to 
the budget.  In the light of the problem of finances of the Agency, the expansion 
of the Safeguards programme is not appropriate. Furthermore the Agency 
should be committed to the real zero growth in its budget.  He said that his 
country welcomes the NPT, however it feels that the NPT should not infringe on 
the rights of the Member States to produce nuclear energy for use in peaceful 
purposes. Saudi Arabia feels that there should be a confidence building process 
in the Middle East in order to achieve peace and maintain security.  He 
concluded by stating the position of his delegation supporting the expansion of 
the Board of Governors for more adequate representation of countries of the 
Middle East and Southeast Asia, which are the least represented areas on the 
Board despite their geographical importance and population size. 
<P>
<A NAME="romania">
<B><I>Romania, Mr. Doru Dumitru Palade, Minister of Research and 
Technology: </B></I></A>
<P>
The delegate greeted Moldova as a new member of the IAEA and wished it 
success in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy.  He associated himself with the 
declaration made by the Representative of Ireland on behalf of the EU, and 
informed the assembly that Romania had joined the group of industrial scale 
producers of nuclear energy in April of this year, when the first unit of the 
Cernavoda nuclear plant went into operation.  He was pleased to note that 
successful co-operation with prestigious international companies and IAEA 
support had helped make this significant contribution to the solution of 
Romania's energy problems possible.  The delegate hoped that the Agency would 
again offer its support towards the development of the second unit, to assume 
operation before 2000.  He went on to state the objectives of the Romanian 
National Atomic Energy Agency, and  expressed his hope that the IAEA's 
technical co-operation programmes in Romania, which had proved so successful 
in recent years, could be expanded in 1997, and emphasized Romania's readiness 
to contribute its own expert potential to the programme.  He reiterated 
Romania's commitment to the NPT and the IAEA's 93+2 programme, 
mentioning that Romania was already issuing multiple visas to IAEA inspectors 
in order to facilitate access to nuclear installations, and went on to express his 
support of other initiatives, in particular the NPT, hoping that further 
developments would follow in the near future.  The delegate urged the 
finalization of the amendment to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damages and the expansion of international co-operation in the fight 
against illegal trafficking in nuclear materials.  He closed by expressing the 
support of his delegation for the programmes and activities of the Agency.  
<P>   
<A NAME="bangladesh">

<B><I>Bangladesh, Mr. M Fazulur Rahman, Secretary, Ministry of Science and 
Technology: </B></I> </A>                                            
<P>
Mr. Rahman opened his speech by mentioning Bangladesh's commitment to 
promoting the use of nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes. He stated that 
his country strongly urges the Agency to actively come forward in promoting 
nuclear power programmes in developing countries and that the IAEA could 
initiate comprehensive efforts to globally promote the viability of nuclear power, 
especially in the developing countries having constraints on energy resource. He 
said that his country deeply appreciated recent IAEA efforts on application of 
tracer and other nuclear techniques for assessing ground water reserves and 
monitoring water quality and content in soil in a reliable and non-destructive 
way.  He further noted that Bangladesh was proud of be among the first 25 states 
that have ratified, accepted or approved the Convention on Nuclear Safety. He 
would like to record Bangladesh's sincere appreciation for the assistance being 
provided by the IAEA in various R & D programmes on peaceful uses of atomic 
energy including application of non-destructive testing techniques, health care 
services through the nuclear medicine centres and the Institute of Nuclear 
Medicine, sterilization of medical supplies, elemental analyses, maintenance of 
in-house electronic equipment, environmental monitoring, other health physics 
services and food preservation. He also said that the technical assistance 
programme of the IAEA in Bangladesh has always been very important and the 
support received from the IAEA over the years, such as the irradiator plant, was 
testimony to the mutual trust that exists between his country and the Agency. 
Mr. Rahman mentioned that Bangladesh is actively involved in various projects 
of RCA and strongly felt that RCA activities should not only continued, but that 
these activities should be enlarged and strengthened further. He added that co-
operation 
between Bangladesh and the Agency was also reflected in the modest 
contribution of Bangladesh through the provision of experts and training 
facilities. 
<P>                                                                                                                    
<A NAME="estonia">

<B><I>Estonia, Mr. Arvo Niitenberg, Ambassador and Resident Representative 
to the IAEA: </B></I></A>
<P>
Estonia expressed its satisfaction with the broad adherence to the CTBT, but its 
dissatisfaction with failure to reach consensus at the Conference on 
Disarmament. Estonia, an associated member of the European Union, shared the 
views in the Statement of Ireland on behalf of the EU.  Mr. Niitenberg referred 
to Estonia's problems: military nuclear facilities inherited from the past; 
inadequate storage and missing final disposal facilities of radioactive waste; and 
mining and processing tailings of uranium ore and resulting contamination.  In 
this context, he appreciated the assistance programmes of the IAEA to Central 
and East European States.  Speaking of illegal trafficking of radioactive and 
nuclear materials, he said that Estonia had upgraded its border and customs 
controls, and that international co-operation was essential in this field.  He 
expressed the hope that the conclusion of the drafting process of the Convention 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management would not be delayed.  He 
reported that Baltic Sea nations have concentrated their effort on the 
environmental safety problems of nuclear plants in operation.  Estonia fully 
supports the 93+2 Programme and is ready to work for implementation of Part I 
and Part II of the programme.  
<P>
<A NAME="guatemala">

							
<B><I>Guatemala, Mr. Mario Juarez Toledo, Ambassador and 
Resident Representative to the IAEA:</B></I></A>
<P>
Mr. Jurez Toledo enumerated some of the many ways in which nuclear 
applications have fostered development in his country. He started by underscoring 
the achievements in the field of health: diagnostic imaging and the development of 
endocrinology using radioimmunoanalysis has enabled the nuclear medicine unit of 
 General San juan de Dios Hospital to implement scintillography, which 
Guatemalan physicians have used diagnostic imaging in various clinical studies, 
thus ensuring the effectiveness of therapy. In the agricultural sector, he continued, 
varieties of improved plants have been developed through the use of biotechnology 
and induced mutation. Agricultural research in crops such as beans have resulted in 
the commercialization of a product which is essential to the basic diet of 
Guatemalans, and in new varieties of wheat that are more  resistant to the effects of 
wind, thus yielding more crop productivity. Concerning development in the 
industrial sector, he underscored the nuclear analytical laboratory, the laboratory 
for non-destructive testing and the gamma spectrometry laboratory. In the field of 
the environment, the utilization of conventional chemical techniques and 
radiotracers have made it possible to study contamination in some bodies of water 
of the country. He closed by describing the developments in the areas of radiological 
protection, storage and management of radioactive waste, and licensing of 
radiodiagnostic facilities.
<P>
<A NAME="uruguay">
									
<B><I>Uruguay, Mr. Walter Cibils, Director of National Nuclear 
Technology:</B></I></A>
<P>
He opened by reaffirming Uruguay's position on measures to strengthen safeguards 
and expressing satisfaction over the conclusion of the test ban treaty and the 
location of the CTBTO in Vienna.  He said that his delegation supports the 
amendment of Article VI of the Statute and will endorse every solution that will not 
entitle a loss in the representation of developing countries, particularly of Latin 
America.  He went on to praise ARCAL and to thank foreign enterprises and 
agencies such as ENRESA in Spain and France's Nuclear Energy Commission for 
their support. He closed by saying that Uruguayan technicians are recognized at the 
regional and international level and that their spirit is to collaborate so that nuclear 
technology can increase its benefits to achieve the welfare of society.  He sited 
several initiatives in his country in areas of radiation protection and radioactive 
waste management, which he said are important matters of public opinion.
<P>
<A NAME="luxembourg">
<B><I>Luxembourg, Mr. Georges Santer, Ambassador and Resident 
Representative to the IAEA:</B></I></A>
<P>
The delegate associated himself with the declaration given by the representative of 
Ireland on behalf of the European Union and associated countries.  He emphasized 
the importance attached by Luxembourg, which has no nuclear installations itself 
but is in close proximity to an installation in a neighbour state, to the work of the 
Agency on nuclear safety and security and on civil liability in the case of a nuclear 
accident.  Luxembourg took part in elaborating the Convention on Nuclear Safety, 
and particularly supports periodic examinations of national reports on nuclear 
plants safety as set down in the Convention; the preparatory meeting to take place 
in the next months will establish the modalities of examination, and it is of 
importance to Luxembourg that its experts have a right of choice in examining 
reports from within the region.  The delegate went on to note problems still to be 
addressed within the framework of the amendment of the Vienna Convention and 
the Complementary Financing Convention, referring specifically to the necessity of 
establishing a single definition of nuclear damages for both legal documents, and 
trusting that common sense would prevail.  In closing, he made special mention of 
the Agency's 93+2 Programme, calling upon all States, in particular nuclear weapon 
States, to participate in the second part of the Programme, and noting that 
Luxembourg had already effected legislation on control of nuclear materials.  
<P>
<A NAME="albania">
<B><I>Albania, Mr. Zef Mazi, Ambassador and Resedent Representative to the 
IAEA:</B></I></A>
<P>
Albania has had a fruitful relationship with the Agency over the past twenty years.  
Applications of nuclear science and technology now include hydro and mineral 
resources, nuclear medicine, radiopharmaceuticals, environmental 
monitoring and many other areas. Albania helped to pioneer the model project 
concept through successful work toward strengthening its radiation protection 
infrastructure. The Agency's work promoting regional co-operation is very much 
appreciated. Albania is grateful for IAEA help in technology transfer, information 
and training of specialists and is convinced that the Agency is making an enormous 
contribution to peaceful uses of the atom. The composition of the Board should be 
changed to genuinely reflect the Agency's membership. Albania has been unable to 
sign many of the conventions related to the nuclear field simply because of changes 
and elaboration of domestic legislation. The country remains in arrears to the 
IAEA, but has taken concrete steps to pay part of it, and will continue to do so. 
<P>
<A NAME="portugal">
<B><I>Portugal, Mr. Alvaro de Mendonca e Moura, Ambassador and Resident 
Representative to the IAEA:</B></I></A>
<P>
The delegate expressed his support of the statement made by the Irish delegate on 
behalf of the EU.  He was pleased to note the indefinite extension of the NPT and the 
establishment of nuclear weapon free zones in Southeast Asia and Africa.  He also 
referred with satisfaction to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, hailing it as an 
important step towards nuclear safety worldwide, and hoped that it would soon be 
followed by other international documents, e.g. the Convention on Safety of 
Radioactive Waste, towards which steady progress is being made.  He expressed 
thanks for IAEA assistance in the field of peaceful applications of nuclear energy, in 
particular to SAGTAC, urging, however, that pre-evaluation project criteria be 
clearly stated in order to maintain a balanced equilibrium between the needs of 
recipient countries and IAEA programme activity priorities.  The delegate 
mentioned the success of the sterile insect technique, successfully used on the 
Mediterranean fruit fly in Madeira, and thanked the Agency for its support in this 
project.  He announced with pleasure that Portugal will host two specialists 
meetings within the framework of the IAEA and FAO, thereby expressing its 
particular support of their programmes.  In closing, he addressed the problem of 
water  scarcity with which the world is being confronted, and hoped for the success 
of the Agency's work in water resources management.

<P>
Secretary of Energy of the United States, Hazel R. O'Leary, Minister of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, Viktor Mikhailov, and Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Hans Blix, met in Vienna on 17 September 1996 to consider practical measures to fulfill statements by the President of the United States of September 1993 and the President of the Russian Federation of April 1996 concerning the application of IAEA verification of weapon origin fissile materials.  The participants noted the importance of these commitments of the U.S. and Russia as a significant contribution to the fulfilment of the Principles and Objectives agreed upon at the 1995 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review and Extension Conference.  Further, the Ministers noted that this endeavour is parallel to, and complementary to, the commitments made by Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin in September 1994 and May 1995 regarding the transparency and irreversibility of nuclear arms reductions.  Specifically, in this meeting:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- The Ministers of the United States and the Russian Federation agreed to discuss technical methods designed to protect sensitive nuclear weapons information and to prevent its disclosure, and to hold appropriate consultations with the IAEA on this matter. It was agreed that it was essential to ensure that IAEA verification of relevant fissile materials would not undermine the obligations of the United States and the Russian Federation under Article I of the NPT.
<P>
<DD>- It was agreed that, to address the various technical, legal, and financial issues associated with implementing IAEA verification of relevant fissile materials, a joint group should be formed and shall report on progress in addressing these issues within nine months.
<P>
<DD>- All parties agreed that within six weeks of this meeting a trilateral visit to the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site and Hanford Site will occur to examine how the IAEA safeguards have been implemented at plutonium facilities under the existing U.S. Voluntary Offer.  The trip will also include a visit to Argonne National Laboratory - West for a demonstration of remote monitoring technology.

<H2>States Adopt Resolutions to Strengthen International Safeguards
 and Global Nuclear Co-operation </H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
States meeting at the IAEA General Conference have adopted resolutions to strengthen international safeguards and global 
co-operation in areas of nuclear safety and technical assistance.  Other adopted resolutions include those related to 
nuclear inspections in Iraq; safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK); safeguards in the Middle East; 
and illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.  The Conference -- which concluded late today in Vienna, Austria -- is being 
attended by Ministers and high-level governmental delegates from the IAEA's 124 Member States.
<P>
Highlights of adopted resolutions follow.  <B><I>(Editor's note: The full texts, as well as related Conference documents 
and reports, are available on-line through the IAEA's World Atom Internet services at <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/">http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40</A>).</B></I>
<P>
<B>Strengthening the IAEA's Safeguards System</B>.  Convinced that IAEA safeguards can promote greater confidence among States and 
contribute to greater collective security, the Conference called upon the Agency to continue its implementation of 
previously approved ("Part 1") measures to strengthen the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of its safeguards system, and 
it urged the States concerned to facilitate the process.  It further welcomed the IAEA Board of Governors' work begun in 
July 1996 to draft a model protocol to reinforce and improve the Agency's capacity to detect any undeclared nuclear 
activities.
<P>
<B>Strengthening IAEA Technical Co-operation Activities</B>.  Citing nuclear energy's existing and potential social, economic, and 
environmental benefits in many fields, the Conference requested the Agency to strengthen its technical co-operation 
activities through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the scientific and technological capabilities 
of developing countries in peaceful uses of nuclear energy for electricity production and other applications,  and at 
achieving sustainable development.  
<P>
<B>Nuclear Inspections in Iraq</B>.  Reaffirming the need for full implementation by Iraq of Security Council resolutions 687, 707, and 715,
the Conference demanded that Iraq hand over to the IAEA's Action Team without further delay any currently undisclosed nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material, and information. It 
further demanded that Iraq allow the Action Team immediate, unconditional and unrestricted rights of access in accordance 
with Security Council resolution 707.  It stressed that the Agency's Action Team will continue to exercise its right to 
investigate further any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in particular as regards any further relevant 
information that Iraq may still be withholding from the Agency.
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the DPRK</B>. The Conference expressed its concern over the DPRK's continuing non-compliance with its IAEA 
safeguards agreement, and noted with regret the limited progress from IAEA-DPRK discussions of outstanding safeguards 
issues. It called upon the DPRK to comply fully with the safeguards agreement and to take all steps the Agency may deem 
necessary to preserve all information relevant to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report 
on the inventory of nuclear material subject to safeguards until the DPRK comes into full compliance with the agreement. 
The Conference further commended the Agency for its efforts to monitor the freeze of specified facilities in the DPRK as 
requested by the United Nations Security Council.
<P>
<B>Safeguards in the Middle East</B>.  The Conference requested the Agency's Director General to continue consultations with the 
States in the Middle East to facilitate the early application of full-scope IAEA safeguards to all nuclear activities in 
the region as relevant to the preparation of model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) in the region. 
<P>
<B>African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (NWFZ)</B>.  The Conference commended the African States for their concerted efforts on 
the establishment of an African NWFZ, and requested the IAEA Director General to continue to assist them in this regard.  
It  urged African States  to make every effort to ratify the Treaty so that it can enter into force without delay, and 
reaffirmed its convction that the establishment of other NWFZs, especially in the Middle East, would enhance the security 
of Africa and viability of the African NWFZ.
<P>
<B>Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear Materials</B>. Noting the programme for preventing and combatting illicit trafficking agreed 
upon at the Moscow Nuclear Summit in April 1996, the Conference welcomed the IAEA's activities in support of efforts 
against illicit trafficking, and invited the Agency to continue working in accordance with relevant conclusions of its 
Board of Governors.
<P>
<B>Nuclear, Radiation, and Waste Safety</B>.  The Conference adopted several resolutions.  One resolution, on the establishment 
of waste demonstration centres, invites the Agency to assist interested Member States in expanding the use of suitable 
existing training centres for practical training and demonstration of techniques for the processing and storage of 
radioactive waste from the application of nuclear techniques in medicine, research, and industry, so that a demonstration 
and training facility would be available in respective regions through greater co-operation and co-ordination of 
resources, including those available in developing countries. A second resolution, on the Convention on Nuclear Safety, 
welcomed the fact that it will enter into force on 24 October 1996,  and expressed satisfaction that the Agency will 
convene a preparatory meeting of Contracting Parties no later than April 1997 on the Convention's implementation.  
A third resolution, on the safety of radioactive waste management, expressed appreciation for work done so far by the 
Open-ended Group of Legal and Technical Experts to draft a Convention on the subject, and hoped that progress at the 
Group's next meeting, to be hosted by South Africa, will allow timely completion of the preparatory work and adoption 
of a convention in the near future.
<P>
<B>Plan for Producing Potable Water Economically</B>.  Emphasizing the need to solve water shortages in many countries and 
noting the World Bank's call to hold a world water conference  in 1997, the Conference welcomed the Agency's work in 
this field to date, and requested the Director General to assign appropriate priority to the nuclear desalination of 
seawater in preparing the Agency's programme and budget, and invited him to establish an advisory body on nuclear 
desalination to take appropriate measures to assist Member States in the process of preparatory actions for demonstration 
projects.
<P>
<B>Isotope Hydrology for Water Resources Management</B>.  The Conference requested the Agency to identify and upgrade 
selected isotope hydrology laboratories in Member States so as to provide easy regional  access to analytical facilities 
for field hydrologists.  It further requested the Agency to work with other United Nations agencies to encourage the 
introduction of isotope hydrology and isotope geochemistry in university courses in Member States so as to provide a 
stronger foundation for future growth in the area of water resources management. 
<P>
<B>IAEA Budget for 1997 and Target for Technical Co-operation Fund</B>.  The budget resolution approved expenditures in 
1997 of $222 million (at an exchange rate of 12.7 Austrian schillings to the US dollar).  The Conference further approved 
the target amount of US $68 million for voluntary contributions to the Agency's Technical Co-operation Fund in 1997.
<P>
<B>Staffing of the IAEA Secretariat</B>.  Two resolutions were adopted.  One requests the Agency to intensify its efforts 
to increase the number of staff members from developing countries, particularly at senior and policy-making levels, 
as well as from Member States that are not represented or are under-represented in the Secretariat.  The second resolution 
requests the Agency to pursue a target of equal representation of women at all levels of Agency employment, and it called 
upon the Director General to further integrate the Platform for Action developed at the United Nations Fourth World 
Conference on Women into the Agency's relevant policies and programmes.
<P>
<B>Representation on the IAEA Board</B>. In a resolution pertaining to Article 6 of the IAEA Statute, the Conference 
recognized there is a widely held view among Member States on the need to expand the size and composition of the Agency's 
Board of Governors, and it requested the Board to develop a process of negotiations and to submit its report on a finalized 
formula for approval by the General Conference at its 41st regular session next year.

<OL>
<B>I.  Introduction</B>
<P>
<LI>The thirty-ninth regular session of the General Conference in
1995 adopted resolution <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r16.html
">
GC(39)/RES/16</A> which, inter alia, requested "the Director
General
to continue to integrate the
available expertise and resources of the Agency and Member States
and to direct them towards concrete programmes for producing a
visible impact by
improving the quality and availability of water". It also
requested the Agency to continue
to explore the possibility of further collaboration with other
concerned international
organizations and to solicit their technical and financial
co-operation. 
<P>
<LI>Document GOV/2805-GC(39)/2, submitted by the Secretariat to
the Board of
Governors and the General Conference in 1995, contained
background information on the
initiatives to enhance the impact of isotope applications in
water resources development and
management, along with specific tasks on the measures envisaged
to provide more effective
end-user benefits in socio-economic development of Member States
through Technical
Cooperation projects.   
<P>
<LI>The present document provides, as requested by resolution
GC(39)/RES/16, an
overview of the progress achieved and new endeavours since the
last General Conference,
and illustrates some of the results obtained during this period.
It is being issued for the
attention of both the Board of Governors and the General
Conference.
<P>
<B>II.    Programme overview and expected impact for improved
water resources
management through isotope techniques</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency's 1995/96 programme in development of water
resources involves 71
national TC projects being implemented in 56 Member Countries,
and 4 regional TC projects
(1 in Africa, 2 in West Asia and 1 in Latin America).  Among
these, two national projects
and
one regional project were designed within the "Model Project"
concept, and their scope and
work plan emphasize applications to selected systems of immediate
practical importance for
the
countries involved to arrive at improved management of water
resources. These model
projects
are:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     Model Project Regional Africa (RAF/8/022) - "Use of
Isotopes in Water
          Resources Development"
<P>
<DD>-     Model Project in El Salvador (ELS/8/005) - "Isotope
Hydrology and
          Geochemistry in Geothermal Fields"
<P>
<DD>-     Model Project in Venezuela (VEN/8/010) - "Groundwater
Hydrology of the
          Caracas Aquifer".
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The other national TC projects are also concerned with
specific issues of water
resources
development and management, including the protection of water
resources and strengthening
national capabilities for isotope applications in the water
sector. These projects involve
isotope
applications in different aspects of  groundwater resources,
surface waters, geothermal
resources
and soil erosion in catchment basins with resulting sedimentation
problems in reservoirs. Of
these, 32 TC projects were successfully completed during 1995
with their initial objectives
fully
achieved. Summary information on the progress of implementation
of the above model
projects
and specific achievements in TC project implementation is
provided in the latter sections of
this
document. 
<P>
<LI>The main component dealing with further refinement and
improvement of isotope
methods within the programme is the implementation of coordinated
research programmes
(CRPs) in specific application areas.  The programme includes
CRPs designed on the basis of
the need for further research and development assessed through
specific Consultants' and
Advisory Group meetings and the findings and recommendations of
the external review of the
whole programme on development of water resources, carried out
during 1995. Some of the
coordinated research programmes are related to applied field
research which is expected to
provide site-specific information for improved
assessment/management of water resources, as
well as refinement and improvement of isotope techniques.  Thus,
the CRPs will directly
contribute to more effective implementation of the respective TC
programme in this field.  
<P>
<LI>Two coordinated research programmes have been concluded
during 1995, and two
new
CRPs in the water sector were initiated at the beginning of 1996.

These new CRPs are:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     CRP on "Use of isotopes for flow and transport
dynamics", which aims at the
use
          of isotopes for verification of dynamics of flow and
pollutant transport in
          groundwater through use of modern numerical flow
modelling procedures and
          calibrated models with the aid of isotopes,  will
enable a decision-support system
          for pollution control management. 12 institutions are
taking part in the CRP.   
<P>
<DD>-     CRP on "Groundwater renewal in water scarce regions",
which aims at an
          improved and reliable estimate of the replenishment
rates of groundwater
          resources, through the use of isotopes in the
unsaturated zone of selected sites in
          arid regions. These estimates will provide the basis
for sustainable extraction
          amounts from groundwater without causing "mining" of
the source and excessive
          decline of the groundwater table, which is presently a
common problem in most
          of the water-scarce regions. The results of the
programme are envisaged to be
          compiled in a publication for wide-scale distribution
to all Member countries in
          the arid zones. A special training workshop, with the
participation of all the
          institutions to be involved in the CRP, was held in
Wallingford, UK, in
          December 1995. All the procedures of soil coring in the
unsaturated zone,
          required equipment for this purpose, laboratory
procedures for extraction of soil
          moisture for subsequent analyses, and other relevant
technical issues were
          discussed and standardized to ensure consistent and
reliable results from the CRP. 
          14 institutions representing all major arid zones in
the Middle East, Africa and
          Latin America are taking part in the implementation of
the CRP.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Along with ongoing programmes previously initiated, a total
of six  CRPs directly
related
to improved management of water resources, are presently
operational.  Their main themes
and
their relation to the four projects of the Agency's sub-programme
on Water Resources
Development, the sectoral distribution of the ongoing TC
programmes in water resources,
and
links between  the CRPs and the TC programme, are listed in the
Annex to  this document.
<P>
<B>III.   Highlights of progress and achievements to date</B>
<P>
<I>(i)    Model Project Regional Africa - RAF/8/022</I>
<P>
<LI>Considerable progress was achieved in implementing phase I
(1995 and 1996) of this
model project, in which four countries are currently
participating, namely Egypt, Ethiopia,
Morocco and Senegal. Among the major activities carried out in
1995, field investigations
including two sampling campaigns for the collection of water
samples for isotope and
chemical
analyses were carried out in all four countries, in most cases
with the involvement of IAEA
regional field experts. The samples collected from the
investigation areas for analyses of
different isotopic species are being measured by specialized
laboratories in France, India,
South
Africa and the United Kingdom, and by the Agency's Isotope
Hydrology Laboratory. The
major
part of the equipment requested by the counterparts has been
supplied, and expert services
have
been provided as planned. To strengthen the capability of
counterpart institutions with regard
to
hydrochemical analyses to be carried out locally, a regional
training course on analytical
techniques for water chemistry was organized by the Agency and
held in Senegal in August
1995. The course was attended by 12 participants from Egypt,
Ethiopia, Morocco and
Senegal.
The training provided and the laboratory intercomparison carried
out in conjunction with the
course will have a significant impact on the improvement of the
work performance of the
laboratories and the accuracy of the hydrochemical results to be
used within the framework of
the project.
<P>
<LI>The second coordination meeting of the project was held in
March 1996 in Cairo and
showed, among other things, that the isotope and geochemical data
gathered so far in all four
countries has proved relevant to water resources management in
the regions under
investigation.
For example, isotope data from Morocco indicates a prevalence of
palaeowater in one of the
study areas, disproving the existence of recent  replenishment of
the groundwater system.
This
information is useful in the management of resources, in
particular with respect to preventing
over-exploitation of a given aquifer system. Achievements were
also made in Egypt in
investigating, among other things, the interaction between
groundwater in the Nile aquifer
system and that in the adjacent Nubian sandstone deep aquifer.
This problem is relevant to
securing sustainable water supply for newly reclaimed land on the
fringes of the Nile flood
plain. Distinct isotopic signatures of the two aquifers have been
found which, after further
enhancement of the database in the current study, including
isotope-based hydrogeological
modelling, will enable an estimation of the recharge sources of
the aquifers under exploitation
and, consequently, ensure sustainability of the resources, both
in quantity and quality. In the
Moyale investigation area of Ethiopia, where a large proportion
of the human population of 3
million and one of the largest concentrations of cattle on the
African continent are entirely
dependent on groundwater, the first isotope results indicate the
potential of isotope techniques
to
tackle such important questions as (i) recharge conditions in the
sedimentary and fractured
rock
aquifers and (ii) continuity and discontinuity of groundwater in
the sedimentary aquifer
systems
under investigation. For example, the groundwater samples so far
collected show distinct
variations in the concentrations of the environmental isotope
tritium, and this makes it
possible
to distinguish between renewable and non-renewable resources and
thus to estimate the
potential
of the resources for the water supply in the area. Finally, in
Senegal, a considerable amount
of
isotope and geochemical data has been gathered through field and
laboratory activities. In
accordance with the project's work plan, modelling approaches
based on this isotope data and
complementary hydrogeological information will be initiated in
April 1996 to re-assess the
groundwater resources around Dakar.  The areas of active recharge
with the potential of
sustainable extraction of water delineated by isotope results
will be used as sites for future
drilling of extraction wells within the scope of a World Bank
financed development scheme
for
Dakar.
<P>
<I>(ii)   Model Project in Venezuela (VEN/8/010) - "Groundwater
Hydrology of the
          Caracas Aquifer"</I>
<P>
<LI>The water supply in the city of Caracas is progressively
decreasing, particularly
during
the dry season due to the adverse climatic conditions during the
last years, the dependency on
water derived from reservoirs of limited capacity, and the steady
increase in population. 
Restricting the water supply to several districts is a common
measure taken by the authorities
every year to preserve water for the long dry season.  To reduce
the dependency on surface
water resources, the exploitation of the Caracas aquifer is the
main alternative.  For the
proper
management of this resource, a comprehensive knowledge of the
aquifer's properties and
groundwater dynamics is essential.  The ongoing project is
focused on providing key
information for the rational exploitation of the aquifer based on
the availability and quality of
groundwater.
<P>
<LI>Hydrogeological, chemical and isotopic data has been used to
identify and characterize
the sources of recharge to the different sectors of  the Caracas
aquifer.  The results obtained
so
far indicate that the shallower part of the aquifer (down to a
depth of 50 m) is characterized
by
rapid groundwater renewal, where water from different sources is
found (including leakage
from
the drinking water distribution system), and the most serious
pollution problems have been
identified.  At greater depths, the so-called  passive zone  is
found, which is characterized by
slower groundwater dynamics and better water quality.  Through
exploitation of selected
wells
(extracting water from specific depths) it will be possible to
provide additional drinking water
to
the existing distribution system.
<P>
<LI>Based on the information contained in this study, which has
been provided to the local
authorities responsible for water resources management, the
location and design of new wells
has been proposed. During the last months of 1994, fifteen wells
were drilled, and another
fifty
will be  drilled during 1996.  It is expected that these wells
will contribute to reducing the
present water restrictions (up to 12 hours a day in some
districts), providing more than
112,000
m<SUP>3</SUP>  per day  (around 43% of the existing water
deficit). Therefore, these
wells,  together with
other measures to reduce waste of water and leakage to
groundwater, will improve the
availability of water to the population, especially in some
marginal areas of the city where
water
is still distributed with trucks.  The laboratory in charge of
controlling the quality of
groundwater pumped from the Caracas aquifer is also being
upgraded with the Agency's
assistance in order to be able to measure additional physical and
chemical parameters, and to
guarantee that existing quality criteria for drinking water are
met.
<P>
<I>(iii)  Model Project in El Salvador (ELS/8/005) - "Isotope
Hydrology and
          Geochemistry in Geothermal Fields"</I>
<P>
<LI>The TC model project ELS/8/005 "Isotope Hydrology and
Geochemistry in
Geothermal
Fields" commenced in 1995 with the aim of integrating isotope
hydrogeochemical techniques
in
the investigation for the development of Ahuachapan and Berlin
geothermal fields. The
project
assists the end-user, Comisin Ejecutiva Hidroelctrica del Ro
Lempa (CEL), in
understanding
the hydrology and processes affecting the fluids in the
geothermal areas. This information
enables the formulation of scientifically sound strategies for
geothermal energy utilization as
well as for appropriate disposal of waste water through
reinjection. 
<P>
<LI>The first year of the project brought about a preliminary
baseline hydrological model
for
the subsequent development of the Berlin geothermal field. Steam
and water samples
collected
from geothermal wells and surface manifestations were analyzed
for chemistry at CEL, for
oxygen-18 and deuterium at the Agency's Isotope Hydrology
Laboratory, and for gases and
isotopes in gases at the Istituto Internazionale per le Ricerche
Geotermiche (IIRG), Pisa,
Italy. 
This data indicates that the hottest sector produces at least
280&#176;C fluids originating
from a
mixture of predominantly meteoric water and an isotopically very
heavy water, probably
andesitic in nature.  As the fluids rise from that sector of the
field, a fraction (25%) of steam
separates at about 220&#176;C and flows towards the north.  The
residual cooler fluids are
tapped by
the rest of the wells.  The meteoric water recharge is postulated
to originate from two
sources
but will subsequently be validated by isotope data from samples
collected from six rain
stations
installed under this project.
<P> 
<LI>In 1995, two wells were drilled while 16 others are scheduled
for drilling during the
third quarter of 1996 to meet the 1997 projected 50 MWe expansion
of the Berlin geothermal
field. Suitable areas for reinjection of waste waters to reduce
environmental pollution are also
being evaluated. 
<P>  
<LI>The development of other potentially productive areas was
re-assessed in connection
with
the loan to CEL from the Inter-American Development Bank (BID). 
The BID supports the
development of the steam field with drilling of additional wells
in Berlin and Ahuachapan. It
was decided to use Chipilapa, 4 km from Ahuachapan, as a
reinjection area.  The
hydrological
connection of the two sectors is being determined to prevent
premature cooling while at the
same time inducing artificial recharge of the reservoir. 
Radioactive tracing by I-131 and
I-125
in this regard will be implemented in the coming months to
determine the preferential flow
paths
of fluids, their rate of flow and the interconnection between the
reinjection and production
sectors.  The information will indicate potential reinjection
sites at a sufficient distance from
the
production area to allow re-heating of fluids and yet
communicating with the reservoir to
induce
recharge to the system.
<P>
<B>IV.    Selected examples of other projects and activities in
water resources:
     Highlights of progress and achievements</B>
<P>
<LI>In view of the severe shortage of freshwater resources in
arid and semi-arid regions
and
water resources management problems stemming from the present
water utilization pattern,
the
Agency's programmes in the field of isotope hydrology have placed
special emphasis on the
application of nuclear technology in such water scarce regions. 
Several regional TC projects
dealing with water resources in arid zones of Africa, the Middle
East and Latin America have
been designed and are being implemented, and a number of
Coordinated Research
Programmes
specifically dealing with problems of arid zone hydrology are
presently operational.
<P>
<LI>In this context, a regional TC project in the West Asia
region (RAW/8/002) dealing
with
isotope applications directed towards improved groundwater
management in selected major
aquifer systems was initiated in 1995.  The subject matter of the
project includes isotope field
investigations dealing with:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i)   estimation of recharge rate from rainfall through
studies in the unsaturated zone
at
          selected sites (Saudi Arabia, Syria) as a means of
establishing allowable water
          extraction amounts without causing decline of the water
table;
<P>
<DD>(ii)  identification of sources of pollutants and their
transport in the groundwater, and
          development of predictive pollutant transport models as
a means of arriving at
          management decisions to minimize water quality
degradation (Lebanon, Jordan,
          Saudi Arabia);
<P>
<DD>(iii) study of sources and processes of water salinization in
coastal aquifer systems so
          that proper engineering decisions to prevent sea-water
encroachment into
          groundwater can ba made (Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, UAE).
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Initial findings of isotope field investigations so far
conducted under problem area (i)
of
the project indicate that recharge at an average rate of 15
mm/year is occurring at two sites
in
Saudi Arabia. This indicates a safe extraction rate of 15 million
cubic meters per year from
groundwater for every 1000 km<SUP>2</SUP> surface area of the
aquifer. The studies
will continue at
different sites to give a representative coverage, thereby
enabling the results obtained to be
spatially extrapolated for a reliable estimate to be made of
major aquifer systems being
exploited
at present.
<P>
<LI>Isotope investigations in the unsaturated zone are a unique
methodology for estimation
of
such low recharge rates. The new coordinated research programme
initiated in 1996, as cited
earlier, which aims at the application of the method in
representative sites covering major
arid
zones,  will also contribute to the achievements expected from
the TC projects being
implemented in water-scarce regions.
<P>
<LI>Complementing ongoing field studies addressing problem areas
(ii) and (iii) of the
Regional Project RAW/8/002, a group training activity on the "Use
of numerical models for
the
simulation of flow and pollutant transport" was recently
conducted.  Through this training,
capability was provided to the participating countries for the
development of site-specific
predictive models of pollutant transport and sea water intrusion
dynamics.  The models form
a
basis for the proper management of groundwater resources as
regards the protection of its
quality. 
<P>
<LI>Isotope hydrological studies being conducted in the Peruvian
Altiplano (PER/8/010)
have
provided key information on origin and dynamics of groundwater as
a basis for an
appropriate
exploitation of the Capillune aquifer.  The construction of
additional wells in selected areas of
the southern part of Peru is linked to the project, in which the
potential of the aquifers to
alleviate the present water shortage is being assessed.  The
results obtained so far indicate
that
the region is composed of small-scale groundwater systems, often
separated by intrusive
volcanic formations, with limited potential for groundwater
exploitation.  In other areas with
more favorable conditions, the discharge of geothermal fluids is
responsible for the high
content
of contaminants, mixing with fresh water and leading to water of
unacceptable quality even
for
irrigation.  Areas of preferential recharge have been found by
examining the structure of the
geological formations and the tritium content of the groundwater.

These areas are envisaged
for
extraction of groundwater.
<P>
<LI>In 1995, a project in Cuba (CUB/8/013) devoted to the
evaluation of the effectiveness
of
a 20-km dike constructed in a coastal area was completed.  The
combined use of
hydrochemical
and isotopic techniques proved that the dike is effective in
retaining river and flood water
during
the rainy season and facilitates its recharge to the aquifer in
the coastal sector, leading to the
displacement of the freshwater-sea water interface by the
infiltration of fresh water.  The
changes produced by the dike in groundwater flow and the effects
in the mangrove area were
investigated.  The dike proved to be effective in restoring the
mangrove zone that was
seriously
affected by intense exploitation of groundwater near the coast.
The study provided key
information for the assessment of the effects of the dike in the
groundwater system and will
be
considered in planning the extension of the dike by another 30
km.
<P>
<LI>Through a TC project in the Philippines (PHI/8/018),
environmental isotopes are
being
used to validate a hydrological model dealing with conjunctive
use of surface and
groundwater
resources for water supply in the Metro Manila area.  Based on
the results of isotope field
studies conducted in Laguna Bay and groundwater aquifers adjacent
to the Laguna lake which
are being extensively used for the domestic water supply of
Manila, it was verified that the
assumed recharge of 26 million cubic meters per year from the
lake to the wells of the
adjacent
aquifers is not taking place under the present climatic
conditions. Thus, the observed water
level
decline and resulting sea water intrusion is being re-evaluated
through findings of isotope
data. 
Based on the findings of these isotope-aided field studies, the
model is being revised so that
optimum pumping rates can be achieved.
<P>
<B>V.  Outlook for the 1997/98 programme</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency's sub-programme on "Development and Management of
Water
Resources" was designed with a re-orientation to focus on the
integration of isotope
techniques in applied
research and practical applications on a wider scale to achieve
efficient development and
management of water resources to meet the growing demand for
water and improved
protection
of water quality. The projects in the 1997/98 programme which are
of direct relevance to
isotope applications for improved water availability and
management are:

<LI>Specific tasks included in the above projects have been
designed taking into account
the results to be achieved from the ongoing projects, and
development and application needs
in areas of immediate practical significance in the water sector.
Specific new initiatives
included in the 1997/98 programme are:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-   CRP on <I>"Application of isotope techniques in urban
hydrology"</I>, with
the objectives of
    groundwater assessment in rapidly growing urban areas and
megacities; predicting and
    identifying hazards to urban water resources, such as surface
pollution, sea/lake water
    intrusion and subsidence/aquifer degradation problems
associated with (over)exploitation;
    assessment of leakage from reticulation/sewage systems; and
improved modelling and
    resource evaluation. 
<P>    
<DD>-   CRP on <I>"Responses of hydrological systems to long-term
exploitation"</I>, with the objective
    of studying hydrological responses to long-term extraction of
water and its implications
    on natural processes related to water  quality; improving
resources management through
    the refinement of conceptual and numerical modelling with the
aid of isotope data.
<P>
<DD>-   CRP on <I>"Use of isotope techniques in problems related
to geothermal
exploitation"</I>, with
    the objective of improving and developing drilling strategies
through better estimates of
    physical and chemical parameters of geothermal reservoirs,
and development of isotope
    methods to identify the origin of acidic fluids involved. 
<P>
<DD>-   Development of an <I>"Isotope and Geochemical Database in
Hydrological
Systems"</I>, which
    will provide all the data collected by the Agency through TC
field applications as basic
    information for the design and implementation of future
isotope field investigations.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The 1997/98 programme on development and management of water
resources makes
provisions for specific activities directed towards the
integration of isotope field investigations
in
large scale water projects in water-scarce regions.  Meetings of
senior management level staff
of
water institutions are scheduled to be held in 1997 and 1998 for
the Middle East and North
Africa, respectively.  The results and findings of the ongoing
regional TC projects will be
discussed and communicated to the senior staff of the water
institutions in these regions to
facilitate the incorporation of findings as a decision support
system for management and
development of scarce water resources in the Middle East and
Africa.
<P>
<LI>A group training for local technical staff involved in these
regional TC projects  will
be
conducted during 1997 in Vienna, for a duration of two months, to
ensure a core of well
trained
staff is created for future similar isotope studies to be
incorporated and integrated in national
activities related to water resources development and management.
<P>
<LI>In the appraisal of new TC project proposals for the 1997/98
programme, due
consideration is being given to assigning higher priority to
those proposals with immediate
practical impact on the assessment/management of water resources.
<P>
<B>VI. Initiatives for improved cooperation with other related
international
organizations</B>
<P>
<LI>The 16th Session of the ACC Subcommittee on Water Resources
held in October 1995
in
New York provided an excellent forum for continuing the efforts
to strengthen co-operation
between UN organizations concerned with water resources. In this
meeting, the following
organizations were represented: 10 UN departments and
commissions, 7 specialized UN
agencies, namely FAO, UNESCO, WHO, WB, WMO, UNIDO and IAEA, and
the Asian
Development Bank, the Stockholm Environment Institute, and the
Water Supply and
Sanitation
Collaborative Council.  The Subcommittee was briefed on current
activities of the IAEA
relevant to the water sector of  Member States, as described in
the recently produced booklet
"Isotopes in Water and Environmental Management" which was
distributed among the
participants.  Information was also provided on the strategy of
the IAEA's programme on
water
resources development as stressed in the respective resolution of
the 1995 General
Conference. 
In individual consultations with representatives of other
organizations, specific possibilities
for
co-operation with regard to the water sector in Africa (UNECA,
FAO), and concerning
hydrological networks and data banks (WMO, WHO, UNESCO) were
discussed.
<P>
<LI>A specific project to be developed jointly by FAO and UNECA
concerns the use of
isotope methods for impact assessment of pollution due to
agricultural water use in selected
major aquifer systems.  Consultations with a representative of
FAO were held in this regard
in
March 1996.
<P>
<LI>The need to establish a comprehensive water quality database,
including isotope data,
and
future joint actions by UNESCO, WHO and IAEA were delineated
during the meeting of
"Arab
National Committees of the UNESCO-IHP Programme", which was held
in Cairo in
December
1995.  Further actions required in this regard and a plan of
action will be worked out in the
course of consultations between the Secretariats of the
organizations involved .
<P>
<LI> The Fourth Annual meeting of the Inter-Agency Group for
Water in Africa (IGWA)
organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), was
hosted by the IAEA
in
November 1995.  The following agencies were represented at the
meeting: FAO, IAEA,
UNCHS, UNECA, UNHCR, UNIDO, WHO, WMO, African Development Bank
(ADB),
Southern African Development Community (SADC), Zambezi River
Authority (ZRA), the
Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), and representatives of
Development of Water and
Environment (DHV Consultants), Amersfoort, The Netherlands, were
present as observers. 
The major objective of the meeting was to further enhance
inter-agency co-operation. The
meeting stressed the importance of system-wide coordination and
harmonization of activities
to
reduce duplication and overlap of activities at a time of
financial constraints for the United
Nations and all other international organizations. One of the
major achievements of the
meeting
was the consensus reached on joint activities. It was agreed that
an informal process of
project
formulation should be undertaken in order to develop one or more
project proposals for
presentation at the next IGWA meeting. Three agencies - FAO, IAEA
and UNECA - offered
to
participate in taking the lead in organizing appropriate
proposals. 
<P>
<LI>Furthermore, the Agency took part in the Intergovernmental
Coordination Council
meeting of the UNESCO International Hydrology Programme (IHP) 
where the planning of
the
next phase of the IHP-V (to be implemented during 1996-2001) was
considered in detail.  A
background document on IAEA activities in isotope hydrology and
possible cooperation with
UNESCO was submitted.  Potential areas of mutual interest for
cooperation between the two
organizations were delineated. The first specific activity to be
jointly undertaken will be the
preparation of teaching material in the field of isotope
hydrology.  During recent meetings
(April 1996) held for this purpose, the scope and contents of six
different manuals covering
both
surface and groundwater hydrology were designed.  Preparation of
the manuals is scheduled
to
be completed by the end of 1997.
<P>
<LI>At the Sixth Regional Meeting of the Arab National Committees
of the International 
Hydrological Programme (IHP) of UNESCO, held from 3-6 December
1995 in Amman,
Jordan,
a paper on "Development of Scarce Water Resources - The Role of
Environmental Isotope
Techniques" was presented.  In an ad-hoc meeting held with
representatives of ACSAD and
UNESCO,  a programme of joint efforts of Arab countries, UNESCO
and IAEA was set up
aimed at the establishment of a regional isotope monitoring
network and an isotope
hydrological
database for the Arab region. First steps in the realization of
the programme are envisaged to
be
taken at a forthcoming meeting at UNESCO-ROSTAS in Cairo in June
1996.
<P>
<LI>The Agency participated in the UNEP/ESCWA Expert Group
Meeting on
"Implications
of Agenda-21 for Integrated Water Management in the ESCWA Region"
(Amman, 2-6
October
1995) and presented a background paper entitled "Isotope
methodologies in water resources
and
examples of applications in the ESCWA region". As ESCWA is
planning to expand their
hydrological activities, particularly concerning water resources
management under water
scarcity
conditions in the ESCWA region,  The Agency's cooperation in
incorporating isotope
methodologies in these ESCWA activities will be further pursued
to define a concrete action
plan.

<I>On 19 July 1996, an addendum was issued to this document <A HREF="gc40-4a1.html">(GC(40)/4/Add. 1)</A>.</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Last year, the General Conference had before it document
GC(39)/12, which
summarized
the progress of various studies and other actions initiated by
the Agency on the topic "Plan
for
producing potable water economically."  The document also
included a summary of the first
phase of the "<B>Options Identification Programme (OIP)</B>,"
which was initiated in
1994.  Following discussions based on information provided in
this document (GC(39)/12),
the
General Conference adopted resolution <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r15.html
">GC(39)/RES/15</A>.
<P>
<LI>Noting the continuing interest of a number of Member States
in seawater desalination
using nuclear energy and stressing the importance of adequate
water supplies for mankind,
the
General Conference, in resolution GC(39)/RES/15, requested the
Director General to continue
relevant activities and consultations, and called upon Member
States to provide expert
services
and extrabudgetary resources in support of the activities
relating to seawater desalination
using
nuclear energy.  The Director General was further requested by
the General Conference to
report on the progress made in the implementation of the
resolution.  The present document
has
been prepared in fulfillment of that request and is being issued
for the attention of both the
Board of Governors and the General Conference.
<P>
<B><I>Activities Undertaken Relevant to Nuclear
Desalination</I></B>
<P>
<LI>The study "Nuclear desalination as a source of low cost
potable water in North
Africa"
and previous studies have led to the conclusion that small and
medium reactors (SMRs) are
most
suitable for nuclear desalination applications in the countries
where electricity grids are
relatively small.  To discuss the status and recent progress made
in the development,
deployment and application of SMRs, to review the past experience
of the introduction of
SMRs
and discuss options, models and constraints for introducing SMRs
in developing countries, an
Advisory Group Meeting (AGM) was held in October 1995.  A status
report containing
up-to-
date technical information on most of the SMRs being developed,
designed or already
commercially available has been completed and was sent for
publication.
<P>
<LI>Recent results and advances in technology development and
design of integral reactors
were discussed and the existing experience along with safety and
economic aspects were
reviewed at a Technical Committee Meeting (TCM), held in October
1995. 
<P>
<LI>In order to review the global experience of coupling nuclear
plants with district heat
networks and desalination processes, an AGM was held in December
1995 and a consultancy
was held in February 1996.  During these meetings, it was
confirmed that radioactivity levels
in
the heat consuming parts of these industrial complexes have
always stayed within regulatory
limits.  It was also reported that about 500 reactor-years of
operational experience from
nuclear
co-generation and heat-only reactors are available.  The largest
part of this accumulation
stems
from the operation of WWER type reactors in the former Soviet
Union and the Eastern
European countries.  Nuclear energy for seawater desalination
plants has been used at
locations
in Japan and in Kazakhstan.  While in Japan the desalted water is
mostly consumed at the
nuclear power plants, in Kazakhstan the desalination complex
supplies water to a near-by
residential area.
<P>
<B><I>Finalization of Feasibility Studies</I></B>
<P>
<LI>In the North African regional feasibility study, which was
initiated in 1991, emphasis
was placed on analyzing the electricity and potable water demand
and the available energy
and
water resources in the participating countries.  The scope of the
study included the selection
of
representative sites, analysis of site specific economics for
various combinations of energy
source and desalination process appropriate for each site,
financial aspects, local
participation,
infrastructure requirements and institutional and environmental
aspects.  These activities were
performed by the relevant institutions in the participating
countries, with assistance provided
by
the Agency.  The study report is in the process of publication.
<P>
<LI>The development of a computer code, which enables
site-specific technical
optimization
and economic evaluation has been completed, and the code is now
available to interested
Member States.  A training course on the operation of the code
has been held for a group of
North African experts.  A more detailed computer code for
allocating the costs of dual-purpose
plants and determining their optimum coupling has been developed
by the Agency and applied for a reference site.  The results will
be published in 1996.
<P>
<B><I>Nuclear Desalination Programmes in Member States</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Several bi-lateral and national programmes on nuclear
desalination are in progress, either with or without the Agency's
involvement.
<P>
<LI>Morocco is about to undertake a joint "Pre-project study on
demonstration plant" with
the People's Republic of China. The Agency has continued to
provide assistance to the
Government of Morocco since 1995, within the framework of a
technical co-operation project. 
In the study, a multi-effect distillation (MED) process is to be
selected for desalination and
connected to a 10 MWth heat-only reactor which will be supplied
later by China to produce 8,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/day.
<P>
<LI>Indonesia intends to undertake a feasibility study on the
application of a high
temperature
gas reactor for the combined production of methanol and
desalinated water, in addition to
production of electricity, for the Natuna gas field.  Agency's
assistance in provision of expert
services and training has been requested.  Indonesia has also
expressed interest in nuclear
desalination in general, which might contribute to the supply of
potable water to some of the
islands and regions where supply of fresh water is difficult or
inadequate.
<P>
<LI>Egypt has expressed an interest to undertake a pre-project
design study on coupling a
reverse osmosis (RO) systems to a nuclear facility for the
desalination of seawater.  The
objective of this pre-project study is to acquire ability to plan
and design RO systems and
their
coupling to nuclear power sources.  Agency's assistance in
provision of expert services and
training has been requested for performing this study.
<P>
<LI>In the Republic of Korea, the conceptual design of a 330 MWth
multi-purpose nuclear
plant is in progress for demonstration of co-generation of
electricity and heat as well as
seawater
desalination.  India is carrying out activities concerning the
demonstration of nuclear
desalination using a 200 MWe pressurized heavy water reactors. 
The Russian Federation has
designed a floating nuclear desalination complex using a power
reactor for icebreakers.
<P>
<B><I>Consultations with International Organizations and Member
States</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Acting on resolution GC(39)/RES/15, the Secretariat invited
comments from the
competent organizations of the United Nations system and other
relevant intergovernmental
organizations, concerning: (i) the main conclusions of the IAEA
TECDOC on "Technical and
economic evaluation of potable water production through the
desalination of seawater by
using
nuclear energy or other means", and (ii) the progress made during
the first phase of the OIP.
<P>
<LI>As of April 1996, four international organizations have
responded.  FAO has provided
a
relevant data base on water resources and rural water use in
Africa.  WMO is sharing the
Agency's position that nuclear water desalination offers
important possibilities for overcoming
critical water shortages in certain regions of the world. 
OECD/NEA and UNIDO have also
responded.
<P>
<LI>Similarly, in response to the resolution, the Secretariat has
sent letters to international
organizations and prospective donor countries, requesting support
in the form of cost-free
expert
services and extrabudgetary funds, in order to complete the
second phase of the OIP in 1996.

Twenty-two Member States and two international organizations have
expressed their specific
support, since the Agency's activities on the subject of nuclear
desalination of seawater was
resumed, as shown in Table 1.  The Agency has received a total of
US$ 670,000.00  as
extrabudgetary funds, as summarized in Table 2.  In addition,
several cost-free experts have
been made available to the Agency.  For completion of the second
phase of the OIP,
cost-free
experts who have worked on the first phase of the OIP continue to
be available.  US$
65,000.00
as extrabudgetary funds has been pledged as of April 1996. 
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has continued consultations with interested
Member States concerning
the
main conclusions of the above mentioned TECDOC and the subsequent
progress.  In
addition,
the Secretariat has undertaken several consultations, such as
"Review of experience with
nuclear
heat applications: district heating, process heat production and
desalination," for the
implementation of the main recommendations of the Advisory Group
on Demonstration
Facilities, which were made in 1994.  A number of Member States
supported the Agency's
activities by participating in meetings and by providing
consultations.
<P>
<LI>The status of the Agency's activities on nuclear desalination
as of March 1996 was
presented to the interested Member States for review and comments
on 18 April 1996 at
VIC,
Vienna. Nineteen representatives from 18 Member States were in
attendance at this
presentation
and provided their interests and comments.
<P>
<B><I>Activities Included in The 1997/98 Agency's
Programme</I></B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency s 1997-1998 Programme and Budget includes
proposals for tasks to be
undertaken in Sub-programme A3.06 (Co-generation and heat
application), most of which are
related to nuclear desalination.  Considering the vital
importance of producing potable water,
several new tasks with specific goals have been proposed.  The
progress in the Agency's
activities on nuclear desalination and the results of feasibility
studies have been considered in
planning and will be implemented once they ar approved.  These
new tasks are related to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     User requirements for nuclear seawater desalination
plants,
<DD>-     Technology, design, and safety aspects of
non-electrical application of nuclear
          energy,
<DD>-     Local participation in nuclear seawater desalination
plants, and
<DD>-     Institutional aspects of nuclear seawater desalination
plants. 
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The Agency is examining the possibility of including a
follow-up study on the North
African regional feasibility study in its 1997/98 programme and
budget as part of technical
cooperations in this region, to provide expert services for a
review of the regional
infrastructure
capabilities and to identify any necessary improvements for the
deployment of nuclear
desalination plants.  Training in the utilization of relevant
computer programmes is also being
considered.
<P>
<LI>Considering the growing international interest in nuclear
desalination of seawater, as
well
as ongoing programmes in some Member States, the Agency will hold
an international
symposium on the subject in 1997.  The Republic of Korea has
expressed a strong interest to
host this symposium.  For detailed preparations of the Symposium,
a Steering Committee has
been established with representatives from nine Member States and
relevant international
organizations.  The European Commission, the Global Technology
Development Center, the
International Desalination Association, UNIDO, WHO and WMO have
expressed their
willingness to support the Symposium in various forms, such as
financial support,
participation
in the Steering Committee, presentation of papers or
participation in panel discussions.
<P>
<B><I>Status of the Options Identification Programme</I></B>
<P>
<LI>The General Conference endorsed in resolution
<A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/glance/policy/gcres07.html"
>GC(XXXVIII)/RES/7</A> of its 1994
session
the recommendation of an AGM that there is a need to establish a
programme for identifying
a
practical set of options for coupling desalination processes to
nuclear reactors, from which
one
or more demonstration facilities with well-defined objectives
might be chosen.  The objective
of
a demonstration programme is to build confidence, through the
design, construction,
operation
and maintenance of an appropriate facility or facilities, that
nuclear desalination can be
successfully accomplished technically and economically, while
meeting established relevant
safety and reliability criteria.  Thus, as a first step, a
two-phase programme, the OIP has
been
initiated.
<P>
<LI>The purpose of the OIP is to select candidate reactor and
desalination technologies that
could serve as practical demonstration of nuclear desalination of
seawater, supplementing the
existing know-how and experience.  As this programme was not
intended to serve as either a
reactor or a desalination process development programme,
demonstration options were to be
based on reactor and desalination technologies which are
themselves readily available,
without
further development being required at the time of the
demonstration.
<P>
<LI>The work has been performed by a Working Group, consisting of
representatives from
interested Member States and Agency staff.  The group, under the
Agency's co-ordination,
has
taken the responsibility for defining and performing all
activities necessary to identify and
fully
characterize a set of practical demonstration options.  It has
carried out its activities through a
combination of periodic meetings and individual work assignments.

Throughout the duration
of
the programme, peer review meetings have been convened by the
Agency through AGMs,
TCMs and consultancies to address specific technical issues.
<P>
<LI>During the first phase of the OIP, the future market survey
of desalted water demand
revealed that large water production facilities, each producing
200,000 to 500,000
m<SUP>3</SUP>/day of desalted seawater, could be constructed. 
For examining the
reactor types
to be coupled with desalination technologies which might be
deployed in the near term for
nuclear desalination projects, the list of worldwide reactors was
reviewed and screened for
potential availability depending upon the status of the design
and licensing of each concept. 
Several candidate combinations were narrowed down to those which
were thought to have the
greatest potential for yielding technical, operational and
economic data having the broadest
general applicability.  The progress of the first phase of the
OIP activities was reported as an
interim report to the General Conference of 1995  for
endorsement.
<P>
<LI>The second phase of the OIP has been devoted to a detailed
analysis of the most
practical
options for demonstration. To provide a basis for a user to
proceed with a project
implementation, issues regarding the project planning and
implementation of demonstration
and
commercial deployment have been analyzed.  To accomplish the goal
of the second phase of
the
OIP, a variety of activities have been performed including
consultancies.  Activities in the
second phase have addressed, in particular, the following:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     Review of current technical status and prospects of
reverse osmosis technology;
<DD>-     Review of experience with nuclear heat applications:
district heating, process
heat
          production and desalination;
<DD>-     Recommendations to OIP from the experience with nuclear
heat applications;
<DD>-     Progress review of the OIP activities;
<DD>-     Survey on development trends of desalination processes;
<DD>-     Review of cost parameters of seawater desalination
plants.
</DL>
<P>
This second phase of the OIP is expected to be finalized before
the end of 1996.
<P>
<B><I>Major Findings of the Options Identification
Programme</I></B>
<P>
<LI>A market survey indicates worldwide demand for desalination
will double every eight
to
ten years during the next decades.  Most of the demand is in the
Gulf and the North African
regions, but will expand to other regions as well.  It is
expected that most desalination plants
to
be built will be in three distinct size ranges, i.e. small (the
capacity of less than 10,000
m<SUP>3</SUP>/d), medium (up to 100,000  m<SUP>3</SUP>/d) and
large ( up
to 500,000
m<SUP>3</SUP>/d).  Due to the relatively high transport cost of
water, plants larger
than 500,000
m<SUP>3</SUP>/d would not be economically feasible.
<P>
<LI>Large scale commercial deployment of nuclear desalination
will mainly depend on
economic competitiveness with available alternative options, and
adequate confidence in this
application.  Should these conditions be satisfied, there seems
to be no reason why nuclear
desalination plants could not penetrate the potable water market.

It could and should be
commercially deployed in situations, where it can offer adequate
incentives.  The continuing
and
increasing interest shown by the Agency's General Conference is a
clear indication of
growing
interest in nuclear desalination.
<P>
<LI>In the course of selecting practical options for
demonstration, the list of available
reactors
was reviewed and several reactors were identified as being most
appropriate.  A set of
screening
criteria based on design status and licensing status was used as
a filter.  Applying these
criteria,
the reactor technologies currently available or which might
become available within a period
of
approximately the next ten years were identified.  Medium size
pressurized light water
reactors
and pressurized heavy water reactors have been considered as most
suitable reactor types. 
Small reactors might be also feasible at sites with low water
demand and where alternative
systems for potable water production are expensive.
<P>
<LI>Consideration was also given to the desalination technologies
suitable for coupling to a
nuclear reactor.  Desalination of seawater by the RO and the MED
processes appear to be
most
promising, due to relatively low energy consumption and
investment costs, as well as high
reliability as compared with the multi-stage flash (MSF) process.

Furthermore, the MED
process appears to be less sensitive to corrosion and scaling
than the MSF process. 
Therefore,
MSF has been excluded, having no inherent advantages over MED.
<P>
<LI>When combining a nuclear reactor and a desalination process
to form an integrated
complex, the compatibility in combination was taken into account
in the selection procedure. 
Inter alia, timing, infrastructure and investment requirements
were considered for their
significance in identifying the practical options for
demonstration. 
<P>
<LI>As a result of the above-mentioned narrowing down process,
three options were
identified as recommended practical candidates for further
consideration as nuclear
desalination
demonstration projects.  These options, using well-proven
water-cooled reactors and
desalination
technologies, are:
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=90% CELLSPACING=10 CELLPADDING=10>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Option 1:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>RO desalination plant having limited size of water
production
capacities (two or three
trains of up to 10,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/d each) in combination with
a medium-size
nuclear power
reactor being constructed or in an advanced design stage with
construction expected in the
near
term. This combination will be easily applied to larger
commercial water production
facilities. 
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Option 2:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>RO desalination plant of limited size as above, in
combination with a
currently
operating
reactor with some minor modifications for integration. Again this
combination will be
straightforward to extrapolate to commercial size production
facility.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Option 3:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>MED desalination in combination with a small
reactor to be newly
constructed,
which
would be suitable for water production capacities of up to 80,000
m<SUP>3</SUP>/d.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<LI>More than a dozen nuclear power reactors, which would be
suitable for Option 1, are
under construction on the seashore.  Several other units are also
in an advanced design stage,
and their construction is expected to start in a relatively short
time.  Among nearly 70
nuclear
power plants which are currently operating on the seashore
worldwide, several reactors
suitable
for demonstration for Option 2 as defined above would be
available.  From among small
reactors being developed, several reactors suitable for Option 3
could be available.
<P>
<LI>The investment required for a demonstration RO facility would
be about US$ 30
million
for two RO trains of 10,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>/d each.  Modest costs
are also expected
for some
minor modifications of the secondary circuit of the nuclear power
plant. Option 1 and Option
2
could thus be implemented with a relatively modest investment.  A
small reactor with
integrated
MED desalination, as proposed for Option 3, would cost about US$
200 to 300 million.
<P>
<B><I>Issues for of Nuclear Desalination Demonstration</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Desalination facilities connected to NPPs in Kazakhstan and
Japan have been
producing
desalted water for years.  This valuable experience would have to
be taken into account in
order
to determine what issues should be specifically addressed in
other ongoing or planned
activities
and projects on nuclear desalination.
<P>
<LI>Several technical items were identified as possible subjects
needing more thorough
examination and evaluation, covering technical, safety and
economic issues.  Such specific
subjects for investigation include:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     interaction between nuclear reactors and desalination
systems;
<DD>-     nuclear safety requirements specific to nuclear
desalination systems;
<DD>-     the impact of feed-water preheating on the performance
of RO systems.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Currently, there are ongoing activities in Canada, the
People's Republic of China,
India,
the Republic of Korea, Morocco, and the Russian Federation. 
Studies in some other
interested
Member States may also lead to the implementation of further
projects.  These national and
bilateral projects will contribute to international know-how and
experience in nuclear
desalination, and can be considered as a basis for international
co-operation and support
which
could be beneficial also to other interested Member States.
<P>
<LI>For the ultimate objective of facilitating and promoting
commercial deployment, the
demonstration programme has to be directed to those issues which
are relevant to commercial
projects.  These issues are technical, economic, financial,
safety, reliability and institutional,
covering a wide spectrum.  Some issues, in particular those
technical features which have a
major impact on economic competitiveness do need demonstration.
<P>
<LI>The infrastructure requirements for nuclear desalination
plants are primarily
determined
by what is required for nuclear industries.  These requirements
are major issues for any
Member States without having previous nuclear power experience. 
A demonstration project,
if
implemented in such a Member State, could be a very effective and
practical framework for
developing its nuclear infrastructure, in particular its nuclear
regulatory structure.
<P>
<B><I>Issues for a Commercial Production Facility</I></B>
<P>
<LI>There could be a number of issues related to commercial
production facilities.   Most
of
the technical aspects could be addressed through the mechanism of
demonstration and would
ultimately enhance the level of confidence in commercial
deployment.  There could be issues
which would be particularly important and should be thoroughly
addressed before commercial
deployment, such as: (i) Site selection and site qualification,
scheduling, manpower and
organizational requirements, (ii) User requirements, or (iii)
Local and national infrastructure
development.
<P>
<LI>National policies, such as (i)National energy plan,
(ii)National potable water supply
assurance plan, (iii)Policies concerning international relations,
or (iv)Financing, governmental
involvement and promotion policies, are also important to proceed
with nuclear desalination
deployment.
<P>
<LI>For the success of commercial nuclear desalination
deployment, firm governmental
commitment based on sound national policies and plans, and with
adequate international
arrangements is of crucial importance.  Other essential factors
to be met include: (i)
Regulatory
issues to be resolved before the start of construction, (ii)
Efficient project management with
tight
control of quality, costs and schedule, and (iii) Secured
financing.
<P>
<B><I>Possible future actions</I></B>
 <P>
<LI>The next step for proceeding with a nuclear desalination
demonstration programme
should be for one or more Member States to proceed with
preparatory actions for
demonstration
projects, including site selection and qualification,
identification of user requirements, project
specifications and the development of infrastructures as may be
required for project
implementation.
<P>
<LI>It is also important to continue and deepen relevant studies,
to exchange information,
and
to promote international co-operation and collaboration in the
subject area.  On request, and
with the support of the Member States, the Agency would continue
its related activities.  In
order to effectively co-ordinate such continuing activities, one
possible framework could be to
set up an advisory body to the Agency's activities on nuclear
desalination with the
participation
of interested Member States that are developing or designing
nuclear desalination plants or
are
considering their deployment.  This body would facilitate the
exchange of information on
national and international programmes, projects and experience,
and identify and review
relevant
key issues for nuclear desalination deployment.

<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>In resolution <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r14.html
">GC(39)/RES/14</A>, the General Conference last year
stressed the need, in
conformity with the Statute, to strengthen technical co-operation
activities and also their
effectiveness and efficiency and requested the Director General
"to pursue, in consultation
with
Member States, efforts to strengthen the technical co-operation
activities of the Agency
through
the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the
scientific and technological
capabilities of developing countries, account being taken of the
infrastructure and the level of
technology of the countries concerned, in the fields of peaceful
applications of nuclear
energy,
including both the applications of nuclear methods and techniques
and the production of
electricity, and achieving sustainable development".  It further
requested the Director General
to
continue to take follow-up actions on initiatives mentioned in
his report to continue to take
account of the view of the General Conference on this question
when requesting Member
States
to pledge their respective shares of the Technical Co-operation
Fund target and to make
timely
payments to the Fund.
<P>
<LI>In addition, the General Conference requested the Director
General to report to the
Board of Governors periodically and to the General Conference at
its fortieth regular session
under an agenda item entitled "Strengthening of the Agency's
technical co-operation
activities". 
The Director General reported to the Technical Assistance and
Co-operation Committee in
November 1995 and to the Board of Governors in December 1995 on
recent developments
and
matters of significance to the Technical Co-operation Programme.
<P>
<LI>The present document provides a comprehensive update on
ongoing and new
initiatives
for the consideration both of the Board of Governors and of the
General Conference.
<P>
<B>I.  Follow-up actions on initiatives presented to the General
Conference's 1995

<P>
<LI>Based on steps already initiated in the context of the Model
Project for upgrading 
Radiation and Waste Safety Infrastructure in those Member States
where the Basic Safety
Standards (BSS) have not yet been met, a detailed in-house review
of the latest situation was
made to identify additional Member States for technical support
under the project. A check
list
of essential requirements for safety infrastructure was prepared.

Components of the check

<P>
<LI>This list was used as a basis to formulate Action Plans for
53 Member States including
five countries already participating in the Model Project. The
Agency sent letters to the
relevant
Member States in January 1996 informing them of these
developments and inviting their
participation in the Model Project.
<P>
<LI>Four Regional Experts, designated specifically to carry out
activities under the Model
Project, have taken up their assignments and are currently in the
process of finalizing national
Action Plans in consultation with the 53 Member States. Due
consideration is being given to
the
prevailing conditions in Member States in order to determine a
realistic pace of implementing
various activities on the check list. It is expected that by the
middle of 1996 most of the
Action
Plans would have been discussed and agreed with the Member States
concerned.
<P>
<LI>Most of the activities being undertaken in support of
radiation and waste safety
infrastructure through other regional arrangements will be
consolidated as the implementation
under the Model Project gains momentum.  Some national projects
will address new specific
infrastructure requirements, depending on prevailing
circumstances  in the countries.  Due
care
will be taken to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts. 
Additional details on the Model
Project for radiation and waste safety Infrastructure can be
obtained from the section on
Interregional activities contained in the Technical Co-operation
Report for 1995, GOV/2858. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> <B>The Model Project
concept</B>
<P>
<LI>Progress in 1995 in implementing Model Projects was presented
in a Report at the
November 1995 TACC meeting.  The preliminary results show that
Model and Model-like
Projects (which have features similar to Model Projects,
particularly a socio-economic impact
on end-users) are having the desired effect of reaching the
target end-users.  The Model
Project in Hungary is influencing operational safety and
reliability of all WWER plants.  In
Mongolia, a new teletherapy machine has treated 2,500 cancer
patients at the Oncology
Research Centre in Ulan Bator since August 1995, following the
successful installation of the
new system and training of radiotherapists and medical
physicists.  The Model Project in
Poland to demonstrate electron beam dry scrubbing (EBDS)
technology to remove pollutants
from the flue gases of a coal-fired power plant and recycle the
by-product to fertilize crops,
has encouraged six other countries to investigate electron beam
technology, while two
additional countries are preparing EBDS feasibility studies.  The
growing success of Model
Projects reflects solid progress in elaborating the Partners in
Development concept. 
<P>
<LI>Another clear example of the influence of Model Projects, and
the result of upstream
work during the year, is the growing interest in many Member
States to formulate new
project requests to meet the requirements set for Model Projects.
These requests are currently
undergoing appraisal and, where required, further clarifications
or refinements are being
made in consultation with the country counterparts.  Several
on-going projects are achieving
quality level of Model Projects, inter alia, through achieving
significant impact and may be
upgraded to Model Projects status.
<P>
<LI>The Agency, and some counterpart organizations have gained
valuable experience in
designing and managing technical cooperation projects that
transfer the benefits of nuclear
technology to end users for social and economic gain.  Some of
the lessons relate to various
aspects of the project cycle; identification, formulation,
implementation, and evaluation. 
Other lessons relate to programme planning and co-ordination of
Agency activities with other
technical and developmental organizations.  The experience of
other specialized UN Agencies
shows that clear programmatic objectives and sound design
criteria can be the basis for
formal co-financing arrangements with major donors.  As reflected
in GOV/INF/779 on the
lessons learned to date from Model Projects, experience also
shows that supplemental
financing can be secured if projects are of sufficient quality
and if beneficiary countries are
also prepared to take supportive action.  It is envisaged that as
additional Model Projects are
approved, the likelihood that additional resources from
traditional and new sources of funding
will be identified for technical co-operation activities, will
also improve.
<P>
<IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> <B>Country Programme
Frameworks</B>
<P>
<LI>During the year, increased emphasis was placed on   "upstream
work"   to prepare the
1997-1998 Biennial Programme. Upstream work refers to programme
planning done in
consultation with counterpart institutions to establish
priorities, capabilities and opportunities
for efficient and effective technical co-operation.  Country
Programme Frameworks (CPFs)
were the central upstream activity to focus future technical
cooperation  activities on national
priorities and identify specific follow-up actions by the Agency
and  Member States.    CPFs
were recommended by the 1994 Technical Co-operation Policy Review
Seminar, as a means
to ensure that the Agency s technical co-operation activities are
directly linked to Member
States national development goals and priorities and thereby to
enhance the effectiveness of
the Agency's activities.  The introduction of CPFs represented a
transition to a more 
proactive
planning process aimed at strengthening the Agency's
effectiveness.
<P>
<LI>During 1995, a total of 15 CPF related missions were
conducted, and 28 Country
Programme Frameworks were drafted or completed.  This timely
result was achieved by
according high priority internally to the work, and by the strong
support received from the
Member States involved.
<P>
<LI>Several CPFs have already resulted in significant
improvements in programme focus
and priority.   For example, in Zimbabwe, five priority
activities, some linked to ongoing
successful Model Projects in other countries, were identified. 
In the Philippines, the CPF
identified specific projects within sectors of high priority to
the government, including
preventive nephrology to detect kidney disorders in children.
<P>   
<LI>Although the Agency had made a good start and gained a mix of
experience, it was
considered important to assess these initial results of the CPF
through an evaluation by
external and internal experts.  The evaluation was completed in
March 1996 and the results
will be reported to the Board after internal review.
<P>
<DL>
However, several lessons appear clear at this stage:
<P>
<DD><IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> The process of
country
planning for technical co-operation  - involving an analysis of
needs, capabilities and
expertise - is complex and places great demand on time and human
resources.
<P>
<DD><IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> The CPF activity
should be
understood as a process rather than a single document or mission.
<P>
<DD><IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> Upstream work
throughout
1995 succeeded in identifying a large number of   Model Project
opportunities.  However the
completed CPFs do not entirely reflect      this development.  To
better identify
opportunities, the CPF should integrate all   the upstream work
performed and past
experience gained.
<P>
<DD><IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> Successful CPFs
produce
specific outputs, such as action plans leading to project
submissions.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The lessons learned from the year's experience and the
evaluation will guide future
CPF activities.  A close focus will be kept on CPF quality, and
practical plans to conduct
CPF will be established, taking into account resource
constraints, to avoid a mechanistic
approach and unrealistic timeframes.
<P>
<IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> <B>Sectoral/thematic
planning</B>
<P>
<LI>The sectoral or thematic programming approach for technical
co-operation activities is
still being developed and more work is required before it can be
fully put to use.  Thematic
planning for technical co-operation is intended to be a either
global or regional process for
assessing technical requirements for the application of selected
nuclear techniques that can be
effectively and efficiently absorbed by recipient Member States. 
The process will establish
thematic programme objectives with enhanced co-ordination within
the Agency and with other
agencies and donors.  It therefore also offers the prospect of
attracting new funding sources.
<P>
<LI>At the present time effort is being concentrated on
developing thematic planning in the
areas of radiation and waste safety and human health (RIA).  The
TC Department and the
Nuclear Safety Division joined to investigate radiation and waste
safety infrastructures for all
TC recipients and to prepare Country Profiles that assess
compliance with the BSS. This
established a sectoral objective to upgrade safety infrastructure
in 53 countries not yet
meeting the BSS.  This objective formed the basis for an action
plan that included country
specific tasks, schedules and responsibilities for national
authorities.  Thematic planning for a
specific sector is also being elaborated in the radioimmunoassay
programme area.  
Significant results have already been achieved in most of the
countries evaluated in 1995 due
to well-defined objectives, sound project design and effective
integration of the various TC
components -- training, experts and equipment.  Thematic planning
for other selected areas
will be further developed in conjunction with the second
generation of Country Programme
Frameworks, and the next project planning cycle.
<P>
<B>II.   Improving scientific and technological capabilities</B>
<P>
<LI>The TC Programme continues to help build scientific and
technological capabilities in
Member States  as an important step in consolidating the base for
the Partner in Development
initiatives. Beginning in 1995, lengthy consultation were
initiated with Member States to
identify
capacity and infrastructure requirements necessary for meeting
their developmental
objectives. 
A number of significant activities in the five regions focused on
capacity building.
<P>
<LI>In the field of energy and electricity, planning activities
were undertaken to introduce
or upgrade capabilities in Member States with particular emphasis
on the use of IAEA
planning methodologies.  Exchange of information and experience
with the Member States
resulted in enhancements to the planning models MAED and WASP. 
The capabilities
generated through this programme would be used by Member States
in decision making
concerning future national energy and electricity systems and the
optimal role of nuclear
energy for power generation.
<P>
<LI>Member States with strong interest in following the option of
nuclear power plants
were provided relevant technical advice and specific training on
various aspects, from siting
to nuclear safety infrastructure.  For those already operating
nuclear power plants, the issues
concerning operational safety were addressed in a substantial
manner, particularly in Europe,
where the safety issues relating to the WWERs and RBMKs were the
main concern.  An
extensive programme of assistance was initiated in 1995 to
address the major backfitting
activities as well as strengthening the regulatory bodies in the
region.
<P>
<LI>In Asia and the Pacific, the Agency has been requested to
support NPP feasibility
studies in Thailand, Indonesia and Viet Nam.  The Agency is also
supporting NPP
preparations for Indonesia, Public Acceptance and Site Selection
for Thailand and ENPEP for
Viet Nam.
<P>
<LI>The field of nuclear medicine received considerable support
for upgradation of
manpower and facilities.  The range of activities covered the
introduction of basic
radioimmunoassay (RIA) kits for diagnostics, upgradation of
nuclear medicine equipment,
training for the maintenance use and QC of equipment, and QA in
all aspects of the
application
of nuclear medicine.  In addition, production, use and quality
control of radioisotopes and
radiopharmaceuticals received support in many Member States.
<P>
<LI>To improve the capability of Member States in Latin America
radiotherapy,
radiodiagnostic procedures and nuclear medicine, three national
projects on medical physics
education and training (ARG/6/007, COL/6/008 and Model Project
MEX/6/005) have been
initiated. Through these projects, national training programmes
in medical physics are being
established that will contribute to address the general shortage
of specialists in the region.  
<P>
<LI>A regional model project to improve the utility of the
existing nuclear medicine
equipment in Latin America started in 1995. Through this project
the technology and the
know-how for the upgrading of old and obsolete gamma-cameras is
being transferred to 15
countries
in the region. Up to now, five gamma-cameras have been upgraded
and 86 more will be
upgraded by the end of the project.
<P>
<LI>Through regional and national projects, special emphasis
continued to be placed in
building up capabilities for the optimal use of water and
fertilizers for improved crop
production.  Such activities were combined in some Member States
with the development of
special varieties to suit arid and semi-arid conditions through
radiation induced mutations.
<P>
<LI>In West Asia a regional workshop, consisting of technical
lectures and field
experiments, was held on the use of nuclear techniques in
improving fertigation and soil
water
balance with an emphasis on fields or protected crops grown under
drip irrigation.  Specific
needs of individual Member States were addressed through expert
missions.  The results of
on-going field studies in participating countries will be
carefully analyzed in order to plan
further actions.
<P>
<LI>Issues concerning crop protection and the use and fate of
pesticides in the
environment were addressed by many Member States with technical
support from the
Agency. 
Assessment and better management of underground and surface water
resources were
supported
through regional and national projects.
<P>
<LI>A regional Model Project on Water Resources for Africa is
aimed at consolidating the
capabilities of four participating Member States to use isotope
techniques to investigate the
water
quality and rates of replenishment in various aquifer systems.
<P>
<LI>Moreover, to strengthen local capabilities and to ensure
sustainability of activities
in the diverse fields of nuclear applications, a special emphasis
was placed on human
resource development through the provisions of fellowships and
the organization of training
courses.  Thus, about 280 African scientists and technicians
received training in 1995 for a
total duration of more than 900 man-months.
<P>
<IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> <B>The Special Training
Programme</B>
<P>
<LI>In recognizing the special needs of the Least Developed
Countries (LDC) the
Agency has initiated a scheme to facilitate the establishment of
basic national infrastructures
which would permit the adoption of relevant nuclear applications.

Under a special training
programme initiated in 1994 LDCs may request assistance in
training a limited number of
"key" staff.  The intention is that the trainees then train
others in the basic sciences - i.e.
nuclear
physics, radiochemistry, etc., at their home institutes.
<P>
<LI>Following selection and nomination, the IAEA's special
training programme
allows qualified applicants the opportunity to undertake either
graduate courses or to perform
research in areas not available in their home country.  Normally
the Agency encourages
shorter on-the-job training related to applied science
activities, rather than training towards
advanced degrees.  This approach provides the flexibility to
split (hence the name of
"sandwich" programme) the training during several years between
an "advanced" country and
their own home institution where an advanced degree or
certification may not be available. 
To-date, the  Agency has selected some 12 candidates for this
training from Ethiopia,
Namibia, Senegal, Sudan and Zaire.  Currently institutes in the
Nordic countries are
participating in the programme under the coordination of the
International Science
Programme (ISP) of the Uppsala University, Sweden, as well as in
the International Centre
for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Italy.
<P>
<LI>Another new development related to special training (see
Resolution
GC(XXXVI)/584) is the introduction of educational courses in
radiation protection.  It
consists of a comprehensive training programme including
post-graduate professional courses,
specialized short courses, seminars and workshops to take place
between 1996-2000.  The
training will be on a regional basis and  given in the
appropriate official languages of the
Agency.
<P>
<LI>This programme, which combines activities of education and
training, is designed to
provide both theoretical and practical experience in the
multidisciplinary development of
radiation protection standards and their implementation.  Such
training activities are over and
above those planned under the Model Project - radiation and waste
saftey infrastructures
(INT/9/143), thus completing the coverage to all TC recipient
Member States.
<P>
<B>III.   New initiatives since the 1995 General Conference</B>
<P>
<LI>The most significant new developments since the 1995 General
Conference relate
to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> Technical
Co-operation
among Developing Countries (TCDC)
<P>
<DD><IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> Performance and
evaluation
methodology
<P>
<DD><IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> Standing Advisory
Group on
Technical Assistance and Co-operation  (SAGTAC). 
</DL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> <B>Technical
Co-operation among
Developing Countries (TCDC)</B>
<P>
<LI>TCDC encourages regional self reliance and the sharing of
common experience
and as such can contribute to increasing the effectiveness and
efficiency of the Agency's
Technical Co-operation.   This approach is not new to the Agency.

The RCA Programme,
for example, has been making extensive use of TCDC to increase
the use of practical
problem
solving nuclear technology in regional industries and thereby
encourage regional industrial
competitiveness.  Last year this project was one of 10 selected
by the Joint Inspection Unit to
compare results and field level impacts of U.N. sponsored
intercountry projects in the Asia-
Pacific region.  It was rated number one in the evaluation with a
score of 96 out of 100
points;
one of the best reviews ever made for a project in the field of
science and technology.  The
RCA network of co-operating Member States was described as a
"model" for TCDC.  The
use
of experts from developing countries has also increased in 1995
to 1812, or 47% of all expert
assignments.  During 1995, 90 group training activities were
hosted by developing countries
which represents 76% of all training courses.
<P>
<LI>Building on this earlier experience, the Agency is
considering new opportunities
to employ TCDC, subject of course to the wishes of Member States
concerned.  One model
for
TCDC is the use within a particular region of national
organizations and experts with
practical
experience gained, inter alia, through Agency technical
co-operation and training to provide
services to other regional countries.  Slovakia for example,
developed a full nuclear
regulatory
authority with the Agency's assistance through the Model Project
SLR/9/005 and is now
supporting the restructuring of Ukraine's Nuclear Regulatory
Authority under the
responsibility
of the Agency.   The TCDC approach is also being applied to other
projects in Europe using
the
expertise of institutions in South Africa, Croatia, Romania, and
Hungary.  Greater emphasis
will
continue to be placed on TCDC activities, in full co-operation
with developing Member
States.
<P>
<IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> <B>Performance and
evaluation
methodology</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency's evaluation of Technical Co-operation activities
has focused on the
following developments.  First, recognition of the positive
effect on programme
implementation
of quantifying and measuring results has led to renewed efforts
on project design and the
development of a quality measurement  methodology.  The
establishment of
performance indicators is the foundation for a systematic
evaluation methodology, and the
success with the Model Projects was the critical first step.
<P>
<LI>Second, the experience gained from the evaluation of the AFRA
programmes
has provided an important start for introducing a system to
assess performance in quantitative
terms.  Evaluation criteria were identified and standards were
set up against which activities
were assessed.  Both the relevance of the programme s objectives
and the design quality of
AFRA activities were assessed within this system.

<P>
<LI>Considerable attention has been paid to refining project
designs and improving
implementation through the introduction of project workplans, as
reflected in the Model
Project concept, and thereby extend the  "discipline"  of Model
Projects throughout the
Programme.  The discipline of Model Projects refers to the need
to adopt clear standards for
programme project planning, project formulation, monitoring and
performance, and
evaluation.  Adherence to such standards enhances the
<I>quality</I> and effectiveness
of the Programme.  This does not mean that all projects should be
directed at achieving a
specific social or economic benefit.  However it does mean that
all projects should have
verifiable objectives directed at clearly defined problems.
<P>
<LI>One such standard for project design is clear objectives that
are quantitative and
measurable through identified performance indicators and success
criteria.   This standard
promotes clear understanding of responsibilities and
expectations, and improves the likelihood
of achieving project objectives. A detailed review was undertaken
of on-going Model Projects
to determine the extent to which the objectives were defined in a
measurable way, and to
identify verifiable performance indicators and success criteria,
as well as progress reporting
mechanisms for assessing achievements. This exercise, completed
successfully for all 23
on-going Model Projects, involved close collaboration between the
project management and
the evaluation team.  Project monitoring will now be based on
these indicators.   Expanded
use of performance indicators in normal projects proposed for the
1997-1998 programme is
an important step toward a systematic and standard methodology to
"quantify" programme
performance and a further example of how Model Projects are
influencing overall project
design.
<P>
<LI>These refinements, and particularly the emphasis on programme
planning,
design and performance, are having a significant influence on the
quality of the Programme
as a whole.  Additional information on evaluation activities
during 1995 can be obtained from
the section on Evaluation contained in the Technical Co-operation
Report for 1995,
GOV/2858. 
<P>
<LI>In an effort to strengthen the ARCAL programme and to
increase the possibilities
of achieving a greater impact and a successful implementation,
national coordinators have
adopted a system for assessing projects (SEPA) which aims at
improving the formulation,
implementation and monitoring of projects through a systematic
supervision of their different
stages.  The new system, developed as a simplification of
classical project evaluation
methods, has been designed to be compatible with the procedures
used by IAEA in its
technical cooperation projects.   Special care has been taken to
avoid possible differences in
management procedures.
<P>
<LI>Participants from all ARCAL Member States have been trained
in the new system
which has already been put into practice.  This harmonized
approach for preparing,
formulating and assessing impact will greatly strengthen future
ARCAL programmes.
<P>
<IMG SRC="little.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP> <B>Standing Advisory
Group on
Technical Assistance and Co-operation</B>
<P>
<LI>The first meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee on
Technical  Assistance and
Co-operation (SAGTAC) was held in November 1995.  This meeting
completed the
organizational phase of SAGTAC, and, in accordance with its Terms
of Reference,  began
the process of assessment and recommendation on policies,
strategies and measures to
enhance the scientific, technological and socio-economic benefits
to the Agency s Member
States, especially developing countries, through the effective
and efficient transfer of nuclear
and associated technology.
<P>
<DL>
During its meeting SAGTAC established the following three working
priorities:
<P>
<DD>i) The elaboration of the Agency s strategic objective for
technical co-
        operation;
<P>
<DD>ii)     The identification of essential issues related to the
achievement of this
             objective; and
<P>
<DD>iii)    The development of a workplan to guide its efforts.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The workplan established by SAGTAC incorporated seven
priority issues which fall
under two broad headings;  i) the "Partnership in Development"
concept including  "reaching
end users"  and  the impact of technical co-operation activities,
the  "special value"  of
certain techniques; and ii) the "process" of management of
technical co-operation, including
programme planning, project identification, implementation and
the accountability and
responsibility for project results.  These two groups of issues
became the subject of working
papers for the second meeting of  SAGTAC held in Islamabad,
Pakistan, from 21-25 April
1996. 
<P>
<LI>A third item for discussion at the meeting in Islamabad was
the review of The
Revised Guiding Principles and General Operating Rules to Govern
the Provision of
Technical Assistance by the Agency - INFCIRC/267.  A working
group will begin analysis in
June, with the full review scheduled to begin at the next SAGTAC
meeting in November
1996.  This review is needed since the environment within which
technical co-operation takes
place has changed dramatically since 1979 when the Guiding
Principles were issued.  In
1979, the Agency delivered $8.6 million in technical assistance,
compared to $63 million last
year.  Further, the provisions of the Guiding Principles dealing
with Financial procedures do
not fully conform with the new Financial Regulations and Rules
approved by the Board and
issued last year.  During the next two years SAGTAC is expected
to make recommendations
on how the Guiding Principles can be updated to strengthen
technical co-operation in the
years beyond 2000. 
<P>
<B>TC management and operations</B>
<P>
<LI>In parallel with efforts to improve programming activities
with Member States,
internal measures are being introduced to streamline managerial
practices and to enhance staff
performance through a variety of training activities.
<P>
<LI>Efforts intensified to complete projects and reduce routine
work for project and
technical officers.  Over 300 project closures during 1995
brought the total closures for the
last two years to almost 600 projects.  The emphasis on fewer
projects will also help focus
resources on larger projects with greater potential for creating
significant impact.  
<P>
<LI>Decentralized approval for programme changes and automated
approval forms has
increased efficiency in the Division of Technical Co-operation
Programmes (TCPM), as will
the electronic submission of TC project requests from Member
States.  Developmental work
continues for new computer applications to support experts, field
procurement and training
course implementation.  These new systems will add dynamic new
monitoring and reporting
capabilities and improve resource  management.  During the next
two years work will
intensify to complete an integrated PC/LAN based TC project
information management
system (TC-PIMS) that will greatly strengthen project management
through improved project
planning, organization and systematic monitoring and reporting.
<P>
<LI>Communications and the flow of information were also enhanced
by access to
Internet services.  The Agency's "World Atom" includes Technical
Co-operation listings of
unrestricted documents and recent articles and publications. 
Expanding electronic
communications with other organizations and Member States
envisaged in the 1995-96 TC
Information Technology Plan will greatly facilitate communication
with suppliers, experts and
host institutes and improve programme implementation and quality.
<P> 
<B>IV. Resources and Delivery</B>
<P>
<LI>New records for financial implementation and performance were
achieved in 1995. 
For the second year the amount of unobligated resources carried
forward between years was
significantly reduced - by some 35% - due to record overall
implementation of 75.7%. 
Progressive
use of overprogramming authority was largely responsible for
overall implementation
increases, but
the higher rate of implementation for Model projects (85.5%)
reflects the consequences of
better
planning and realistic budgeting as well as the impact of
strengthened project management
and
procedural streamlining.  In every area of project implementation
delivery was higher than
previous
years and records were set in delivering 40% more goods and
services to Member States than
was
delivered three years earlier.
<P>
<LI>The downward trend over recent years in resources for
technical co-operation has
improved.  The amount pledged to the TCF in 1995 was the highest
percentage in the last
five years
reaching 77.5%, higher than the 72% anticipated for at the
beginning of the year, but still
well
below levels achieved during the 1980s.  Two Member States made
pledges toward the end
of last
year totaling $3.3 million which brought them into conformity
with their 1995 target.  Four
Governments made additional pledges worth $1.2 million to the
1994 TCF target during
1995. 
Total resources available of $63.5 million for technical
co-operation activities in 1995 were
the
highest ever, due to unexpected contributions to the TCF and 
significant increases in interest
income and assessed programme costs (APC).  Payments by recipient
Member States for
assessed
programme costs exceeded $2 million for the first time, an
increase of 36% over 1994. 
However,
over $6.6 million outstanding APC remains in arrears. 
<P>
<LI>Discussions with Member States on the 1997-98 Technical
Co-operation programme
are being undertaken bearing in mind the Board's report to the
General Conference on the
Financing of Technical Assistance and the Financing of Safeguards
(GC/39/23, paragraph
4(a)) recommending that the General Conference "urge all Member
States to pledge and pay
in full their shares of the targets for voluntary contributions
to the TCF and urge the Agency
to take due account of the extent to which Member States have
paid their TCF target shares
when determining the allocation of resources for TC projects and
for the procurement of
equipment and expert services for TC activities".
<P>
<B>V. Outlook</B>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat will continue to appraise the General
Conference and the Board of
Governors of the status of initiatives undertaken and planned for
strengthening technical
co-operation activities.  The idea of a partnership in
development between the Agency, its
Member States and other external partners is developing as a
prominent feature of efforts to
strengthen technical co-operation and accelerate and enlarge the
contribution of  nuclear
technology to national development.  The concept involves ongoing
activities such as Model
Projects and CPFs, and new initiatives such as thematic planning
and expanded co-ordination
with developmental organizations.  It also involves closer
working relationships with all
parties to this new partnership.  Future reports will discuss
further development and
implementation of the Partners in Development Agenda.

<A HREF="gc40-6a1.html">(GC(40)/6/Add. 1)</A>.</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In resolution <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r24.html
">GC(39)/RES/24 (1995)</A>, the General Conference,
inter alia, called upon
all
parties directly concerned:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"to consider seriously taking the practical and appropriate steps
required for the
implementation of
the proposal to establish a mutually and effectively verifiable
nuclear-weapon-free zone
(NWFZ)
in the region" of the Middle East.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The resolution in this regard, requested the Director General:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to continue consultations with the States of the Middle East to
facilitate the early application
of full-
scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region
as relevant to the preparation
of
model agreements, as a necessary step towards the establishment
of a NWFZ in the region".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>The resolution also took note:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"of the importance of the ongoing bilateral Middle East peace
negotiations and the activities
of the
multilateral working group on Arms Control and Regional Security
in promoting mutual
confidence
and security in the Middle East, including establishment of a
NWFZ",
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
and called upon the Director General, as requested by the
participants:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"to render all necessary assistance to the working group in
promoting that objective".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>The resolution further called upon all States in the region
to extend their fullest
co-operation
to the Director General in the fulfilment of the tasks entrusted
to him and requested the
Director
General:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"to submit to the Board of Governors and to the General
Conference at its fortieth regular
session
a report on the implementation of this resolution ...".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>It may be recalled that the Director General submitted to the
General Conference, in
1992,
a report contained in document GC(XXXVI)/1019 of 16 September
1992 which described the
kinds
of obligations which might be undertaken, in a Middle East NWFZ
agreement, by the States
located
in the region and by the declared nuclear-weapon States. Such
obligations were characterised
as
falling within three broad categories:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i)   Those precluding research and development on and the
possession, acquisition,
          manufacture or stationing of nuclear weapons or nuclear
explosive devices;
<P>
<DD>(ii)  those precluding research and development on and the
production, importing or
          stockpiling of weapons-usable materials (i.e. uranium
enriched to 20 per cent or
          more in uranium 235 and separated plutonium) and
requiring the disclosure of all
          nuclear activities, including research and development,
imports, exports and
          production; and
<P>
<DD>(iii) those requiring the application of safeguards to all
nuclear material, installations
and
          relevant equipment and non-nuclear material.
</DL>
<P>
The report further identified types of obligations described in
the three broad categories which
had
already been entered into by States in the Middle East whether by
reason of their membership
in
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), or
because of other pertinent
considerations.
<P>
<LI>As well as describing the kinds of material obligations which
might form part of a
Middle
East NWFZ agreement, the Director General's report submitted in
1992 identified possible
verification requirements in such a zone, noting that in view of
the particular circumstances
of the
Middle East and its underlying tensions, creating confidence in a
Middle East NWFZ would
most
likely require far-reaching and comprehensive verification
arrangements. As noted in
document
GC(XXXVI)/1019, institutional arrangements combining
international and regional
verification in
a NWFZ, can be devised.  
<P>
<LI>However, as stated by the Director General in his previous
reports, for him to be able
to
proceed further in examining verification modalities which might
feature in a Middle East
NWFZ,
and in particular to develop the model agreements foreseen, inter
alia, in resolution
GC(39)/RES/24, it would be helpful if States which have not yet
responded to the Director
General's request for views on the obligations, verification
requirements and modalities
described
in document GC(XXXVI)/1019 were to provide them.  In this regard
and notwithstanding the
call
upon relevant States, in GC(39)/RES/24, to extend their fullest
co-operation to the Director
General, no further replies have been received to the Director
General's letters of November
1992
seeking States' views about possible material obligations
included in a Middle East NWFZ
agreement or on verification requirements and modalities.
<P>
<LI>Paragraphs 8-10 of the Director General's 1995 report to the
General Conference in
document GOV/2825-GC(39)/20 described Secretariat participation,
as part of the United
Nations
delegation, in the work of the multilateral working group on Arms
Control and Regional
Security
(ACRS).  The report recalled, inter alia, that following a
proposal by the Secretariat, the
IAEA and
the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) organized, with
the co-operation and
assistance of the relevant German authorities, a visit, by
regional participants in the
multilateral
working group's deliberations, to the Phillipsburg Nuclear Power
Plant in Germany in
October 1994
to see a practical demonstration of nuclear verification
techniques and to become more fully
acquainted with the ways in which regional verification
structures and activities complement
international verification in Europe. The visit appeared to be
helpful in further acquainting
Middle
East participants with the practicalities of nuclear
verification, including through co-operative
arrangements with regional systems. 
<P>
<LI>At the sixth Plenary meeting of the working group on ACRS
held in Tunis from 13-
15 December 1994 in which the Secretariat participated, again as
part of the United Nations
delegation, in fulfilment of the mandate conferred upon the
Director General by resolution
<A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/glance/policy/gcres21.html"
>GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21</A>, there was a wide-ranging exchange of
views
about whether to undertake
further work on generic verification techniques and principles.
In this connection,
consideration was
given to a proposal for a workshop on a model safeguards
agreement for the Middle East
which
would have led the participants to explore how such an
arrangement might work technically.
No
meeting of the ACRS working group has been held since the sixth
Plenary meeting. 
<P>
<LI>As requested by the General Conference, the Director General 
continued his
consultations
with States of the Middle East, including further visits to the
region. Since his report
contained in
document GOV/2825-GC(39)/20, the Director General has visited
Israel, Kuwait, Oman,
Algeria,
Morocco and Egypt.  
<P>
<LI>During these visits, the Director General continued to
underline the importance of
verification measures for a nuclear weapon free zone in the
Middle East and to explain the
various
options available to the States of the region in this regard.
There continue to be common
understanding among these States that verification measures would
need to be more
far-reaching
than current safeguards in States with comprehensive safeguards
agreements and that some
form
of regional or mutual verification might need to be established
in addition to verification by
the
IAEA to create additional regional confidence. In this
connection, the Director General
highlighted
the importance of Agency's current efforts to strengthen its
safeguards system, particularly
with
regard to increasing its capability to detect undeclared nuclear
activities, in order to provide
additional assurances, both globally and regionally, in the
exclusively peaceful nature of
nuclear
activities.
<P>
<LI>There continued, however, to be difference of views among
States of the region as to
the
timing of the application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all
nuclear activities in the
Middle East
as well as the timing of the establishment of a NWFZ in that
region. Most States believe that
the
application of full-scope Agency safeguards to all nuclear
activities in the Middle East  -
possibly
through adhesion to the NPT, or through the establishment of a
nuclear-weapon-free zone - is
a step
that should be taken prior to or concurrently with the conclusion
of peace agreements as an
important arms control and security measure that cannot lag
behind peace agreements. One
State,
on the other hand, believes that application of full-scope
safeguards and the establishment of a
nuclear weapon free zone should await and follow the conclusion
of comprehensive peace in
the
region because arms control measures should be the outcome of
peace and detente.
<P>
<LI>The general concept of NWFZs and in particular of such a zone
in the Middle East
has
continued to be a focus of discussion in other fora. Thus, a
further resolution supporting the
establishment of a Middle East NWFZ, resolution 50/66, was
adopted by the United Nations
General Assembly without a vote on 12 December 1995 and which,
inter alia, recognized
"the
importance of credible regional security, including the
establishment of a mutually verifiable
nuclear
weapon free zone".  
<P>
<LI>The Director General will continue his efforts, pursuant to
the mandate entrusted to
him by
the General Conference, of contributing to the development of
verification modalities for such
a
zone. The report of the Director General in GC(XXXVI)/1019 of
1992 inter alia noted that
there
were many options and problems on which a consensus would be
needed among the parties
for the
establishment of a Middle East NWFZ.  It noted also that it is
only through a process of
discussion
that the choices of options and the answers to problems, which in
many instances will be
decisive
for the safeguards model agreements foreseen in General
Conference resolutions, can emerge.
With
this in mind, and with a view further to encourage States of the
Middle East to convey their
views
about relevant issues, the Director General intends to pursue his
consultations with such States
in
Vienna and visits to the region.  
<P>
<LI>It is still to be hoped that through written response from
relevant States, through
consultation
and through the Agency's  participation in the working group on
ACRS, the views of relevant
States, especially with regard to material obligations to be
assumed in a Middle East NWFZ
and
to possible verification modalities, will be clarified to an
extent to enable the Director General
to
prepare model verification agreements envisaged in resolutions
GC(39)/RES/24,
GC(XXXVIII)/RES/21, GC(XXXVII) /RES/627 and GC(XXXVI)/RES/601.

1.    I present herewith the Agency's accounts for the year ended
31 December 1995. Part I contains the External Auditor's report
to the Board of Governors on the audit of the accounts. The
Agency's accounts, comprising Statements I to V and Schedules A
to G, are presented in Parts II and III, respectively. Part IV,
entitled 'Notes to the financial statements' describes the
purpose and financing of the Funds and the authority under which
they are administered, and the significant accounting policies
applied by the Secretariat in preparing the statements and
schedules. The notes offer the reader additional information on
significant items and events which could have a bearing on the
financial position of the Agency, or of funds in its possession
or under its control.
<P>         
I. Significant changes
<P>         
2. On 1 January 1995, a set of revised Financial Regulations and
Financial Rules went into
effect. As a result, this year's accounts use the names and fund
structure reflected in those
Regulations and Rules. In particular, the following changes were
made:

<P>        
In order to give effect to the establishment of the new
Extrabudgetary Programme Fund and the Technical Co-operation
Extrabudgetary Fund, the individual Funds shown under Fund group
IV in 1994 have been divided accordingly, and separate financial
statements are now shown for technical co-operation and other
extrabudgetary activities.
<P>         
3. Statements for the International Centre for Theoretical
Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy, appear in the Agency's accounts
for the last time. The administrative responsibility for the
Centre was transferred to the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on 1 January 1996.
<P>
4. The United Nations system accounting standards adopted by the
Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions - Finance and
Budget (CCAQ - FB) on behalf of the Administrative Committee on
Co-ordination (ACC) in 1995 has been reviewed by the Secretariat.
A separate paper explaining the major accounting and statement
presentation changes which are expected from the Agency in this
respect has been prepared for Member States' information.
<P>         
5. Fund Group IV includes the following new accounts under the
Technical Co-operation Extrabudgetary Fund:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>China, People's Republic of - to administer contributions in
support of a footnote a/ project and to the Agency's Regional
Co-operative Agreement (RCA).
<P>         
<DD>Philippines - to administer contributions in support of the
Agency's Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA).
<P>
<DD>Thailand - to administer contributions in support of the
Agency's Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA).
</DL>
<P>
<B>II. Financial Highlights</B>
<P>
<I>General</I>
<P>
6. The Agency's general financial situation has been marked by a
significant decrease in overall cash resources compared to last
year, mainly due to lower assessment collection in the Regular
Budget Fund towards the end of the year. Total Agency cash
holdings at the end of the year amounted to $ 86.4 million (1994:
$ 114.8 million).
<P>         
7. The United Nations rate of exchange of the Austrian schilling 
versus the United States dollar has dropped from 11.00 in January
to 10.00 in December 1995, with a low of 9.60 in May and June.
This resulted in overall gains on exchange from revaluation of
cash holdings in Fund groups I, II and III reflected in
Statements I.D, II.D and III.D under the item "Provision for
revaluation of cash". Gains on exchange from revaluation of
currencies are used to offset potential future losses.
<P>
<I>Fund Group I. Regular Budget Fund and Working Capital Fund</I>
<P>     
8.    Appropriations originally approved in the amount of $ 211
557 000 at the rate of AS 12.70 to the US dollar, were
recalculated at $ 258 615 000 using the average rate of exchange
of AS 10.03, in accordance with Resolution GC (XXXVIII)/RES/2
Attachment.
<P>         
9.    Cash in banks declined sharply from $ 54.8 million in 1994
(Regular Budget Fund $ 39.1 million and Working Capital Fund $
15.7 million) to $ 18.1 million in 1995 in the Regular Budget
Fund, including the Working Capital Fund. This was due to an
increase in current year assessments
outstanding from $ 30.8 million in 1994 to $ 82.6 million in
1995.
<P>
10.   In November 1995, an advance from the Working Capital Fund
totalling $ 15.8 million and of part of the retained cash
surpluses became necessary to carry out the approved programmes.
By the end of 1995, the total Working Capital Fund and $ 18.2
million of prior years' cash surpluses were utilized.
<P>
11.   The 1994 cash surplus amounted to $ 25.5 million (1993 cash
surplus: $ 7.5 million), due to improvements in the collection
for prior years' arrears, savings on prior years' obligations and
unspent balances of deferred programme activities. Of the 1994
Deferred Programme activities set up in the amount of $ 13.5
million, $ 10.3 million were spent or obligated, leaving $ 3.2
million to be returned to the 1994 cash surplus (Statement
I.A.2).
<P>         
12.   The 1995 budgetary surplus of $ 8.3 million (1994: S 19.3
million) consists of the following (in millions S):

<P>
The decrease in 1995 over 1994 is due to the return to normal
implementation of Regular Budget programmes which led to a fuller
use of approved appropriations. The budgetary surplus will turn
into a cash surplus once the majority of the 1995 arrears of
assessed contributions is paid in 1996 (Statement I.C). Details
on programme and budgetary performance of the Regular Budget as
well as other Agency activities are given in a separate note
issued by the Secretariat under the heading "Report on Programme
and Budgetary Performance in 1995".
<P>
<I>Fund Group II. General Fund - Technical Co-operation Fund</I>
<P>         
13. The financial situation of this Fund is stable. A slight
increase in cash is due to improved collection of voluntary
contributions. Total pledges amounted to $ 47.7 million (1994: $
42.4 million) against a target of $ 61.5 million (1994: S 58.5
million).
<P>
<I>Other Fund groups</I>
<P>         
14. The financial situation of Fund groups III, IV and V is
stable. The resources are based on extrabudgetary contributions
from Member States or Member State institutions received before
the respective activities are undertaken, or funding agreements
with United Nations or other international organizations.

<CENTER><B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>1. In accordance with Article XIV.A of the Statute, the Board
of Governors hereby submits to the General Conference the
Agency's
programme and budget estimates for 1997 and 1998.  The Board
requests the General Conference to adopt the draft resolutions in
respect of 1997 set out in Annex I.
<P>
<DD>2. The programme proposals for 1997-1998 involve:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- the consolidation, discontinuation or phasing down of
certain activities deemed to be of less importance than hitherto;
<P>
<DD>- the assumption of significant savings in the areas of
travel costs and translation, general services, printing and
procurement;
<P>
<DD>- significant redistribution of the resulting resources to
additional programme activities in Major Programme 1 (Nuclear
Power and Fuel Cycle), Major Programme 2 (Nuclear Applications),
Major Programme 3 (Nuclear, Radiation and Waste Safety), and
Major Programme 5 (Management of Technical Co-operation for
Development); and
<P>
<DD>- an increase in the overall resources for Major Programme 4
(Nuclear Verification and Security of Material) in addition to an
internal redistribution.
</DL>
<P>
<B>PROPOSED PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR 1997 AND 1998</B>
<P>
<B>Regular Budget</B>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>10. The budget estimates for 1997 and 1998 have been based on
an exchange rate of AS12.70 to US$1.00, the same used for the
1996 estimates.  In line with the split appropriation and
assessment system, the US dollar is used only so as to present
the estimates in a single currency, even though the estimates are
to a large extent Austrian Schilling based and only to a small
extent linked to the US dollar.
<P>
<DD>11. For 1997, the total regular budget estimates amount to
$221 992 000, of which $216 698 000 are foreseen for Agency
programmes and the balance of $5 294 000 represents reimbursable
work for others (see Table 1).  The latter amount has to be
covered completely by income in respect of the services provided
to other international organizations or other Funds
<P>
<DD>12. The preliminary regular budget estimates for 1998 amount
to $230 060 000, of which $224 568 000 are in respect of Agency
programmes.
<P>
<DD>13. The budget estimates for 1998 have been prepared with the
same degree of detail and accuracy as those for 1997 and are
considered to be a realistic assessment of the financial
resources which will be necessary for the implementation of the
1998 programme.  They may, however, require adjustment as a
result of possible changes in programme emphasis or of factors
outside the control of the Agency.

<LI>On 9 September 1996, the Board of Governors discussed a report by the Chairman of the Open-Ended Consultative Group on Article VI of the Statute, to which were attached a formal proposal for amending Article VI submitted by Morocco (see Annex 1 to the Attachment hereto) and informal proposals submitted by Pakistan (Annex 2) and Spain (Annex 3).  It may be recalled that certified copies of the Moroccan proposal were circulated by the Director General in June 1995 pursuant to Article XVIII.A of the Statute and was discussed at the thirty-ninth regular session of the General Conference. <A HREF="#note_*"><SUP>*/</SUP></A> The Board agreed that the report, together with the summary records of the Board's discussion on the matter, should be transmitted to the General Conference in response to the request made in resolution GC(39)/RES/21. The report is contained in the Attachment hereto. The summary records of the Board's discussion will be issued as an Addendum to the present document.
<P>
<LI>The Board's observations on the proposal submitted by Morocco which are required under Article XVIII.C(i) of the Statute, are set out in the Chairman's summing-up of the Board's discussion (see the above-mentioned summary records).

<B>AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE VI OF THE STATUTE
<P>

Report to the Board of Governors
by the Chairman of the Open-ended
Consultative Group on Article VI of the Statute
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>On 22 September 1995, the General Conference of the IAEA adopted without a vote resolution GC(39)/RES/21, which requested "the Board of Governors to continue consultations with Member States through the existing Open-ended Consultative Group and to submit its report and recommendations on proposed amendments to Article VI for approval by the General Conference at its fortieth regular session".
<P>
<LI>The Board, at its meeting on 25 September 1995, decided that the Open-ended Consultative Group should continue its work and that it should report back to the Board at an appropriate time.  The Board, at its December session, invited Ambassador Bjer of Denmark to chair the deliberations of the Open-ended Consultative Group.
<P>
<LI>Meetings of the Open-ended Consultative Group were held on 22 February 1996, on 17 May 1996 and on 4 September 1996.  Prior and in addition to these more formal discussions within the Group there has been a series of informal bilateral consultations with a large number of Member States.
<P>
<LI>In its discussions the Group has based itself on the following
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)	the comprehensive report by the previous Chairperson of the Open-ended Consultative Group, Ambassador Fgen Ok of Turkey, to the 39th session of the General Conference of the IAEA (GC(39)/21);
<P>
<DD>(b)	the amendment of Article VI proposed by the Kingdom of Morocco, which remains the only proposal formally submitted (Annex 1); 
<P>
<DD>(c)	an informal proposal presented by Pakistan on 17 May 1996 (Annex 2); and
<P>
<DD>(d)	informal amendments by Spain to the Moroccan and Pakistan proposals (Annex 3).
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Despite the very competent work done by previous chairpersons through the last decade, as well as the cooperative spirit and thoughtful contributions of many Member States during and in the margin of the meetings of the Group, it has not been possible to reach an agreement on recommendations on proposed amendments to Article VI for approval by the General Conference at its fortieth regular session.  A number of Member States have been reluctant to accept any amendment of Article VI, arguing that the present composition of the Board is adequate and/or, that any decision on enlargement would have to await the evolution of certain other questions, such as the composition of the area groups referred to in Article VI and, possibly the outcome of CTBTO negotiations on organizational matters. A few Member States, however, have given me to understand that their acceptance of any amendment to Article VI would presuppose a resolution of the question of the composition of area groups. 
<P>
<LI>The trend, however, seems to be a convergence of opinions towards considering a limited increase in the size of the Board to be justified.  Also there seems to be a universally shared assumption that the solution must be reached through consensus.
<P>
<LI>Some Member States argued that the size of any such enlargement should take into account the legitimate demands of different area groups for better representativity as well as keeping the balance between designated and elected members.  Other Member States, comprising those reluctant to change in the size of the Board, have argued that the size of any increase is really the key issue.  While the former group of countries has stressed the significance of representativity the latter has emphasized the importance of efficiency.
<P>
<LI>If the demands of the countries stressing representativity are to be met, the increase is likely to be around 10 new members.  This number has so far not been acceptable to those stressing efficiency.  If, on the other hand, the numbers suggested by the countries underlining efficiency are used as a yardstick, the increase will be in the order of 2 or 3 new members.  This, however, does not fulfill the demands of those seeking greater representativity of the Board.
<P>
<LI>It has also been proposed to change the number of area groups from the present 8 to 5, as is known in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.   It has however been the predominant preference of Member States to maintain the existing grouping.
<P>
<LI>Several Member States have argued in favour of allowing for immediate re-election to the area seats of the Board.  As proposed, this possibility would be restricted to only two consecutive terms of office.  There has been little, if any, opposition to this proposal.
<P>
<LI>From the deliberations of the Open-ended Consultative Group so far, there seems to be a consensus among Member States that any amendment to Article VI should resolve the issue of representation for the foreseeable future and should include an agreement not to re-open the issue for an agreed period, for example ten years.
<P>
<LI>A possible compromise would therefore most likely include the following elements:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	a small numerical increase in the number of designated members of the Board of Governors,
<P>
<DD>-	no change in the number of the area groups, as set out in Article VI of the Statute,
<P>
<DD>-	possibility of immediate re-election to the area seats of the Board,
<P>
<DD>- a gentlemen's agreement that the issue of amendment of Article VI is put to rest for a 10 year period after the adoption of any change in the composition of the Board by the General Conference. 
</DL>
<P>
<LI>In conclusion, it has not yet been possible to reach a consensus on changing the size and composition of the Board.  There has, however, been some progress in reconciling the views of many Member States. 
<P>
<LI>It is therefore my view that good prospects exist for a consensus on amendments to Article VI, but that the objective of reaching such consensus can only be realized if a little more time is allowed for the process of negotiations.

<P>         
         "A member in this category of office will be eligible for re-election
         in the same category for two consecutive terms".
</DL>
<P>
<B>RATIONALE</B>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>The thoughts which have gone into this proposal are as follows:
<P>
<DD>1) All the presently designated members retain their designation.
<P>
<DD>2) Membership of the Board should be about 1/3rd of the total membership
         of IAEA.
<P>
<DD>3) Due account is taken of the under-presentation of the regions of Africa
         and MESA as mentioned in General Conference Resolution 389 and re-affirmed in subsequent resolutions.
<P>
<DD>4) Due account is taken of the technical and political changes that have taken
         place in the world after the last expansion of the Board, in particular the
         technological advancement of several Member States and the increase in
         the number of Member States in Eastern Europe and MESA following the
         break-up of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
<DD>5) The efficiency of the Board is promoted through the addition of Member
         States with active nuclear programmes. At the same time, the
         opportunities for election are increased due to the increase in designated
         members.
<P>
<DD>6) The distinction between globally and regionally designated members has
         been eliminated, in line with the current practice of the Board.

<P>
<I>Explanation</I>
<P>
1.-There is an increase of 10 seats in the Board, 6 designated
         and 4 elected. The Board will have 45 seats, 19 designated and
         26 elected. There is, therefore, an adequate balance between
         designated and elected seats
<P>         
         2.-Latin America, WEOG and eastern Europe will have one
         additional designated seat each. Africa will have one additional
         designated seats and 1 2/3 additional elected seats, and Asia
         two additional designated seat and 2 1/3 additional elected
         seats. In this way, the mandate of resolution GC(XXV)/RES/398.
         of 26 September 1981, has been fulfilled, since 7 of the 10
         additional seats are given to Africa (2 2/3) and Asia (3 1/3),
         in which MESA has been embodied. The distribution according to
         the geographical criterion is equitative and more or less
         proportional to the membership in each of the 5 Groups (unlike
         the present distribution which is arbitrary and keeps no
         proportionality with membership in the 8 artificial groups).
<P>         
         3.-WEOG absorbs the North America Group (USA and Canada), plus
         Australia and New Zealand. The new Group Asia will embody MESA,
         Far East and South East Asia and the Pacific (with the exception
         of Australia and New Zealand).
<P>         
         4.-The geographical allocation of seats is simplified since there
         are no longer fractions. The principle of re-election is maintained, although reduced to one additional term of duty.

<P>
<DL>
<DD>1) The 8 regional groups, which are constituted in an artificial
         way, are replaced by the usual distribution in UN practice of 5
         regional groups.
<P>
<DD>2) The same ratio of distribution as in the Pakistani proposal
         is maintained. Thus, the 8 members of the WEOG correspond to 5
         members from Western Europe, 2 Members from North America (USA
         and Canada) and one member from South Asia and Pacific
         (Australia). The 5 members of Asia corresponds to the 2 members
         from MESA and the 3 members from Far East.

<B>I.   INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
<LI>At the thirty-ninth regular session of the General
Conference, a draft resolution was
submitted  by Israel to the Committee of the Whole, under the
agenda item "Amendment of
Article VI of the Statute", which, in operative paragraph 2
thereof, calls for the adoption of
an attached "list<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> specifying
the Member
States belonging to the eight areas listed in Article
VI of the Agency's Statute" (a copy of the draft resolution,
GC(39)/COM.5/10, is set out in
Annex I to this report).
<P>
<LI>In GC(39)/RES/22  (see Annex II to this report), the General
Conference requested
the Director General "to study all the implications of the
proposal contained in document
GC(39)/COM.5/10 and to submit a report to the Board of
Governors"<A
HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.  The General Conference further
requested
that the Director General's report:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
take into account the general debate undertaken in this regard,
especially the view that the primary responsibility for deciding
upon the composition of regional groups lies with the respective
groups themselves and the view that every State has the right
to participate in a regional group...

Committee of the Whole

<P>
<LI>While the ten States referred to in paragraph 4(a) above are
to be designated without
reference to the areas in which they are located, each of the ten
must be associated with a
listed area in order for the outgoing Board to ascertain whether
any further member needs to
be designated  pursuant to paragraph 4(b) above (e.g., no further
member would need to be
designated if, by operation of the provisions described in
paragraph 4(a) above, one member
from each of six of the areas were designated and two members
from each of the two
remaining areas were designated).  The long-standing practice of
the Board, when announcing
the members it has designated, is to list those members in
alphabetical order without stating
the area to which any of them belongs.
<P>
<LI>Article VI.A. 2 of the Statute requires the General
Conference to elect to membership
of the Board twenty-two members, as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)  twenty members, with due regard to equitable
representation on the Board as
a whole of the members in the eight listed areas, so that the
elected members
of the Board shall at all times include:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-    five representatives of Latin America;
<DD>-    four representatives of Western Europe;
<DD>-    three representatives of Eastern Europe;
<DD>-    four representatives of Africa;
<DD>-    two representatives of the Middle East and South Asia;
<DD>-    one representative of South East Asia and the Pacific;
<DD>-    one representative of the Far East;
</DL>
<P>
<DD>(b)  one further member from among the members in the
following areas:  Middle
East and South Asia; South East Asia and the Pacific; Far East;
<P>
<DD>(c)  one further member from among the members in the
following areas:  Africa;
Middle East and South Asia; South East Asia and the Pacific.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>It is evident that Article VI is premised upon the assumption
that every Member State
of the Agency is within one of those areas.  If this were not the
case, a Member State that
was not within an area would be ineligible to serve as a member
of the Board.  Such
ineligibility would be contrary to the principle of the sovereign
equality of all of its Member
States, upon which the Agency is based and which is enshrined in
Article IV.C of the Statute.
<P>
<LI>Article VI.A.1 of the Statute does not speak of "geographical
groups", but rather
refers to "areas", not all of which are necessarily geographical.

Thus, "Latin America"
appears to be an ethnic-linguistic, rather than a geographical,
description.  Two apparently
geographical areas, "Western Europe" and "Eastern Europe",  have
obvious political
connotations.  At the Working Level Meeting on the draft Statute
in February 1956, the
representative of the USSR officially recorded his understanding
that "Eastern Europe" was
composed of twelve States which included Greece and Yugoslavia. 
The United States and the
United Kingdom representatives reserved their positions on that
understanding.  In fact,
Greece, which is geographically located to the east of several
acknowledged Eastern
European countries, has been elected to a Western European seat
on the Board, as has
Turkey, which is located even further to the east.  Further, even
with respect to areas that
appear to be purely geographical (e.g., "Middle East and South
Asia", "South East Asia and
the Pacific", "Far East" and "Africa"), the Statute gives no
guidance as to the boundaries of,
or the Member Sates that are within, these (or, indeed, any
other) areas.   Nor has the Board
or the General Conference developed any criteria or other
guidance to determine whether a
Member State is within one of the areas specified in Article VI
of the Statute.
<P>
<LI>Where a doubt exists as to whether a Member State is within a
particular area, it is
clear that the decision on that issue cannot be taken solely by
the Member States who are
acknowledged as being within that area.  The taking of a decision
by such States could result
in the State in question being excluded from all areas.  This is
not to say that account should
not be taken of the views of the Member States in the area
concerned.  Thus, the following
consensus opinion was reached in the Preparatory Commission which
negotiated the Agency's
Statute:  "In the separate elections of members of the Board of
Governors representing the
geographical areas listed in paragraph A.1 of Article VI, the
General Conference should take
account of the preference of the members concerned"
(IAEA/PC/OR.61, quoted in
GC.1/OR.2, para. 3).  It is evident from that language that the
views of the members of the
area concerned are not decisive.  Thus, at the fifth General
Conference, the Conference
elected Viet Nam to a Far East seat even though China and the
Philippines, two of the (at that
time) four acknowledged members of that area (the other two being
Japan and Korea), stated
that Viet Nam did not belong to the Far East area (GC(V)/OR.59,
paras. 1-9, 17-18).  Since
then, Viet Nam has been elected more than once to the Board as
representing the area of the
Far East. 
<P>
<LI>In these circumstances, the determination of whether a State
falls within a particular
area referred to in Article VI, or the development of a list of
States that fall within each of
the areas referred to in Article VI, is a matter that falls
within the co-responsibility of the
Board and the General Conference.  This is evident from the fact
that both organs have a role
to play in the composition of the Board.  The eight areas
referred to in Article VI are
relevant
to the action that each organ is to take under Article VI.  In
composing the Board, problems
would arise if the actions of the two organs were to be based on
different views of the States
that fell within each area in Article VI.

<P>
<LI>Differences of view as to which area a Member State belongs
have also been manifest
in the voting in elections to the Board at the General
Conference. Thus, in the past, Israel has
received votes at the General Conference for election to the
former area of "Africa and the
Middle East" and to the current area of "Middle East and South
Asia".  But from such
individual votes, no generalized conclusions can be drawn. In
such elections, a vote cast for
the election of a State to a particular area implies that the
State casting the vote considers that
the State for whom it has cast its vote is within the area in
question. For some States votes
have been cast for different areas (sometimes for two areas at
the same meeting of the
Plenary - see, e.g., the vote cast for the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea for the area
"South East Asia and the Pacific" at the same election at which
that State was elected to a
seat for
the "Far East" area (GC(XXIII)/OR.217, paras. 19-21)). Although,
in accordance with Rule
85(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference (which
provides that a vote is
invalid if cast for a State that is not in the area in respect of
which the election is being held),
tellers are instructed to report as invalid any votes cast for
States that are "manifestly" not in
the area in question, in no case has any vote been challenged on
this ground.
<P>
<LI>It bears noting that, for purposes other than determination
of Board membership, the
grouping of States may vary depending on the purpose for which it
is done.  For example,
while the annual report to the General Conference on the staffing
of the Secretariat basically
follows the lines of Article VI, a different grouping is used for
the administrative division of
responsibilities within the Department of Technical Co-operation.
<P>
<LI>It is within the authority of the Policy-making Organs of the
Agency to adopt a list
identifying which States belong in the areas identified in
Article VI of the Statute, as 
proposed in the draft resolution set out in GC(39)/COM.5/10. 
This would manifest the right
of a Member State to be eligible for election to the Board in
respect of the area indicated on
such a list.  However, actual election to the Board is not
guaranteed by the Statute.  
<P>
<LI>The above background indicates that the attribution of a
State to a particular area is
one in which factors other than geographical considerations play
a role.  It also confirms the
absence of any complete indication among Member States of the
States in each of the areas
set out in Article VI.
<P>
<B>III. PRACTICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS</B>
<P>
<LI>With respect to the United Nations, the only explicit
provisions of the Charter on
geographical distribution concern the election of the ten
non-permanent members of the
Security Council (Article 23(1) - "equitable geographical
distribution") and the recruitment
of the staff of the Organization (Article 101(3) - "on as wide a
geographical basis as
possible").  In this context, since 1963, the General Assembly
has adopted geographical
distribution patterns for electing officers and members of
various organs.  While there is no
classification based upon formal membership in a geographical
group, Member States are
generally categorized into African States, Asian States, Eastern
European States, Latin
American States, and Western European and Other States.
<P>
<LI>Regional groupings of Member States corresponding to the
afore-mentioned
geographical patterns have evolved in practice as an informal
arrangement mainly for
consultation and election purposes.  It is an arrangement based
on the agreement of the States
concerned.  Since groupings of Member States by geographical
region have evolved as an
informal arrangement for a number of practical purposes,
different groupings are sometimes
used for different purposes, or in the context of different
United Nations bodies.  In some
cases, for example, as regards Turkey, a State can belong to one
regional group for election
purposes (Western European and Other Group) and to another group
for other purposes
(Asian States).
<P>
<LI>According to information provided by the United Nations
Office of Legal Affairs, the
composition of the various groups is entirely in the hands of the
groups themselves; the
current chairman of a specific group informs the Secretariat
about changes in the composition
of the groups, but this information does not appear in any
official document.  The Division
for General Assembly Affairs prepares a list for General Assembly
election purposes which,
however, is only an internal document with no circulation.  In
reporting to the General
Assembly on the composition of the Secretariat, the
Secretary-General divides Member States
in "groupings by major geographical regions" for statistical
purposes, including seven
regional groupings and one group for "other nationalities". 
Member States are listed in yet
another manner for purposes of election to the Committee on Food
Aid Policies and
Programme of the World Food Programme.
<P>
<LI>A review of the practices of other organizations in the
United Nations system reveals
that, while the use of regional or geographical groupings of
States is prevalent, there is no
uniformity in the practical details.
<P>
<LI>For some organizations, specific groups are defined either in
the constituent instrument
or by decisions of the plenary body of the organization.  In the
case of UNIDO, Article 9 of
its Constitution provides for the classification of Member States
into specific groups.  With
respect to the ITU, it was a decision of the Plenary Conference
in 1959 which adopted the
principle of division of Member States into a specified number of
regions.
<P>
<LI>The number of such groups also varies among the organizations
(for example, while
in the ITU and UNESCO there are five groups, the Constitution of
UNIDO provides for four
groups).
<P>
<LI>As regards the criteria for composition of the groups, some
organizations have adopted
specific criteria, while for other organizations no formal
indication is given.  For instance,
pursuant to resolution 28(c)/20.4 (1995) of the General
Conference of UNESCO,
"geographical situation and cultural identity" were laid down as
criteria to be applied in the
assignment of new Member States to electoral groups.  In the ILO,
the criterion of
"geographical position" is used, while in the ITU, the areas are
grouped strictly on
"geographic basis".  In addition, even where the names of the
groups are the same among
different UN-system organizations, and the criteria would appear
to be similar, the
composition of those groups may vary from organization to
organization.
<P>
<LI> The practices of the UN organizations with respect to the
procedure for determining
which States constitute the groups also vary considerably.  In
UNIDO, UNESCO and the
ITU, the plenary conferences make that determination, and decide
as well on changes of a
State from one group to another.  In the case of the ILO, a
recent amendment to the standing
orders of the ILO Conference will, when it enters into force,
institutionalize the geographical
distribution of its Member States, for the purpose of
distribution of the seats on its governing
board; the delimitation of the regions will be adjusted, if
necessary, by mutual agreement
among all the governments concerned.  As regards ILO regional
conferences, as opposed to
meetings of its Governing body, there are no rules which define
the criteria determining to
which group a country belongs, or which establish the procedure
to be followed in the event
of a modification.  All of these questions are dealt with by the
Governing Body of the ILO
on a consensus basis.
<P>
<LI>In most UN-system organizations, the grouping of States is
used for purposes of
election to the executive body or other subsidiary organs.  That
is true, for instance, of the
ITU, UPU, WHO and UNESCO.  Groupings may also be used for other
purposes.  In
UNESCO, for example, geographical groups are also used in respect
of the execution of
regional activities; in the ILO, for the purposes of regional
conferences.  The Constitution of
the WHO uses the criterion of "geographical areas" in respect of
the establishment of regional
organizations which are integral parts of WHO.  In most of these
cases, there is no symmetry
in the composition of the groups for electoral and other
purposes.
<P>
<B>IV.  CONCLUDING REMARKS</B>
<P>
<LI>The survey conducted of the practices of other UN
organizations reveals no common
approach either to the procedures for assigning States to
particular areas, to the criterion for
making such a determination or to the establishment of fixed
lists of area Members. 
Moreover, the composition of the various lists in such
organizations appears to be fluid and
depends on the purposes for which the respective lists are
developed (at least some of which
are only informal).  Thus, these practices are not of direct
relevance to interpretation of the
provisions of the Statute of the Agency as regards "area"
representation. Equally, the past
practice of the Agency does not provide unequivocal guidance as
to the interpretation of the
provisions of the Statute as regards "area" representation. In
that practice, reference has been
had to a number of considerations, including political
considerations, in relation to this issue.
<P>
<LI>The principle of sovereign equality of Member States requires
that each Member State
be eligible for election to the Board.  Hence, under the Statute
of the Agency, it is for the
Board and the General Conference to act on the premise that each
Member State belongs to
some area.  The drawing of the conclusion that a State belongs -
or does not belong - to a
particular area is not the exclusive prerogative of the Member
States who are acknowledged
as being within that area, although account should be taken of
the preference of the Members
concerned.  The full Board and the General Conference plenary is
free to depart from such
conclusion.

AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE VI OF THE STATUTE (GC(39)/21,
GC(39)/21/Add.1,
GC(39)/COM.5/9, GC(39)/COM.5/10)
<P>
<DL>
<DD>25.       The <I>CHAIRMAN</I> proposed that the Committee
begin by
discussing the report of the Chairman of the Open-ended
Consultative Group on Article VI of
the Statute contained in the Attachment to document GC(39)/21 and
then take up the
Moroccan proposal for amending Article VI contained in Annex 8 to
that report. 
Subsequently, the Committee could take up the draft resolutions
contained in documents
GC(39)/COM.5/9 and GC(39)/COM.5/10.
<P>
<DD>26.       <I>Mr. SNYDER</I> (United States of America),
supported by
<I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I>
(Morocco) and <I>Mr. LEDERMAN</I> (Israel), requested that the
meeting be
suspended pending
the conclusion of the informal consultations currently under way
in connection with the
Article VI issue.
<P>
<DD>27.  <I>It was so agreed</I>.

AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE VI OF THE STATUTE (GC(39)/21,
GC(39)/21/Add.1,
GC(39)/COM.5/9, GC(39)/COM.5/10)
<P>
<DL>
<DD>32.  She [THE CHAIRMAN] then invited the representative of
Israel to introduce the
draft
resolution contained in document GC(39)/COM.5/10.
<P>
<DD>33.       <I>Mr. LEDERMAN</I> (Israel) said that Article VI
of the Statute
referred to eight
areas but did not address the issue of the composition of those
areas.  For effective
consideration of the question how many seats on the Board should
be allocated to the different
areas, however, it was necessary to know which Member States
belonged to which area.
<P>
<DD>34.  The list attached to the draft resolution submitted by
Israel could be useful in
that connection.
<P>
<DD>35.  That having been said, his delegation would not press
the draft resolution if its
operative paragraph 2 could be incorporated into the amended
version of the draft resolution
submitted by Morocco.
<P>
<DD>36.       <I>Mr. POSTA</I> (Hungary), noting that - as
already pointed out by
the representative of Ukraine - there had been a significant
increase in the number of Member
States located in Eastern Europe, said that his delegation was in
favour of the adoption by the
Conference of a list specifying which Member States belonged to
which of the eight areas
referred to in Article VI.
<P>
<DD>37.  Given the scientific and technical character of the
Agency, any expansion of the
Board's membership should be such as to ensure - besides fair
representation of the different
areas - the adequate representation of Member States which had
nuclear power programmes
or were otherwise engaged in significant peaceful nuclear
activities.
<P>
<DD>38.       <I>Mr. OTHMAN</I> (Syrian Arab Republic), supported
by <I>Mr.
AL-TAIFI</I> (Saudi
Arabia) and <I>Mr. HAMADA</I> (Tunisia), said that the
geographical distribution of
States was not identical with their political distribution and
that the issue raised by the
delegation of Israel should be dealt with in the United Nations
General Assembly - not in the
Agency's General Conference.
<P>
<DD>39.       <I>Mr. STRATFORD</I> (United States of America),
supported by
Mr. MOLLINGER
(Netherlands), said that any consensus eventually reached on an
expansion of the Board's
membership would have to be fair to all Member States.  There
would accordingly have to
be a way of determining which Member States were in which areas
and then allotting seats
to the different areas.  It would be most unfair if there were
Member States regarded as not
belonging to any of the eight areas referred to in Article VI.
<P>
<DD>40.  Adoption of a list which assigned the Agency's Member
States to the different
areas
would facilitate future consultations on the Article VI issue.
<P>
<DD>41.       <I>Mr. EID</I> (Lebanon), expressing support for
the comments made
by the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic, said that
consultations should continue with
a view to amending Article VI and that, when they were completed,
consideration could be
given to the situation of certain States in order to determine to
which area group(s) they
belonged.
<P>
<DD>42.       <I>Mr. JAMEEL</I> (Pakistan) said that the present
forum was not a
proper place to
discuss the issue of which States belonged to which area groups. 
The issue was a difficult
one, and it should be resolved primarily within the area groups
themselves.  Also, it was
extraneous to the question of amending Article VI of the Statute.
<P>
<DD>43.       <I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I> (Morocco) said that the draft
resolution
submitted by his country could be considered without reference to
the issue of the
composition of area groups, which ought really to be dealt with
under a separate agenda item.
<P>
<DD>44.       <I>Mr. BENATTALLAH</I> (Algeria), supported by
<I>Mr.
NAJADA</I> (Jordan),
associating himself with the views expressed by the
representative of the Syrian Arab
Republic, said he had the impression that Israel wished to be
regarded as belonging to the
Middle East and South Asia area group.  In other contexts,
however, Israel belonged to other
area groups (to European area groups, for example), and he saw no
reason why, in the
Agency context, Israel should not be regarded as belonging to -
say - Western Europe.  A
country should not be able to impose itself on an area group.
<P>
<DD>45.       <I>Mr. MACKINNON</I> (Canada) said that it would be
very difficult
to explain to anyone not familiar with the workings of the Agency
- the Canadian tax payer,
for example - why the General Conference was not prepared to
acknowledge that Israel
belonged to the Middle East and South Asia area group.
<P>
<DD>46.       <I>Mr. AYATOLLAHI</I> (Islamic Republic of Iran)
said that, in his
delegation's view, the issue of the list attached to the draft
resolution contained in document
GC(39)/COM.5/10 should be discussed elsewhere.  The Agency's
Statute was silent
regarding the composition of area groups, and it would be wrong
to recommend that the
General Conference adopt that particular list.
<P>
<DD>47.  The question really at stake was that of regional
security, which was inseparable
from the question of regional co-operation.  For regional
co-operation to work, the States of a
given region had to decide among themselves what was politically
acceptable and what
constituted a normalization of relations.
<P>
<DD>48.  It was regrettable that so little progress towards
regional security had been made
in the Middle East - for example, through the creation of an
NWFZ.  The lack of progress
was reflected in the agendas of the General Conference, which for
several years had
contained an item on the nuclear capability of a particular
Member State and the threat posed
by that State. The item had now disappeared from the agenda, but
the threat remained.
<P>
<DD>49.       <I>Mr. LEDERMAN</I> (Israel) said that his country
was not seeking
to impose itself on any area group.  Unfortunately, however, for
political reasons some
countries in the area of the Middle East and South Asia would not
accept the logical
consequences of Israel's geographical situation.
<P>
<DD>50.       <I>Mr. MOHAMEDAIN</I> (Sudan) said that the
Committee was not
a suitable forum for discussing the composition of area groups;
that was a matter for the
countries in the individual groups.
<P>
<DD>51.       <I>Ms. OGNJANOVAC</I> (Croatia), noting that part
IV (Eastern
Europe) of the list attached to the draft resolution submitted by
Israel included "Yugoslavia",
drew attention to document GC(39)/INF/22 containing a letter to
the Director General about
references to "Yugoslavia" as a Member of the Agency.
<P>
<DD>52.  The Security Council had in resolution 777 (1992) noted
that "... the State
formally known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
has ceased to exist" and that
"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
cannot continue automatically
the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in the United
Nations".
<P>
<DD>53.  That resolution had been endorsed by the General
Assembly in its resolution
A/47/L.1
of 22 September 1992, a decision which had subsequently been
reaffirmed by the Agency's
General Conference the same year.
<P>
<DD>54.  Therefore, in the list attached to the draft resolution
submitted by Israel,
Yugoslavia should be included with those States whose group
membership was yet to be
determined.
<P>
<DD>55.       <I>Mr. OTHMAN</I> (Syrian Arab Republic) said that
a country's
geographical existence and its political identity were two
different things and expressed
surprise that a country which otherwise saw itself as a part of
Europe should seek to become
a member of the Middle East and South Asia group.  Even if it was
not a member of any
area group, that country still received Agency technical
assistance.
<P>
<DD>56.       <I>Mr. de YTURRIAGA</I> (Spain), speaking on behalf
of the EU,
suggested that the draft resolution submitted by Israel be
replaced by the following:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><I>"The General Conference</I>,
<P>
<DD>"(a) <I>Noting</I> paragraph 1 of the draft resolution
submitted by Israel
GC(39)/COM.5/10, and

<P>
<DD>"(b) <I>Taking into account</I> the legal and political
implications of the
drafting of a list allocating the IAEA's Member States among the
eight regional groups,
<P>
<DD>"1.  <I>Requests</I> the Legal Adviser of the Agency to study
the legal
implication of the
proposal submitted by Israel and submit a report to the Board of
Governors; and
<P>
<DD>"2.  <I>Requests</I> the Board of Governors to examine the
report of the Legal
Adviser
and to make relevant recommendations on the subject to the
General Conference at its fortieth
session."
</DL>
<P>
<DD>57.       <I>Mr. AL-TAIFI</I> (Saudi Arabia) said that his
delegation could go
along with the text suggested by the representative of Spain
provided that "Legal Adviser" in
operative paragraphs 1 and 2 was replaced by "Director General"
and the Board was
requested to submit to the General Conference merely a report on
the legal and political
aspects of the subject.
<P>
<DD>58.       <I>Mr. STRATFORD</I> (United States of America),
expressing
support for the text suggested by the representative of Spain,
said that he too would like to
see "Legal Adviser" replaced by "Director General" in operative
paragraphs 1 and 2.  Also,
he would like to see", in consultation with interested Member
States," added in operative
paragraph 1.
<P>
<DD>59. <I>Mr. de YTURRIAGA</I> (Spain) said that he considered
the
amendments put forward by the representatives of Saudi Arabia and
the United States of
America to be acceptable.
<P>
<DD>60. <I>Mr. LEDERMAN</I> (Israel) said that his delegation was
ready to
accept the suggested text with the amendments put forward by the
representative of the United
States of America.
<P>
<DD>61.       The <I>CHAIRMAN</I> proposed that further
discussion under the
present agenda item be postponed until the suggested new texts
had been circulated in writing.
<P>
<DD>62.  <I>It was so agreed</I>.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>The <I>CHAIRMAN</I>, drawing attention to the text of a draft
resolution which
had just been distributed, said that it represented a consensus
arrived at earlier that morning
in
informal consultations presided over by the delegate of Canada.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. WALKER</I> (Canada), introducing the text, said the
consensus was
based on the understanding that the text would be recommended for
adoption with no
amendments.  He thanked those who had participated in the
consultations for the spirit of
co-operation which they had shown.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. LEDERMAN</I> (Israel), having expressed appreciation
of the
co-operative spirit shown during the consultations, said that his
delegation favoured adoption
of the text with the understanding that in operative paragraph 1
the word "especially" applied
to both of the views referred to.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I> (Morocco) said that the consensus
arrived at was a
reasonable one and did not prejudge the outcome of the envisaged
study.  The matter would
be decided upon the following year, by which time the political
climate might well have
changed.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. STRATFORD</I> (United States of America), expressing
support for the
consensus text, said he was pleased that it made clear that two
strongly held views should be
taken into account in the preparation of the Director General's
report to the Board of
Governors.
<P>
<LI><I>Mr. de YTURRIAGA</I> (Spain), speaking on behalf of the
European Union,
welcomed the consensus text and commended the spirit of
co-operation which had led to it.
<P>
<LI><I>The CHAIRMAN</I> said that the spirit of co-operation
which had been
shown could well be important for the future of the Agency and
asked the Committee whether
it wished to recommend to the General Conference that it adopt
the consensus text.

position on the issue of
"Amendments of Article VI (A-1) of the IAEA Statute/the

As can be expected, the Israel's position paper "zooms" and
discusses in great detail the
arguments that would facilitate Israel's participation in its
regional group i.e. MESA in all the
group activities, including eventually its election to the Board
of Governors.

<B>Amendment of Article VI of the IAEA Statute
<P>
Israel's position</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Background</I></B>
<P>
At the IAEA 39th General Conference, Israel submitted a draft
resolution GC(39)/COM.5/10
dated 19 September 1995, entitled "Amendment of Article VI of the
Statute" (See
Annex).<A HREF="#note_4">*</A>
<P>
In its operative paragraph 2, the draft resolution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"2.  Adopts the attached list specifying the Member States
belonging to the eight
regional areas, listed in Article VI of the Agency's Statute."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The list attached to the draft resolution is the unofficial list
of IAEA member states allocated
to the eight regional groups according to the IAEA Statute, as
distributed in document
GOV/2814 of 8 June 1995.
<P>
The Israeli delegation submitted its draft resolution at the 39th
IAEA General Conference
because:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>A.   Israel was a founding member of the IAEA in 1957. It has
never been elected to
the     Board of Governors (BOG), because member states in the
geographical group to which
Israel belongs, i.e., MESA, opposed its participation, thus
effectively excluding Israel
from being elected as a member of the BOG.
<P>
<DD>B.   In accordance with "the principle of the sovereign
equality of all members" -
enshrined      in the Agency's Statute - it was strongly felt by
the Government of Israel that
this situation ought to be corrected.
<P>
<DD>C.   At present, Article VI of the Statute defines the eight
regional areas for the
purpose of  representation of members on the BOG without
addressing the issue of their
composition.
<P>
<DD>D.   A list of member states in each regional area would
provide member states the
basic data  to work with during consultations on the issues
pertaining to Article VI.
<P>
<DD>E.   By turning the IAEA unofficial list of states by region
into an official one,
Israel's  participation in its regional group, i.e., MESA, would
be given official recognition
and   sanction.
</DL>
<P>
During the deliberations on the issue at the Committee of the
Whole at the 39th General
Conference, it became clear that the Israeli draft resolution,
while drawing support from
several delegations, could not become a consensus resolution due
to strong opposition of
several states.
<P>
After a long process of deliberations on the floor of the
Committee of the Whole and
extensive consultations, consensus has been reached on resolution
GC(39)/45 which reads as
follows:
<P>
<I>"The General Conference,</I>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)  <I>Noting</I> the draft resolution submitted by Israel
GC(39)/COM.5/10,
and
<P>
<DD>(b)  <I>Taking into account</I> all the implications of the
drafting of a list
allocating the
IAEA's Member States among the eight regional groups,
</DL>
<P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Requests</I> the Director General to study all the
implications of the proposal
contained in
     GC(39)/COM.5/10 and submit a report to the Board of
Governors. This report should
     take into account the general debate undertaken in this
regard, especially the view that
     the primary responsibility for deciding upon the composition
of regional groups lies with
     the respective groups themselves and the view that every
State has the right to
     participate in a regional group;  and
<P>
<LI><I>Requests</I> the Board of Governors to consider this
matter and report to the
General Conference at its fortieth session."
</OL>
<P>
Pursuant to that resolution, the Government of Israel would like
to present its views on the
subject.
<P>
<B><I>Israel's positions - main elements</I></B>

<P>
In accordance with the IAEA Statute all member states should have
the right to participate in
all IAEA activities and enjoy all rights and privileges of
membership. Some of these rights
are exercised through participation in the geographical area
groups.
<P>
The fact that Israel is a part of the Middle East area, cannot be
denied on geographical,
political or any other grounds.
<P>
Israel has the right to be a part of and to participate in MESA
area group, including, inter
alia, the right to be elected on its behalf to the IAEA Board of
Governors. Therefore, the
opposition of certain states in MESA to Israel's participation in
the activities of MESA is an
infringement of the principle of sovereign equality of member
states of the Agency, as laid
down by the Statute.
<P>
We believe that the adoption of a list allocating each of the
IAEA's member states to the
eight regional groups would:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>a.   Provide the required data needed for the continued
consultation on the
composition of the BOG.
<P>
<DD>b.   Constitute a first, modest step in eliminating the long
overdue discrimination of
Israel and enabling Israel to enjoy all the rights as practiced
by all other states.
</DL>
<P>
<B>A.   Legal Aspects of the IAEA Statute provisions</B>
<P>
     Article IVc of the IAEA Statute opens by stating that "The
Agency is based on the
     principle of the sovereign equality of all its member
states, ...". This provision echoes the
     parallel requirement of Article 2, paragraph 1, of the
Charter of the United Nations,
     embodying the principle of sovereign equality in the central
and vital set of provisions
     detailing the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
<P>
     Article IVc establishes the equation between ensuring the
rights and benefits resulting
     from membership in the Agency on the one hand, and, on the
other, the fulfillment in
     good faith of the obligations assumed by members in
accordance with the Agency's
     Statute. Neither this provision nor any other provision in
the Statute provides for the
     denial of rights to a member state which fulfills in good
faith its membership obligations.
     Hence, the denial of Israel's right to the full enjoyment of
its membership rights is not
     justified by the Statute, and such a denial negates a
central tenet of membership as set
     in it.
<P>
     This is further strengthened in the context of the
inter-relationship between the IAEA
     Statute and the United Nations Charter, as formalized both
in Article IIIB of the Statute
     as well as in Article I(4) of the 1957 Relationship
Agreement between the IAEA and the
     United Nations, whereby the Agency "undertakes to conduct
its activities in accordance
     with the purposes and principles of the United Nations
Charter ...".
<P>
     Article VI of the Statute establishes the principle of
geographical distribution of the
     membership of the BOG, adding the necessity to give "due
regard to equitable
     representation on the Board as a whole of the members in the
areas listed in sub-
     paragraph A.1 ...". It is not unreasonable to interpret the
concept of equitable
     representation of the members in the area groups, as
indicating that all the members of
     the Agency should be entitled over time, to be elected to a
term, or terms of membership
     of the BOG, without any exception. 
<P>
<B>B.   Area groups composition in IAEA practice</B>
<P>
     Article VI of the Statute does not address the issue of
composition of the eight area
     groups. However, the practice at the IAEA is based on an
unofficial list of states by
     region (GOV/2814, 8 June 1995, Annex C).
<P>
     This has also been applied to MESA as an area group which
includes Israel according
     to that list.
<P>
     In 1989 the IAEA defined the Middle East as: "... the area
extending from Libyan Arab
     Jamahiriya in the West, to the Islamic Republic of Iran in
the East and from Syria in
     the North to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in
the South. This selection
     carries no political significance and it is purely
geographical" (Modalities of Application
     of Safeguards in the Middle East", GC(XXXIII)/887, 29
August, 1989).
<P>
     This practice was evident also in the Secretariat structure.
For example a Middle East
     section was until 1995 part of the Division of Technical
Cooperation Programs in the
     Department of Technical Cooperation. Israel was also
included in the geographical area
     covered by that section.
<P>
<B>C.   The Middle East : The Geographical Perspective</B>
<P>
     The 1990 report of the UN Secretary-General's study team
(A/45/435 of October 1990)
     has extensively considered the delineation of the region for
purposes of a NWFZ. In
     defining the region, the report distinguished between "core"
and "peripheral" states. The
     "core" states include Israel. The peripheral region was
defined as including members of
     the Arab League.
<P>
     The US Arms Control Initiative for the Middle East of May
29, 1991, that has inspired
     the establishment of ACRS Working Group, defined the region
of the Middle East as
     extending from Iran in the East to the Maghreb in the west.
<P>
 A draft treaty, discussed at the Arab League, on the
establishment of the Middle East
     as a WMDFZ, defined in Article I in the term the Middle East
region as "the territories
     under the jurisdiction or control of the Arab League member
countries, in addition to
     Iran and <I>Israel</I>." (Al-Ittihad, Abu Dhabi, in Arabic,
15 February 1995, p.23).

<P>
     In conclusion, all the definitions and delineations include
the State of Israel in the Middle
     East region.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
          Israel is politically a part of the Middle East. The
purpose of the present Middle
          East Peace Process is to achieve a just and lasting
peace between Israel and its
          neighbors.
<BR>
This process has underlined that:

<DL>
<DD>-    Israel is a full partner in the Middle East peace
process.

cooperation and
               development, Environment, Arms Control and
Regional Security  -

<P>
<DD>-    Israel is a member-party in the foundation of a regional
Middle East

<P>

<DD>-    As mentioned, the Arab League's text for a draft Middle
East WMDFZ
               uses the term "Middle East region" as meaning "the
territories under the

countries, in addition
               to Iran and Israel" (<I>Al-Ittihad</I>, Abu Dhabi,

<P>
<DD>-    Resolutions on the Middle East sponsored by Arab states
both in the UN

by the Secretary-
               General of the UN in 1975 in the context of the UN
General Assembly
               resolution on the establishment of a NWFZ in the
Middle East included
               Israel (S/11778, 28 July 1975; A/10027/Add.1,
1976, para.72). This has

<P>
<B><I>Points raised at the Committee of the Whole</I></B>
<P>
During the deliberations of the Committee of the Whole several
delegations expressed
opposition
to the Israeli draft resolution on Amendment of Article VI of the
Statute.
<P>
Representatives of Syria, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Lebanon,
Algeria, Jordan and Iran presented
the following arguments:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=100% CELLSPACING=5>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Argument A:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT>The geographical distribution of states
is not
identical with their political  distribution. The Israeli
proposal should be dealt with in the
United Nations  General Assembly and not in the IAEA General
Conference.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<I>Israel's response:</I>
<P>
At issue here is the composition of the area groups, as practiced
in the IAEA. These area
groups
are defined in the IAEA Statute on geographical grounds only. The
group definition and
composition at the UN General Assembly are different and not
relevant.
<BR>
In the IAEA there is no legal meaning to "political
distribution".
<BR>
Accordingly, the Israeli proposal should be dealt with in the
Policy Making Organs of the
IAEA
and not be dependent on extraneous considerations.
<BR>
Those who use this argument admit and acknowledge that Israel
belongs geographically to the
Middle East.
<P>
<TABLE  BORDER=0 WIDTH=100% CELLSPACING=5>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Argument B:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT>Priority should be given to amending
Article VI (the
expansion issue) and only  after its completion, consideration
should be given to the situation
of certain  states in order to determine to which area groups
they belong.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<I>Israel's response:</I>
<P>
On the contrary : in order to facilitate consultations on
amendments to Article VI concerning
the number of seats on the BOG a formal list of member states in
each regional area should
be
provided in advance.
<BR>
Adoption of such a list would acknowledge the general practice
which is exercised by all
geographic area groups except MESA.
<BR>
A variation on this argument declares that there are other member
states that are trying to
become part of a different regional area group. It should be
noted that in those cases a state
belonging to one regional area may want to become a member in
another regional area. In
such
a case no denial of privileges and rights is involved. Israel's
situation requires urgent
correction:
it does not belong in effect to any regional area group.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=100% CELLSPACING=5>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Argument C:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT>
While Israel wishes to belong to MESA group, in other contexts it
belongs to
other area groups (to European area groups, for example). There
is no reason
why Israel, within the Agency context, should not be regarded as
belonging to
Western Europe. 
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE >
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<I>Israel's response</I>
<P>
In the context of the IAEA Statute, groups are defined according
to geographical regions.
Israel belongs to the Middle East. This is an irrefutable fact in
the IAEA as anywhere else. It
is not accepted by certain states in the MESA regional group.
This should be corrected.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=100% CELLSPACING=5>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Argument D:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT>A country should not be able to impose
itself on an
area group.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<I>Israel's response:</I>
<P>
This argument implies that some members of a regional area group
can arbitrarily exclude
another member from that group by exploiting their majority vote.

<P>
Such a behavior contradicts the IAEA statutory principle of
sovereign equality of all member
states and creates inequality : all member states belong to a
regional group, except one state
that
is arbitrarily excluded. This means that the rights of one member
state have been suspended.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=100% CELLSPACING=5>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Argument E:</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT>The list of members states attached to
the Israeli
draft resolution for adoption  was termed an "Israeli List".
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<I>Israel's response:</I>
<P>
The list attached to the Israeli draft resolution GC(39)/COM.5/10
is not an "Israeli List". It is
the unofficial list that has always been in use by the Agency.
The only exception to this
practice
is by the MESA group and this is an additional reason for a
change.
<P>
It should also be noted that during the deliberations, the
Israeli position was strongly
supported
by several delegations. The United States delegation supported by
the delegation of the
Netherlands, maintained that "It would be most unfair if there
were member states regarded
as
not belonging to any of the eight areas referred to in Article
VI. Adoption of a list which
assigned the Agency's Member States to the different areas, would
facilitate future
consultations
on Article VI."
<P>
The delegation of Canada pointed out that "it would be very
difficult to explain to ... the
Canadian tax payer for example, why the General Conference was
not prepared to
acknowledge
that Israel belonged to the MESA group."
<P>
The Israeli draft resolution was compatible with the letter and
spirit of the Statute. It proposed
the inclusion of the notion that "especially ... every state has
the right to participate in a
regional
group".
<P>
The persistence of some Arab delegations and the Iranian one to
include in the resolution the
phrase "especially the view that the primary responsibility for
deciding upon the composition
of regional groups lies with the respective groups themselves"
can only have had a political
motive as there is no legal or substantive basis. The arguments
presented by some Arab
delegations and the Iranian one against Israel's position can
only lead to the conclusion that
the
aim was political discrimination.
<P>
<B><I>Conclusion</I></B>
<P>
By objecting to the list of member states in the regional areas,
Arab states and Iran, in fact,
discriminate against Israel. This is unacceptable and detrimental
to the objectives of the
IAEA. One cannot treat Israel as an essential part of the Middle
East, when the aim is to
condemn it and exclude it from the region on the exercise of its
rights and privileges.
<P>
It would have been hoped that the achievements of the Peace
Process in the Middle East and
its ongoing progress would have changed the political climate,
eliminated old animosities and
helped to correct the discrimination against Israel in the IAEA.
<P>
Israel trusts that its position in the context of Resolution
GC(39)/45, will be considered and
hopes that the DG's report to the BOG, will recommend, to adopt
the IAEA unofficial list of
states by region. This would be a small but important step in the
elimination of Israel's
discrimination at the IAEA governing bodies.

The Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic presents its
compliments to the Director
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency and has the
honour to inform him as
follows:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The IAEA General Conference resolution GC(39)/RES/22, adopted
at the 39th session
(1995), on the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, requested
the Director General to
study all the implications of the proposal contained in document
GC(39)/COM.5/10 submitted
by Israel and submit a report to the Board of Governors.  This
report should take into account
the general debate undertaken in this regard, especially the view
that the primary
responsibility
for deciding upon the composition of regional groups lies with
the respective groups
themselves.
<P>
<LI>In accordance with the above-mentioned resolution, the
Mission wishes to state the
position of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, which is
as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The inclusion of any State in a group requires the agreement of
the members of the group to
its inclusion.  Likewise, any modification in the existing
geographical groups requires the
agreement of every group to the list of Member States included in
it."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic requests the
Director General to take
note of and study the position of Syria and to take it into
consideration in preparing the report
to be submitted to the Board of Governors, and avails itself of
this opportunity to renew to
him the assurances of its highest esteem.

<B>C.  PERMANENT MISSION OF TURKEY</B>
<P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT>
13 October 1995
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Mission of Turkey presents its compliments to the
International Atomic
Energy Agency and in accordance with Resolution 39/22 adopted by
the 39th General
Conference of the Agency has the honour to transmit herebelow the
views of the Government
of Turkey on the membership to the list of eight regional groups
mentioned but not identified
in Article VI of the IAEA Statute:
<P>
In the "indicative" list which had been prepared by the
Secretariat of the Agency and has
been solely used for practical purposes, "Cyprus" (Greek Cypriot
Administration) is included
in the "Western Europe" area.  This list has not been adopted by
the General Conference and
thus has not born any effect whatsoever so far.  Consequently,
the members of the eight areas
specified in Article VI of the Statute have not legally been
identified.  Now, in line with the
General Conference Resolution NO. 39/22, as a result of the
drafting process of a list
allocating IAEA Member States among the eight regional groups,
such a list will eventually
become formalized and thus legally binding upon the adoption by
the General Conference.
<P>
As is known, "Cyprus", belongs to the "Asian Group" among the
geographical groupings go
the Member States both at the United Nations Headquarters in New
York and at the Untied
Nations Office in Geneva.
<P>
Moreover, "Cyprus", being a member of the "Non-aligned movement"
and taking part in the
Asian Group at the United Nations Offices both in New York and in
Geneva, neither
geographically nor politically belongs to the Western Europe
area.  Therefore, in the drafting
process of such a list as envisaged by the GC(39)/RES/22, this
fact should be reflected
accordingly and "Cyprus" should be included in the Middle East
and South Asia area where it
geographically and politically suits.
<P>
On the other hand, in the aforementioned "indicative" list
"Yugoslavia" is included in the area
of Eastern Europe.  As is known, the former Yugoslavia has
physically disintegrated and
there now exist three independent sovereign States on its
territory, all members of the UN,
namely Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina and a fourth State,
the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), whose participation in the UN
is conditioned to its
application for membership to the UN.  In fact, according to the
United Nations General
Assembly Resolution 47/1 of 1992, the General Assembly "considers
that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue
automatically the
membership of the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations; and
therefore decides that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should
apply for membership in the
United Nations and that is shall not participate in the work of
the General Assembly".  As a
consequence of this Resolution, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)
has not, in fact, participated in the work of the General
Assembly and its subsidiary organs or
in the Conferences and meetings convened by them.  In the light
of the General Assembly
Resolution no. 47/1, the 36th General Conference of the IAEA
adopted on 24 September
1994 Resolution no. 576 stating that "The General Conference ...
considers that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue
automatically the
membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
in the IAEA;  and
decides that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) should apply for
membership in the Agency and that it shall not take any further
part in the work of the Board
and the General Conference".  Accordingly, the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) has not participated in the work of the Board and the
General Conference of the
IAEA.
<P>
Therefore, the question of the membership of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) should be settled at the United Nations and the IAEA
in accordance with the
abovementioned Resolutions before this State is included in one
of the eight areas indicated in
Article VI of the Statute.
<P>
The Permanent Mission of Turkey requests that the above-mentioned
views be duly reflected
in the report of the Director General to the Board of Governors
on this issue and avails itself
of this opportunity to renew to International Atomic Energy
Agency the assurance of its
highest consideration.

<LI>The Director General submits herewith to the General
Conference a draft resolution whereby the Conference may set, in
accordance with Article XIV.D of the Statute, the scale of
assessment of Members' contributions to the Agency's Regular
Budget for 1997. The scale annexed to the attached draft
resolution has been prepared in accordance with the principles
established by the General Conference <A
HREF="#note_1"><SUP>[1]</SUP></A>. The scale, which is based on
the Agency's membership as of 31 July 1996, includes
two new States, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of
Georgia, which became Members on 19 September 1995 and 23
February 1996 respectively.
<P>
<LI>With regard to the scale annexed to the attached draft
resolution, 92 Members (hereinafter referred to as "shielded"
Members) will receive partial relief in respect of their
assessments for the safeguards component of the Regular Budget
(see Table 4 in the Appendix). The remaining 32 Members
(hereinafter referred to as "unshielded" Members) will contribute
on a proportionally increased basis in order to make up the
balance of the safeguards expenses (see Table 5 in the Appendix).
<P>
<LI>3. It will be noted that the following draft resolution also
provides for approval by the General Conference of the base rate
of assessment of each Member. This has been derived from the
scale used by the United Nations to assess contributions from its
Members to its Regular Budget for 1996 and adopted by the General
Assembly in resolution 49/19 B on 29 November 1994. The 1996
scale of the United Nations is adjusted by applying a
mathematical coefficient to compensate for differences in
membership between the Agency and the United Nations.
<P>
<LI>The calculations that were made in order to establish both
the individual base rates and the resulting scale of assessment
are reproduced for the information of the Conference in the
Appendix.
<P>
<LI>Member States are urged to inform the Director General by 1
January 1997 as to when their Regular Budget contributions will
be paid to the Agency. This information is required in order to
enable the Secretariat to prepare cash forecasts on the basis of
which the Agency's programme will be implemented.

<B>I. Introduction</B>
<P>
1.    Document GOV/INF/776, dated 24 October 1995, contained the
text of the eighth six-monthly report, submitted by the Director
General to the United Nations Security Council in accordance with
paragraph 8 of resolution 715 (1991), summarising the status of
the Secretariat's understanding of Iraq's past covert nuclear
programme and describing the activities related to the
implementation of the IAEA plan for ongoing monitoring of Iraq's
compliance with its obligations under UN Security Council
resolutions. The report also addressed the potential impact of
the information contained in the large documentation cache
handed over on 20 August 1995 at the end of the visit of the
joint IAEA-UNSCOM delegation to Iraq. Since the issue of
GOV/INF/776, the Secretariat has carried out three inspection
missions in Iraq - IAEA-28 (September 1995), IAEA-29 (October
1995) and IAEA-30 (May - July 1996). The main objective of
IAEA-28 and IAEA-29 was to follow-up on information contained in
the documentation cache or directly received from the Iraqi
counterpart. Reports of these inspections are contained in
documents GOV/INF/781 and GOV/INF/783 dated 6 December 1995 and
22 January 1996 respectively.
<P>
2. The purpose of IAEA-30 was to review the draft of the Full,
Final, and Complete Declaration (FFCD) provided by Iraq on 1
March 1996. This review, which will still require some time to
complete, aims at clarifying ambiguities, inconsistencies and
contradictions found in the draft, securing the inclusion of
additional details and at obtaining documentation to support the
correctness and completeness of the declaration. The Secretariat
has also entered into discussions with the Iraqi counterpart
during routine monitoring activities in order to further clarify
the aforementioned information and with the assistance of experts
from Member States, has carried out a detailed examination of
centrifuge enrichment-related drawings and correspondence
contained in the documentation cache. A similar analysis is in
progress on weaponisation-related documentation.

<P>
<I>A. The reactor project</I>
<P>
3. The history of the development of an indigenous nuclear
reactor (Project 182) was
discussed with the Iraqi counterpart in November 1995. The
discussions opened with a
description by the counterpart of the scope of Iraq's planned
nuclear power programme
which had originated in 1975 and with international assistance,
had developed from modest
plans to acquire a single 600 MWe unit, to involve the
progressive construction of four to
six power plants by the year 2010. Although these plans had been
further modified in the
mid 1980s, no practical progress had been made in the acquisition
of nuclear power plants
other than the identification of four possible sites suitable for
the location of nuclear power
plants.
<P>    
4. The counterpart explained that Iraq's feasibility studies on
the underground siting of
reactors and other fuel cycle related installations, had been
aimed exclusively at providing
protection from aerial attack and that the strategy had been
abandoned due to its prohibitive
cost. The counterpart further explained that, although it had
been managed by the same
IAEC department, Project 182, relating to the construction of a
research reactor, had been
an entirely separate study. This project - which foresaw the
construction of an indigenous
research reactor to replace the capability that would have been
provided by the Osirak
(Tamuz-1) research reactor - had originated in 1984/85 after the
breakdown in Iraq's
negotiations with France for the rebuilding of the Osirak
reactor. The Project 182 reactor
was explained to have been a natural uranium - heavy water type,
similar to the Canadian
NRX reactor. When the project had become more defined, in 1987
and 1988, studies had
concentrated on the design of the reactor core. As this work
progressed it was recognised
that considerable IAEC and foreign resources would be needed to
bring the project to
fruition. In mid-1988, while still in the study phase, the
project was allowed to lapse due
to lack of available resources - a consequence of the higher
priority given to the needs of the
EMIS enrichment programme. The counterpart also stated that
studies on the indigenous
production of heavy water had not progressed beyond surveys of
technical literature and
preliminary laboratory measurements.
<P>         
<I>B. Uranium enrichment</I>
<P>
5. During the month of December 1995 the Secretariat, assisted by
experts from
Member States, held discussions with the counterpart to further
explore the progress that had
been made in chemical (solvent extraction) and ion-exchange
methods for the enrichment of
uranium, before the outbreak of the Gulf war.
<P>
The counterpart stated that full disclosure of these activities
had already been made
during the talks which took place during the early (1991)
inspections, and maintained that
this information was corroborated by the original documentation
obtained during the IAEA-6
inspection. However the discussions focused on obtaining
additional technical details on
activities and achievements.
<P>
The counterpart reconfirmed that all of the activities carried
out had taken place at
the Nuclear Research Centre, Tuwaitha, except for the production
of tri-butyl phosphate
which, together with some theoretical work on crown ethers, had
been done at Muthanna.
The motivation to develop the chemical enrichment process had
been Iraq's wish to enhance
the capability of the EMIS (Electromagnetic isotope separation)
process by feeding low
enriched instead of natural uranium.
<P>         
6. Iraq appears to have done only limited, basic laboratory-scale
work in solvent
extraction for uranium enrichment. However, the counterpart
expressed confidence that Iraq
could have addressed the practical problems that would have
arisen during scaling-up. At
the time it had been in the process of procuring components for a
pilot plant to produce four
tonnes per year of 1 to 1.2 % enriched uranium. Concerning ion
exchange enrichment
technology, the counterpart stated that approach was promising,
but that a lot of work was
needed, as experience with it was limited in Iraq. The results of
laboratory scale
experiments, using indigenously produced ion exchange resins,
were stated to have been
modest and a similar project for a pilot plant to produce four
tonnes per year of up to 3 % enriched uranium had not gone beyond
the preliminary assessment of equipment and material
requirements.
<P>
According to the counterpart, the most promising project, though
still at the
conceptual design stage in late 1990, combined both enrichment
methods in an hybrid process
having a solvent extraction first stage and an ion exchange
output stage, in order to produce
up to 5 tonnes per year of 4 to 8% enriched uranium.
<P>         
7. The counterpart was also asked to further clarify the
achievements made with respect
to the production of diffusion barriers and compressors, which
are key components of
gaseous diffusion enrichment technology. The counterpart
confirmed that the First Group
of IAEC Department 3000<A HREF="#note_b"><SUP>1/</SUP></A> had
continued its work in these areas
after its relocation from
Tuwaitha to the Engineering Design Centre (Rashdiya) and that
some significant achievements had been attained in the
development of anodised aluminium barriers. It had
been able to demonstrate the corrosion resistance of the barrier
material to UF6 and had
achieved measurable uranium isotopic separation. However,
according to the counterpart,
this activity, carried out in 1989, had not progressed beyond the
qualification of a single type
of barrier.
<P>
In parallel to barrier studies, attempts to reverse-engineer
compressors had been
made, in co-operation with Iraq's Specialised Institute for
Engineering Industries. However,
the counterpart maintained that these attempts had not been
successful. The counterpart
stated that all activities related to gaseous diffusion had been
stopped in 1989 and priority
given to exploiting the progress made in as centrifuge enrichment
technology.
<P>
<I>C. Nuclear weapon missile delivery vehicle</I>
<P>
8. Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, as planned in 1988, foresaw
the production of
the first weapon in 1991. However, the nuclear weapon in the
mid-1988 conceptual design
was deemed to be far too heavy to be delivered by missile.
Consequently the PC-3 Fourth
Group (Weapon development) had been advised to modify the design
"with a view to
reducing the total weight of the projectile (payload) to about
one ton or less".
<P>
From discussions with the counterpart, undertaken by the IAEA
with assistance from
a missile expert provided by the Special Commission, it appears
that three delivery vehicle
options were pursued:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>a) The longer term plan was for a delivery vehicle based on
the engine that was
being developed to power the second stage of the Al Abid
satellite launcher. This
vehicle would have had a payload chamber of 1.25 metre diameter
and the capability
to deliver a warhead of at least one tonne to a range of almost
1,200 km. Practical
work on this engine did not start until April 1989 and according
to the counterpart,
this nuclear weapon delivery vehicle option would not have been
complete until 1993
- two years after the first nuclear weapon was supposed to have
been produced.
<P>         
<DD>b) The fall-back option was to use an essentially unmodified
Al Hussein missile
and to accept a range limitation of 300 km.
<P>         
<DD>c) Although discounted as impracticable by the counterpart,
it seems reasonable
to suppose that the shorter term - crash programme - option was
the attempt, stated
to have been initiated in August/September 1990, to produce a
derivative of the Al
Hussein/Al Abbas missile designed to deliver a warhead of one
tonne up to 650 km
and to accommodate a nuclear package of 80 cm diameter.
</DL>
<P>         
9. It is difficult to evaluate these options without detailed
knowledge of Iraq's nuclear
weapons strategy, including how that strategy might have evolved
up to 1991 and how the
strategy might have changed in response to the international
reaction to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. However, it is reasonable, based on statements by the
counterpart, to suppose that
the first device, containing indigenously produced HEU, would not
have been available
before late 1992. Equally, if it is accepted that Iraq's strategy
was to acquire a small
nuclear arsenal before testing, it is likely that the need to
demonstrate a delivery capability
would not have occurred until 1994. In this context, the
development of the vehicle in
option a) above, which should have been completed in 1993, was
compatible with the overall
programme.
<P>         
10. If Iraq's nuclear strategy had always included the option to
divert safeguarded HEU
to the production of a nuclear weapon by 1991, then the delivery
vehicle in option a) above
was clearly not going to be available and work on an alternative
vehicle - perhaps option c)
above - should have originated much earlier than August 1990.
This situation is consistent
with the rationale that the diversion of the HEU from safeguards
and the development of an interim delivery vehicle were uniquely
components of a "crash programme" devised in
August/September 1990 and quite separate from the long term
programme to acquire a
nuclear weapons capability.
<P>         
<I>D. Full, final and complete declaration (FFCD)</I>
<P>
11. The report on the IAEA's twenty-eighth inspection mission to
Iraq recorded the need
for a radical revision<A HREF="#note_c"><SUP>2/</SUP></A> to the
FFCD required of Iraq in
accordance with paragraph 3 of UN
Security Council resolution 707 (1991). In response, a document
of more than one thousand
pages was delivered, by Iraq, to the IAEA office at the Baghdad
Monitoring and Verification
Centre (BMVC) on 1 March 1996. This document, issued in English
as a draft by the Iraqi
National Monitoring Directorate, is entitled "Full, Final and
Complete Declaration of the
Iraqi National Nuclear Programme" and consists of six volumes.
The table of contents of
the draft FFCD was attached to document GOV/INF/791.
<P>
12. The assessment by the IAEA of the draft FFCD was undertaken
as a high priority task
and an ad hoc inspection (IAEA-30), organised in two stages, was
conducted from 13 to
19 May and from 17 June to 8 July 1996.  The objective of IAEA-30
was to clarify
ambiguities, inconsistencies or contradictions found in the
draft, to secure the inclusion of
additional details and to obtain documentation to verify the
correctness and completeness of
the declaration. In this extensive review of the draft FFCD, the
IAEA was assisted by
experts from Member States who are thoroughly familiar with the
details of the Iraqi nuclear
programme through their participation in previous inspection
missions. Based on the
clarifications provided in response to questions asked by the
inspectors, the Iraqi counterpart
undertook the preparation of a second draft of the FFCD, which,
except for Volume II
(EMIS related technologies) was provided to the IAEA on 21 June
1996. At the time the
present report was prepared (August 1996), the review of the
draft FFCD was 50%
complete. If the Iraqi counterpart continues to co-operate at the
present level, it should be
possible to conclude the assessment of this document within a few
months.
<P>         
<B>III. Ongoing monitoring and verification (OMV) activities</B>
<P>         
<I>A. Operations</I>
<P>
13.   In the period under review (1 September 1995 through August
1996), the Baghdad-based IAEA Nuclear Monitoring Group will have
conducted more than 300 monitoring
inspections of which more than 30 were carried out at sites which
had not been previously
inspected. This will bring the total number of OMV inspections
since the start of OMV
implementation in August 1994, to over 600. The majority of these
inspections were carried
out with no prior announcement and one such inspection, carried
out in co-operation with
monitoring staff of the UN Special Commission, took place during
the night. No indication
of prohibited equipment, materials or activities was detected.
<P>         
14. Since July 1995 and in the frame of their OMV activities, the
IAEA and the Special
Commission have started to implement a joint programme of
inspection of Iraqi sites that in
the judgement of IAEA/UNSCOM are deemed to have capabilities
suitable for conducting
work on some aspect of weapons of mass destruction, despite the
lack of evidence or
indication of such work. The carrying out of joint IAEA-UNSCOM
multi-disciplinary
inspections at "capable" sites on a regular basis will contribute
to the effectiveness of the
OMV plans to detect any attempt by Iraq to conduct activities
proscribed by Security
Council's resolutions. In the period under review five such
inspections at "capable" sites,
coordinated by the IAEA, have been conducted by joint IAEA-UNSCOM
teams. On
7 July 1996, the fifth such multi-disciplinary inspection of a
"capable" site met with some
difficulties to gain immediate access to the site. The facility
to be inspected was a factory
building located inside an army camp. On arrival at the entrance
gate, the joint
IAEA/UNSCOM team was advised that the facility was an
installation of the Special Guards
and as such was considered to be a sensitive site, hence the
UNSCOM "modalities for
inspection of sensitive sites" were to be applied. The team was
kept at the gate for
approximately two hours waiting for the arrival from Baghdad of a
high ranking Iraqi officer,
before being granted access and allowed to proceed with the
inspection. No indication of
prohibited equipment, materials, or activities was detected.
<P>
15. The sixth and seventh periodic radiometric surveys of Iraq's
main water bodies were
completed in October 1995 and April 1996. Each survey involved
the collection of samples
of water, sediment and biota from 15 sites selected from the more
than 50 locations for
which baseline data had been established in the original survey
completed in November 1992.
<P>         
16. The Nuclear Monitoring Group, in co-operation with the
counterpart, arranged for the repackaging of the inventory of
natural uranium tetrachloride from the severely corroded
steel drums to corrosion resistant high density plastic
containers. The opportunity was taken
to re-verify the quantity of this nuclear material and to place
it under individual IAEA seals.
<P>         
<I>B. Technical developments</I>
<P>         
17. Geographic position loggers, developed and donated by the
Government of the United
States, were successfully commissioned. These devices, which
measure and store geographic
position against time, are now in use in the air sampling
programme which uses road vehicle
and helicopter-based collection systems. It is expected to use
geoposition loggers with other
transportable sensors.
<P>         
<I>C. Video surveillance</I>
<P>         
18. Video surveillance is used individually and jointly by the
IAEA and UNSCOM to
assist in the monitoring of activities at Iraqi facilities. The
surveillance systems have the
capabilities both to record locally and to transmit the video
signals via radio telephone links,
to the BMVC. These capabilities have recently been extended to
allow the video signals to
be transmitted to the IAEA headquarters via satellite telephone
links and to be viewed in the
Action Team Operations Office.
<P>         
<I>D. Procurement matters</I>
<P>         
19. The active co-operation of the Member States involved has
made it possible to locate
a carbon fibre filament winding machine, the procurement of which
was initiated by Iraq in
mid-1990 for use in the production of rotors for uranium
enrichment gas centrifuges. The
winding machine was shipped from Switzerland, in February 1991,
through Singapore and
was received in Jordan in July 1991, where it has remained until
located in November 1995.
Arrangements have been made with the assistance of the Government
of Jordan to inspect
the machine in situ. The final disposition of the machine - the
location of which was notified
to the Agency in February 1996 - is yet to be determined, but its
discovery represents the
successful conclusion to this particular investigation into
Iraq's clandestine procurement
activities, started in May 1994 on the basis of information
obtained from open sources.
<P>         
<I>E. Exploitation of the documentation cache</I>
<P>         
20. As previously reported, the so-called "Haider House Farm
documentation cache",
declared to have been withheld on the express orders of the late
Hussein Kamel Hassan Al
Majid, was subject to immediate review before being transferred
from the BMVC to IAEA
Headquarters in Vienna. Since that time, additional documentation
has been provided by the
counterpart to the extent that our library now contains what
appears to be an almost complete series of the 1,572 technical
reports issued by PC-3 and a large number of drawings of the
various designs of gas centrifuge machine prototypes.
The documentation library has been further exploited to provide
even fuller
understanding of the activities undertaken by Iraq in the area of
uranium enrichment
technologies and weapon development. In the uranium enrichment
area the Agency has been
assisted by experts from Member States, who have carried out a
thorough review of the
centrifuge enrichment information in order to determine the
extent of foreign assistance
received by Iraq. A similar analysis of weaponisation-related
documentation is in progress.
<P>         
21.   In August 1996, a preliminary scanning of some 50,000
aperture cards (microfiche)
found in the Haider House farm cache was completed in order to
identify documents which
deserve further detailed analysis. At the same time work has
started to categorise a first
batch of some 72,000 microfilm frames handed over by the Iraqi
counterpart in the course
of IAEA-30 second stage (June 1996). These 72,00 frames are only
approximately 15%
of the documentary material in microfilm form made available by
Iraq since August 1995,
which amounts to 9 km of roll film.
<P>         
22. The management of the documentation library and its further
exploitation is an
ongoing task of the Agency's Action Team.
<P>         
<B>IV. The export/import monitoring mechanism</B>
<P>         
23.   Pursuant to paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 715
(1991), a mechanism for
the monitoring of sales and supplies to Iraq of items relevant to
the implementation of section
C of resolution 687 (1991) and other relevant resolutions,
including resolution 715 and the
plans approved thereunder, was developed by the Committee
established under resolution 661
(1990) (the "Sanctions Committee"), the Special Commission and
the IAEA. The mechanism
provides for notification by Iraq of intended imports of those
items identified by the IAEA
and the Special Commission in the revised annexes to their
respective plans for ongoing
monitoring and verification (documents S/1995/215 and Corr.1 and
2 and S/1995/208 and
Corr.1). It also provides for notification by supplier States of
planned supplies of such
items to Iraq. The notifications are to be submitted to the IAEA
and the Special
Commission through a joint unit, located in New York, constituted
by the IAEA and the
Special Commission. Thereafter, Iraq would be required to declare
the arrival, and end use,
of such items in Iraq. Those declarations would be subject to
verification by the IAEA and
the Special Commission under their plans.
<P>         
24.   On 27 March 1996, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter
of the United Nations,
the Security Council unanimously approved the export/import
monitoring mechanism in
resolution 1051. The resolution requires implementation of the
mechanism by Iraq as from
a date to be agreed upon by the IAEA, the Special Commission and
Iraq, but in any event
not later than sixty days from the adoption of the resolution
(i.e., 27 May 1996). All other
States must begin to notify the joint unit of intended exports to
Iraq as from the date the
Secretary-General and the Director General of the IAEA report to
the Security Council, after
consultations with members of the Security Council and other
interested States, that they are
satisfied with the preparedness of States for the effective
implementation of the mechanism.
The Security Council further decided that all States are to be
provided, not later than 45 days after the adoption of resolution
1051, by the Special Commission and the IAEA with
information necessary to make preparatory arrangements at the
national level prior to the
implementation of the provisions of the mechanism.
<P>         
25. As recognised by the Security Council, the export/import
mechanism is an integral
part of ongoing monitoring and verification by the Special
Commission and the IAEA. The
mechanism is not a regime for international licensing, but rather
for the timely provision of
information by States of sales or supplies to Iraq of items
covered by the plans for ongoing
monitoring and verification. As further recognised by the
Council, the mechanism "will not
impede Iraq's legitimate right to import or export for
non-proscribed purposes, items and
technology necessary for the promotion of its economic and social
development".
<P>         
26. Finally, under the same resolution (paragraph 16), the
Security Council decided to
consolidate the periodic requirements for progress reports under
resolutions 699 (1991), 715
(1991) and resolution 1051 and to request the Secretary-General
and the Director General of
the IAEA to submit such consolidated progress reports every six
months to the Council,
commencing on 11 April 1996.
<P>         
<B>V. Conclusions</B>
<P>         
27. The IAEA has continued rigorously to implement its plan for
the ongoing monitoring
and verification of Iraq's compliance with its obligations under
United Nations Security
Council resolutions. It has not, since the last report to the
General Conference, seen
instances of activities or the presence, in Iraq, of equipment or
materials, proscribed by those
resolutions. The Iraqi counterpart has continued to co-operate
with the IAEA in a productive
way. The IAEA is conscious, however, that the expertise and
know-how acquired by Iraqi
scientists and engineers can provide an adequate base for
re-constituting a nuclear weapons
oriented programme. A continuing high level of vigilance is
necessary to avert this risk.
<P>         
28. Iraq has made a major effort to provide a detailed account of
its past covert nuclear
programme in the latest draft of the "Full, Final and Complete
Declaration" called for in
Security Council resolution 707 (1991). The IAEA has undertaken
an in depth appraisal of
this document aiming at assessing its correctness and
completeness and focusing, in
particular, on those areas where, in the opinion of IAEA, Iraq '
s achievements are
understated. Barring surprises it can be expected that a
satisfactory Iraqi account of their
covert nuclear weapons programme will attain its final form
within a few months.
<P>
29. The original Iraqi documentation concerning the past nuclear
programme continues
to be examined and further additions have been made in the period
under review as the
counterpart has realised that the correctness and completeness of
their statements must rest
on original project documents.
<P>         
30. In discharging the tasks assigned to it by the UN Security
Council, the IAEA
continues to benefit from the assistance of Member States through
the secondment of cost-
free experts, the access to advanced technologies and the
provision of information.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1.    In the period under review - <B>1 September 1995 through
August 1996</B> - the IAEA
has maintained a continuous presence in Iraq of its Nuclear
Monitoring Group (NMG) to
implement the Ongoing Monitoring and Verification (OMV) Plan
called for in UN Security
Council resolution 687 (1991) and approved in UN Security Council
resolution 715 (1991).
The Plan's main purpose is to monitor and verify Iraq's
compliance with paragraph 12 of UN
Security Council resolution 687 (1991) and paragraphs 3 and 5 of
UN Security Council
resolution 707 (1991).
<P>
Events which occurred in August 1995 following the arrival in
Jordan of General
Hussein Kamel Hassan Al Majid,<A HREF="#note_d"><SUP>1/</SUP></A>
although commanding a shift in
priority of other
activities, did not detract from the full implementation of the
IAEA's OMV Plan. Resident
inspectors of the NMG have continued their work in the field
according to schedule, with the
support of the staff of the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification
Centre (BMVC) and in co-
ordination with the chemical, biological and missile Groups of
the Special Commission.
Since 1 September 1995, more than 300 monitoring inspections -
most of them unannounced
- will have been conducted including more than 30 at sites not
previously inspected. This
will bring the total number of OMV inspections since the start of
the OMV Plan
implementation in August 1994 to more than 600. No indication of
prohibited equipment,
materials or activities has been detected.
<P>         
2. The twenty-eighth inspection mission in Iraq under Security
Council resolution 687
(1991) took place from <B>9 to 19 September 1995</B>. The primary
objective of the inspection
was to follow-up on revelations made by the Iraqi authorities on
their past covert
programmes in the aftermath of the departure to Amman of Gen.
Hussein Kamel. The
following provides highlights of the IAEA-28 mission's findings:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>For the first time, it was acknowledged by Iraq what the IAEA
had always maintained
i.e., that the activities carried out at first at Tuwaitha and
later at Al Atheer had been
aimed at the production of a nuclear device and not only to the
definition of what was
         required to produce it, as had previously been asserted
by Iraq. Key documentation
on Iraq's design of a nuclear device was provided to the IAEA.
<P>
<LI>The involvement of the Al Qa Qaa State Establishment in
support of the development
of the implosion package was for the first time acknowledged by
Iraq and declared
to have begun in 1987.
<P>
<LI>The crash programme which was initiated in the late summer of
1990 had been
planned to comprise the chemical processing of both unirradiated
and irradiated
research reactor fuel placed under IAEA safeguards to recover the
highly enriched
uranium (HEU) from the fuel; the re-enrichment of part of the HEU
through the use
of a 50-machine centrifuge cascade which was to have been
specially constructed for
the purpose; the conversion of the HEU chemical compounds to
metal. Had the HEU
recovery and enrichment process been successful, it could have
resulted in the
availability by the end of 1991 of a quantity of HEU sufficient
to manufacture a
single low-yield nuclear device.
<P>
<LI>Also planned were measures such as the fabrication of the
implosion package and the
selection and construction of a test site and studies of a
delivery system. Assembly
of the device could not have been possible, according to the
estimate of the Iraqis
scientists, before the end of 1992. The validity of this estimate
was one of the issues
addressed during IAEA-28 and has to be assessed by the IAEA with
the assistance of
nuclear weapons experts.
<P>
<LI>Detailed explanations were provided by Iraqi authorities of
centrifuge related activities
in the buildings of the Engineering Design Centre (Rashdiya), but
no convincing
rationale was offered for Iraq's continued concealment, even
after the commencement
in July 1993 of the high-level technical talks, of the role
played by the Engineering
Design Centre in the covert nuclear programme.
<P>
<LI>No evidence has as of yet been found of practical progress
towards the establishment
of the 50-machine centrifuge enrichment cascade, although it
appears that external
assistance was to have been relied upon for the procurement and
production of the
carbon fibre cylinders and other components of the centrifuge
rotors.
<P>
<LI>Wide ranging information was obtained which provided
clarification and confirmation
of various aspects of the procurement network established to
support the centrifuge
enrichment project.
<P>
<LI>In spite of the obvious progress in openness and transparency
shown by a number of
Iraqi staff participating in the technical discussions, there was
still a tendency to
misrepresent the expertise and competence of Iraqi scientists and
engineers both in
the areas of programme co-ordination and in some specific R & D
activities.
<P>
<LI>Initial indications do not appear to conflict with the IAEA's
assessment of the scope
and status of Iraq's clandestine programme to acquire nuclear
weapon capability, as
set out in the IAEA's seventh semi-annual report to the Security
Council. However,
it would be premature to draw any definitive conclusions pending
analysis of the
recently acquired documentation, samples and other information.

3.    At its thirty-ninth regular session, on <B>22 September
1995</B>,
the IAEA's General
Conference adopted resolution CG(39)/RES/5 commending the
Director General and the
Agency's Action Team for their strenuous efforts to implement
Security Council resolutions
687, 707 and 715 and requesting them to continue their efforts;
welcoming the work done
by the Agency towards establishing a mechanism for monitoring
future sales and supplies of designated items to Iraq; noting
that with the establishment of a continuous presence of
Agency inspectors in Iraq the plan for the ongoing monitoring and
verification of Iraq's
compliance with its obligations under relevant Security Council
resolutions became
operational as of the end of August 1994; urging Iraq to
co-operate fully with the Agency
in achieving the complete and long-term implementation of the
relevant Security Council
resolutions, especially regarding the Ongoing Monitoring and
Verification Plan; condemning
Iraq for having, since 1991, withheld from the Agency information
about its nuclear weapons
programme, in violation of its obligations under Security Council
resolutions 687, 707 and
715; demanding that Iraq hand over to the Agency without further
delay any currently
undisclosed nuclear-weapon-related equipment, material or
information, as called for in
Security Council resolutions 687, 707 and 715; stressing that the
Agency will continue to
exercise its right to investigate further any aspects of Iraq's
past nuclear weapons capability,
in particular as regards the new information obtained by the
Agency in August 1995 and any
further relevant information that Iraq may still be withholding
from the Agency; and
requesting the Director General to report the views of the
General Conference to the
Secretary General of the United Nations and to report to the
Board of Governors and to the
fortieth regular session of the General Conference on his efforts
to implement Security
Council resolution 687, 707 and 715 and; deciding to remain
seized of this issue.
<P>         
4. As requested in operating paragraph 8 of General Conference
resolution
GC(39)/RES/S, by letter dated <B>12 October 1995</B> the Acting
Director
General, David B.
Waller reported the views of the General Conference to the
Security Council of the United
Nations.
<P>         
5.    On <B>13 October 1995</B>, the Director General briefed the
Security Council in an
informal session and submitted his eighth semi-annual report on
the implementation of the
Agency's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's
compliance with paragraph
12 of resolutions 687(1991). In highlighting the content of his
report, the Director General
made the following points:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The IAEA's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification had
been operating for over
a year and during that period some 326 inspections at 83
facilities, installations and
sites had been done, mostly without prior notice;
<P>
<LI>Iraq had finally acknowledged what the IAEA knew all along
that it was actually
trying to develop a nuclear weapon and not just exploring the
possibilities;
<P>
<LI>The highly enriched uranium (HEU) contained in Agency
safeguarded research
reactor fuel that the inspectors found intact in May 1991, was
not left as it was out
of respect for legal commitments; it was slated for use in a
nuclear bomb but the plan
could not be implemented because of the bombing that destroyed
the technical tools
for processing it;
<P>
<LI>The plan to divert the HEU for weapons purposes was a
violation of Iraq's NPT and
safeguards obligations;
<P>
<LI>The withholding of the documentation on Iraq's weapons
programme was a violation
of Iraq's obligations under the relevant Security Council
resolutions;
<P>
<LI>Despite the masses of documents and other items that had now
been released, the
IAF.A ill believed that there must be more concealed documents
and that, in any  case, Iraq still had at its disposal expertise
and know-how to reconstitute the
programme; vigilance would continue under the ongoing monitoring
and verification
system;
<P>
<LI>The documents made available in August which were being
carefully analysed, might
give reason for further investigations that could help in filling
remaining gaps in the
IAEA's knowledge;
</UL>
<P>         
The Director General stressed, however, that the new revelations
were unlikely to
change the conclusion reported to the Security Council in 1994:
namely, that the essential
components of the nuclear weapons programme had been identified
and eventually destroyed
or rendered harmless. That conclusion was based not only on Iraqi
statements and
documents but also on inspections, on information received from
former suppliers and on the
Action Team's analysis of the consistency of the overall
programme. No evidence had been
discovered of any unknown relevant installations.
<P>
The Director General also briefed the Council on the measures
taken by the IAEA
since 1991 to strengthen the safeguards system, with the aim of
detecting possible non-
declared activities. The Agency needed access to more
information, freer access to sites for
inspections and early access to the Security Council in cases of
resistance. Much had been
accomplished so far e.g. reporting procedures on import/export of
relevant items,
introduction of environmental sampling, recognition of IAEA's
role by the Security Council
in its Summit Statement on non-proliferation. More recently, the
IAEA had continued to
strengthen the system through its "93+2" programme. The Agency's
authority and its
safeguards responsibilities had been reaffirmed by the NPT
Conference and states were urged
to communicate their relevant concerns to the Agency. For rapid
communication, the
Director General had established a "hot-line" link with the
Secretary General and was willing
to brief the Council whenever necessary, including by
teleconferencing. The text of the
Director General's eighth semi-annual report to the Security
Council can be found in
document GOV/INF/776.
<P>         
6. The twenty-ninth IAEA inspection mission in Iraq under
Security Council resolution
687 (1991) was carried out from <B>17 to 25 October 1995</B> to
continue
investigations, begun
in September during the twenty-eighth inspection mission, into
revelations made by the Iraqi
authorities after the departure of General Hussein Kamel from
Iraq. Detailed discussions
with the Iraqi counterpart, focused on Iraq' s centrifuge
enrichment and weaponisation
technologies, helped to refine the IAEA's assessment of Iraq's
state of knowledge of these
technologies, in particular:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It was confirmed that although Iraq's nuclear weapons
programme plan, established
in 1988, had the objective to produce a small arsenal of weapons
- with the first
device being produced in 1991 - the three main components of the
programme,
namely the production of HEU from domestic sources of uranium,
the design and
production of a viable device and the development of a delivery
system, had not
progressed equally to meet the planned schedule.
<P>
<LI>The weapon design component was in the opinion of the Iraqi
counterpart, making
the best progress and with the solution of the few problems
remaining in January
1991, the weaponisation group was confident that the finalisation
of a viable design
could have been achieved close to schedule. On the last day of
its stay in Iraq, the
team was provided with an optical disk on which reports from PC-3
Fourth Group (Weaponisation), dated from 1988 to 1991, were
stored. These reports, in Arabic,
seem to cover the most significant areas of the weaponisation
activities and will
require several months to be properly assessed.
<P>
<LI>The production of HEU by enrichment of domestic uranium,
pursued through the two
parallel lines of electromagnetic isotope separators (EMIS) and
gas centrifuges was
lagging far behind. In January 1991, EMIS was years away from
completion of the
plant and the centrifuge enrichment was still at the stage of
single machine testing.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to the information provided by Iraq, drawings
contained in the Haider
House Farm cache show that their interest in the long,
super-critical centrifuge
machine clearly went beyond the stage of efficiency calculations.
Furthermore,
although the Iraqi counterpart told IAEA-28 they had never
carried out procurement
activity for the supercritical machine, it was admitted to
IAEA-29 that they had
sought bellows production technology and that their consultant -
identity known to
IAEA - had provided them with three sample bellows.
<P>
<LI>Although some originals of EDC project drawings and documents
have been found
in the Haider House Farm cache, IAEA inspectors are convinced
that many more
documents relating to the centrifuge programme have been produced
than have been
provided to the IAEA. Despite the Iraqi counterpart's assurances
to the contrary it
remains difficult to accept that these, and other, documents do
not remain in storage
somewhere in Iraq.
<P>         
<LI>It became clear that the design and development of the
delivery system had
progressed further than previously disclosed. According to the
Iraqi counterpart,
several meetings and detailed technical exchanges had taken
place, during the second
half of 1990, between the nuclear weapon and the missile groups.
A modification of
the Al Hussein missile was being designed with a separable
warhead to deliver a
payload of 1 ton over a distance of 600 kilometres and it was
estimated that this
development could have been completed within six months.
<P>
<LI>Iraq has developed or otherwise acquired many of the
technologies required to
produce deliverable nuclear weapons but the attempt made by Iraq
to assemble a
nuclear device by diverting HEU from their safeguarded research
reactor fuel is a
clear indication that their uranium enrichment programme was
still far from
production in January 1991.
<P>
<LI>The Gulf War destroyed Iraq's EMIS facilities and halted
their efforts to master
centrifuge technology. Although the IAEA has removed from Iraq
all existing
research reactor fuel and hence any in-country source of quickly
available weapons-
usable nuclear material, vigilance is necessary to prevent the
direct acquisition of
nuclear weapons-usable material by Iraq in view of the low
signature associated with
weaponisation activities.
</UL>
<P>         
The report of the 29th inspection can be found in document
GOV/INF/783.
<P>         
7. The sixth periodic radiometric survey of Iraq's main water
bodies was completed on
<B>22 October 1995</B>. The survey involved the collection of
samples of
water, sediment and
biota from 15 sites selected from the more than 50 locations for
which baseline data had been
established in the original survey completed in November 1992.
<P>
8. On <B>1 November 1995</B>, the Director General addressed the
fiftieth session of the
United Nations General Assembly. In presenting the IAEA's annual
report, he summarised
the results of the IAEA's activities in Iraq as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>         
"As I reported to the General Assembly last year, it is our
conclusion that the
essential components of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapon
programme have been
identified and destroyed, removed or rendered harmless. This
assessment was not
based on faith in Iraqi statements, but on data gathered during
inspections, on
information provided by the suppliers and Member States and, to a
great extent, on analysis of the large number of original
documents which were obtained in Iraq early
in the inspection process. Since August 1994, IAEA inspectors
have been continuously
present in Iraq to perform on-going monitoring and verification
of Iraq's compliance
with the relevant Security Council resolutions. This does not
exclude the further
conduct of inspections for the purpose of investigation, should
such an investigation
be called for, for example, to verify new information.
<P>
Recently the IAEA received additional information on Iraq's
former nuclear
weapons programme by way of new declarations, voluminous
documents and other
materials, which were transmitted to the IAEA and UNSCOM by Iraq
following the
departure of the former Iraqi Minister of Industry and Military
Industrialisation.
What we have been told is that in 1990, Iraqi authorities
instituted a crash project to
take safeguarded highly enriched research reactor fuel and
transform the fissile
material for use in a nuclear weapon. It is uncertain whether
Iraq would have been
able to overcome the considerable technical difficulties involved
in this project. As it was, the project was made impossible by
damage inflicted on the nuclear research
centre at Tuwaitha by the January 1991 bombing and the
safeguarded nuclear fuel
was fully accounted for in the IAEA post-war inspection. The new
Iraqi declarations,
along with all of the documents and materials to which I have
referred, are currently
being carefully examined for any new data. What can be concluded
at this stage is
that Iraq's withholding of information, documents and materials
clearly constitutes a
breach of Iraqi obligations under the Security Council
resolutions and that the crash
programme was in violation of the safeguards agreement and the
NPT."
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>         
9.   On <B>20 November 1995</B>, Gen. Amer Rashid Al Ubaydi,
Iraqi
Minister of Oil and
Chief technical counterpart in all rounds of "high level
technical talks", visited the Director
General and met with the IAEA's Action Team to discuss progress
made in the post-August
1995 inspections and current issues related to the IAEA's
activities in Iraq. Gen. Amer
stated that he and Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, had several
meetings with the former         principals of the nuclear
programme after the August events urging them to tell the IAEA
all that they knew "even if they believed the information was not
relevant to resolution 687".
In acknowledging the reticence shown by some Iraqi officials,
described in the reports of the
twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth inspection missions, Gen. Amer
stated that although Hussein
Kamel's orders to conceal the truth had been revoked and he was
now out of the country,
his legacy still lingered and not everyone had yet realised that
now, the whole truth was
being demanded by the Iraqi government, because it was in the
best interest of the country.

<P>
10.   By letter dated <B>14 December 1995</B>, the Director
General
provided information to the
United Nations Secretary General on the progress made by the IAEA
in implementing the
Agency's plan for the destruction, removal or rendering harmless
of the items specified in
paragraph 12 of the resolution 687 (1991). The text of this
letter can be found in document
GOV/INF/782.
<P>         
11.   On <B>1 March 1996</B>, the Iraqi National Monitoring
Directorate
handed over to the
IAEA's Nuclear Monitoring Group in Baghdad the draft of the
"Full, Final and Complete
Declaration (FFCD) of the Iraqi National Nuclear Programme." The
IAEA undertook the
assessment of this document as a high priority task.
<P>         
12.   On <B>19 March 1996</B>, the Agency's Board of Governors
considered, under item 5 of
the Agenda, the report of the Director General on the
implementation of the United Nations
Security Council resolution 687, 707 and 715 relating to Iraq
(document GOV/2846). The
Board took note of the report and requested the Secretariat that
the report, updated as
appropriate, together with the customary chronology on the
Agency's activities in 1995 -1996
as an attachment, be submitted to the forthcoming regular session
of the General Conference
in response to the request contained in resolution GC(39)/RES/5.
<P>         
13.   On <B>27 March 1996</B>, the United Nations Security
Council
adopted resolution 1051
concerning the Iraqi export/import monitoring mechanism. Pursuant
to paragraph 7 of
Security Council resolution 715 (1991), a mechanism for the
monitoring of sales and supplies
to Iraq of items relevant to the implementation of section C of
resolution 687 (1991) and
other relevant resolutions, including resolution 715 and the
plans approved thereunder, was
developed by the Committee established under resolution 661
(1990) (the Sanctions
Committee), the Special Commission and the IAEA. The mechanism
provides for
notification by Iraq of intended imports of those items
identified by the IAEA and the Special
Commission in the revised annexes to their respective plans for
ongoing monitoring and
verification (documents S/1995/215 and Corr. 1 and 2 and
S/1995/208 and Corr.1). It also
provides for notification by supplier States of planned supplies
of such items to Iraq. The
notifications are to be submitted to the IAEA and the Special
Commission through a joint
unit, located in New York, constituted by the IAEA and the
Special Commission.
Thereafter, Iraq would be required to declare the arrival, and
end use, of such items in Iraq.
Those declarations would be subject to verification by the IAEA
and the Special Commission
under their plans.
<P>
The resolution adopted by the Council, acting under Chapter VII
of the United
Nations Charter, requires implementation of the mechanism by Iraq
as from a date to be
agreed upon by the IAEA, the Special Commission and Iraq, but in
any event not later than
sixty days from the adoption of the resolution (i.e., 27 May
1996). All other States must
begin to notify the joint unit of intended exports to Iraq as
from the date the Secretary
General and the Director General of the IAEA report to the
Security Council, after
consultations with members of the Security Council and other
interested States, that they are
satisfied with the preparedness of States for the effective
implementation of the mechanism.
The Security Council further decided that all States are to be
provided, not later than 45 days
after the adoption of resolution 1051, by the Special Commission
and the IAEA with
information necessary to make preparatory arrangements at the
national level prior to the
implementation of the provisions of the mechanism.
<P>
As recognised by the Security Council, the export/import
mechanism is an integral
part of ongoing monitoring and verification by the Special
Commission and the IAEA. The
mechanism is not a regime for international licensing, but rather
for the timely provision of
information by States of sales or supplies to Iraq of items
covered by the plans for ongoing
monitoring and verification. As further recognised by the
Council, the mechanism "will not
impede Iraq's legitimate right to import or export for
non-proscribed purposes, items and
technology necessary for the promotion of its economic and social
development".
<P>
Finally, the Security Council decided to consolidate the periodic
requirements for
progress reports under resolutions 699 (1991), 715 (1991) and
resolution 1051 and to request
the Secretary General and the Director General of the IAEA to
submit such consolidated
progress reports every six months to the Council, commencing on
11 April 1996.
<P>         
14.   On <B>11 April 1996</B>, the Director General submitted to
the Secretary General of the United Nations the first
consolidated six-monthly report on IAEA activities relating to
Iraq called for in the Security Council resolution 1051 (1996).
The report, which covers the period October 1995 - April 1996
described results achieved in the course of IAEA-28 and IAEA-29
inspection missions and clarifications provided by the Iraqi
authorities on the indigenous reactor project (Project 182), on
uranium enrichment by solvent extraction, ion exchange and
gaseous diffusion methods and on the options pursued by Iraq for
a missile delivery vehicle for their nuclear device. Other
chapters of the report covered the implementation of the OMV
Plan, progress made in procurement matters, the reception of
the draft FFCD and the work undertaken by the IAEA to exploit the
large number of original Iraqi documents handed over since August
1995. The text of the report can be found in document
GOV/INF/791.
<P>         
15. The seventh periodic radiometric survey of Iraq's main water
bodies was conducted
from <B>20 to 27 April 1996</B>. As usual, samples of water,
sediment
and biota were collected
at 15 sites selected from the more than 50 locations for which
baseline data had been
established in the original survey completed in November 1992.
<P>         
16. By <B>May 1996</B>, a first detailed analysis of the content
of the
Iraqi draft FFCD
submitted had been completed by the Agency with the assistance of
experts from IAEA
Member States. The document was found to provide an acceptable
basis to start a detailed
discussion with the Iraqi counterpart in order to arrive at a
satisfactory final version of the
FFCD. An "ad hoc" mission (IAEA-30) was organised to clarify
apparent inconsistencies
and contradictions in the draft FFCD and to request additional
information which in the
IAEA's judgement were needed in certain areas of the programme.
<P>         
17.   The first stage of IAEA-30 was conducted from <B>13 to 19
May 1996</B> and the second took place from <B>17 June to 8 July
1996</B>. Based on the results
achieved in a series of
meetings with the counterpart, Iraq undertook to prepare a second
draft of the FFCD which
apart from volume II (EMIS related technology) was provided to
the IAEA on 21 June 1996.
At the time the present report was prepared (August 1996) the
review of the draft FFCD was
50% complete.
<P>
18.   On <B>7 June 1996</B>, General Amer Rashid Al Ubaydi met
the
Director General at the
IAEA headquarters in Vienna to discuss current issues which were
of concern to the Iraqi
government. He referred in particular to the time consuming
process undertaken by the
IAEA to verify the correctness and completeness of the FFCD which
involved analyses of
"less significant details". Gen. Amer touched on the monitoring
of the present assignments
of former key staff involved in the nuclear covert programme. He
also added that the
IAEA's opinion that Iraq still retained a complete record of the
nuclear programme was
"totally wrong". In addressing those comments, the Director
General noted that the IAEA
Secretariat was well focused on matters of significance and was
using its best efforts to reach
a conclusion as soon as feasible. It should be understood
however, that the events of August
1995 and the revelation of the "crash programme" had shaken
confidence in Iraq's statements
and co-operation. Technical expertise still existed in Iraq even
if the facilities and equipment
had been neutralised and this made ongoing monitoring inevitable.
As part of the monitoring
process, the Director General stated that it was important to the
IAEA to verify current
activities of people previously involved in the nuclear
programme.
<P>         
19.   From <B>24 to 29 June 1996</B>, the leader of the IAEA
Action Team
was in Baghdad and
had separate meetings with the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq
Aziz, the Iraqi Minister
of Oil, Gen. Amer Rashid Al Ubaydi and Dr. Jafar Dhia Jafar, the
minister formerly
responsible for PC-3. Progress made since the last round of high
level technical talks
(August 1995) was reviewed. Problems linked to the verification
of the correctness and
completeness of the FFCD and to the monitoring of personnel
current assignments were
discussed and assurance was given of the Iraqi Government's
intention to facilitate the task
of the Action Team in every possible way.

<LI>In resolution <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r4.html"
>GC(39)/RES/4</A> on this subject, the General
Conference last year:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>commended</I> the African States "for their united efforts
directed towards the establishment of an African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone" and <I>requested</I> the Director
General "to continue to assist them in this regard".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In the latter connection the resolution also <I>requested</I> the
Director General:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"to report on the implementation of this resolution to the
General Conference at its fortieth regular session under an
agenda item entitled 'An African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone'."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This report is pursuant to that request.
<P>
<LI>In resolution GC(39)/RES/4, the General Conference welcomed
the progress made towards the conclusion of a treaty on an
African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone on the basis of the Declaration
on the Denuclearization of Africa, adopted by the Summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its first ordinary
session, held in Cairo from 17-21 July 1964, and of resolution
A/RES/49/138 adopted on 19 December 1994 by the General Assembly
of the United Nations. In that respect, it may be recalled that,
in 1993, the United Nations had requested the Agency to help the
Group of Experts designated by the United Nations in co-operation
with the OAU by preparing draft treaty provisions relevant to
verification requirements in a future NWFZ in Africa. The Agency
did so. Last year's report to the General Conference (document
GC(39)/14) explained the Agency's activities in this regard.
<P>
<LI>At their Joint Meeting held at Johannesburg (South Africa)
from 29 May to 2 June 1995, the OAU/United Nations Group of
Experts and the Intergovernmental Group of
Experts of the OAU adopted the Pelindaba text of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. The Pelindaba text was submitted
to the OAU Council of Ministers at its Sixty-second Ordinary
Session held at Addis Ababa from 21 to 23 June 1995. The OAU
Council of Ministers adopted the text of the Treaty, as amended
by resolution OAU CM/Res. 1592 (LXII)/Rev.1. Subsequently, the
African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty)
was adopted by the thirty-first ordinary session of the OAU
Assembly of Heads of State and Governments held in Addis Ababa
from 26 to 28 June 1995. (A copy of the <A

<I>welcomed</I> "with special satisfaction the adoption by the
African leaders of the final text of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty)",
<I>invited</I> "the African States to sign and ratify the
Pelindaba Treaty" and <I>called upon</I> "all States to respect
the continent of Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The resolution also expressed gratitude to the Secretary-General
of the United Nations, to the Secretary-General of the OAU and
the Director General of the IAEA for the assistance rendered by
them to the Group of Experts to prepare a Draft Treaty on an
African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.
<P>
<LI>The signing ceremony of the Pelindaba Treaty took place in
Cairo on 11 April 1996. According to the information provided to
the Agency by the OAU as depositary of the Treaty, as of 22 July
1996, 48 States have signed the Treaty which will enter into
force upon ratification by 28 States. The relevant Protocols to
the Treaty were signed by the majority of the nuclear-weapon
States. On the occasion of the signature of the Pelindaba Treaty,
the African States signatories to the Treaty adopted the Cairo
Declaration (INFCIRC/512) which, <I>inter alia</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
<I>decided</I> "that the first session of the Conference of
States Parties to the Treaty shall be held not later than one
year after its entry into force" and <I>endorsed</I> "the
establishment of the headquarters of the African Commission on
Nuclear Energy in South Africa".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>At the invitation of the Government of the Arab Republic of
Egypt, the Director General attended and addressed the signing
ceremony of the Pelindaba Treaty. (A copy of the statement by the
Director General at the signing ceremony is attached to this
report.) The Director General also briefed African delegations
about the basic features of the Agency's safeguards system as
relevant to the verification of compliance with the Pelindaba
Treaty. He also provided information on the Agency's activities
in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy in general and in
Africa in particular.
<P>
<LI>On 12 April 1996 the President of the Security Council of the
United Nations made a statement on behalf of the Council in which
the Security Council, <I>inter alia</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
<I>considered</I> that the "signature of the African
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty constitutes an important
contribution by the African countries to the maintenance of
international peace and security". The Council also <I>seized
this occasion</I> "to encourage such regional efforts" and "to
support efforts on the international and regional level aimed at
the universality of the nuclear non-proliferation regime".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>There are currently fifty-one States members of the OAU which
are already party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and which have thereby undertaken to use
nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes and accepted
IAEA safeguards to verify compliance with this commitment. The
Agency applies safeguards pursuant to comprehensive safeguards
agreements and facility-specific agreements in six of these
States.
<P>
<LI>It is to be noted, however, that the Pelindaba Treaty
contains a series of undertakings supplementary to those already
assumed by the States parties to the NPT. Unlike the NPT,
the Pelindaba Treaty prohibits the stationing and testing of any
nuclear explosive device in the territories of the parties; it
also commits its parties to apply the highest standards of
security and physical protection of nuclear material, facilities
and equipment to prevent theft and unauthorized use; it prohibits
armed attacks against nuclear installations in the zone; and it
prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste.
<P>
<LI>In addition, the Pelindaba Treaty is not limited to assuring
the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy. Its parties
commit themselves "to promote individually and collectively the
use of nuclear science and technology for economic and social
development"; they are "encouraged to make use of the programme
of assistance available in the IAEA and, in this connection, to
strengthen co-operation under the African Regional Co-operation
Agreement for Research, Training and Development Related to
Nuclear Science and Technology" (Article 8 of the Treaty).
<P>
<LI>Under the Pelindaba Treaty the IAEA is entrusted with the
obligation of verifying, through its safeguards system (Article
9(b) and Annex II of the Treaty), and in accordance with the
complaints procedure provided for in the Treaty (Annex IV of the
Treaty), compliance by the States parties with their commitment
to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. The
Treaty also specifies (in Annex II) that the safeguards agreement
to be negotiated and concluded with the IAEA shall be, or shall
be equivalent in its scope and effect to, the agreement required
in connection with the NPT, and that a "party that has already
entered into a safeguards agreement with the IAEA is deemed to
have already complied with the requirement".         
<P>
<LI>For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of
the Pelindaba Treaty, Article 12 of the Treaty provides for the
establishment of an African Commission on Nuclear Energy. The
Commission will, inter alia, be responsible for collating the
reports and the exchange of information required by the Treaty
and for reviewing the application of safeguards by the IAEA to
peaceful nuclear activities in Africa. It would also encourage
regional and sub-regional programmes for co-operation in the
peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology and be
responsible for promoting international co-operation with
extra-zonal States for the peaceful uses in the aforementioned
field.

<P>
<OL>
<B>I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</B>
<P>
<LI>The background to the Agency's programme in measures against
illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive
sources has been provided in the previous progress report given
at the thirty-ninth General Conference (GC(39)/19). at the
thirty-ninth regular session, the Director General was invited to
continue working in accordance with the conclusions of the Board
of Governors and requested to submit a report to the General
Conference at its next regular session on activities undertaken
by the Agency in the intervening period (<A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r18.html
">GC(39)/RES/18</A>).
<P>
<B>II. SECRETARIAT ACTIONS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1995</B>
<P>
<LI>The Deputy Director General for Safeguards is the
co-ordinator of the Agency's overall programme on measures
regarding illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other
radioactive sources. Projects under this programme are the
responsibility of relevant Departments/Divisions throughout the
Secretariat. A description of the IAEA's role in combating
illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and other radioactive
sources is provided in Annex 1. As stated in this description,
the IAEA's co-operation with Member States fall into four broad
categories of support:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><I>prevention</I>, which involves assisting States to enhance
relevant national infrastructures in the areas of legislation,
physical protection, accounting for and control of nuclear
material, control and security of radioactive sources, and
export/import control;  
<P>
<I>response</I>, which involves assisting States, when requested,
to detect and respond to cross-border movements and to analyze
confiscated materials and utilizing the Agency's data base on
illicit trafficking to provide reliable and authoritative
information in a timely manner to States and the media;
<P>
<DD><I>training</I>, which involves developing and providing
training in both prevention and response; and
<P>
<DD><I>exchange of information</I>, which is accomplished through
international and interagency meetings and conferences.
</DL>
<P>
Activities since the last General Conference are described in
paragraphs 5-15 below.
<P>
<LI>While some of the Agency assistance in the area of illicit
trafficking is specifically designed to deal with these issues,
other such assistance to Member States results from the
Agency's Technical Co-operation activities. For example, the
Secretariat has identified 101
projects for 38 Member States where some aspects relate to
illicit trafficking. In addition,
the IAEA together with Donor States have developed "Co-ordinated
Technical Support
Plans" (CTSP's) for the Newly Independent States (NIS) to help
them meet their obligations
for control and accounting of nuclear materials. This support
covers a range of topics
applicable to trafficking in two of the broad areas mentioned
above: prevention and training.
The Agency will continue to be active in these on-going efforts.
<P>
<LI>For 1996 the approved regular budget resources amounted to
$333,000, with extrabudgetary contributions of approximately $1M.
For 1997, a programme has been separately identified in the
Agency's Programme and Budget, "Programme M: Security of
Material," with a regular budget of $560,000 and expected
extrabudgetary contributions of $1.2M. These resources will
ensure the operation of a database, assist Member States in
efforts to improve physical protection and control of nuclear
material, provide border control measures, and support the
adoption by States of the Basic Safety Standards norms that
pertain to illicit trafficking. An important part of this
programme is also carried out by the Department of Technical
Co-operation.
<P>
<B>III. PREVENTION</B>
<P>
<LI>In May 1996 agreement was reached with the International
Group of Legal Experts established to co-ordinate the Group's
Co-operative Programmes in the NIS with the Agency's current and
future projects on legislative assistance. The Group has
activities in seven countries - Belarus, Georgia, Kazakstan,
Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, and Ukraine -  and invitations from
three more countries- Armenia, Kyrghyzstan, and Uzbekistan - to
establish comprehensive, up-to-date systems of nuclear laws,
ordinances, and regulations. Through the co-operative agreement,
the Group has access to the expert and logistic
resources within the Agency. The Technical Secretary of the Group
is an Agency staff member.
<P>
<LI>In October 1995 several Eastern European States and the
Russian Federation were invited to propose projects for
improvements in physical protection. A number of proposals
have been received and discussions have been initiated with
several countries. Some elements of these requests, particularly
those in the area of training, are being implemented.          
<P>         
<LI>A consultants' meeting was held in Vienna in October 1995 to
develop the concept of an International Physical Protection
Advisory Service (IPPAS). This Agency advisory service, which was
announced in April 1996, will arrange, when requested, to have an
international team of experts review the effectiveness of
national regulatory programmes and the physical protection of
nuclear material at particular facilities. One request has been
received and interest has been expressed by several States. 
Missions are expected to begin this fall.
<P>
<LI>Documents are being developed to facilitate the
implementation of physical protection measures. A draft
<I>Physical Protection System Design Handbook</I> describing
physical protection principles and practices has been reviewed by
a group of experts and revisions are in progress. In addition, a
consultants meeting was held in June 1996 to develop Agency
guidance for the implementation of INFCIRC/225/Rev.3. Experts
from seven countries reviewed the INFCIRC and developed the first
draft of a document providing additional guidance for
implementing the portions of the INFCIRC document which may be
difficult to interpret.
<P>
<LI>In July 1996 the Agency along with the World Customs
Organization (WCO) hosted a joint Technical Committee Meeting on
Detecting and Responding to Illicit Cross-border
Movement of Radiation Material. The committee meeting reviewed
documents dealing with detecting and responding to cross-border
trafficking of radioactive material established by previous
consultants services meetings and expert group meetings, and
drafted a safety practice document on detection instrumentation
and training of border control personnel. A number of
recommendations for future Agency and WCO actions which resulted
from the meeting are attached as Annex 2.
<P>
<B>IV. RESPONSE</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency data base on illicit trafficking incidents has
been used to generate a summary listing of confirmed incidents of
illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive
sources for distribution to all Member States in September 1996.
It is planned
that summary listings will be issued quarterly. Based on the
experience gained during the
past year, Member States have been informed of changes made in
the way information on
trafficking incidents is handled (Circular Letter N4.11.42 Circ.,
dated 21 August 1996). The
changes will provide for improvements in notification of
trafficking incidents through a
revised incident notification form that can be sent by fax or
electronic mail directly to the
Agency's Trafficking Database Office.
<P>
<LI>The number of Member States expressing their interest in the
sharing of information about illicit trafficking incidents has
increased during the past year. To date, 30 countries
have identified their point of contact for matters concerning
illicit trafficking incidents to the Agency.
<P>
<B>V. TRAINING</B>
<P>
<LI>The IAEA co-ordinates international and regional training of
State System of Accounting and Control (SSAC) staff and facility
personnel. A regional training session was conducted in Japan in
November 1995 and an international session was conducted in St.
Petersburg in June 1996.
<P>
<LI>Training courses administered by the Agency in the area of
physical protection during the past year have ranged from the
international to the local level. The Secretariat is
preparing for the next regular session of the three-week long
International Training Course on Physical Protection in
Albuquerque in April 1997. The first Regional Training Course
on Physical Protection of Nuclear Facilities and Materials was
held in Brno, Czech Republic in November 1995. This course was
attended by 30 participants from the Russian Federation, the NIS
and Eastern European countries and another course is scheduled
for
November 1996. A more general one-week course covering physical
protection and various
aspects of illicit trafficking to be held in Kiev, Ukraine in
January 1997 is being designed
specifically for Ukraine regulators, facility operators, customs
officials, and law enforcement
personnel.
<P>
<B>VI. INFORMATION EXCHANGE</B>
<P>
<LI>In the area of information exchange, the first Interagency
Meeting on Illicit Cross-Border Movement of Nuclear Materials and
Other Radioactive Sources was held in Vienna in September 1995.
Ten international organizations attended. Conclusions from this
meeting were reported in GC(39)/19/Add. l . The success of this
meeting led to a second meeting to be held in late August 1996
with representatives from 18 international organizations expected
to attend. These meetings facilitate and expand the co-ordination
and co-operation among international organizations in the
prevention, detection, and response to incidents involving
illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and other radioactive
sources.
<P>
<LI>Further, in the area of information exchange, consultants met
in Vienna in January 1996 for initial planning of the
International Conference on Physical Protection of Nuclear
Materials: Experience in Regulation, Implementation, and
Operations to be held in Vienna on 10-14 November, 1997.

<P>
THE IAEA'S ROLE IN COMBATING ILLICIT TRAFFICKING OF NUCLEAR
MATERIAL AND OTHER RADIOACTIVE SOURCES</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Introduction and Background</B>
<P>         
Illicit trafficking involves unauthorized movement of nuclear
material and other radioactive
sources. The term, "nuclear material" comprises radioactive
material which could contribute
primarily to the production of nuclear weapons and which may have
adverse health effects,
while the term "other radioactive sources" refers to radioactive
material that can cause adverse
health effects but has little or no value for nuclear weapon
proliferation. Reported trafficking
cases have involved both nuclear material and radioactive
sources, and the concerns raised
have related to both the threat of proliferation and the threat
to public health. The reported
cases have created public anxiety and threaten to undermine the
credibility of established
control systems both for nuclear material and for radioactive
sources.
<P>
Legitimate trade in nuclear material and radioactive sources is
conducted under the authority
and within the limitations of State regulation. States have the
direct responsibility to assure
proper security for, and the handling, control and accounting of,
nuclear material and
radioactive sources. This requires a solid regulatory
infrastructure.
<P>         
The Director General brought the problem of illicit trafficking
to the attention of the
September 1994 Session of the IAEA General Conference, which
adopted a resolution calling
upon States to "take all necessary measures to prevent illicit
trafficking in nuclear material".
The Conference confirmed that national governments and
authorities will continue to carry
the main responsibility in this field; however, the importance of
close co-operation between
Member States was stressed, and the IAEA was invited to intensify
its support to Member
States in this area.
<P>         
In March 1995, the Director General submitted proposals for the
intensification of the IAEA
activities which had been discussed at the December 1994 meeting
of the Board of Governors,
and the Board asked for the continuing development of a programme
in the area of illicit
trafficking. Thus, through its Board of Governors and the General
Conference, the IAEA has
a mandate to assist Member States in a number of activities
relevant to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- <I>prevention</I>, which involves assisting States to
enhance relevant <I>national infrastructures</I> in the areas of
legislation, physical protection, accounting for and control of
nuclear material, control and security of radioactive sources,
and export/import control; 
<P>
<DD>- <I>response</I>, which involves assisting States, at their
request, to detect and respond to cross-border movements and to
analyse confiscated nuclear materials and radioactive
sources and utilizing the Agency's <I>data base on illicit
trafficking</I> to provide reliable and authoritative information
in a timely manner to States and the media about illicit
trafficking incidents;
<P>         
<DD>- <I>training</I>, which involves developing and providing
training in both prevention and
response; and,
<P>         
<DD>- <I>exchange of information</I>, which is accomplished
through international and interagency
meetings and conferences.
</DL>
<P>
In April, 1996, at the Nuclear Safety and Security Summit held in
Moscow, participants reaffirmed the need for the safe management
of fissile material as a safeguard against the risk of illicit
trafficking in nuclear material. They also recognized the need
for nations to co-operate bilaterally, multilaterally and through
the IAEA to ensure that national systems for controlling nuclear
material remain effective. Of particular interest to the Agency,
the summit participants noted that international efforts to
suppress illicit trafficking should address: safe and secure
storage of nuclear material and effective protection, control and
accounting to
prevent its diversion; co-operative intelligence, customs and law
enforcement efforts to
prevent the transportation and sale of diverted material; and
joint efforts to identify and
suppress illicit supply of, and demand for, nuclear material and
to deter potential traffickers.
<P>         
Although the Agency has neither the mandate nor the resources to
bring about the
modernization of national regulatory infrastructures, it can and
does play a useful role by co-ordinating the efforts of certain
Member States in this field, identifying various problems and
concerns, providing expert services, developing international
consensus guidance, fostering
the exchange of information, and both encouraging and conducting
necessary training. These
activities are fashioned to complement the extensive bi-lateral
support that is being provided
by a number of States which are providing resources to combat
illicit trafficking in various
material.
<P>         
The Deputy Director General for Safeguards is the coordinator of
the Agency's overall programme on measures regarding illicit
trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive
sources. Projects under this programme are the responsibility of
relevant Departments/Divisions throughout the Agency.
<P>
<B>Prevention</B>
<P>      
The most important precondition for preventing illicit
trafficking is the existence of effective <I>national systems for
control of nuclear material and radioactive sources</I>. The IAEA
programme is, therefore, focussed on assisting States to
establish and/or strengthen national control systems and to
implement measures that would prevent or deter unauthorized use
or handling of such material and sources. 
<P>
The national control systems must be based on <I>legislation and
regulations</I> that incorporate modern standards and meet the
State's obligations and commitments arising from international
treaties and conventions to which the State is a party.
<P>         
Also, the national control systems must include measures on the
State level for preventing,
detecting and deterring unauthorized activities. Nuclear
materials require systems and
procedures for <I>physical protection, accountability, and
export/import control</I>, whereas relevant
measures for control and security of radioactive sources must
include, in addition to
<I>export/import control</I>, an infrastructure for (i)
<I>notification, registration, licensing and
inspection</I> of radioactive sources, and (ii) <I>prevention of
theft or any other third-part
interference</I> that may jeopardize the control of the sources.
<P>         
An example of Agency assistance relevant to illicit trafficking
control and non-proliferation
has been the formulation and implementation of "Co-ordinated
Technical Support Plans"
(CTSPs) for the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former
Soviet Union. Since 1992,
IAEA staff have conducted fact-finding missions and technical
visits to the NIS, through
which information about the individual State's needs has been
compiled and distributed to
potential donors. Recipient States, together with Donor States
and the IAEA, have then
developed agreed CTSPs to provide co-ordinated technical support
with the objective of
helping the NIS to meet their obligations under the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) to control and account for nuclear material. The
programme has established
CTSPs for all the NIS. CTSP Donor States include Australia,
Finland, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Sweden, the UK and the USA.
<P>         
<B><I>Legislation and Regulations</I></B>
<P>         
The foundation of a strong national control system is appropriate
legislation and regulations.
For the IAEA Member States, the basic international obligations
for nuclear material are
contained in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) and the
Safeguards Agreements with the IAEA (INFCIRC/153 and 66). In
States where a safeguards
agreement is in force with the Agency, the Agency is obliged to
verify the presence of the
nuclear material subject to safeguards under the agreement, and
the State is obliged, among
other things, to report to the Agency if the State believes there
is or may have been a loss of
nuclear material.
<P>         
Previous legislative systems in the NIS were identical to, or
based upon, the Soviet system.
This circumstance and the gradual accession of the NIS to
international treaties and
conventions, as non-nuclear weapon States, motivated the NIS to
adopt programmes for
improving their legislation based on principles designed to
establish the duties and
responsibilities of regulatory bodies, facility operators and
individuals in the implementation
of both non-proliferation and safety measures which would meet
with international standards
and procedures.
<P>         
Legislation support activities, which were requested by and
agreed with the NIS, have been
identified and co-ordination of such activities between donor
countries is being promoted.
Four Donor countries have established an International Group of
Legal Experts, in which the
IAEA is represented.
<P>
Support activities in the area of legislation and regulations are
undertaken to assist in the
development of a legal and regulatory framework that meets
international standards, taking
into account commitments by individual States to international
conventions and agreements,
such as the NPT, the safeguards agreements with the IAEA, the
Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material, the Vienna Convention on Nuclear
Liability, and the
Convention on Nuclear Safety. With respect to the basic laws, the
areas covered by the
support work include nuclear material accountancy and control,
physical protection,
export/import control, liability, transport of radioactive
material, safety, and radiation
protection.
<P>         
In the NIS, the fundamental objective is the establishment of a
complete nuclear legislative
system, that covers both nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear
safety. The laws, ordinances
and regulations must comprise provisions for (a) the
<I>licensing</I> of all nuclear activities,
including sanctions/penalties; (b) the <I>responsibilities</I> of
both management and individuals
within the facility organizations, including requirements on
facility operator systems and
procedures for preventing failures and proliferation; (c) the
functions and responsibilities of
an independent and competent <I>State regulatory body</I>,
including organizational and
administrative systems for ensuring safety and non-proliferation.
<P>         
Significant progress is being made in this support effort. To
date, work is underway in
Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Kazakstan, and Ukraine, and initial
contacts have been established
with Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan.
<P>
<B><I>Physical Protection</I></B>
<P>         
Physical protection against the theft or unauthorized diversion
of nuclear material and against
sabotage of nuclear facilities by individuals or groups is a
matter of national and international
concern. Although responsibility for establishing and operating a
comprehensive physical
protection system for nuclear material and facilities within a
State rests entirely with the
Government of that State, the IAEA has long contributed in this
area.
<P>         
The IAEA was involved in the development and subsequent review of
two instruments on
physical protection which have relevance to the problem of
illicit trafficking: the Convention
on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material
(INFCIRC/274/Rev.1), hereinafter referred to
as the Convention, and the IAEA "Recommendations on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear
Material" (INFCIRC/225/Rev.3), which were prepared by a panel of
experts convened by the
Director General-and first published in 1972.
<P>         
The Convention, which entered into force in 1987 and currently
has 54 States Parties, defines
levels of physical protection to be applied to nuclear material
used for peaceful purposes while
in international transport. States Parties are also obligated to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- make the commission of certain acts (e.g., theft of nuclear
material, threat to use nuclear material to cause harm)
punishable offenses under national law, 
<P>
<DD>- extradite or prosecute persons alleged to have committed
any such act, and  
<P>
<DD>- provide assistance to other Parties to the Convention in
the event of an incident.
</DL>
<P>         
However, there is no obligation on the Parties to the Convention
to ensure the protection of
nuclear material used for peaceful purposes while in
<I>domestic</I> use, storage and transport.
Also, the Convention does not apply to (i) nuclear material used
for military purposes, (ii)
nuclear facilities or (iii) other radioactive sources.
<P>         
INFCIRC/225/Rev.3 provides guidance and recommendations for the
physical protection of
nuclear material in use, storage and transport, whether domestic
or international and whether
peaceful or military, and contains provisions relating to the
sabotage of facilities. The
guidance contained in INFCIRC/225/Rev.3 details the elements
needed in a State's system of
physical protection. It also recognizes the adverse health and
safety consequences arising
from the theft of nuclear material and the sabotage of facilities
(and potential release of
radioactivity). Most industrial and developing countries have
used these recommendations in
the establishment and operation of their physical protection
systems.
<P>         
In order to assure that adequate physical protection is provided,
State systems must establish
conditions which (i) minimize the possibilities of unauthorized
removal of nuclear material
or of sabotage, (ii) provide rapid and comprehensive measures to
locate and recover missing
nuclear material, and (iii) minimize the effects of sabotage.
Physical protection regulations
and associated procedures must thus be designed to thwart any
attempted theft and to
promptly detect an actual theft.
<P>         
For some time, the Agency has given <I>technical support</I> to
Member States by providing
experts to conduct missions to advise States in the area of
physical protection. Now, the
Agency is prepared to expand this technical support to States
with particular physical
protection concerns and to procure some specialized equipment, in
cases of urgent need, where
the facilities are not covered by an ongoing Donor programme.
<P>
Technical support may comprise both <I>advisory services</I> and
<I>technical guidance</I>. In April
         1996, the Agency announced a new <I>advisory service</I>
to be known as the International Physical
Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS). It will provide to Member
States, upon request, an
international team of experts to review national regulatory
programmes for the physical
protection of nuclear material and/or for the implementation of
physical protection systems
at specific nuclear facilities.
<P>         
<I>Technical Guidance</I> includes development of a basic
reference manual on physical protection
principles and practices is proceeding. The Agency will also
develop additional guidance for
implementing portions of INFCIRC/225/Rev.3 which may be difficult
to interpret.
<P>         
Donor assistance to Member States in the area of physical
protection is of particularly high
priority when high-enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium are
involved. Donor assistance
is provided for establishing a State's policy on physical
protection and for addressing these
needs at particular facilities. A report, which serves as a basic
blueprint for needed physical
protection improvements at nuclear installations, is usually
prepared by experts from two or
three Donor countries. Installation of physical protection
equipment at facilities is provided by Donors and to some extent
supported by the recipient State. Installation of systems and
equipment is at various stages of completion in Belarus, Georgia,
Kazakstan, Latvia,
Lithuania. Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
<P>        
<B><I>Accounting for and Control of Nuclear Material</I></B>
<P>
A primary deterrent to the theft of nuclear material is a strong
State System of Accounting and Control (SSAC) that recognizes the
complementary nature of material accounting and
control and physical protection regulations and associated
procedures. Material accounting
and control is designed to assure that the location of all
nuclear material in a State is known
and confirmed through periodic inventory taking.
<P>         
States that are signatories to the NPT are under an obligation to
conclude safeguards
agreements with the IAEA. A fundamental requirement in such an
agreement is the
establishment of an SSAC. When needed and requested, the Agency
will assist States in
establishing procedures and routines for the SSAC, both at the
State and facility levels. This
is normally done in connection with the initial implementation of
safeguards inspections at
State offices and nuclear facilities.
<P>         
Extensive assistance in setting up and implementing SSACs in the
NIS has been given by
Donor States under the Co-operative Technical Support Programs
(CTSPs). That assistance
covers additional components of State and facility activities,
such as national and bi-lateral
requirements. The needs of the individual State for assistance
with infrastructure development
and equipment have been identified.
<P>         
The Donors' assistance has resulted in the provision of expertise
and know-how, as well as
hardware, software, specialized equipment, office and
communication equipment, relevant
procedures and instrumentation used by State inspectors.
<P>         
Work has been completed or is underway in Belarus, Georgia,
Kazakstan, Latvia, Lithuania,
Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Work is still to be initiated in the
remaining NIS. These efforts
have provided an adequate basis for the initial phase of IAEA
safeguards implementation in
the NIS.
<P>         
<B><I>Control and security of radioactive sources</I></B>
<P>         
With regard to legislation relating to radioactive sources other
than nuclear material, there are
no internationally binding legal instruments through which
Parties commit themselves to
ensure the control and security of radioactive sources and, in
particular, to report the loss or
theft of such sources to the IAEA and\or other international
organizations. However, the most
recent revision of the Basic Safety Standards (BSS)<A
HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1/</SUP></A> on international radiation
safety standards has recently been approved by the IAEA Board of
Governors and by five other sponsoring organizations.<A
HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2/</SUP></A> Many States tailor their
national regulatory systems to the general
guidance provided by the BSS.
<P>         
Adoption of the BSS by Member States and international
organizations establishes a general obligation that activities
utilizing radioactive material (including nuclear material) are
carried out in accordance with the BSS, unless the radiation
exposure caused by the source is excluded from the BSS or the
source is exempted by the regulatory authority. The BSS,
moreover, provide that the transport of radioactive sources
should be performed in accordance with the requirements of the
IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material<A
HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3/</SUP></A>. These requirements may be made
mandatory through applicable international conventions or
national legislation.
<P>         
Requirements of the BSS that are relevant to illicit trafficking
are those of notification and
authorization by registration or licensing, as well as those
related to the security of radioactive
sources. The latter require that sources shall be kept secure by
registrants and licensees so
as to prevent theft or damage and to prevent any unauthorized use
of such sources.
Independent verification by an established national Regulatory
Authority is an essential
condition of compliance with the BSS requirements. Thus, although
the BSS are intended to
place requirements on registrants and licensees, who have the
primary responsibility for
applying them, Governments have the responsibility for their
enforcement, generally through
a national infrastructure that includes the necessary Regulatory
Authority.
<P>         
Additionally, as part of the general assistance to States to
develop and maintain strong and
effective systems for the registration, licensing and control of
radioactive sources, a number
of Member States are being assisted in assembling a complete
inventory of the sources on
their territory and to ensure that they are under responsible
control.
<P>         
<B><I>Export/Import Control</I></B>
<P>         
Control of States' exports and imports seeks to prevent
unauthorized movement of nuclear
material and radioactive sources across borders and is
established within each country by
means of legislation and State systems for control of handling
and use of such materials. The
measures that have been described above in the chapters about
legislation, physical protection,
accounting and control of nuclear material and radioactive
sources are all links in the chain of an efficient export/import
control. In addition to the systems and procedures specifically
implemented in the area of nuclear activities (e.g. SSACs),
conventional components in a State's infrastructure must be
engaged in nuclear export/import control, e.g. police and
customs. The extent to which such components are utilized and the
way in which they are organized and co-ordinated, depends on the
specific conditions in each country.
<P>
Within the CTSPs for the NIS, Donor States are committed to
assist in establishing "State concepts" for export/import
control.
<P>
<B>Response</B>
<P>      
National authorities or the media are the first to detect and
investigate trafficking incidents.
Under its safeguards system, the Agency receives information from
States about the quantity
and location of nuclear material under that State's jurisdiction
or within its territory.
Disappearance of nuclear material in particular, e.g. through a
theft, in a State with
comprehensive safeguards must be reported to the Agency.
<P>         
Considerable progress has been made by the Agency in developing
guidance for national
authorities, and specifically for border officers, on the
procedures to be used in the detection
of illicit movements of radioactive materials and the appropriate
response to such detection.
<P>         
<B><I>Analysis of Confiscated Material</I></B>
<P>         
In case of illicit trafficking in nuclear material or radioactive
sources, or in case of suspicion
of such a trafficking incident, the Agency may provide a State,
upon its request, the service
of performing analyses on confiscated material. Such analyses may
then be used by the State
(i) to identify or confirm the nuclear nature and properties of
confiscated materials; (ii) to
evaluate the radiological hazards that may have resulted from
their illicit handling; and (iii)
possibly to provide clues about the origin of the confiscated
material.
<P>         
The IAEA laboratories have capabilities and a long practice in
the analysis of materials
encountered throughout the nuclear fuel cycle. It is also
possible to determine the chemical
nature of the major components, the nature and content of minor
constituents, and the nature
and content of chemical and radiological trace components. These
latter measurements can
provide generic information about the mode and time of production
of the confiscated
materials. Such information may be useful for States'
investigations regarding the origin of
the material.
<P>         
IAEA analysis assistance to States can also be provided by
performing qualitative and
quantitative assays directly in the "field", using portable or
transportable instruments such
as gamma ray spectrometers, neutron counters or X-ray
fluorescence analyzers.
<P>         
<B><I>Data Base on Illicit Trafficking</I></B>
<P>         
With the increase in the number of reported trafficking
incidents, the Agency has been requested by its Member States to
expand its existing data base in order to provide a reliable
global overview of the illicit trafficking situation.
<P>         
In August 1995, the Agency informed Member States that it had
upgraded its "Summary of
Incidents" data base to create the "Illicit Trafficking Data
Base", that it was prepared to accept
information on illicit trafficking and that it would begin
issuing periodic summary reports.
At that time, the Agency invited each Government to indicate its
interest in participating in this programme and to identify its
point of contact for the data base. The Agency's current
Illicit Trafficking Data Base accumulates incidents reported by
media sources and State
authorities
<P>         
Its primary function is to provide reliable, accurate, and timely
information on all trafficking
incidents <I>at three levels of use</I>: the States',the Agency's
and the public's. It facilitates an
individual State's determination of which facts about specific
illicit trafficking incidents are
pertinent to its own interests. Also, it allows the Agency to
maintain details of trafficking
incidents with a view to determining common themes and trends to
be used to support
Member States' programmes to combat illicit trafficking. Finally,
it contributes to the public
welfare by providing reliable and timely information about
illicit trafficking incidents to the
media.
<P>         
Since 1993, 168 events involving the illicit trafficking of
nuclear materials and other
radioactive sources reported by States or published in the media
have been included in the
IAEA data base. The data available are not yet sufficient to
determine any trend in the
frequency of these occurrences. Any apparent reduction may be due
in part to potential
traffickers finding that there is little genuine market for the
materials involved in past
incidents. However, as long as there remains a potential for
theft due to poor security
conditions, there is a strong possibility that clandestine groups
may seek these materials for
illicit purposes. Lingering security weaknesses make the illicit
trafficking in nuclear
substances a possibility that the international community must
continue to deal with.
<P>         
A breakdown of the 168 incidents recorded in the database at the
end of July 1996 is shown  by percentage and category in the
following Table:

In 1996, the Agency will begin to provide quarterly information
summaries of trafficking
incidents to States. Initially the summary will include all
incidents contained in the Agency
data base that meet the general trafficking description above.
Subsequent quarterly summaries
will contain information about new significant incidents and
modifications to previously
reported incidents.
<P>
<B>Training</B>
<P>
IAEA activities that contribute to improving national systems of
control and security of
sources include the provision of <I>training</I> courses, either
provided by the Agency generally or
provided to the Member States to allow them to train themselves.
<P>
The development of a strong SSAC requires training of SSAC staff
and facility personnel.
The IAEA co-ordinates international and regional SSAC training
programmes sponsored by
a number of Member States, i.e., Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Japan, Russia and the USA.
Two or three programmes have been offered per year to State
authority and facility personnel,
in order to assist with the establishment of new SSACs and/or to
enhance the effectiveness
of existing State systems. More than 900 Member State personnel
have attended these
programmes over the last 20 years.
<P>
The IAEA, through the Technical Co-operation Programme, has
administered an interregional
training course on physical protection for the past 20 years;
over 300 individuals from various
Member States have been trained in this course. The objective of
the course is to familiarize
professionals involved in the establishment of integrated State
systems of physical protection
of nuclear facilities with current concepts and technology,
thereby assisting Member States
in developing and implementing their State system with reference
to system engineering, state-
of-the-art technology and facility analysis.
<P>      
With the intensification of activities in physical protection,
the IAEA will be providing
additional training opportunities for countries which seek to
upgrade the security of nuclear
material. The IAEA held a Regional Training Course on Physical
Protection of Nuclear
Facilities and Materials in the Czech Republic in November 1995
for 30 individuals from the
Russian Federation, the Newly Independent States of the former
Soviet Union (NIS) and
Member States in Eastern Europe. This was the first time that the
course was given in
Europe, and the first with simultaneous interpretation and
instructional material in English and
Russian. This course, as well as additional courses, will be
offered again in 1996 and future
years.
<P>
Under the CTSPs to the NIS, extensive training of NIS personnel,
provided through Donor
assistance, is incorporated in all areas of the NIS support
activities, including concepts,
procedures and the use of equipment.
<P>
The Agency convened three Consultants Services Meetings (CSMs) in
1995 to address various
elements of the Agency's programme concerned with the illicit
movement of radioactive
sources. One group drafted guidance on strengthening the Basic
Safety Standards and
improving State programmes for the security of radioactive
sources. Several such
programmes that have already been implemented by Member States
were included in the
report to serve as examples. The results of that report were
considered at an Advisory Group
Meeting held in January 1996. The second CSM held in 1995 drafted
guidance on monitoring
the illicit movement of radioactive sources, particularly across
borders or at airports. The
third developed guidance on training of personnel likely to
become involved in the control
of illicit trafficking, who are not familiar with the
characteristics of the materials of national
concern, e.g., border officials and airport security personnel.
The reports of these latter two
meetings were studied at the Technical Committee Meeting convened
in July 1996. The output of some of these efforts will be
particularly useful to the World Customs Organization
in training customs officials on the detection of, and response
to, the illicit movement of
radioactive materials.
<P>
<B>Exchange of Information</B>
<P>      
Preparations are now underway to conduct the Agency's first
International Conference on
Physical Protection in Vienna from 10 - 14 November 1997.
Additionally, in keeping with
its important role of acting as a focal point for technical
information in a number of nuclear
fields, the Agency is actively co-ordinating its physical
protection activities with a number of
Donor States and international organizations.
<P>      
In June 1995, the IAEA held a technical committee meeting in
Vienna concerned with the
safe transport of radioactive materials. This meeting included
representatives from 20
Member States plus EUROPOL and the World Customs Organization.
The representatives
considered actions that should be taken to combat the illicit
movement of materials. Several
recommendations were made to the Agency related to information
sharing, coordination of
activities, detection of materials at borders, utilization of the
Agency illicit trafficking data
base and notifications of incidents.
<P>
To further address these and other concerns of national
authorities and customs officers, the
Secretariat in September, 1995 held an Interagency Co-ordination
Meeting with international
organizations concerned with the cross-border movement of
radioactive materials, including
nuclear material, i.e., the United Nations, the European Union
(EU), EURATOM,
INTERPOL, the World Customs Organization, EUROPOL, the
International Maritime
Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
This initial meeting was
primarily used to exchange information about the activities of
each of the organizations in this
area and to assess the current and future support to States for
combating the illicit movement
of these materials. Based on the usefulness of that meeting, a
second and expanded meeting
was held in August 1996.
<P>
<B><I>The IAEA also maintains close ties with the EU and EURATOM.
The European
Commission and its Member States have worked closely with the
IAEA and other specialist
organizations regarding the common interests of the EU, the
countries of Central and
Eastern Europe, and the,former Soviet republics.</I></B>
<P>      
In connection with the CSTPs, in June 1995, the IAEA convened a
Donors' meeting in
Vienna to review the experience gained with the programmes and
identify areas where
additional assistance is needed by recipient NIS States.
Participants at the meeting encouraged
the IAEA to continue its activities in monitoring support tasks
through established IAEA
databases.
<P>
<B>Considerations for the Future</B>
<P>      
During 1995, the Board of Governors and the Secretariat of the
IAEA have continued to
define the Agency's role in assisting States to combat the
illicit trafficking of nuclear material
and radioactive sources. Activities identified by the Member
States encompass several
Agency departments and are consistent with the Agency's
traditional tasks, i.e. training,
technical support and guidance, information exchange, and
co-ordination and identification
of needs.
<P>
In 1996, through the voluntary contributions of a number of
Member States, activities already
begun include: increasing the number of training courses on
physical protection and initiating
the International Physical Protection Advisory Service (APACE);
establishing or up-dating of
         the inventory of radiation sources, which is being
promoted and assisted in 53 States through
Technical Co-operation Projects; assisting, when needed, the
management of spent radiation
sources; assisting some States and some border custom stations by
providing them with the
means to detect radioactive material movements; and actively
promoting, in many States, the
designation of a national focal point to co-ordinate matters
dealing with prevention and
response in illicit trafficking incidents.
<P>      
In the area of prevention generally, it is anticipated that the
Agency, as well as other
international organizations and States, will intensify assistance
to States or national entities.
In the field of legislation and regulation, an international
regime is generally in place which
provides a basis for supporting States in their efforts to combat
illicit trafficking; however,
at the national level further implementation is needed.
Specifically: the IAEA will promote
the call of the Moscow Safety and Security Summit for universal
adherence to the Convention
on Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials as well as the
application of recommendations on
physical protection specified in INFCIRC/225/Rev. 3. In addition,
the Agency will be assisting
States in their programmes to assure that all radioactive sources
are regulated in a manner consistent with the BSS.
<P>
With respect to support to the NIS, Donor State assistance,
focussed through the International
Group of Legal Experts, is being further promoted, and
co-operation programmes are planned
to be in place in all the NIS before the end of 1996. The urgent
need for improved nuclear
legislation structures, covering all areas of the nuclear
activity field, is emphasized by the NIS
themselves, and assistance from Donor countries on a co-operative
basis is being given as
requested. The specific nature of the legislative work, with the
objective of establishing a
foundation for implementing State control of nuclear activities,
is an incentive for co-ordination of support resources, both
between Donor States and with the Agency. There is
also an interest in harmonizing nuclear laws and regulations,
taking into account the advanced
requirements of safety and quality assurance.
<P>
In the area of response, at least for nuclear material of a
sensitive nature (e.g. highly enriched
uranium and separated plutonium), the State authorities should
immediately inform other
States, international law enforcement organizations and customs
authorities, about theft or
<P>
In the area of response, at least for nuclear material of a
sensitive nature (e.g. highly enriched
uranium and separated plutonium), the State authorities should
immediately inform other
States, international law enforcement organizations and customs
authorities, about theft or
disappearance of such materials. With respect to the Illicit
Trafficking Data Base, the
implementation of measures to improve the reliability and
timeliness of information has
already begun. Member States are being contacted to amend and/or
to correct the information
which has been collected from open sources. Also, the
communication mechanism between
the Agency and Member States is being looked at to improve the
timeliness of the
information
<P>      
The Agency will continue to foster close international
co-operation in the development and
implementation of measures to prevent, detect and respond to
illicit trafficking events. The
training and development activities described above should be
completed as soon as possible,
and related "Safety Practices" will be developed for use in the
training courses and as
reference material for all Member States wishing to strengthen
their illicit trafficking
programmes.
<P>
The success of the Agency's programme addressing illicit
trafficking depends on co-operation
and co-ordination between and among States and international
organizations to avoid
duplication and overlap of efforts.

<P>
Recommendations and Unresolved Issues from the Technical
Committee Meeting on
Detecting and Responding to Cross-border Movement of Radiation
Material (TCM):
<P>
<DL>
<DD>a) It is recommended that the IAEA and the World Customs
Organization (WCO)
consider establishing guidelines to assist customs and border
control administrations
on procedures for responding to the discovery of radioactive
materials that have been
illicitly trafficked. In many cases, national administrations do
not have the legal
authority to detain, seize or dispose of illicitly trafficked
materials that have been
smuggled into their country. The IAEA and the WCO should
formulate guidance or
initiate a convention similar to the Convention on Physical
Protection to assist
national administrations with respect to this issue. Such a
convention would provide
the means to increase the exchange of information between Member
States. It would
also provide a mechanism for the IAEA to assist national
administrations in
identifying the origin of smuggled radioactive materials.
<P>
<DD>b) It is recommended that the IAEA and WCO also consider
providing national
administrations with radiation safety guidance when illegally
trafficked materials are
discovered. Guidance to national administrations of basic safety
standards for the
handling of radioactive materials discovered during an
interdiction or investigation is
also essential. Detailed information for officer safety, facility
decontamination and
evidence preservation should be included in this guidance.
<P>
<DD>c) The TCM recommends that Member States should not rely
solely on the radiation
detection equipment as the means for detecting radioactive
materials. Border control
officers might need the use of inspection techniques in addition
to the radiation
monitoring equipment in order to assure that radioactive
materials be detected.
<P>
<DD>d) The conference discussed at great length the consideration
for establishing standards
for detection equipment and the establishment of equipment
testing protocols. The
TCM recommends that the IAEA consider such practices in the
future.
<P>
<DD>e) The TCM invites the IAEA and the WCO to make efforts to
ensure the participation
of other international organizations, particularly the
ICPO/Interpol and the EC in the
designing, delivering of training programmes and production of
training materials in
order to share the experiences, the limited resources and to
avoid duplication of
efforts in this field.
<P>
<DD>f) Concerning the training programmes for customs officers,
the TCM feels that the
WCO Secretariat could play a key role as an executive agency and
employ the WCO
training module on nuclear/radioactive materials.
<P>
<DD>g) The TCM joins previous Advisory Group Meetings in stating
that internationally
accepted radiological levels for radioactive residues, e.g. for
contaminated scrap-
metal from nuclear decommissioning and/or dismantling activities,
should be
established as soon as possible.

<B>THE SITUATION PREVAILING WITH REGARD TO SAFEGUARDS
IMPLEMENTATION IN THE DPRK AT THE TIME OF THE THIRTY-NINTH
REGULAR SESSION OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE</B>
<P>
<LI>The Director General's report to the General Conference in
1995 in document GC(39)/18 of 17 August 1995 gave the background
to the developments which had taken place during the previous
year in safeguards implementation in the DPRK pursuant to the
DPRK's Safeguards Agreement with the Agency (INFCIRC/403) and
described those developments. They included the Board of
Governors' authorization to the Director General, on 11 November
1994, to carry out the tasks which the United Nations Security
Council had asked the Agency to undertake in the light of the
"Agreed Framework" (see Annex l); the discussions which
subsequently took place between an Agency technical team and DPRK
representatives; the visit to the DPRKby an IAEA technical team
in November 1994, and the later visit by the team in January
1995.
<P>
<LI>The report last year referred to the further technical
discussions between the Agency and DPRK scheduled for April 1995,
but which had not taken place. This was because DPRK had informed
the Agency that it continued to regard the IAEA activities in
their country as being directly related to the implementation of
the "Agreed Framework", and took the view that, when negotiations
between the United States and the DPRK were at stalemate     
over aspects of the "Agreed Framework" there was little point in
further technical discussions with the Agency. Notwithstanding,
the Director General was subsequently able to inform last year's
General Conference that further technical discussions between the
IAEA team and the DPRK had taken place in September 1995,
following US/DPRK bilateral discussions. Limited progress had
been made on some issues.         
<P>
<LI>In the light of this and of the Director General's report in
document GC(39)18, the General Conference adopted resolution
GC(39)/RES/3. By that resolution, the General Conference,
<I>inter alia</I>, endorsed the actions and commended the efforts
taken by the Secretariat to implement the Safeguards Agreement
and to monitor the freeze in the DPRK; expressed concern over the
continuing non-compliance of the DPRK with its Safeguards   
Agreement; and urged it to co-operate fully with the Agency in
the implementation of that Agreement.
<P>
<B>DEVELOPMENTS OVER SAFEGUARDS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE DPRK SINCE
THE THIRTY-NINTH REGULAR SESSION OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE</B>
<P>
<LI>At the post-General Conference meeting of the Agency Board of
Governors on 25 September 1995, the Director General reported on
the talks held in the DPRK from 12-18 September 1995. He
explained that although the DPRK had agreed to measurements of   
irradiated fuel rods in storage at the 5 MWe experimental reactor
which would verify whether the rods were all irradiated fuel, it
had not agreed to measures which would give information about the
total amount of plutonium in the spent fuel. As a result, the
information required about that plutonium would have to be
obtained through measurements, with some limitations in accuracy,
to be made at a much later date and could require opening
the storage containers at significant additional cost. The Board
of Governors was reminded that the Agency had envisaged taking
the required measurements during the transfer of the spent fuel
into containers for storage.
<P>
<LI>The Director General said that no agreement had been reached
about installing additional Agency monitoring equipment at
nuclear waste tanks in the DPRK's reprocessing plant, to enable
the Agency to verify, on a continuous basis, the absence of any
movement or operation involving those wastes. On the other hand,
some implementation measures which had been agreed in January
1995 with the DPRK but not yet applied because of objections by
the operator (e.g. photographing of the new process line of the
reprocessing plant by inspectors) would now be implemented as
soon as possible. The Director General also told the Board that a
detailed technical paper on the subject of the preservation of
information, which had been given to DPRK representatives at the
beginning of the talks, had not been discussed; the DPRK intended
to study the paper and discuss it with the Agency at a future
meeting. The paper describes the information that the DPRK needs
to preserve (and which the Agency requires) in connection with
verifying the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial
report.
<P>
<LI>At the meeting of the Board of Governors on 12 December 1995,
the Director General said that in September 1995 the Agency had
asked the DPRK to undertake minor but essential modifications to
the design of the storage racks for the cans to contain spent
fuel discharged from its Experimental Reactor. This was to allow
the cans to be sealed effectively in the racks under water. The
modifications requested would not cause delay in the canning
operations, the timetable for which appeared to have slipped
because of technical difficulties. The Director General also said
that, despite the agreement reached with the DPRK about
photographing the new process line and other areas of the
Radiochemical Laboratory, DPRK operators had raised fresh
objections and the photographing had still not been possible. The
Agency's technical paper about the preservation of information
was also on the agenda for the next technical meeting planned for
January 1996.
<P>
<LI>In his report to the Board of Governors for its March 1996
meeting (GOV/2687/Add.11), the Director General reported that a
fourth round of technical discussions had taken place in
Pyongyang from 23-29 January 1996. Although discussion had
resulted in limited progress in some areas, the DPRK had
continued to decline a number of important measures. Thus, the
DPRK had said that the Agency could now "resume ad-hoc and
routine inspections" (required by the Safeguards Agreement) but
had made clear that  such inspections would be permitted only at
facilities not subject to the freeze.
<P>
<LI>During the January talks, there was reconfirmation of
agreement on Agency inspectors continuing baseline photographing
at all facilities subject to the freeze. Reconfirmed too was
that the DPRK would provide (as the freeze requires) advance
notice to Agency inspectors about any maintenance work involving
facilities and equipment. Also reconfirmed was that short notice
inspections and visits by Agency inspectors already in the DPRK
would continue to take place at different parts of facilities
subject to the freeze. This was as an interim measure, until
agreement were reached about installing containment and
surveillance and other monitoring devices (e.g. at certain parts
of the Radiochemical Laboratory).  Additionally, to help obviate
delays in issuing visas for Agency inspectors, it was agreed that
the Agency would give inspector notifications two weeks in
advance so as to facilitate the timely issue of visas in Vienna.
<P>
<LI>The report in GOV/2687/Add.11 recorded that the technical
talks of January 1996 had also involved a detailed discussion
about inspection activities to be carried out at specific
locations. The report also covered other issues addressed,
especially the preservation of information required to verify the
correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration
under its Safeguards Agreement.
<P>
<LI>In that regard, the report said that no agreement could be
reached in January 1996 about the proposals in the Agency's
technical paper. Agency representatives had reiterated         
that in the absence of early agreement on the measures required,
any possibility for the Agency to verify the correctness and
completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration in the future
might be lost. The report also said that a fifth round of
technical discussions between the Agency and the DPRK had been
planned for the second half of May 1996.
<P>
<LI>In his introductory statement to the June 1996 meeting of the
Board of Governors, the Director General said that "because of
unforeseen reason", the DPRK had had to postpone the fifth round
of technical discussions from May until mid-June. The Agency had
proposed that the discussions focus on the need for early
implementation of measures for the  preservation of the
information required in connection with the verification of the
correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration.
The consultations would also cover issues related to safeguards
implementation in the DPRK, including the installation of
monitoring equipment at nuclear waste tanks in the reprocessing
plant and monitoring the freeze. The Director General reminded
the Board that the Agency maintains a continuous inspector
presence in the Nyongbyon area, and also said that canning of the
spent fuel rods  at the 5 MWe reactor had started at the end of
April 1996. Agency inspectors were performing verification of the
rods by measurements which, however, did not provide any
information about the total amount of plutonium contained in the
irradiated fuel.
<P>
<LI>Details of the sealing arrangements for the containers with
spent fuel rods had not yet been agreed. Progress in canning was
slow and the completion of the operation could be expected only
by the beginning of 1997. Until then, three to four Agency
inspectors would  need to be stationed in the Nyongbyon area to
cover all the required activities. This would increase the
financial burden resulting from the Agency's work in the DPRK.
<P>
<LI>The fifth round of technical discussions between IAEA and
DPRK representatives took place from 25 to 28 June 1996.
Discussions resulted in some progress in certain areas
but the DPRK still did not accept some important measures.
<P>
<LI>There was discussion about a paper from the IAEA on the
status of Agency activities performed in the DPRK.  This included
clarification about issues regarding the implementation of the
activities, agreement on procedures for short-notice inspections
and visits and activities related to the canning operations. The
June 1996 technical meeting did not result in agreement about the
long-standing issue of reports by the DPRK on facilities
subject to the freeze, or on installing monitoring equipment to
allow the monitoring of nuclear waste tanks. Neither was there
agreement about measuring or taking samples at locations in the
Radiochemical Laboratory selected by the IAEA. As for monitoring
the graphite blocks and other nuclear related equipment and
components for the 50 MWe and 200 MWe reactors under construction
at the inception of the freeze, the DPRK reiterated that
manufacturing such equipment and components had been discontinued
in 1993. The two sides agreed that this subject would again be
addressed during the next technical meeting, after appropriate
consultations.
<P>
<LI>During discussion about the Agency paper on the preservation
of information the DPRK made the following comments:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Agency should not make excessive requirements even in the
light of the contents of the US/DPRK Agreed Framework;
<P>
<LI>IAEA proposals on the preservation of inforrnation should be
linked to progress in the implementation of the Agreed Framework;
<P>
<LI>verification of the correctness and completeness of the
initial declaration of the DPRK's nuclear material is to be
carried out following consultations between  the IAEA and the
DPRK when a significant portion of the LWR project is   
completed, but prior to the delivery of key, nuclear related
components;
<P>
<LI>the DPRK is now ready to discuss verification measures at
facilities both subject to and not subject to the freeze.
However, issues related to "other" facilities would be discussed
when "the time comes";
<P>
<LI>the monitoring activities which the Agency is currently
undertaking at DPRK facilities both subject to and not subject to
the freeze, are important for the preservation of information.
Additionally, a lot of information has previously been provided
to the Agency.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>During the discussions, the Agency team pointed out that the
requirements in the Agency paper applied to all comprehensive
safeguards agreements. The team also made clear that crucial to
verifying the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial
declaration is information about "other" facilities, that is
nuclear waste sites and a pilot plant at which the first core of
the 5 MWe reactor had been manufactured and which, the DPRK
said, had been dismantled. The Agency could not agree to the
DPRK's intention to split provision of the information into two
parts. The data required needed to be preserved urgently and in
its entirety.
<P>
<LI>The DPRK presented a paper dated 27 June 1996 on
"Preservation of information relevant to verification of the
correctness and completeness of initial declaration". Providing
the paper which, to a limited degree, incorporates measures
contained in the Agency paper on the same subject, is a step in
the right direction. However, the DPRK paper does not
include any proposal for implementing the measures required.
Moreover, it includes only limited information about facilities
subject to and not subject to the freeze, and does not
cover "other" facilities and locations. Further discussions will
take place during the next technical meeting. This was
tentatively scheduled and later confirmed to take place in
Vienna in September 1996.
<P>
<LI>In the light of increased technical activities, the DPRK
agreed to take the measures necessary to improve communications
from the DPRK. The DPRK also agreed to designate nine more Agency
inspectors.

<B><I>Introduction</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Pursuant to paragraph 2 of resolution <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r19.html">GC(39)/RES/19</A> ("Staffing of the Agency's Secretariat") adopted by the General Conference on 22 September 1995, the Director General presents in this report information on the measures taken to implement that resolution and statistical data on the Professional staffing situation in the Secretariat.
<P>
<LI>The present report deals only with the recruitment of staff from developing countries and other Member States that are under-represented in the Professional and higher categories, not with the representation of women, although the two issues are interrelated.  However, the present report contains some material (text and data) relevant to the representation of women in the Secretariat which is not reproduced in document GOV/2877-GC(40)/19 dealing with that issue. 
<P>
<LI>The report first states the objective set by the Conference and describes measures taken to increase the number of staff members drawn from developing countries and other Member States that are under-represented.  It then provides statistical data (with technical explanations) and reviews the progress made in achieving the objective set by the General Conference.
<P>
<B><I>Objective set and measures taken</I></B>
<P>
<B>(a) 	Objective set</B>
<P>
<LI>In resolution GC(39)/RES/19 the General Conference requested the Director General "pursuant to Article VII of the Statute, to intensify his efforts to accordingly increase, particularly at the senior and policy-making levels, the number of staff members from developing countries and other Member States that are under-represented".
<P>
<B>(b) 	Measures taken</B>
<P>
<LI>In an effort to achieve the objective set by the General Conference, a variety of measures were taken during the past year:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i) 	The implementation of resolution GC(39)/RES/19 was regularly reviewed at Director General's Meetings on the basis of reports presented by the Director of Personnel.  On several occasions, the Director General restated the policy that applicants from developing Member States and other Member States that are under-represented should be given preference, in keeping with the provisions of Article VII of the Statute, in cases of comparable qualifications and suitability, and he requested Department Heads to bear this policy in mind when making selections.
<P>
<DD>(ii)	The Director of Personnel closely monitored the selection process and referred appointment proposals back to Departments in cases where, in his opinion, applicants from developing Member States and other Member States that are under-represented had not received the appropriate special attention.  In addition, the Advisory Panel on Professional and G-8 Staff reviewed appointment proposals with this policy in mind.
<P>
<DD>(iii)	The programme budgets for 1995 and 1996 included provision for three Junior Professional Officer positions to serve as training opportunities for  persons from developing Member States who might later apply for regular positions or use the experience gained in their home countries. 
<P>
<DD>(iv)	A roster of well-qualified and qualified applicants from developing countries is being used by the Division of Personnel in dealing with vacant fixed-term  Secretariat positions.
<P>
<DD>(v)	In the Division of Personnel, work is continuing on the development of a roster of recruitment sources, especially in developing countries and other countries that are under-represented, with a view to establishing and maintaining direct contacts with national recruitment centres and with well-qualified candidates who might be interested in applying for a position in the Secretariat.  For this purpose, a Junior Professional Officer was provided by a Member State for a period of one year starting in January 1995.  Following the Junior Professional Officer's departure at the end of 1995, the Secretariat - using temporary assistance funds - recently recruited a Professional staff member to continue the job.
<P>
<DD>(vi)	The Secretariat has continued examining the Agency's recruitment process, particularly with regard to applicants from developing countries and other Member States that are under-represented.  As a result, the personal history form is being revised, vacancy notices are being modified and a recruitment brochure which emphasizes the interest of the Agency in receiving an increased number of applications from well-qualified applicants from developing Member States and other Member States that are under-represented is being finalized for circulation to the recruitment sources in Member States noted in para- graph (v) above.
</DL>
<P>
<B><I>Statistical data and review of progress</I></B>
<P>
<LI>In the statistical part of this document, Annexes I to V contain staffing data by area and country for all Member States;  Annexes VI to XI focus on the representation of developing countries on the Secretariat staff;  and Annexes XII to XIV contain statistics on staff drawn from countries belonging to the Group of 77.  In most cases, the reference date is 1 August 1996.  Information relating to the staffing situation at four other reference dates (1 September 1981, 1 September 1985, 1 September 1989 and 1 August 1993) is also given in order that trends in the composition of the Agency's staff over a four-year period (as specified in resolution GC(XXXVII)/RES/621) may be assessed.
<P>
<LI>In this report, the Secretariat has used the definition of "developing country" used by the Statistical Division of the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat in its "World Economic and Social Survey".
<P>
<LI>The data regarding the representation of countries belonging to the Group of 77 have been adjusted in order to reflect the current membership of the Group.
<P>
<B>(a)	Geographical distribution </B>
<P>
<LI>As in the past, the data provided in this document relate to staff members in posts "subject to geographical distribution" - which, in accordance with the practice followed throughout the United Nations system, means essentially regular posts in the Professional and higher categories held by staff members who have been appointed for a period of at least one year by the Director General following standard recruitment procedures (i.e. the circulation of a vacancy notice, competitive selection and government sponsorship).  Excluded are staff members in posts requiring specific linguistic skills (i.e. translators, revisers and editors), staff members appointed after inter-agency consultations (i.e. the physicians in the VIC Medical Service) and staff members recruited under special procedures (e.g. cost-free experts, extrabudgetary staff, temporary staff, consultants, Technical Co-operation experts and departmental administrative officers).  Thus, the total number of posts subject to geographical distribution on 1 August 1996 was  702.
<P>
<LI>Out of these 702 posts, 57 were vacant on 1 August 1996.  The number of staff members subject to geographical distribution on 1 August 1996 was therefore 645.
<P>
<B>(b)	General observations on the staffing situation and distribution of staff by area</B>
<P>
<LI>As can be seen from Annex I, the total number of staff in the Professional and higher categories increased by 45 during the three-year period between 2 August 1993 and 1 August 1996 and by 32 during the seven-year period between 2 September 1989 and 1 August 1996, whereas during the eight-year period between 2 September 1981 and 1 September 1989 it increased by 132.  Between 2 August 1995 and 1 August 1996, the total number of staff in the Professional and higher categories increased by 23.  The increase in the total number of staff in the Professional and higher categories during the past year was due to a decrease in the number of vacant posts subject to geographical distribution - a number which had been high in the past as many posts had been kept vacant for financial reasons.
<P>
<LI>During the period between 2 September 1981 and 1 August 1996, the percentage of the staff drawn from Latin America and Africa increased significantly, whereas the percentage of the staff drawn from North America, Western Europe and Eastern Europe declined significantly; the percentage of the staff drawn from the Middle East and South Asia increased significantly between 1981 and 1993 and then declined slightly; the percentage of the staff drawn from  South East Asia and the Pacific increased between 1981 and 1989 and then remained at the 1989 level; there was no significant change in the percentage of the staff drawn from the Far East (see Annex II).  Between 2 August 1995 and 1 August 1996, there was a slight increase in the percentage representation of Latin America (0.5%), Africa (0.8%) and the Far East (0.5%) and a slight decrease in the percentage representation of Eastern Europe (0.7%) and the Middle East and South Asia (0.8%), while the percentage representation of North America and Western Europe remained at the same level.
<P>
<B>(c)	Progress with regard to staff drawn from developing countries</B>
<P>
<LI>There was an increase (0.8%) in the percentage representation of developing Member States during the period from 2 August 1995 to 1 August 1996.  As can be seen from Annex VI, the percentage representation of developing Member States almost doubled during the period 2 September 1981-1 August 1996, increasing from 16.6% to 32.6% in 15 years.  Most of this increase (from 16.6% to 29.0%) occurred during the period 1981-1989, during which the total number of staff in the Professional and higher categories increased by 132 (see paragraph 11 above).  However, the percentage representation of developing Member States on the staff of the Secretariat during the seven-year period 2 September 1989-1 August 1996, during which the total number of staff in the Professional and higher categories increased by 32, increased more rapidly than during the previous eight-year period 1981-1989.
<P>
<LI>There was a 7.2% increase (from 30.3% to 37.5%) in the representation of developing Member States at senior levels (Directors and Deputy Directors General) during the period 2 August 1995-1 August 1996 (as can be seen from Annex VII, the increase was from 25.9% to 37.5% during the period September 1981-August 1996).  However, three candidates from Member States that are not developing countries and one candidate from a developing Member State who have been recommended for appointment at a senior level as of 1 August 1996 are not yet on board.  Should they join the Agency on the agreed dates of entry on duty, the percentage representation of developing Member States at the end of September will be 35.3% - a 5.0% increase compared to 1  August 1995.
<P>
<LI>During the period 2 August 1995-1 August 1996, 76 persons were appointed to and 53 separated from posts subject to geographical distribution - a net increase of 23.  Of those who were appointed to such posts, 29 - or 38.2% - were nationals of developing Member States.  Of those who separated from such posts, 17 - or 32.1% - were nationals of developing Member States (see Annex III).  
<P>
<LI>As can be seen from Annex VIII,  the percentage representation of developing Member States is higher in scientific and technical areas (33.4%) than in administrative areas (31.1%), except with regard to Technical Co-operation Administrators.  In scientific and technical areas, the percentage representation of developing Member States is particularly high among Nuclear Safeguards Inspectors (37.3%), Life Scientists (33.3%) and Chemists (50.0%).
<P>
<LI>Of the 1904 outside applications received during the period August 1995-August 1996 for 28 vacant administrative posts (see Annex IX), 736 - 38.7% - were from nationals of developing countries.  Of these applicants, 6.2% (46) were assessed as well-qualified;  the percentage for applicants from other Member States was 7.6% (89).  Well-qualified applicants from developing countries accounted for 34.1 % of the total number of well-qualified applicants, while 36.8% (7) of the 19 administrative positions for which selections were made were filled by applicants from developing countries.  
<P>
<LI>Of  the 1034 outside applications received for 37 vacant scientific and engineering posts (see Annex IX), 330 - 31.9% - were from nationals of developing countries.  Of these  applicants, 10.3% (34)  were assessed as well-qualified;  the percentage for applicants from other Member States was 9.4% (66).  Well-qualified applicants from developing countries accounted for 34.0% of the total number of well-qualified applicants, while 37.8% (14) of the 37 scientific and engineering positions for which selections were made were filled by applicants from developing countries.  
<P>
<LI>During the period August 1992-August 1996, on average 50 outside applications (three of them from well-qualified candidates) were received in response to each of the 276 advertized vacancies for administrative and scientific/engineering posts.  For 47% of the advertised vacancies, the number of outside applications received ranged from 20 to 50, and for almost 20% it was below 20. The relatively low number of outside applications, particularly from well-qualified applicants for scientific/engineering posts, reflects the increasing difficulties encountered in the recruitment of high-caliber candidates due to the deterioration in the competitiveness of the UN Common System remuneration.  These difficulties are also reflected by the growing number of selected candidates who reject offers of appointment or request an initial within-grade step increase in order to match their current salary.
<P>
<B>(d)	Progress with regard to staff drawn from other Member States that are under-represented</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency does not have "quotas" or "desirable ranges" for staff recruitment purposes.  The guiding principles for recruitment are laid down in Article VII.D of the Statute.  The paramount consideration is to secure employees of the highest standards of efficiency, technical competence and integrity.  Subject to this consideration, due regard is paid to the contributions of Member States to the Agency and the importance of recruiting staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.  
<P>
<LI>For exclusively internal information and for assessing the appropriateness of the nationality distribution of the staff, the Secretariat maintains a pro forma record of post allocations based on Member States' assessments for contributions towards the Agency's Regular Budget and compares it with the actual staff nationality distribution.
<P>
<LI>For Member States which are assessed for at least 1% of the Agency's Regular Budget, the pro forma record of post allocations shows that the level of representation of France, Italy, Japan and Ukraine is below that corresponding to 50% of their assessment rates.  The number of staff members drawn from such Member States on 1 August 1996 was 64, an increase of three compared to the 1 August 1995 level.  
<P>
<B><I>Closing date for the submission of applications</I></B>
<P>
<LI>The closing date for the submission of applications is normally four months from the date of issue of the vacancy notice for advertised posts in the Professional and higher categories (as prescribed in paragraph 48 of Part II, Section 3 of the Administrative Manual).  The Secretariat, acknowledging the difficulties encountered by some Member States in circulating information regarding vacant posts to their national recruitment sources within a short time, has in the past accepted applications received after the closing date in order to ensure that all interested candidates were considered in the competitive process, with a view to securing employees of the highest standards of efficiency, technical competence, and integrity.  However, in judgment No. 1549 dated 11 July 1996 the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation, considering a complaint filed by a former Agency staff member who had applied unsuccessfully for a Director post, stated that announced closing dates should be scrupulously observed and that an organization should announce a new closing date in cases where it wanted to consider late applicants.  Consequently, the Secretariat, although recognizing the need for flexibility in dealing with closing dates, urges governments and Permanent Missions to request from their national recruitment centers and from individual applicants the transmission of applications for advertised vacant posts before the closing date.
<P>
<B><I>The government sponsorship practice</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Last year, the Secretariat brought to the attention of Member States (in document GOV/2823-GC(39)/15) the difficulties arising from the government sponsorship practice.  It noted that this practice had on occasion made it difficult for the Director General to appoint the best qualified candidates and to implement the General Conference resolutions relating to the representation of developing countries and of women in the Secretariat (during the period from 1 September 1985 to 1 August 1995, the Agency was denied the services of 39 well-qualified candidates - 16 of them from developing Member States - for lack of government support).  Also, the Secretariat stressed that the government sponsorship practice should not, in its view, be taken to mean that a Member State could approve or veto the appointment of a particular candidate; the practice should be seen as a means of helping the Agency to obtain a sufficient number of applications from suitably qualified candidates and to verify the candidates' credentials and integrity, the final decision to appoint a particular candidate to a given post being at all times the prerogative of the Director General.  
<P>
<LI>Despite this clarification, between 2 August 1995 and 1 August 1996 the Agency was denied the services of six well-qualified applicants, four of them from developing Member States, for lack of government sponsorship.
<P>
<LI>There is no common position among Member States regarding the government sponsorship practice; some continue to consider it a mechanism whereby they can approve or veto the appointment of a candidate, while some support the Secretariat view presented above.  At all events, an in-house candidate for a Secretariat position who was recently not granted government sponsorship by his national authorities is in the process of filing a complaint for consideration by the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation.  The Secretariat will inform Member States of the Tribunal's judgment and of its implications for the government sponsorship  practice. 
<P>
<B><I>Conclusion</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Measures of the kind taken in response to resolution GC(39)/RES/19 will continue to be taken by the Secretariat, which urges all Member States to assist it by nominating more candidates who are suitably qualified for vacant positions.

<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
<LI>Pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r20.html
">GC(39)/RES/20</A> ("Women
in the Secretariat") adopted by the General Conference on 22
September 1995, the Director General presents in
this report information on the measures taken to implement that
resolution and statistical data on the status of women in the
Secretariat. In order to avoid duplication, some material (text
and data) relevant to the representation of women in the
Secretariat which appears in document GOV/2876-GC(40)/18
("Staffing of the Agency") is not reproduced in this report.
<P>
<LI>The report first states the objectives set by the Conference
and describes measures taken to increase the representation of
women from all geographic areas, and particularly from
developing Member States and from other Member States which are
under-represented, in the Professional and higher categories. It
then provides statistical data (with explanations) and
reviews the progress made in achieving the objectives set by the
General Conference. The report touches on some measures relating
to career development issues and provides data that are also
relevant to female staff members in the General Service (GS)
category.
<P>
<B><I>Objectives set and measures taken</I></B>
<P>
<B>(a) Objectives set</B>
<P>
<LI>In resolution GC(39)/RES/20 the General Conference requested
the Director General "to continue his efforts, in keeping with
the provisions of Article VII of the Statute, to increase
substantially, particularly at the senior and policy-making
levels, as well as for scientific and technical posts, the number
of female staff members, particularly from developing countries
and from those Member States which are under-represented".
<P>
<LI>Also, it called on the Director General "to examine the
Platform for Action developed at the United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women and to integrate, where applicable,
the elements of this platform into the Agency's relevant policies
and programmes".
<P>
<LI>In addition, it invited the Director General "to establish a
focal point for gender concerns in the Secretariat and for the
implementation of the Platform for Action."
<P>
<B>(b) Measures taken to increase the number of female staff
members</B>
<P>
<LI>In an effort to achieve the first objective set by the
General Conference, a variety of measures were taken during the
past year:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i) The implementation of resolution GC(39)/RES/20 was
regularly reviewed at Director General's Meetings on the basis of
reports presented by the Director of Personnel. On several
occasions, the Director General restated the policy
that female applicants - especially those from developing Member
States and other Member States that are under-represented -
should be given preference, in keeping with the provisions of
Article VII of the Statute, in cases of
comparable qualifications and suitability, and he requested
Department Heads
to bear this policy in mind when making selections.
<P>
<DD>(ii) The Director of Personnel closely monitored the
selection process and referred appointment proposals back to
Departments in cases where, in his opinion, female applicants -
and especially female applicants from developing Member
States and other Member States that were under-represented - had
not received the appropriate special attention. In addition, the
Advisory Panel on Professional and G-8 Staff reviewed appointment
proposals with this policy in mind.
<P>
<DD>(iii) A roster of suitably qualified women is being used by
the Division of Personnel in dealing with vacant fixed-term
Secretariat positions.
<P>
<DD>(iv) There has been considerable effort to increase the
number of women carrying out expert missions for the Agency and
the number of fellowships awarded to women. The percentage of
missions performed by female experts in 1995 was 7.5%, compared
with 7.1% in 1993 and 2.2% in 1981. There was an increase       
in the percentage of fellowships awarded to women from 17.0% in
1981 to 21.9% in 1993 and 23.4% in 1995. During the same period,
the percentage of  training course participants who were women
rose from 9% in 1981 to 22.8% in 1993 and 23.9% in 1995, and the
percentage of female project counterparts rose from 12.3% in 1981
to 14.4% in 1993 and 15.6% in 1995. In April 1996, the Director
General requested Department Heads to help increase the number
of women participating in Agency meetings, training courses and
fellowship programmes, serving as consultants and field experts,
etc.
<P>
<DD>(v) A Member State provided a cost-free expert for a period
of six months starting 29 May 1995 to advise on and assist with
the implementation of an action plan (approved by the Director
General on 17 May 1995) for improving the status and
representation of women in the Secretariat. The cost-free expert,
together with a senior female Agency representative, attended the
United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, which took place
in Beijing in September 1995. In addition, she visited Ghana and
Japan in order to present the Secretariat efforts directed
towards improving the representation and advancement of
women.
<P>
<DD>(vi) Work continued on the development of a roster of
recruitment sources (including associations of women working in
science and technology), especially in developing countries and
other countries which are under-represented, with a view to
establishing and maintaining direct contacts with well-qualified
candidates who might be interested in applying for a position in
the Secretariat. For this purpose, a Junior Professional Officer
was provided by a Member State for a period of one year starting
in January 1995. Following the Junior Professional Officer's
departure at the end of 1995, the Secretariat - using temporary
assistance funds - recently recruited a Professional staff member
to continue the job.
<P>
<DD>(vii) Since the launching, in April 1995, of the Temporary
Assignment Programme designed to help GS staff members broaden
their experience and explore career options within the
Secretariat while helping to meet temporary staffing needs in
different Departments, more than 50 staff members - 40 of them
women - have moved from their original Positions to temporary
assignments.
<P>
<DD>(viii) The Secretariat has continued examining the Agency's
recruitment process, particularly with regard to female
applicants, and as a result the personal history form is being
revised, vacancy notices are being modified and a recruitment
brochure which emphasizes the interest of the Agency in receiving
an increased number of applications from well-qualified women -
and especially well-qualified women from developing countries and
other countries which are under-represented - is being finalized
for circulation to the aforementioned recruitment sources in
Member States.
<P>
<DD>(ix) As part of the Secretariat's staff development
programme, five sessions of a "Leadership Skills for Women"
course, three sessions of an "Interviewing
Skills" course and two sessions of an "Effective
Supervision Skills" course for staff in the GS category were held
between September 1995 and July 1996 (almost 80% of the 151
participants were women). All three courses take into
account gender concerns; and
<P>
<DD>(x) The establishment of a Learning Resource Centre to assist
staff, and especially women, in assessing their potential and
their career options and to provide career choice guidance is
near completion.
</DL>
<P>
<B>(c) Implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action</B>
<P>
<LI>The aforementioned cost-free expert prepared a
summary of the Platform for Action and identified the key points
relating to the Agency. 
<P>
<LI>In April 1996, the Platform for Action and the summary were
brought to the attention of Department Heads with a request that
they identify the elements of the Platform for Action which
relate to the Agency's mandate and how those
elements could be, or had been, integrated into relevant
departmental programmes.
<P>
<LI>Responding to this request, most of the Department
Heads indicated that they had already integrated some elements of
the Platform for Action into their departmental programmes, where
applicable, and also established departmental focal points for
gender concerns (over and above the envisaged Secretariat focal
point) and all of them indicated that they would endeavour -
inter alia - to further increase the representation of women at
Agency conferences, seminars and workshops and at other events
organized by the Agency.
<P>
<LI>All comments and suggestions made by the Department
Heads (relating - inter alia - to technical co-operation
counterpart personnel, radiation protection, food and
agriculture, and water resources) are being analysed by the
Secretariat and will be discussed at the senior management level
before departmental programmes are modified.
<P>
<B>(d) Establishment of a Secretariat focal point for
gender concerns</B>
<P>
<LI>In April 1996, pursuant to paragraph 4 of
resolution GC(39)/RES/20, the Director
General assigned to Ms. Joyce Amenta, Director of the
Division of Scientific and Technical
Information, responsibility for acting as the focal
point for gender concerns in the Secretariat.
Ms. Beverley Young, Head of the Human Resource Unit in
the Division of Personnel, was
designated as her alternate.
<P>
<LI>The focal point functions are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>to promote a supportive work environment and foster the
changes in attitude necessary for a climate conducive to the
equal
participation of men and women
in the work of the Secretariat;
<P>
<LI>to address gender concerns raised by men and women, seek
redress - where
applicable - through the existing machinery and, if
appropriate, recommend
policy changes;
<P>
<LI>to assist in the implementation of the action plan for
improving the status and representation of women in the
Secretariat;
<P>
<LI>to monitor the progress made in the representation of
women in the Professional and higher categories in the
Secretariat with a view to identifying any adverse trends; and
<P>
<LI>to monitor the implementation in the Secretariat of the
Platform for Action approved at the United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Working closely with the Director of Personnel and
staff/management bodies such
as the JAC Sub-Committee for the Advancement of Women<A
HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1/</SUP></A>,
the two staff members in
question will report on gender issues, as necessary, to
the Director General and the Deputy
Director General for Administration.
<P>
<B><I>Statistical data and review of progress</I></B>
<P>
<LI>In the statistical part of this document, the
reference date is in most cases 1 August
1996. Information relating to the situation on two other
reference dates (1 September 1989
and 1 August 1993) is also given in order that trends
may be assessed. Although the main
focus is on women in the Professional and higher
categories, some of the data relate to female
staff members in the GS category.
<P>
<B>(a) General staffing situation</B>
<P>
<LI>The total number of regular posts (both subject and
not subject to geographical distribution) in the Professional and
higher categories held by staff members appointed for a period of
at least one year by the Director General following standard
recruitment procedures (i.e. the circulation of a vacancy notice,
competitive selection and government sponsorship) was 767 on 1
August 1996.
<P>
<LI>Of these 767 posts, 63 were vacant on 1 August
1996, so that the number of staff members in the Professional and
higher categories on board as of 1 August 1996 was 704.
The number of staff members in the GS category on board
as of 1 August 1996 was 1299.
<P>
<B>(b) Progress in improving the representation of women</B>
<P>
<LI>As can be seen from Annex I, the percentage
representation of women in the Professional and higher categories
increased during the period 2 September 1989- 1 August 1996 from
12.6% to 18.0% - an increase of more than a third in six years.
It increased from 17.2% to 18% between 2 August 1995 and 1
August 1996. During the period 2 September 1989-1 August 1996,
the number of women at the levels P-5 and above increased from
six to 16 (five holding a D grade) - an
increase in the representation of women
at these levels from 3.2% to 7.8%. As of 1 August 1996,
the percentage representation of
women in the GS category was 61.2%.
<P>
<LI>The percentage representation of developing Member
States among the Agency's female staff members is 36.2% (Annex
II).
<P>
<LI>During the period August 1995-August 1996, 79
persons were appointed to and 57
separated from regular posts - a net increase of 22. Of
the appointees, 18 - or 22.8% - were
women. Of those who separated from such posts, 8 - or
14.0% - were women.
<P>
<LI>As can be seen from Annex III, the percentage
representation of women is far lower
in scientific and technical areas (8.9%) than in
administrative areas (31.0%). In particular,
the percentage representation of women is low among
Nuclear Engineers (8.2%), Nuclear
Safeguards Inspectors (6.4%), and Nuclear Physicists and
Physicists (17.9%), who account
for more than 45% of the Agency's Professional staff.
<P>
<LI>Of the 2143 outside applications received during
the period August 1995-August 1996
for 32 vacant administrative posts in the Professional
and higher categories, 407 - 19.0% -
were from women (Annex IV). Of these female applicants,
8.4% (34) were assessed as well-
qualified; the percentage for the male applicants was
6.2% (107). Well-qualified female
applicants accounted for 24.1 % of the total number of
well-qualified applicants, while 45.4%
(10) of the 22 administrative posts for which selections
were made were filled by female
applicants, reflecting the affirmative action of the
Secretariat in giving preference to women
in cases of comparable qualifications and suitability.
<P>
<LI>Of the 1215 outside applications received during
the period August 1995-August 1996
for 42 vacant engineering and scientific posts in the
Professional and higher categories 132 -
10.9% - were from women (Annex IV). Of these female
applicants, 6.8% (9) were assessed
as well-qualified; the percentage for the male
applicants was 10.1% (109). Well-qualified
female applicants accounted for 7.6% of the total number
of well-qualified applicants, while
9.8% (4) of the 41 engineering and scientific posts for
which selections were made were filled
by female applicants. In the three occupational groups
in question (Nuclear Engineers,
Nuclear Physicists and Physicists, and Nuclear
Safeguards Inspectors), applications from
women accounted for only 4.9% of the total applications
received and women accounted for
only 4.9% of the well-qualified applicants. These low
percentages reflect the continuing
scarcity of well-qualified women in the nuclear field.
<P>
<B><I>Conclusion</I></B>
<P>
<LI>The measures taken pursuant to resolution
GC(39)/RES/20 have been instrumental in
improving the representation of women in the Secretariat
despite a scarcity of women in the
nuclear field. The Secretariat, which will continue to
take such measures, urges Member
States - and particularly the developing countries among
them - to nominate more well-
qualified female candidates in order that further
progress may be achieved.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mr. Chairman,
<P>
The undersigned delegations of the Arab States, members of the League of Arab States participating in this Conference, wish to express their reservations about the credentials submitted by the Israeli delegation for the following reasons:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>	(1)	Israel has annexed the city of Jerusalem, regarding it as its capital in spite of the relevant United Nations resolutions and in particular Security Council resolutions 252, 267, 271, 298, 465, 476 and 478 adopted in various years and General Assembly resolution E 169/35 of 15 December 1980, which considered all administrative and legal measures taken after the occupation of the city of Jerusalem null and void and unlawful, and in which the General Assembly called upon all States and specialized agencies and other international organizations to disregard any measure contravening the provisions of that resolution.  You will notice that, in spite of the provisions of the above-mentioned resolution, the credentials submitted by the delegation of Israel have been issued from occupied Jerusalem;
<P>
<DD>(2)	Israel has annexed the Syrian Arab Golan area and refused to implement the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions relating to the annulment of the annexation measures.  It continues to occupy part of South Lebanon and Western Beqaa, and to refuse to apply Security Council resolution 425 on this subject.
</DL>
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<LI>	In 1989, the General Conference adopted a procedure for determining the order of speakers in the general debate as follows<SUP>1/</SUP>:
<P>
<DL>
<DD> (a)	At a previously announced date and time, the Secretary of the Policy-making Organs shall be available for a period of one hour to receive applications from Member States wishing to speak early during the general debate.  All those who apply during this period shall be eligible for inclusion in a ballot, which shall be held shortly after the closure of the application period.  The ballot shall be organized by representatives of the Secretariat and held in the presence of any representatives of Member States who indicate a wish to attend.  The ballot shall determine an order of priority among all the participating Member States.
<P>
<DD>(b)	The names of any Member States applying for inclusion in the speaker's list after the end of the period designated for application for inclusion in the ballot shall be added to the list in the order in which they apply.
<P>
<DD>(c)	By mutual agreement, Member States shall be permitted to exchange places on the speakers' list.
<P>
<DD>(d)	The practice of giving special priority to Ministers shall continue, the Secretariat being guided entirely by information provided by Member States.
</DL>
<P>
<LI><I>Accordingly, the Secretariat of the Policy-making Organs will be available in Room A-2873 at the Vienna International Centre from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Monday, 17 June 1996, to receive applications from Member States' representatives for inclusion in the list of speakers in the general debate at the forthcoming regular session of the General Conference.  A ballot to determine the order of priority among the Member States whose representatives have applied will be held at 11 a.m. on that day.</I>

<OL>
<B>OPENING OF THE FORTIETH SESSION</B>
<P>
<LI>The fortieth regular session of the General Conference will
open on Monday,
16 September 1996, at 10 a.m.<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1/</SUP></A>
It will be held at the Austria Center Vienna (ACV), Am
Hubertusdamm 6, 1220 Vienna, next to the Vienna International
Centre (VIC).
<P>
<LI>Unless otherwise decided by the Conference, morning meetings
will begin at 10 a.m. and afternoon meetings at 3 p.m. Delegates
are requested to be in their places by those  times in order to
allow meetings to start punctually. If evening meetings prove to
be necessary, the starting times will be announced during the
session.
<P>
<B>PRE-SESSION CONSULTATIONS</B>
<P>
<LI>During the weekend preceding the opening of the Conference's
session (Saturday, 14 September, and Sunday, 15 September 1996),
facilities for group meetings are being  made available on
request. Member States are strongly urged to avail themselves of
those facilities with a view to achieving agreement on
organizational matters (e.g. regarding the composition of the
General Committee) before the session opens on Monday and thereby
contributing to the smooth running of the Conference's session,
ensuring - where necessary - that their representatives arrive in
Vienna in time to participate in pre-session group meetings and
the associated group decision-making. Meeting rooms should be
reserved in good time through the Secretariat's Conference
Service Section.
<P>
<B>NOTIFICATION OF THE COMPOSITION OF DELEGATIONS</B>
<P>
<LI>Governments are requested to communicate to the Secretariat
the composition of their delegations well in advance. This should
be done in writing - by letter or by completing the    
registration form which has been transmitted to Permanent
Missions. Rule 23 of the Conference's Rules of Procedure<A
HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2/</SUP></A>
provides for each Member State of the Agency to be        
represented by one Delegate, who may be accompanied by as many
assistants (alternates, advisers, etc.) as may be needed An
unofficial edition of members of delegations will be
issued on Wednesday, 11 September 1996; only those names that are
received by the Secretariat before Friday, 6 September can be
included in it The first official list of members of delegations
will be issued on Sunday, 15 September; it will contain
information which has been communicated to the Secretariat before
Friday, 13 September.
<P>
<LI>If, during the session, changes are required in the
particulars provided at the time of registration, Delegates are
requested to inform Protocol in writing, so that the list of
delegation members may be brought up to date.         
<P>
<B>CREDENTIALS OF DELEGATES</B>
<P>
<LI>Delegates (but not other members of a delegation) will
require credentials specifically for the session, even if they
are already accredited to the Agency in some other capacity -
for example, as Resident Representative. Credentials have to be
delivered in due time; this helps to avoid difficulties,
particularly for the General Committee. It is accordingly
emphasized that, under Rule 27 of the Rules of Procedure,
credentials should be submitted to the Director General not later
than Monday, 9 September 1996, issued either by the Head
of State or Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of
the Member concerned. If credentials cannot be submitted by
Friday, 13 September, Delegates should deliver them direct to the
Credentials Officers at the ACV either on Sunday, 15 September,
between 2.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. or on the following Monday
morning.
<P>
<B>REGISTRATION FOR BADGES</B>
<P>
<LI>Each participant will require a badge with a photograph for
entry into the ACV during the session. Badges will be issued by
the staff at the Registration Desk to those designated
participants who are not already in possession of a valid VIC
ground pass. Badges issued for the General Conference will also
be
valid for entering the VIC.
<P>
<LI>Participants may register on Friday, 13 September, at the
Agency's Registration Desk at the VIC between 9 a.m. and 5.30
p.m. and on Sunday, 15 September, between 2 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. at
the ACV. Registration will continue throughout the week of the
Conference's session at the Registration Desk at the ACV.
<P>
<LI>Participants also attending the meetings of the Board of
Governors which start on Monday, 9 September 1996 may register
simultaneously for both the Board's meetings and the Conference's
regular session at the Agency's Registration Desk at the VIC
between 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. on Monday, 9 September and
Tuesday, 10 September, provided that they inform the Secretariat
of their intention to do so before Friday, 6 September.
<P>
<B>DOCUMENTS</B>
<P>
<LI>Each delegation is urged to visit the Documents Distribution
Centre in room FM152 at the VIC not later than Friday, 13
September, and specify its requirements for documents on a form
which will be provided for this purpose. If this is not possible,
delegations should apply to the Documents Station at the ACV
either on Sunday, 15 September, between 2.30 p m. and 6.30 p m or
on the following Monday morning.
<P>
<LI>Before the opening of the session one complete set of the
Conference documents already issued will be available to each
delegation. All documents produced during the session, including
the Conference Journal containing the daily programme, and other
notices will also be available at the Documents Station at the
ACV.
<P>
<LI>Delegates wishing to submit draft resolutions or other
documents to the Conference during the session are requested to
provide the Conference Secretary or the appropriate
Committee Secretary with the text as early as possible.
<P>
<B>SPEAKERS IN THE GENERAL DEBATE</B>
<P>
<LI>Until the beginning of the Conference's session on Monday, 16
September 1996, requests for inscription on the list of speakers
in the general debate should be made directly, either personally
or in writing, to the Secretariat of the Policy-making Organs
(VIC, room A 2871). As Member States were informed by document
GC(40)/INF/1, issued on 20 May 1996, inscription in the list of
speakers started on 17 June 1996; a ballot was taken at 11 a.m.
on that day in order to determine the order of priority among the
Member States whose representatives had - between 10 a.m. and 11
a.m. - personally made a request for inscription in the list.<A
HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3/</SUP></A> Since 11 a.m. on 17 June, Member
States making requests for inscription in the list have been
added in the order in which they made their requests. It should
be noted, however, that the practice of giving priority to
Ministers participating in the general debate will continue.
<P>
<LI>Delegates who have not inscribed their names on the list by
the beginning of the session but wish to speak in the general
debate are requested to contact the official responsible for
maintaining the speakers' list, who will have a desk in
Conference Room A (where the plenary meetings will take place).
Delegates should also contact that official if they wish to speak
on other items at plenary meetings.
<P>
<B>STATEMENTS IN THE GENERAL DEBATE</B>
<P>
<LI>In order that the general debate may represent a more
efficient use of the time available, Delegates are invited to
keep the duration of their statements down to <I>15 minutes</I>
by focusing on the main points which they wish to make.
<P>
<LI>To facilitate interpretation, texts of statements to be
delivered should be handed to the Conference Officer in advance.
Copies of the full texts (in the original language) will, if
Delegates so request, be made available to other Delegates during
the session.
<P>
<LI>It is of considerable help if the texts of statements
provided to the Secretariat are typed with double line spacing.
<P>
<B>WORKING LANGUAGES AND INTERPRETATION</B>
<P>
<LI>The working languages of the Conference are Arabic, Chinese,
English, French, Russian and Spanish, and statements made in any
one of these languages will be interpreted simultaneously into
the others. If Delegates wish to make a speech in a language
other than the working languages, they should, under Rule 87 of
the Rules of Procedure, themselves arrange for interpretation
into one of the working languages and provide the Secretariat
with a written text of their speech in advance in that working
language.
<P>
<B>PLEDGES OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION FUND
FOR 1997</B>
<P>
<LI>The Board of Governors has set a target of US$ 68 million,
subject to the
Conference's approval, for Members' contributions to the
Technical Co-operation Fund for
1997 A circular letter indicating Member States' individual
shares of the target (calculated
on the basis of the base rates of assessment applicable for 1997)
is being forwarded to
Member States. Before the regular session opens, a document will
be circulated for the
purpose of notifying delegates of the contributions that Members
have pledged themselves to make.<A
HREF="#note_4"><SUP>4/</SUP></A>
It would be greatly appreciated if Governments facilitated the
timely preparation of this document by communicating their
pledges to the Director General as soon as they are in a position
to do so. During the session, it will be possible to communicate
pledges to the Contributions Officer, who will have a desk in
Conference Room A and will arrange for updated versions of the
document to be issued.
<P>
<B>SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMME ORGANIZED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
CONFERENCE'S SESSION</B>
<P>
<LI>A special scientific programme will be organized in
conjunction with the Conference's fortieth regular session It
will take place on Tuesday, 17 September, in the afternoon and
on Wednesday, 18 September, in the morning and in the afternoon,
in Conference Room C at the ACV, as follows:

<B>Highlights</B>
<P>
<LI>Eleven new Model Projects were launched. The Model Project
concept was strengthened through the introduction of performance indicators for all 23 projects. Continuous monitoring ensured that Model Project goals remained realistic and are being achieved.
<P>         
<LI>During the year intensive "upstream work" was undertaken and the detailed programme planning approach applied to Model Projects was used with the counterpart institutions to prepare for the 1997-98 Biennial Programme.
<P>         
<LI>Basic Safety Standards were a key issue and action plans were
drafted for 53 Member States under the interregional Model
Project "Upgrading Radiation and Waste Safety Infrastructure".
<P>         
<LI>The Agency's co-ordination role through regional projects in
Europe relating to nuclear safety and strengthening regulatory
bodies has attracted the attention of the European Union, G-24
and other donors.
<P>         
<LI>A total of 28 Country Programme Frameworks were initiated as
a basis for agreement between the Agency and recipient
Governments on priority areas that can produce significant
national impacts.
<P>         
<LI>A number of measures were taken to strengthen the AFRA and
ARCAL regional agreements. In both, improvements in management
procedures were made and thematic programming was initiated,
which should lead to fewer but better projects.
<P>         
<LI>A total of 307 projects were completed during 1995; at the
beginning of 1996 the number of operational projects had been
reduced to 1049.
<P>         
<LI>Computerization in the Department was enhanced with the
introduction of a Windows based application for Fellowships.
Provision of information on the INTERNET was introduced under the
Agency's home page "World Atom".
<P>         
<LI>The influence of Technical Co-operation among Developing
Countries (TCDC) is increasing throughout the programme as
regional networks and national experts supported a variety of
project activities.          
<P>
<LI>The overall financial implementation rate reached a record
high 75.7% and that for Model Projects 85.5%, with a total $66.2
million being obligated from all funds.
<P>         
<LI>Delivery was up in all project components compared with 1994:
20% more expert assignments, 18% more fellowships, 11% more
training course participants, and 4% more equipment purchase
orders.
<P>
<LI>         
Total new resources increased to $63.5 million and were 20%
higher than those recorded for 1994. The unobligated balance of
the TCF was reduced to $13.8 million and the readily useable
resources, at year end, totalled $6.2 million.

<DD>18. During the year, great emphasis was placed on "upstream work"
to prepare the 1997-1998 Biennial Programme. Upstream work refers
to early programme planning and development work done in consultation with
counterpart institutions to address subjects of priority, capabilities and
opportunity for technical co-operation. The new process started
in 1995 to guide programme planning resulted from the Policy Review Seminar
in 1994. The CPF as a management tool forms the basis for agreement
between the Agency and the Member State to both concentrate assistance in a
few strategic areas, and undertake specific follow-up actions. The 28 CPFs
initiated in 1995 provided a solid basis for assessing the effectiveness of the
process. An assessment was undertaken early in 1996, and will be the subject
of a later report.
<P>
<DD>19. The central objective guiding programming in 1995 was to
extend the
"discipline" of Model Projects throughout the Programme. This
does not
necessarily mean that all projects should produce social or
economic impact.
It means that all projects should be directed at clearly defined
problems with
measurable objectives. The discipline of Model Projects refers to
the need to
adopt clear standards for programme planning, project
formulation, monitoring
and performance, and evaluation. Adherence to such standards
enhances the
<I>quality</I> of the Programme. Quality management is the overriding
objective of
the TC Department.
<P>
<DD>20. The following review examines the characteristics of
programme
management and planning that improved the focus, government
involvement
and impact of the technical co-operation activities in each of the
five regions.
The activities mentioned are not exhaustive, but illustrate how
technical
co-operation activities are being systematically strengthened
through improved planning, project design, monitoring and
evaluation to produce measurable
impact and greater benefit for Member States.
<A NAME="africa">
<P>
<B><I>1. Africa</I></B>
<P></A>
<DD>21. Building upon the concept and criteria of Model Projects, the
Agency
introduced substantial improvements in the 1995-96 technical
co-operation
cycle. As a result support from donors and financing institutions
for several
new projects in the region seems to be increasing. New
obligations funded by
extrabudgetary contributions from Member States exceeded US$ 2.5
million in
1995.
<P>
<DD>22. The policy dialogue with Member States expanded through
programme
monitoring and review missions to Cameroon, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Ghana,
Mauritius,
Namibia, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda. These missions served to
strengthen
upstream work with Member States, streamline national programmes,
and also
identify problems hindering project implementation . Preparation
of draft CPF
documents for Cameroon, Ghana, Namibia, Sudan, Zambia and Uganda
were
completed and CPF documents were finalized for Madagascar,
Tunisia and
Zimbabwe, following field missions.
<P>
<DD>23. In Madagascar, the CPF process resulted in the identification
of key
agricultural activities that will boost farm animal production
and develop
improved cultivars of major food crops, i.e. cassava and rice. A
CPF mission
to Tunisia identified a potential Model Project that will use
nuclear techniques
to improve water and soil management practices in the Kairouan
plain, situated
in the central part of the country. A potential area of further
collaboration was
related to the proposed acquisition of a 2MW nuclear research
reactor by the
Government.
<P>
<DD>24. The CPF for Zimbabwe indicates two priority needs in
agriculture:
integration of the sterile insect technique (SIT) with
conventional bait methods
for tsetse fly eradication in the Matusadona National Park; and
improved soil
fertility and crop production on small farms in the communal
areas, using the
biological nitrogen fixation technique. National authorities will
also assess the
desirability for Agency support in improving the diagnosis and
monitoring of
infectious animal diseases, in view of the economic importance of
livestock.
In the water sector, isotope hydrology will be used in
combination with
conventional techniques to investigate ground water resources for
small scale
irrigation from the Nyamanhlovu and Save River aquifer systems.
With regard
to human health, project designs were developed in co-operation
with local
counterparts, employing isotopes and advanced molecular
techniques in
diagnosing and controlling tuberculosis and malaria.
<P>
<DD>25. Five Model Projects were operational in 1995, covering a wide
range of developmental priorities: assessment and development of water
resources (regional); radiotherapy and nuclear medicine (Ghana); crop
improvement (Mali); screening of neonatal hypothyroidism (Tunisia); and
eradication of tsetse fly in Tanzania. Overall activities were carried out as planned
and the average implementation rate achieved was 87.7%. These Model Projects
injected new vitality into the Agency's technical co-operation programme in
Africa. The Model Project concept has introduced a new managerial approach
to technical assistance and aided programming activities in the region by
facilitating policy dialogue with Member States. This has helped in the design and
formulation of similar or model-like projects for the 1997-98 programming
cycle          
<P>
<DD>26. During 1995, a substantial increase in field activities of
the Model
Project to eradicate tsetse flies resulted in a significant
reduction of wild tsetse
flies on Zanzibar. Following the refurbishment of the
insectaries, Tanga has
the largest tsetse colony in the world, with over 420,000 females
by the end of
the year. The aerial releases of sterile tsetse flies resumed
early in the year
and proved to be very effective. Thus, the wild tsetse fly
population in the
Jozani forest is now estimated to be only 3% of what it was two
years ago. A
third insectary at Tanga became operational in April 1996,
increasing the
colony to over 600,000, and bringing the number of sterile males
released to
60,000 per week in the remaining parts of Unguja in mid-1996.
After just one
complete year of sterile male releases, females routinely caught
in the wild
already show a high ratio of infertility, reaching 65% in the
first quarter of 1996.
It is anticipated that another year of sterile male releases will
cause the
collapse of the tsetse population.
<P>
<DD>27. National Authorities have provided scientists, technicians,
and supportive infrastructure, as well as cash for the project, which
is integrated with national development plans so that its benefits reach the
small farmers who will use the tsetse-free land. To rebuild Zanzibar's herds of
mixed livestock, family based farming is now being expanded. Farmers in
areas that until recently were infested now have the opportunity to obtain
cattle through a Government programme offering concessional loans. Another
Government programme is developing an integrated smallholder farm system
with a loan from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),
$615,000 of which is supporting the tsetse eradication programme on Zanzibar.
Government initiatives are based on the very real prospect of the
tsetse fly
being eradicated by the end of the Model Project, expected to
occur as
scheduled in 1997.
<P>         
<DD>28. In Tunisia a screening programme for neonatal hypothyroidism
was
launched in three centres in Tunis, Sousse and Sfax, under Model
Project
TUN/6/005. On average, about 2000 newborn babies are currently
being
screened every month, representing about 12% of the total. The
first positive
case identified so far is undergoing treatment and about 10
others have been
recalled for verification. Tunisia has RIA facilities in nine
hospitals, each of
which will receive training and supplies of reagents. With all
centers
participating in the screening programme, total sample capacity
of over
100,000 assays can be achieved. A law was issued in September
1995 to add
iodine to salt, and legislation that would mandate blood samples
be taken from
all newborn babies in Tunisia for hypothyroidism test is ready
for enactment.
<P>
<DD>29. The Government of Ghana has committed about $1,000,000 to
construct the buildings for a new radiotherapy and nuclear
medicine network.
The facility in Accra is expected to be functional by the end of
1996. A
contribution of $780,000 has been made by the People's Republic
of China,
mainly to purchase equipment for the radiotherapy unit in Accra.
Fellowships
have been awarded to train 20 specialists, including 4
radiotherapists to
support the 2 centres in Accra and Kumasi.
<P>
<DD>30. In Mali, the Model Project evaluating the field performance
of improved
varieties of sorghum and African rice made steady progress. Five
mutant
varieties of sorghum and the control were grown on demonstration
plots, and
two of the mutants (MIK-41, MIK-42) produced 33% and 38% higher
yields than the control variety. With the average yield of
sorghum in Mali around 800
kg/ha, the mutants have the potential to produce over 1,100
kg/ha. Yield
performance trials were conducted in four locations. For the
African rice, trials
did not have sufficient plant stand to assess yield performance,
however further
sow trials will be conducted in 1996
<P>
<DD>31.  Considerable progress was achieved in implementing the
regional Model Project on water resources for Africa (RAF/8/022). In all
four participating countries (Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco and Senegal),
field investigations and sampling were carried out. Two experts from
India provided technical assistance to these field investigations. The water
samples collected during the field campaigns are being analyzed by isotope
hydrology laboratories in India, in France, in the UK and at the IAEA.
Initial results have proved highly relevant to water resources management in the
region. For example, isotope data from Morocco indicate prevalence of
paleo-water, disproving previous assumptions of recent replenishment of the
groundwater system. In the Moyale aquifer system (in the south of Ethiopia),
preliminary data of the isotope tritium revealed two types of groundwater
resources with different rates of replenishment and different potentials for
meeting water requirements in the area. Steps are now underway to include more
countries in phase II of the project, which will start in 1997 subject to
approval by the Board. The appropriate design of project activities is reflected
in a financial implementation rate of 96.2% achieved in 1995.
<P>
<DD>32. As part of its assistance in the water sector, the Agency
developed a feasibility study of nuclear desalination as a source of low cost
potable water in North Africa under regional project RAF/4/010. The study
indicates that nuclear energy can serve as an economically competitive
alternative to fossil fuels for generating electricity and supplying energy for
seawater desalination in medium to large units. The Government of Morocco has expressed
interest in using a small nuclear heating reactor for seawater
desalination, and a reserve fund project was established to assist in a pre-project
study of such a demonstration plant. A subsequent project will be carried out
through a bilateral co-operation accord between China and Morocco.
<P>
<DD>33. Collaboration with FAO in sub-Saharan Africa was considerably
strengthened through a new project being implemented within the
framework
of FAO's Special Programme on Food Production in Support of Food
Security
in Low Income Food Deficit Countries (LIFDC). Nuclear techniques
are being
used to assess the sustainability of food production systems
under various
technological packages by monitoring nutrients and pesticides in
pilot farm
demonstration areas in Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania
and Zambia.
<P>
<DD>34. Infrastructure and facilities established with previous
assistance of the
Agency are also being effectively utilized for the development of
many Member
States in the region. The non-destructive testing (NDT)
techniques of the
Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organization (TIRDO)
were
used to inspect the TAZAMA oil pipeline (which runs from Tanzania
to Zambia),
a newly built oil storage tank at Kigoma, and cast sugar roller
shells. The
gamma irradiation facility in Ghana is being employed on a
semi-commercial
scale for the sterilization of medical products. The radiotherapy
services set up in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda are contributing
significantly to cancer
treatment and are much appreciated by the general public and the
respective
Governments.
<P>
<DD>35. In Egypt, progress was made in 1995 in the production of
radioisotopes
for use in nuclear medicine. Basic kits for labelling with
technetium-99m for
use as radiopharmaceuticals were produced and tested clinically,
and locally
produced Tc-generators are now being supplied to Cairo hospitals.
In the field
of radioimmunoassay, achievements include the production of kits
for T3 and
T4 thyroid hormones using locally developed reagents (tracers,
second
antibody and quality control sera).
<P>
<DD>36. A technical co-operation project implemented at the Institute
of Agricultural Research in Holetta, Ethiopia, is improving the
productivity of local breeds of cattle though better nutritional management. It was
shown that urea/molasses/mineral blocks (UMMB) could serve as inexpensive
substitutes
for the concentrated feed supplements presently provided to some
dairy cattle.
The developmental work on UMMB technology has a great potential
as a
low-cost and sustainable method of improving livestock and milk
production.
This is especially important for Ethiopia, which has the largest
cattle population
in Africa with an estimated 32 million heads
<P>
<DD>37. The Ethiopian Rift Valley is endowed with a rich potential of
resources
that could be exploited for geothermal electricity generation and
other direct
energy uses. With the assistance of bilateral and multilateral
donors, eight
exploratory wells have been drilled in the Aluto-Langano region
and four others
in Tendaho. Moreover, the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power
Authority has
issued a tender for the construction of a 5 MWe pilot power plant
at Aluto
utilizing the exploratory wells. The Agency has been supporting
these efforts
through analysis of samples and interpretation of data under a
technical
co-operation project, ETH/8/003. Since a vast area of over
150,000 km<SUP>2</SUP> has
geothermal potential, further Agency assistance is being proposed
to study the
geothermal reservoir processes and to identify the recharge zones
in 1997.
<P>
<DD>38. Substantial assistance has been provided to African Member
States in
the Radiation and Waste Safety fields to create suitable
conditions for the
sustainable development of nuclear technology in the region. Over
30 related
national projects were operational in the region and required
co-ordinated
management in connection with the Model Project on radiation and
waste
safety infrastructure. Cameroon, Ghana and Uganda participated in
the Model
Project activities during the year.
<P>
<DD>39. Priorities within the Africa Region relate to enforcement
mechanisms
and technical capabilities. A regional seminar on radiation
protection
infrastructures and legislative frameworks was held in Zambia.
Radiation
Safety questionnaires were completed by 12 countries, and these
contributed
to the guidance provided to representatives of 14 countries where
the most
noticeable infrastructure deficiencies had been identified. Draft
model radiation
protection legislation and enforcement regulations consistent
with the BSS were
prepared by the Agency in support of the seminar.
Country-specific Action
Plans were developed for the three countries currently
participating in the
model project, and plans are being prepared for 14 additional
countries,
including: C&ocirc;te d'lvoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Madagascar, Mali,
Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Zaire, Zimbabwe. A
total of 17 countries from the region are participating.
<P>
<B>AFRA</B>
<P>
<DD>40. Greater emphasis on co-operation in specific fields of
nuclear science and technology could be seen in the activities carried out
through the regional AFRA agreement. Areas of common interest included: nuclear
medicine, clinical radiotherapy, agriculture, maintenance of scientific and
medical instruments, radiation protection and waste management. The
inter-governmental arrangement, which was extended on 3 April
1995 for another 5 years, now has a membership of 21 countries. Much of the year's
efforts concentrated on AFRA's new strategic directions and procedures.
Intensive upstream work and consultations with AFRA Member States and donor
countries resulted in a new mission and strategy which will guide
AFRA's capacity building work in nuclear science and technology over the
next five years and consolidate ability to plan and implement appropriate
solutions to the region's development problems.
<P>
<DD>41. Creating an AFRA Field Management Structure that will
gradually decentralize all decisions and managerial activities to the field
was an essential step towards full ownership of technical co-operation by AFRA
Member States. Moreover, the provision of cost-free assistants to the
chairperson of AFRA by Member States is an indication of commitment to the spirit and
ideals of AFRA and to sharing the available expertise and facilities in the
region. Technical backstopping and administrative support provided by the Agency
helped translate decisions into actions. Shifting from the
project-by-project approach to thematic programming is another promising innovation.
<P>
<DD>42. The 6th Technical Working Group Meeting held in Johannesburg
in April
1995 approved thematic programmes for crop improvement,
radioimmunoassay, radiation technology, and radiation safety. As
a result of
this upstream planning a detailed regional work plan for
1997-2001
was
formulated to assist the countries in expanding the scope of RIA
activities in
the region, notably through: (i) the detection and measurement of
tumor
markers relevant to the management of some common cancers, (ii)
the
establishment or upgrading of neonatal hypothyroidism programmes
in Africa,
and (iii) the stimulation of regional production and distribution
of primary
reagents for the radioimmunoassay of thyroid related hormones,
and for tumor
markers.
<P>
<DD>43. Thanks to extrabudgetary contributions made available by
France, the
United States and the OPEC Fund, assistance was provided to the
AFRA
Member States to support their own efforts in radioimmunoassay,
mutation
breeding, biotechnology and nuclear instrumentation.
<A NAME="latin">
<P>
<B><I>2. Latin America</I></B>
<P></A>
<DD>44. Efforts to improve the management of technical co-operation
within the
region emphasized upstream activities for the 1997-98 biennium.
Missions to
Member States and visits by government officials and counterparts
to IAEA
featured briefings on recent programming improvements, including
the special
features of Model Projects. Follow-up activities are ensuring
that the 1997-98
project proposals are formulated along these lines for maximum
socio-economic impact.
<P>
<DD>45. Draft CPFs were prepared in-house for 14 countries. A mission
to Cuba was undertaken to review the draft CPF with government
officials and staff from various institutions. These documents will serve as
the foundation for future programming.
<P>
<DD>46. New programming objectives involving extending the
"discipline" of
Model Projects were discussed at a national workshop on project
design,
management and evaluation techniques held in Brazil. A similar
course for
ARCAL projects was conducted in the Dominican Republic in
February 1996.
<P>
<DD>47. During the 39th General Conference, Member States were
invited to prepare concise plans concerning project proposals to be
submitted for the biennium 1997-98. In many instances these plans were discussed
with government officials and modifications were made to bring the
proposals in accordance with current programming objectives. During 1995, six
Model Projects were initiated in the region including applications of
nuclear techniques in biology and medicine, and hydrology and geothermics.
<P>
<DD>48. Argentina's Model Project for the eradication of the
Mediterranean
fruit-fly completed a second year. So far the eradication has
reached across
250,000 Ha. in the central and southern valleys of the Mendoza
Province.
Progress slackened due to financial problems delaying support
from the
Government during the second half of 1995; however, a recovery is
expected
during 1996-97. A medfly genetic sexing or male-only strain
developed at the
Agency's Seibersdorf Laboratory was successfully introduced into
the local
rearing and sterilization facility. This use of genetic sexing
strain will
significantly increase the effectiveness of SIT applications
against medflies.
<P>
<DD>49. An expert from the US Department of Agriculture has estimated
that these new strains will save tens of millions of dollars over the
lifetime of
medfly eradication programmes and will mean the difference
between
success and failure for the US programme in Hawaii. The strain
transferred
to Argentina, which allows separation of sexes based on pupal
color, (brown
for male and white for female) is being mass-produced (150
million/week)
and will be released in Mendoza and probably San Juan provinces
during
1996. In Patagonia, where project initiation has been delayed by
limited
official resources, the private Fruit Producers Association will
provide funding
for both medfly eradication and codling moth control.
<P>
<DD>50.  Peru's Model Project using nuclear techniques to monitor
child
nutrition interventions was reformulated, taking into account
that the provision
of the essential operating capital ($10 million) from the
national Government for the intended pre-school feeding programme
was not forthcoming. An
alternative school breakfast programme was proposed by the Peru
social-welfare bureau, FONCODES, which has essentially the same
objectives
as the pre-school programme and attracts more national support
($15 million).
Isotopic methods are being applied as early predictors of the
efficacy of the
school breakfast programme in the Peruvian highlands and coastal
region.
Such techniques complement conventional long-term evaluations by
quantifying
the physiological effects of feeding programmes in terms of
vitamin A, iron,
immune status, and energy utilization for growth and activity.
Evaluation of the
programme has required a substantial education effort directed at
school
administrators, teachers, and to the children and their families.
<P>
<DD>51.  El Salvador's development plans call for expanding
electricity production
through the further development of geothermal resources. About
14% of
electric power is currently supplied by geothermal resources, and
it is expected
to reach 24% by year 2000. The Rio Lempa Executive Hydroelectric
Commission (CEL) is an autonomous public service institution
responsible for
electricity production and development as well as for
conservation, utilization
and administration of energy resources. CEL's plans include
exploration and
exploitation activities in several geothermal fields financed by
loans from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). This Model Project began
in 1995
by helping to guide planning through isotope, geothermal and
geochemical
investigations in the areas of primary interest, Ahuachapan and
Berlin. The
information obtained is used to prepare hydrogeothermal models
that are
instrumental in drilling, production and injections and reservoir
management.
<P>
<DD>52.  The water supply deficit in the city of Caracas is expected
to worsen
each year due to the adverse climatic conditions, dependency on
reservoir
water and the rapid increase in population. Restricted
distribution of water to
several districts is now a common measure taken by the
authorities each year
to save water for the long dry season. The exploitation of the
Caracas aquifer
has been identified as the primary means for reducing the
dependency on
surface resources. However, proper management of this resource
requires
knowledge of the chemical and physical properties of the aquifer
and
groundwater dynamics.
<P>
<DD>53.  The Model Project VEN/8/010 has focused on providing new
information
for the rational exploitation of the aquifer based on the
availability and quality
of groundwater. The construction of 50 new wells, (their location
and design
to be based on the results of the project) is planned or underway
and it is
expected that this new source of groundwater will contribute
around
112,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> per day or about 43% of the present shortage (260,000
m<SUP>3</SUP> per
day). The laboratory in charge of monitoring the quality of
groundwater
pumped from the Caracas aquifer is being upgraded in order to
measure
additional parameters and to guarantee that existing water
quality criteria are
met.
<P>
<DD>54.  Uruguay's capability for the screening of neonatal
hypothyroidism has
been strengthened during the first year of the Model Project
URU/6/022.
Currently 60% of the newborns in Uruguay are tested. The
programme is
co-ordinated by the Nuclear Medicine Centre, responsible for
processing about
two-thirds of the 54,000 newborn blood-samples collected each
year. The
National Vaccination Programme is collaborating in the collection
of samples from all over the country. The screening revealed four
positive cases, which
received appropriate treatment. It is expected that by 1996 the
screening will
cover nearly all newborn babies, thus contributing to a reduction
in infant
mortality and improvement in the quality of life.
<P>
<DD>55.  Several Model-like projects were concluded in 1995. One
established
a human tissue bank in Argentina using ionizing radiation to
sterilize tissues.
Initiated in 1993, counterpart institutions included the
Foundation Fortunato
Benaim, where the bank is located, the National Commission of
Atomic Energy
and the Orthopaedic Department of the Faculty of Medicine,
University of
Buenos Aires. Skin and bone allografts are now available and can
be safely
used for the treatment of burn patients. Tissue donation and
transplantation
are now governed by law, and additional regulations are to be put
in place in
1996 regarding transplant recipient procedures for the donation
of grafts. The
Tissue Bank was inaugurated by the President of Argentina on
1995-03-15.
<P>
<DD>56.  Another notably successful project completed in 1995 was
BRA/6/O12,
at the Institute of Nuclear Energy and Research (IPEN) in Sao
Paulo, Brazil.
It established modern procedures for recombinant techniques to
produce a
number of primary reagents for RIA. This is the only laboratory
in a developing
country supported by IAEA that has successfully produced this
material, which
is being widely distributed to participating laboratories in
Latin America and
Africa at a fraction of the cost of comparative commercial
sources.
<P>
<DD>57.  Chile is the only country in South America that is
internationally
recognized as being free of Mediterranean fruit flies, and has
developed a
multi-billion dollar fruit export industry. Until recently
however, Chilean fresh
fruits were still excluded from certain markets, because of the
fear of outbreaks
originating from medflies in the Arica region in northern Chile
next to Peru.
The Chilean Agricultural Service, after a decade of unsuccessful
attempts to
eradicate medfly using insecticides in the region requested
support from IAEA
in 1990 to establish a SIT eradication programme. By 1993 a
medfly mass
rearing facility was built in Lluta, Arica, with a capacity to
produce 60 million
sterile flies per week. After considerable staff training and
provision of expert
services, sterile fly releases were initiated in Arica in late
1993. By mid-1995,
these releases were expanded under a co-operative agreement
signed
between Chile and Peru to co-ordinate their actions against
medfly in the
valleys of southern Peru. As a result, no wild medflies have been
detected in
Arica since mid-1995, and in December 1995 Chile was formally
declared a fly-free zone by international experts. According to the Chilean
Minister of
Agriculture this will mean an annual increase of $500 million in
fruit exports
over the next five years. Based on these successes, studies are
being
prepared to expand the Chile and Argentina SIT experience to
other interested
South American countries.
<P>
<DD>58.  A regional project (RLA/2/O06) funded by Germany and the IAEA
to
foster environmental studies using nuclear techniques concluded
in 1995 after
strengthening capabilities in five countries (Argentina, Chile,
Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Venezuela). New analytical techniques were introduced
and several
types of research were carried out for the first time in areas of
special interest
to these countries. In Argentina's Rio de la Plata coastal zone,
studies
incorporating significant quality assurance procedures, including
an
intercomparison exercise, were carried out among the
participating national institutes for the first time. In Chile, a
complete characterization study of
aerosol emissions was performed for the first time. In Ecuador,
the effects of
pesticide use on San Pablo lake and the surrounding area were
described. A
co-ordinated study of the effects of volcanic emissions was
completed in Costa
Rica involving aerosols, precipitations and gas studies. One of
the most
important results of the regional project was the development of
co-operative
arrangements between the countries that had improved
implementation.
<P>
<DD>59.  Within the Latin America Region, 11 countries have been
invited to
participate in the interregional Model Project on upgrading
radiation and waste
safety infrastructure, including: Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Nicaragua,
Panama (waste
safety only) and Paraguay. A first draft work plan has been
prepared for these
countries focusing on priority activities with respect to the
BSS. Discussions
on workplans with the two national counterparts began in 1995,
and it is
expected that by mid-1996 all the first drafts will be approved
by the proper
national authorities. Progress was also made in addressing urgent
and
short-term radiation and waste safety issues in some target
countries in Latin
America, including the establishment of legal frameworks for the
activities of
national authorities.
<P>
<B>ARCAL</B>
<P>
<DD>60.  The Third Phase of the ARCAL Programme began in 1995 and a
number of measures were adopted to strengthen the Programme.
Among
these:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- Establishment of a new evaluation system for ARCAL projects
featuring clear and precise procedures for appraising and
implementing projects.
<P>
<DD>- Review of the Guidelines, Policies and Procedures of ARCAL to
adapt them to the new requirements of the Programme including:
greater application of the Model Project concept within ARCAL;
clear identification of end-users in the ARCAL projects; stronger
commitment of the national government authorities in the nuclear
field; and increase in the responsibilities assigned to the
National
Co-ordinators in managing the Programme.
<P>
<DD>- Installation of a new management structure including the post of
President and Vice-President of ARCAL, and special assistants to
advise in technical matters related to new areas of co-operation
within ARCAL and the revision of new project proposals.
<P>
<DD>- Review of ARCAL strategy and planning for short and medium
term goals, to be adjusted to new directions in the technical
co-operation programme.
</DL>
<P>
<DD>61.  The ARCAL programme includes a Model Project (RLA/6/027) to
increase the utility and extend the life of existing nuclear
medicine equipment
in Latin America by upgrading old analogue gamma cameras and
replacing
nuclear medicine computer systems. Five gamma cameras were
upgraded with interface cards during the year, and another 25 are
scheduled for 1996.
A regional workshop on image processing software is also
scheduled for 1996.
During the ALASBIMN Congress held in Brazil last October a
special IAEA
session on upgrading nuclear medicine practices was held to
provide the public
with information about the project's impact. During the session,
promising
results in upgrading nuclear medicine equipment, both hardware
and software,
were presented by Argentina, Cuba and Peru. Great interest was
generated
by a 20 year old gamma camera in Argentina which was discarded
for the last
eight years but could be successfully reconditioned under the
system
developed by the Agency. Another IAEA upgrade system involving
Cuban
interfacing units and Portable Image Processing (PIP) software
was introduced
and is now being tested in the region.
<P>
<DD>62.  During 1995, the number of ARCAL projects was 14, with
Agency
resources reaching approximately US$ 1.8 million. At the end of
the year four
projects were completed.

<DD>63.  Upstream work to improve the quality of the 1997-98
programme was
assigned top priority during 1995. Special efforts were devoted
to instituting
Model Project and Workplan cultures by both Agency staff and
national
counterpart staff. Moreover, the need for higher quality project
proposals was
highlighted through the "fewer but better" objective. Member
States were
strongly encouraged to incorporate Model Project features into
project designs
and, where possible, to introduce end-user orientation and
emphasize
socio-economic impact. Member States were most co-operative in
reducing
their submissions for 1997-98 with the understanding that fewer
but better
proposals will not reduce the (financial) volume of the Agency
programme.
<P>
<DD>64.  National manpower development projects initiated in the
1993-94 cycle
for each Member State were expanded to include a modest expert
component
along with provisions for spare parts/reagents etc. so that needs
could be more
efficiently met without formulation of a full project. This has
proven to be an
effective mechanism because it has provided the Agency with the
flexibility to
respond promptly to unforeseen requirements of a Member State.
<P>
<DD>65.  Strengthening the Workplan culture was the critical element
in project
planning. Nearly 90% of the project counterparts submitted
up-dated
Workplans along with the six-month progress reports, which became
mandatory
during the 1995-96 cycle. National workshops on project design,
management
and evaluation were organized in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, during
which
participants reviewed and discussed current TC policy. Such
workshops have
strengthened the communications between the Agency and Member
States and
prepared project counterparts to respond better to Agency
programming and
thematic priorities. As a result, considerable improvements were
visible in the
quality of TC project proposals submitted by Sri Lanka and
Myanmar and
implementation of country activities also advanced noticeably.
<P>
<DD>66.  As a follow-up to the 1994 Policy Review Seminar, Medium-Term
Country Plans were received from all Member States in the Region.
Missions were necessary for the Philippines and Vietnam to
prepare CPFs, while CPFs
were formulated for Mongolia and Myanmar on the basis of Country
Programme Review missions conducted during 1993 and 1994. These
efforts
were followed-up with specific programming missions e.g. in the
Philippines,
on geothermal hydrology, and in Vietnam to investigate the
feasibility of a
nuclear power programme.
<P>
<DD>67.  To enable quantification of project impacts, performance
indicators were
established for all Model Projects. The following milestones were
reached
during the year under on-going Model Projects:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- In Bangladesh, under the project "Biofertilizers for Increased
Legume Production", the Agricultural Extension Department of the
Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with the Bangladesh
Institute
for Nuclear Agriculture (BINA) trained more than five hundred
block
supervisors at 12 regional centers across the country. Each block
supervisor in turn trained 5 farmers. In total, some 2500 farmers
received training in the use of biofertilizer during the year.
<P>
<DD>- In Mongolia, under the project "Upgrading Radiation Therapy
Services", a new teletherapy machine was installed in the State
Oncological Research Center in Ulan Bator in August 1995. Since
then about 2500 cancer patients have been treated. Four
radiotherapists and medical physicists have received training
abroad.
<P>
<DD>- In China, under the project "Production of Gel-Tc99m Generators
for Nuclear Medicine", the in-cell equipment for the production
of
gel-generator was designed, manufactured, tested and installed in
the upgraded hot cells. The laboratory for assembling
gel-generator
is currently being upgraded to a clean room to comply with
standards of Good Manufacturing Practices, and a new production
line with a capacity of 150-200 gel-generators per month has been
established. Whereas several performance characteristics of the
gel-generator have been improved, these are still being subjected
to clinical trials in 100 nuclear medicine centers in China.
<P>
<DD>- Under the other Model Project in China "Industrial Scale
Irradiation
of Rice and Other Foodstuffs", the construction of the
Irradiation
Center, including the experimental building, irradiation room and
storage hall, was completed in June 1995 and the cobalt-60 source
loaded in October. In order to promote public acceptance of
irradiated food, a video cassette entitled - "Food Irradiation in
China" was prepared, and telecast throughout the country.
<P>
<DD>- Under the Model Project in Sri Lanka entitled "Radiation
Sterilization
of Human Tissue for Transplantation", a human tissue bank was
established in 1995 with a budget of $375,000. Amnion tissues for
burn dressing and bone allografts are being distributed to public
and private hospitals. The current capacity to prepare and
irradiate
amnion tissues is about 350 pieces per month while current local
needs are estimated at 200 per month. The excess amnion tissues
will be donated to other countries in the region. Sri Lanka
currently spends an average of $200,000 per year on imported
tissue grafts.
Savings of an equivalent amount can be expected as a direct
economic benefit to the country, in addition to the benefits
derived
from donated tissue.
</DL>
<P>
<DD>68.  Counterparts of all Model Projects were invited to share
experience in
the National Workshop on TC Project Management, Design and
Evaluation in
Colombo, Sri Lanka, in March 1995. Similarly, five participants
from Korea,
India and Pakistan were invited to attend a National Seminar on
Systematic
Approach to Personnel Training and Qualification for Safe
Operation of NPPs
in Shenzhen, China.
<P>
<DD>69.  In accordance with the guidance of the 1994 Policy Review
Seminar,
projects relating to radiation protection and waste safety
infrastructure were
given a high priority in the region's TC programme. Ten relevant
national
projects and a large regional project under RCA were co-ordinated
with the
interregional Model Project on radiation and waste safety. All
Member States
in the region completed radiation protection questionnaires
prepared by the
Technical Division (NENS). This questionnaire assisted the Agency
to update
its assessment on the status of radiation protection
infrastructure in the
countries.
<P>
<DD>70.  Within the TC programme for East Asia and the Pacific, 18
national
projects were operational in radiation protection and waste
management, in
addition to activities carried out under the Regional RCA
project. Sri Lanka
has been assisted under the interregional Model Project on
Radiation
Protection since 1994. Beginning in 1996, Bangladesh, Mongolia,
Myanmar
and Viet Nam will also participate. Action plans have been
finalized for all five
countries
<P>
<DD>71.  Substantial technical assistance was provided to the four
countries in
the region with active nuclear power programmes: China,
Indonesia, Pakistan
and the Republic of Korea.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- The UNDP project "Manpower Development for Safe Operation of
Nuclear Power Plants (NPP)" has been operational in China since
1993. A national seminar on systematic approaches to personnel
training and qualification was organized last year with five
participants from other developing countries with operational
NPPs.
Sixteen fellows under the project were trained through two group
training activities arranged at the training centres/facilities
in the
Republic of Korea. Such support to regional training activities
has
made the Republic of Korea a leading source for TCDC.
<P>
<DD>- Several multiple expert missions were fielded to Indonesia under
an
umbrella project, "Support for the First Nuclear Power Plant" to
investigate various aspects of NPP siting. Some siting issues
remain to be resolved and further assistance may be required.
<P>
<DD>- Priority activities in Pakistan included energy and nuclear power
planning, operational safety of the Karachi NPP (KANUPP) and
design review, site evaluation and safety aspects of the Chashma
nuclear power plant. A number of workshops on root-cause analysis
and trip reduction techniques, severe accident analysis,
fault tree analysis, upgrading of instrumentation and control
were
held at KANUPP during the year. Missions were fielded to advise
on the Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) of the 300 Mwe Chasma NPP.
<P>
<DD>- A mission was organized to the Republic of Korea to review safety
aspects in the design of the Ulchin NPP units 3 and 4 (UCN3/4).
The two identical 1000 MWe PWRs are being constructed by Korea
Electric Power Co. (KEPCO) at a site alongside the French
designed units 1 & 2. The UCN 3 and 4 plants will serve as
reference plants for all subsequent PWR units to be built in
Korea
up to the year 2006.
</DL>
<P>
<DD>72.  The Thai Ministry of Health requested the Agency to conduct a
national
workshop on neonatal screening, which was undertaken in April
1995. The
workshop was inaugurated and attended by the Minister of Health,
who
expressed a strong Government commitment to establishing a
nation-wide
programme whereby all newborn children in Thailand (800,000 per
year) would
be screened by the year 2000. The mass production of reagents
will enable
1,800,000 screening tests per year by the year 2000, and will be
supported
through an ongoing project.
<P>
<DD>73.  For the first time, the programme for East Asia and Pacific
included
three regional projects outside the RCA, two in agriculture and
one in nuclear
power. One of the projects builds on the success of an earlier
UNDP project
in Indonesia to develop multi-nutrient supplementation feed
blocks using locally
available resources in order to increase the milk and meat
production from
ruminant livestock. Demonstration trials have been initiated in
the eight
participating Member States, with Indonesia transferring the
'know-how' in the
true spirit of TCDC.
<P>
<DD>74.  Considering the importance and potential of geothermal energy
to at
least three countries of the region (China, Indonesia and
Philippines), efforts
continued to formulate a regional project to exploit
opportunities. A UNDP
Sectoral Support Mission was fielded to the Philippines in March
1995 to
further develop the project concept, which is supported by Japan
and New
Zealand. Geothermal development activities in the Philippines
have also been
supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) under a $30
million
project and by a World Bank loan for development of geothermal
areas. In view
of the expertise it has acquired through the years from Agency
assistance in
isotope hydrology, the Philippines is now in a unique position to
support
regional efforts as a provider of technical "know-how".
<P>
<DD>75.  A Reserve Fund Project entitled "Radiological Aspects of the
Rehabilitation of Bikini Atoll" was established to review the
prevalent conditions.
The project aimed to investigate if the Atoll could indeed be
reinhabitable in a
way that is consistent with the philosophy of radiation
protection. A report will
be forthcoming in 1996.
<P>
<B>RCA</B>
<P>
<DD>76.  The East Asia and Pacific region now has a good basis for
increased
regional development co-operation. During 1995, the Regional
Co-operative
Agreement (RCA) for Asia and the Pacific continued to facilitate
such
dynamism within the region through the mechanism of Technical
Co-operation
among Developing Countries (TCDC). TCDC was prominent in RCA
programmes, as was evident from the wide participation of other
countries in
national events in the region.
<P>
<DD>77.  Contributions from Member States during the year exceeded $1
million
for the first time. Substantial contributions from Australia and
Japan supported
the multi-million dollar UNDP/RCA/IAEA project on "The Use of
Isotopes and
Radiation to Strengthen Technology and Support Environmentally
Sustainable
Development", which is helping to develop the Region's capacity
to use
practical problem-solving techniques in industry and the
environment. This
project has been particularly successful in promoting the
transfer of
non-destructive evaluation technologies to the private sector. A
variety of
techniques have been applied in fields as diverse as the
petro-chemical
industry and air transportation sector, public safety and
protecting the
environment.
<P>
<DD>78.  The success of the UNDP/RCA/IAEA collaboration follows an
earlier
project to increase the use of nuclear technology in regional
industries and
encourage regional industrial competitiveness. Last year this
project was one
of 10 selected by the Joint Inspection Unit, an independent
investigatory body
of the UN, to compare field level impacts and results of UN
sponsored
intercountry projects in the region. It was rated number one in
the evaluation
with a score of 96 out of 100 points; one of the best reviews
ever made for a
project in the field of science and technology. The commitment of
national
counterparts and the readiness of participating Governments to
collaborate
actively with the private sector were identified as particular
strengths, and the
RCA network of co-operating Member States was described as a
"model" for
TCDC.
<P>
<DD>79.  Since 1993, the Agency has invested considerable resources in
helping
RCA Member States develop a curriculum for training operators of
tissue
banks. National Co-ordinators from 15 Member States have
contributed to the
development of a draft curriculum addressing the key training
needs of the
Region. It also incorporates training by open learning (also
called distance
learning) methods, which have been successfully applied in
nuclear medicine
and radiation protection as part of Australia's contribution to
the RCA. The
programme culminated in September 1995 in Singapore with a
successful
workshop. Local production of bone allografts for surgical
transplantation have
already saved the region approximately 1 million dollars, and
thus the cost of
the RCA project has already been returned through economic and
health care
benefits for the region.

<DD>80.  A new Section was established in 1995 to be responsible for
the TC
programming in countries in the Middle East and Central Asia.
Many of these
countries were either new Member States or had recently started
technical
co-operation activities with the Agency. Substantial upstream
work was
undertaken in 1995, including the preparation of three CPFs that
required
missions to Kazakstan, Lebanon and Uzbekistan to understand
country needs better. In view of the above situation, regional
project activities were expanded
to introduce the new entrants to a variety of Agency programmes
and to
provide them with effective fora for learning from other Member
States.
Individual requirements of Member States were addressed through a
wide
range of country projects.
<P>
<DD>81.  The regional project mechanism was often used to consolidate
miscellaneous manpower development requests for expert services
and
training from Member States. In several cases, it was possible to
use regional
experts to facilitate technical co-operation between countries.
The strategy of
using regional expertise for training events is being actively
pursued. Greater
use of manpower development projects is envisaged, as Member
States gain
experience in identifying their training needs systematically.
<P>
<DD>82.  One important initiative in 1995 was the launching of the
regional Model
Project "Support to Rinderpest Surveillance in West Asia".
Rinderpest is a
contagious and deadly disease in cattle caused by a virus related
to measles
in humans. When it first reached Africa in the late 1890s it
killed more than
90% of the continent's cattle. Outbreaks continue to occur
periodically as
rinderpest remains the largest global threat to livestock. In the
11 participating
countries of West Asia there are some 60 million cattle. The
objective of this
Model Project is to help build regional capacity and upgrade
analytical
laboratories by supplying equipment, training and expertise, so
that each of the
countries can conduct serum monitoring and surveillance essential
for
rinderpest eradication. In March 1995, the first Co-ordination
Meeting under
the project was held in Damascus. Specialists from six Member
States
elaborated a workplan to establish and co-ordinate the
sero-monitoring and
surveillance in support of their national vaccination programmes
to eradicate
rinderpest.
<P>
<DD>83.  In food and agriculture, the experience gained through
earlier regional
projects was extended to studies on water balance and nutrient
delivery
methods for crop improvement, especially in arid and semi-arid
zones. The
follow-up project combined field demonstrations on the
application of these
techniques with technical lectures. Participating countries
carried out field
experiments and were supported through expert advice and minor
items of
equipment. Eight countries in the region participated in a
regional workshop
in Turkey.
<P>
<DD>84.  Two new regional projects in human health began in 1995. One
promotes the screening of newborns for thyroid deficiencies in
the six
participating countries. The Agency has been concentrating on
developing one
central laboratory in each country with the capability of
establishing and
validating the required methodology. The second regional project
supports maintenance and quality control of nuclear medicine
equipment. The project
planning meeting for the second project was held in Iran with the
participation
of representatives from Jordan, Kuwait, Kazakstan, Lebanon,
Syria, Yemen
and the host country. Participants presented reports on the
status of
radiotherapy and nuclear medicine centers within the region and
identified
major problems with the maintenance, operation and quality
control of
equipment. An action plan was drawn up for the next stage of the
project,
which will improve the capabilities of these Member States
through training and
the upgrading of equipment.
<P>
<DD>85.  A preparatory study was initiated in 1995 under a regional
project to
address the consequences for the riparian countries of the rise
of water level
of the Caspian Sea. The complexity and magnitude of the problem
requires
a collective effort by several UN agencies. A workshop was
organized with the
co-sponsorship of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
(UNESCO) in Paris, including participants from all the affected
countries. The
workshop discussed and updated information on the infrastructure
available to
investigate this problem. During the year, the Agency organized a
three-week
study cruise on the Caspian Sea that provided training on
sampling techniques,
measurement of various hydrological and chemical parameters and
interpretation of data. Participants from Iran, Kazakstan, the
Russian
Federation, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan took part in the event.
The sample
data will form the basis for future analysis of this problem,
including a larger
second phase investigation of the Caspian Sea possible under the
footnote-a/
project RAW/8/005.
<P>
<DD>86.  A workshop was organized in Amman to study energy options
using
IAEA planning methodologies. Participants from Iran, Jordan,
Kazakstan,
Lebanon and Saudi Arabia exchanged experience in the general
field of energy
and electricity planning and the usefulness of IAEA methodologies
for the
conduct of national studies. The participants made
recommendations for
enhancement of the IAEA planning models under review. This
project could
help the participating Member States in decision making relating
to future
national energy and electricity systems and the role of nuclear
energy.
<P>
<DD>87.  In radiation safety the Agency continued to assist Member
States, in
particular the new ones, in upgrading their national radiation
protection
infrastructures. Regional project RAW/9/003 aims to bring
national standards
up to the level of the Agency Basic Safety Standards for
protection against
ionizing radiation and for the safety of radiation sources. The
project was
planned and approved prior to the interregional Model Project in
the same field,
but is co-ordinated closely with it.
<P>
<DD>88.  In West Asia, a regional workshop was held in Beirut to
present the
essential elements of establishing and maintaining adequate
national radiation
protection infrastructure commensurate with applications of
ionizing radiation.
Participants from Iran, Jordan, Kazakstan, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia,
Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen attended. The workshop
served to
update the current information on these countries and thereby
identify areas
for further technical support. Although this particular workshop
was organized
under a regional project, the participants also were briefed on
key features of
the Agency's Model Project on upgrading radiation and waste
safety
infrastructure. INT/9/143. An agreement was reached between
Lebanon and the IAEA to locate the office of the Model Project's
Regional Co-ordinator in
Beirut. This office will be responsible for the co-ordination and
harmonization
between all ongoing national, regional and interregional
activities in countries
of East and West Asia and prevent duplication of efforts.
<P>
<DD>89.  Nine West Asian countries have been invited to participate in
the
interregional safety project: Afghanistan, Kazakstan, Lebanon,
Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Kyrgyzstan
(pending
membership) . While some of these Member States have received
technical
assistance on some aspects of radiation protection and waste
safety, others
are new and have not had such projects. These Member States are
at varying
levels of radiation protection and safety infrastructure
development and
therefore require greater assessment and elaboration to develop
specific action
plans. Draft action plans have now been prepared for all
countries in the
region and will be finalized in consultation with the concerned
Member States.
<P>
<DD>90.  In addition to these regional events, specific requirements
for radiation
protection and waste management were provided under national
projects. As
a consequence of Iran's decision to revive the Bushehr NPP with
the
WWER-1000 technology, technical assistance was requested on
safety issues
such as seismic site studies, plant safety features, quality
assurance (QA) and
project organization. Outside experts prepared comprehensive
reports and
recommendations which were sent to Iran for review. A sizeable
manpower
development programme on nuclear power safety and applications
was initiated
in support of the above activities.
<P>
<DD>91.  Substantial progress was achieved in the final stages of
establishing the
miniature neutron source reactor (MNSR) facility in Syria.
Completion of the
building and installation of equipment were accomplished by the
end of the
year and the commissioning is expected early in 1996. In
Kazakstan, a
number of safety upgrading measures for the WWR-K research
reactor were
implemented and the re-commissioning of this major facility at
the National
Centre was planned for the first half of 1996. The continued
importance of
strengthening radiation and nuclear safety infrastructure in
Kazakstan was
confirmed by the CPF mission. Seismic safety-related technical
advice was
provided to Uzbekistan with respect to its operational research
reactor.
<P>
<DD>92.  After converting to LEU fuel, the research reactor in Iran
operated
smoothly in 1995 and the draft of the safety analysis report for
the reactor was
completed and reviewed. Recommendations were provided to Iran for
preparing the final version. Iran's cyclotron became operational
and production
of radioisotopes Ga-67 and Tl-201 began for use in medicine. The
production
of other medical radioisotopes is under development. The
equipment for isotope processing was delivered and installed, and
expert advice was
provided for its operation. Further progress was made in
industrial applications
of radioisotopes and their use was extended to the oil industry.
A leak
detection experiment on oil pipelines was successfully performed.
<P>
<DD>93.  Syria made substantial progress in the operation of an
irradiation facility
for the sterilization of medical goods. In addition, a Co-60
source of 10 kCi
was delivered for use in studies on seed mutation and the sterile
insect
technique. A Co-60 source was also supplied to Jordan for
research and
demonstration on the sterilization of medical supplies and food
preservation.
These efforts have established a good technical basis for the
future production
of radioisotopes and for radiation technology applications in
sterilization and
crop mutation in these two countries.

<DD>94.  Many countries in the region are new Member States of the
Agency or
have experienced economic or political transitions which
adversely affected the
institutions and organizations involved in nuclear technology.
This situation
creates great demand for Agency assistance. A number of new ideas
were
introduced to improve the management and delivery of TC
activities. The new
initiatives and approaches were introduced to the region both
through direct
communications and workshops.
<P>
<DD>95.  Eleven Country Programme Frameworks (CPFs) were under
         preparation during 1995 and four missions were carried
out to assess or
         validate programme planning assumptions. CPF planning,
pre-project expert
missions and Area Office/counterpart visits were all part of the
Section's
upstream work to facilitate project preparation for the 1997/98
programme.
Two special "TC Management Workshops" were also organized in
1995, and
proved successful in providing both the Agency and the
participating countries
with new tools to enhance communications and improve project
identification,
formulation, implementation and evaluation.
<P>
<DD>96.  Although the scope of efforts underway in this region is
broad, the
primary objective of the on-going programme was improving
radiation and
waste safety. Significant radiation and waste safety problems
remain to be
resolved in many recipient Member States in Europe. Although
there are
several well established nuclear regulatory organizations,
responsibilities for
radiation protection are generally dispersed and clear control is
not always
established. Therefore, a major activity in Europe under the
Interregional
Model Projects INT/9/143 and INT/9/144 was preparation of
detailed studies
of the present radiation protection and waste safety
infrastructure in
13 European recipient states. Albania has been assisted under the
interregional Model Project on Radiation Protection since 1994.
During 1995,
10 additional countries were invited to participate in the
interregional safety
project: Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus,
Estonia, Georgia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia and Moldova (pending membership).
Action
plans to address the deficient infrastructure components have
been completed
for each country. Assistance will commence pending approval of
the plans by
the respective governments.
<P>
<DD>97.  One major TC initiative in 1995 addressed safety concerns in
operating
nuclear power plants constructed to earlier safety standards.
Under
RER/9/035 "Support for Nuclear Safety in Central and Eastern
Europe",
pressing safety concerns were identified and ranked according to
their impact
on plant safety. These data were then used to review the adequacy
of
improvement measures proposed and implemented in countries
operating
Water Cooled and Moderated Reactors (WWERs). Because these
countries
depend extensively on electricity produced by NPPs, phasing out
even the
older designs has major socio-economic consequences. This
regional TC project also assisted 10 Member States in
strengthening their capabilities for
safety assessment of NPPs and is facilitating technical exchange
in the
Region. Activities in 1995 included: preparation of guidelines,
peer reviews,
assistance in evaluating plant safety improvements; organization
of topical
meetings to consolidate knowledge and consensus on actions needed
to
resolve generic safety issues; maintaining the IAEA technical
database on
safety issues; and providing operational safety services (ASSET,
ASCOT,
OSART). Safety services funded by this TC project were carried
out in
Armenia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia,
Slovakia and
Ukraine. Most of the countries receiving assistance confirmed
that the
programme's results were very beneficial both to NPP operators
and
regulators.
<P>
<DD>98.  Among the areas warranting special attention was the role of
regulatory
bodies in European recipient countries. In co-operation with the
European
Union's (EU) Regulatory Assistance Management Group (RAMG),
exploratory
missions were sent to several recipients in Europe under the
regional TC
project RER/9/023 - "Strengthening Nuclear Safety Regulatory
Bodies". One
important management objective has been to ensure that the IAEA's
activities
did not duplicate other assistance. This was accomplished through
close
co-ordination with the G-24 Nuclear Safety Assistance
Co-ordinating Centre.
Within the framework of this project, the first co-ordinating and
programming
meeting of the regulatory bodies was held in April 1994 in Kiev,
Ukraine, to
assess the status and identify the needs and priorities for
assistance. The
success of the Agency' co-ordination role has attracted EU, G-24
and other
donors, and resulted in the full endorsement of the project's
objectives by
recipient countries. By the end of 1995, three regional training
courses, three
regional workshops and one national workshop were held. These
events drew
some 133 participants from twelve countries in the region.
<P>
<DD>99.  Other important nuclear safety activities included a project
in Romania,
ROM/9/007 "Licensing of Cernavoda NPP", which contributed to
strengthening
the Romanian National Regulatory Body (CNCAN). CNCAN completed a
draft
Nuclear Law, which was approved by the Parliament's lower chamber
in
October 1995 and is now under review in the Senate. It is
expected to be
enacted during autumn 1996. The commissioning license of the
first NPP unit
was issued in 1995. In addition, a comprehensive high level
training
programme for staff of the regulatory body was carried out to
keep up with the
licensing requirements of the NPP.
<P>
<DD>100.  The Model Project in Slovakia, SLR/9/005 "Strengthening
Nuclear
Regulatory Body" has been highly successful. The counterpart is
the Slovak
Nuclear Regulatory Authority (SNRA), which was appointed to
elaborate an
Atomic Act and facilitate the approval procedures by Parliament.
The advice
given during the expert missions led SNRA to develop an effective
internal
structure covering all of its duties. Similarly, expert advice
enabled SNRA to
establish a set of internal procedures, inspection guidelines and
a programme
for inspection activities. An internal training organization was
introduced, and
a draft internal training programme was developed. SNRA has
become a
mature and efficient regulatory body and is now preparing a
comprehensive
report on the state of safety of nuclear installations in the
country, identifying
the significant safety actions it has taken.
<P>
<DD>101.  Ukraine's newly restructured regulatory authority will soon
introduce
international standards in radiation protection, nuclear safety
and waste
management as a result of assistance provided under UKR/9/006 -
"Upgrading
Nuclear Regulatory Capability", which began in 1995. To augment
technical
backstopping, it was decided to utilize the experience gained by
the Slovak
Nuclear Regulatory Authority from its Model Project SLR/9/005. As
a result of
a fact finding mission by Slovak experts, a comprehensive work
plan was
proposed for UKR/9/006. Subsequently, in agreement with the
Ukrainian
authority, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the IAEA
and the
Slovak Nuclear Regulatory Authority was drafted to cover the
implementation
of the proposed project activities through subcontracts. This
approach provides
new opportunity for implementing certain TC projects: the
subcontractor,
normally a well qualified institution in the same region, is
responsible for         implementation and progress reporting to
the Agency. This concept, which will
further TCDC objectives in the region, is also being applied to
other projects
in Europe involving, experienced institutions in Croatia, Romania
and Hungary.
<P>
<DD>102.  The Hungarian Model Project, HUN/9/019 "Strengthening
Training for
Operational Safety at Paks NPP" is a complex multi-year
undertaking involving
several institutions and an investment of over $10 million,
including Agency
inputs (both TCF and extrabudgetary contributions from Japan,
Spain, and the
US) and contributions from the European Union within the scope of
the PHARE
regional programme. One of the major achievements of the project
was the
introduction of a Systematic Approach to the Training (SAT) of
NPP personnel.
SAT is an accepted international practice for achieving
competence and as a
mechanism for providing cost-effective and efficient training
with inherent
quality assurance and competence assessment. Within the framework
of SAT,
several seminars were held at Paks with the participation of
international
experts. The maintenance training centre was the component
requiring the
largest financial inputs. The acquisition of WWER main components
was
achieved ahead of schedule with a cost-effective supply contract.
In view of
this success, additional contributions through the PHARE
programme were
approved in 1995 and were fully co-ordinated with the Agency's
inputs.
<P>
<DD>103.  The Agency began assisting Bulgaria in the seismic
evaluation and
upgrading of the Kozloduy NPP in 1991. The findings of the safety
review
missions became the basis for a comprehensive seismic upgrading
programme
at Units 1 and 2. With the provision of additional funds from the
IAEA and the
USA, BUL/9/012 "Site and Seismic Safety of Nuclear Power Plant"
was
extended through the 1995-96 technical co-operation cycle.
Westinghouse
Energy Systems Europe was subcontracted under the project to
perform a
preliminary walkdown at the plant, and to assess the seismic
capacity of safe
shutdown systems and components, including the structures of the
buildings'
housing systems and components. As a result of this preliminary
work, the
plant was judged to have seismic vulnerabilities similar to those
in many US
nuclear plants prior to the seismic upgrading programme of the
late 1970s.
<P>
<DD>104.  The IAEA's recommended that substantial improvements to
seismic
safety be accomplished by simple, relatively inexpensive
modifications and
improvements. On the basis of these findings and other work
carried out by
Bulgaria, the terms of reference for the design of the seismic
upgrading of
Kozloduy Units 1 and 2 were elaborated by the Bulgarian authority
and World
Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) with assistance from the
IAEA.
These terms of reference were used to obtain substantial
financing from the
European Union to complete the seismic upgrading . The project
has
demonstrated that international seismic safety standards can be
applied to
Soviet era WWER type reactors.
<P>
<DD>105.  The radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident in 1986
resulted in
widespread contamination of the region. In addition to the direct
exposure of
the population, substantial amounts of radionuclides contaminated
agricultural
lands and found their way into the food chain. A TC project,
UKR/9/007
"Reduction of Radionuclides in Human Food" was initiated to
advise on ways
to reduce the internal dose to the population through control of
radionuclides.  The Ukraine Government was particularly
interested in the feasibility of
producing milk free from radionuclide contaminants, mainly caesium
(Cs-137)
and strontium (Sr-90). Moreover, the need for clean milk was
emphasized by
the Ministry of Food because it should provide clean baby food
products for the
region's 1.5 million children. The project's main counterpart and
end-user is
the Ovruch Milk Canning Plant located 80 km west of Chernobyl and
the
beneficiaries will be a large number of the local population.
<P>
<DD>106.  During 1995, two expert missions concluded that it was
technically
feasible to remove the radionuclides from milk and to control the
public doses  through a careful control and monitoring programme.
Consequently, the plant
decided to apply technology developed by a US company for
magnetic removal
of caesium and strontium from milk, water, fruit juices and soft
drinks through
particles coated with specific absorbers. In November the US
agreed to
finance the installation of this facility on a bilateral basis.
The Agency has
been asked by the Ukrainian Government to monitor the performance
of this
technology and to provide gamma-monitoring equipment, low level
scintillation
counters and wet chemistry equipment as well as training and
expert services.
In addition, quality assurance support will be provided to ensure
international
credibility of the analytical data generated. These activities
have received a
high priority in the Ukraine and have also attracted
international press attention.
<P>
<DD>107.  In Belarus, about 23% of the total agricultural land is
contaminated by
radionuclides originating from the Chernobyl accident and one
third of it is so
severely contaminated that it is not considered sufficiently safe
to produce
crops. A TC project, BYE/5/002 "Rapeseed Cultivation on Soils
Contaminated
by Radionuclides", was initiated in 1995 to follow up on previous
research in
the country which had shown that a portion of the contaminated
soils was
suitable for diversified cultivation of oil seed crops used for
industrial
applications in the energy sector. The initial studies during
1995 showed that
through comprehensive radioactivity monitoring and the use of
agronomic and
agro-radiological criteria, it was possible to select varieties
of rape-seed that
could be grown on medium to highly contaminated soils with the
minimum
uptake of radionuclides. These successful results prompted the
Government
to request the IAEA's assistance in a second phase study of
industrial
processing of oil-seeds for the production of bio-lubricants and
related
products. As a result of these efforts, the European Union is
interested in
helping to finance industrialization and socio-economic studies.
<P>
<DD>108.  The Black Sea is one of the most contaminated marine
environments
in the world. TC is playing a major role in assisting Member
States bordering
the Black Sea to apply tracer techniques, assess marine
environmental pollution, and upgrade analytical techniques for
radionuclides in marine
samples. The project, RER/2/003 - "Marine Environmental
Assessment of the
Black Sea", is being implemented with the participation of
Bulgaria, Romania,
Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. The national governments of these
countries,
have committed themselves to a regional approach for the
management and
protection of the marine environment, which is supported by
co-ordinated
marine research activities at the national level, in
collaboration with the
Agency's Marine Environmental Laboratory in Monaco. In view of
the
Governments' commitment to these activities, several
international
organizations have also initiated assistance programmes. The
Global
Environmental Facility (GEF), administered by World Bank, UNDP
and UNEP,
approved a large scale project of assistance.
<P>
<DD>109.  Burning poor quality coal in conventional power plants
releases millions
of tons of SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB> into the atmosphere in many European
countries. In
view of the advantages offered by the electron beam (EB)
purification of flue
gases (simultaneous removal of SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB> and recycling of
by-products as
fertilizer), the Agency is advancing the application of this
technique in several
developing countries by assisting Member States to carry out
feasibility studies
for introducing EB technology. In September 1995, a meeting was
organized
in Vienna to review the status of this technology in developing
countries and
exchange information on its application, particularly the
experience of Poland's
Model Project (POL/8/014) for the construction of an industrial
demonstration
EB plant at the Pomorzany power station (Szczecin). Twenty
participants from
Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Poland,
Thailand, Turkey,
and Ukraine participated. The conclusion was that the Model
Project had
made significant contributions in terms of furthering the
understanding of EB
technology and its applications. Three countries in the region
(Bulgaria, Turkey
and Ukraine), now have active programmes related to EB technology
and the
Ukraine has already started the construction of an industrial
plant with
assistance from the Agency under UKR/8/003. Two feasibility
studies are also
underway in Bulgaria and Turkey.
<P>
<DD>110.  As a result of management changes at Pomorzany plant in
early 1995,
the project was almost cancelled when the new management became
concerned over economic and technical risks. A high level meeting
in Vienna
with Polish counterparts and international experts produced a
contingency plan
with well defined steps. Further meetings and discussions
involving the Prime
Minister, the Deputy Foreign Minister, the President of the
National Atomic
Energy Agency and the Pomorzany management during the period May-
September 1995, led to full resolution of all internal questions.
During his
statement to the 39th General Conference, the President of the
Polish NAEA
announced that the Model Project would go ahead as planned. The
tripartite
supply contract for high power electron accelerators was
finalized and signed
shortly afterwards. On the basis of the existing schedule, the
electron beam
plant should be operational by October 1998.
<P>
<DD>111.  A new initiative began in 1995 that could contribute to
enhanced food
quality and safety by reducing the large scale use of
insecticides. The
Government of the Autonomous Region of Madeira in Portugal has an
economic interest in controlling the Mediterranean fruit fly
(Medfly), a pest that
causes tremendous losses to fruit production. A study of fruit
growing on
Madeira Island concluded that eradication of the medfly using the
sterile insect technique (SIT) was a feasible method to ensure
the continued expansion of
fruit production and to reduce the large scale use of
insecticides. The project
POR/5/005 - "Mediterranean Fruit Fly Programme" was established
to
implement the SIT solution. The Agency is providing the technical
backstopping to design a mass-rearing facility, including quality
control
equipment, field monitoring, control and release activities,
training, maintenance
and field operations. Overall project management is the
responsibility of the
Agency in co-operation with the counterpart.
<P>
<DD>112.  A mass-rearing facility for the medfly on Madeira would be
the first
facility of its kind in Europe and North Africa. Financing for
the construction
of a fly rearing facility, with a capacity to supply 50 million
sterile flies each
week, has been approved by the European Union. As part of the
project's
activities, site selection and final design of the facility were
concluded in the
first quarter and construction was initiated in July 1995.
Eradication of the
medfly from Madeira would prevent annual losses of about $3
million. It would
also significantly reduce pesticide use in agriculture, and
contribute to the
expansion of subtropical fruit production, already a leading
sector of the
island's economy.

1995:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- activities related to programme management and project
development;
<P>
<DD>- interregional training courses on specialized topics; and
<P>
<DD>- projects in areas such as safety, that warrant a global approach.

<P>
<DD>114.  The Agency participates in the Board of the International
Science
Program (ISP) of the Uppsala University, Sweden, which assists in
enhancing
the research capacity of developing countries. As in TC projects,
this is done
through the exchange of scientists, post-graduate education in
physics/chemistry and provision of equipment. In many cases ISP
works with
the same countries and TC project counterparts. During 1995,
co-operation
activities with ISP were strengthened in the area of fellowship
training through
the so-called "sandwich programme" in which Agency fellows
receive advanced
training both in the fellow's country and in Sweden under the
supervision of the
ISP. Fellows from TC are already benefitting from this programme.
Furthermore, ISP may in future assist the Agency in implementing
certain
projects where both institutions are already involved. Similar
strengthening is
being achieved with the International Centre for Theoretical
Physics - Office of
External Activities (ICTP - OEA) which has the same types of
assistance to
developing countries, and where the Agency chairs the Committee
on External
Activities (IAEA, ICTP-TWAS, UNESCO).
<P>
<DD>115.  Pre-project assistance and programme reviews focused on the
objectives defined at the 1994 Policy Review Seminar, including
development of Model Project type projects and country programme
frameworks (CPF).
Nine out of twenty programme review missions carried out in 1995
aimed at
helping to prepare CPF documents. Thirteen pre-project missions
covered high
impact activities, such as human communicable diseases in Kenya.
<P>
<DD>116.  The list of training courses approved by the DG reflected a
dedicated
effort to consolidate interregional courses with other TC
activities on the
national and regional level, and to see that these corresponded
with coherent
sectoral planning. In the past, interregional training courses
often covered too
wide an array of issues and were not sufficiently integrated with
other TC
activities.
<P>
<DD>117.  In 1995, 17 interregional training courses were conducted
on subjects
of interest to a large number of developing countries. Ten were
devoted to
nuclear power and safety, including issues such as electricity
demand
forecasting for nuclear power planning, nuclear power project
management,
operational safety of nuclear reactors and interim storage of
spent fuel. The
balance of the courses were devoted to the application of
isotopes and
radiation techniques in agriculture and nuclear medicine, and to
experimental
nuclear spectroscopy and nuclear electronics. A total of 472
specialists from
developing countries participated in these courses.
<P>
<DD>118.  Two workshops and fourteen expert missions were carried out
during
the year under project INT/9/122 which assists in siting and
seismic review of
research and power reactors. Under this project expert missions
were sent to
Bulgaria (seismic safety of Kozloduy units 5/6), Croatia (NPP
site selection
criteria), Hungary (seismic safety review of PAKS NPP), Turkey
(seismic safety
issues activity plan for Akkuyu NPP and planning of
infrastructure for NPP
programme), Argentina (advisory mission on full scale testing of
NPPs), Egypt
(seismic safety of Inshas research reactor), Uzbekistan (seismic
safety review
of Ulughbek WWR research reactor) and Morocco (site safety review
of the
Sidi Boulbra NPP site). As a result, specific recommendations
concerning the
upgrading of the seismic safety of the above reactors were
provided leading
to greater safety of these nuclear installations
<P>
<DD>119.  During the year, efforts began to articulate a broad based
interregional
approach for monitoring and controlling rinderpest in Africa and
West Asia.
Pre-emptive actions are needed in many parts of the world where
there is little
knowledge of the disease. Such work can only be done where
national
authorities have access to good laboratory facilities. A new
project proposal
is now being formulated using laboratories already established by
the Agency.
The objective is to enhance support for the surveillance of
rinderpest by
consolidating the various regional and national efforts under one
project. If
approved by the Board the project could be included in the 97/98
TC
Programme. This project is in support of the Global Rinderpest
Eradication
Programme (GREP) co-ordinated by FAO.
<P>
<DD>120.  A review of the Model Project on upgrading radiation and
waste safety
infrastructure in early 1995 concluded that while the basic
concepts were
sound, the organization, management and planned actions (calling
for activities
in five to six countries each year) would not achieve the
objectives within the
         duration of the project (1994-2000).  The information
gathered for country
profiles indicated that 53 countries, far more than originally
estimated, needed substantive improvements in their radiation and
waste safety infrastructures to
meet BSS requirements. Implementation would have to be
accelerated
significantly and a systematic action plan would be necessary if
the required
infrastructures were to be in place before the end of the
century.
<P>
<DD>121.  Further analysis found that a more effective system of
management
accountability and responsibility for objectives would be
essential to achieving
BSS requirements in all Member States by the year 2000. Given the
common
nature of the safety culture in most Member States, it was also
determined that
greater efficiency and effectiveness could be achieved by
consolidating all
safety related activities into one project. Such an integrated
approach called
for co-ordinated and centralized management, and simultaneous
implementation in all countries requiring infrastructure support.
It also required
greater national self-reliance and involvement from the outset of
implementation. Two new management components would be essential
to
make the new system successful: a clearly identifiable single
focal point for the
entire effort, and a firm commitment to time-limited objectives.
<P>
<DD>122.  This approach establishes global thematic planning in TC for
the first
time: it institutes a sectoral objective (upgrading safety
infrastructure) in some
53 countries not yet meeting the BSS; it includes a comprehensive
assessment
of national infrastructure in all regions; and it commits to a
time-limited action plan to meet country requirements. The new
management system offers
greater efficiency and effectiveness by introducing field
management/experts
to monitor and support in-country activities. Operationally, the
new system
reduces redundancies and enhances the predictability of project
achievements
by establishing a firm implementation schedule and full budgetary
requirements. Equally important, it creates a clear delineation
of
responsibilities between the TC Department, the Safety Department
and
national counterpart institutions, thus providing greater
accountability for the
project management structure and lines of authority.
<P>
<DD>123.  Three interregional projects, the "Basic Safety Standards"
(INT/9/055),
"Radioactive Waste Management" (INT/9/011) and "Emergency
Preparedness
and Planning" (INT/9/124) were completed in 1995 as part of a
consolidation of these activities into two interregional Model
Projects on radiation protection
and waste safety infrastructure, and waste management (INT/9/143
and
INT/9/144). The 36 RAPAT and 29 WAMAP missions undertaken during
these
projects helped to develop infrastructure ratings that form the
basis for the two
interregional Model Projects.

<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>On 22 September 1995, in resolution <A
HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r23.html
">GC(39)/RES/23</A> entitled
"Nuclear testing", the General Conference, inter alia,
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- called on all States concerned
<P>         
<DD>"to fulfil their responsibilities to ensure that sites where
nuclear tests have  been conducted are monitored scrupulously and
to take appropriate steps to avoid adverse impacts on health,
safety and the environment of such nuclear testing",
<P>
<DD>- requested all States concerned
<P>
<DD>"to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency of any
adverse impact on health, safety and the environment as a
consequence of such nuclear testing as necessary to assist the
Agency to discharge its functions under the Statute" and
<P>
<DD>- called for
<P>
<DD>"co-operation between the States concerned and the
International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with its Statute
in the implementation of the two preceding paragraphs".
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Before that resolution was adopted, in his statement to the
General Conference the Director General had said that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"As reported to the Board of Governors the previous week, he had
recently received a letter from the French Minister for Foreign
Affairs concerning France's irreversible commitment to the
conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty in 1996 and
its intention to undertake a final series of nuclear tests before
that date. The Minister  had asked whether the Agency would be
willing to conduct a scientific mission to assess the
radiological impact of the tests. Such an assessment would have
to be complemented by an assessment of the geological situation
of the test site. In reply he had indicated that, for the Agency
to take a decision on the matter, a number of preliminary
questions would need to be carefully considered, including the
objective and the scope of the mission, its modalities and the
composition of a team. He had added that the Secretariat wished
to consult with the French authorities and with others on those
issues. Consultations with French experts were scheduled to take
place during the week of the Conference.
<P>
"The French request was being considered in the context of the
numerous services provided by the Agency to its Member States in
the field of nuclear safety and radiological protection and its
establishment of radiation safety standards."<A
HREF="#note_1"><SUP>l/</SUP></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>On 12 December 1995, the Director General informed the Board
of Governors that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The resumption of nuclear testing in the Pacific had been the
subject of a resolution in which the General Conference had
called, inter alia, for co-operation between the States concerned
and the Agency. As he had mentioned in September, the
Government of France had requested the Agency to perform a study
of the overall radiological situation at the Mururoa and
Fangataufa Atolls, account being taken of all past events of
radiological significance and the study comprising two parts: an
assessment of the radiological situation and an evaluation of the
potential long-term radiological impact. The envisaged study
could be carried out - after the end of the tests - under the
supervision of an international advisory committee composed of
highly qualified experts, including experts from relevant
organizations belonging to the United Nations system. In the
light of consultations with Member States, he had
informed the French Foreign Ministry that the Agency was ready in
principle to conduct the study and that an agreement could be
formalized after discussions with the relevant French authorities
on modalities."<A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2/</SUP></A>         
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>On 18 March 1996, the Director General informed the Board
that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"As reported to the Board in September and December, the
Secretariat had been requested by the Government of France to
conduct a study designed to assess the radiological situation at
the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa in French Polynesia.
At its 1995 session, the General Conference had called, inter
alia, for co-operation between the Agency and Member States
concerned. Since the informal briefing of Board members in
February, at which he had mentioned the progress made in
preparing for the study, all arrangements and the terms of
reference had been formalized. An International Advisory
Committee to supervise the study was being established under the
chairmanship of Dr. Gail de Planque of the United States. A
technical team from the Secretariat had visited the Pacific test
sites in order to make logistic preparations for the necessary
measurements and sampling. The first formal meeting of the
International Advisory Committee was set for early April. The
findings, conclusions and recommendations of the study, which was
expected to take about 18 months, would be contained in a report
of the Committee to be published by the Agency. The co-operation
with the French authorities had been good. France was covering
the costs of the study, but other voluntary contributions - in
the form of expert services and laboratory work - would be
welcome."<A HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3/</SUP></A>         
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>Also on 18 March 1996, a statement to the Board made by the
Acting Deputy Director General for Nuclear Safety included the
following remarks:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Turning to the study - mentioned by the Director General in his
introductory statement - of the radiological situation at the
Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls, he said that an Agency team from
Seibersdorf and Monaco had just returned from a visit to
the atolls, where they had made logistic preparations for
measurements and sample-taking due to begin at the end of June.
Besides the 14 experts of the International Advisory Committee,
two task groups and five working groups with a total of about
50 additional experts would be directly involved. A worldwide
network of national laboratories, in addition to the Agency's own
laboratories at Seibersdorf and Monaco,  would assess
environmental samples. The project, which was being funded
through a voluntary contribution from France, would take
approximately 18 months to complete."<A
HREF="#note_4"><SUP>4/</SUP></A>        
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>On 10 June 1996, the Director General informed the Board
that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The International Advisory Committee on the Study of
the Radiological Situation at the Atolls of Mururoa and
Fangataufa was now fully operative. It was composed of ten
prominent scientists from ten Member States plus representatives
of WHO, UNSCEAR, the South Pacific Forum and the European
Commission. The Committee had set up [Task and Working Groups]
comprising 26 experts from 15 Agency Member States and Fiji and
supported by a grid of national laboratories co-ordinated
by the Agency's laboratories in Seibersdorf and Monaco. A group
dealing with the  present radiological situation had already
started work, and a three-week sampling  campaign would take
place at the atolls at the end of July. He would inform the
Board periodically about the study."<A

<P>
<I>Organizational structure</I>
<P>
<LI>The organizational structure for the Study includes - besides
the International Advisory Committee - a Liaison Office set up by
the French Government, a Project Management Office set up by the
Agency and the Task and Working Groups (see attached chart)
referred to by the Director General when reporting to the Board
in June 1996.
<P>
<LI>The Task and Working Groups are described below:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i) Task Group A (on the current radiological situation) -
under the chairmanship of Mr. A. McEwan, Director of the National
Radiation Laboratory in Christchurch, New Zealand - is
responsible for evaluating (a) the radioactive materials in the
environment that may lead to radiation exposure of the public;
and (b) the doses to members of the public as a result of the
environmental contamination. It is supported by two working
groups: the first - headed by Mr. F. Schonhofer of the Federal
Institute of Food Control and Research in Vienna, Austria, and
co-ordinated by the Agency's Laboratory at Seibersdorf -
is responsible for assessing the terrestrial environmental
contamination of the atolls and their biota; and the second -
headed by Mr. D. Woodhead of the Directorate of Fisheries
Research (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), United
Kingdom, and co-ordinated by the IAEA Marine Environment
Laboratory in Monaco - is responsible for assessing the aquatic
environrnental contamination of the atolls' lagoons and the
surrounding oceanic water and of their biota. Data to be
evaluated will be obtained - inter alia - from the French
Government and through independent sampling and measurements.
<P>
<DD>(ii) Task Group B (on the potential long-term radiological
situation) - under the chairmanship of Mr. D. Levins, Deputy
Director of the Environment Division of the Australian Nuclear
Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) - is responsible for
evaluating the potential long-term radiological impact of the
radioactive materials remaining in the geological cavities at the
atolls. It is supported by three Working Groups:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- Working Group 3- headed by Mr. L.-E. De Geer of the Nuclear
Detection Group of Sweden's National Defence Research
Establishment and dealing with the source term- will assess the
radiologically significant radioactive materials remaining in the
deep geological formations of the atolls, their physical-chemical
composition in relation to their geological transportability and
their predicted rates of release from the test cavities;
<P>
<DD>- Working Group 4 - headed by Mr. C. Fairhurst of the
Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Minnesota,
United States of America, and dealing with geosphere radionuclide
transport- will assess the geological stability and hydrology of
the atolls, estimate other physical and chemical parameters which
influence the movement of radionuclides through the atolls and
model the transport of radionuclides from the vicinity of the
test cavities to the biosphere; and
<P>
<DD>- Working Group 5- headed by Mr. E. Mittelstaedt of the
Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency in Hamburg, Germany, and
dealing with marine modelling- will assess the marine transport
of radioactive materials that might be released from the
geological formations.
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
<I>Financial aspects</I>
<P>
<LI>The Study is being financed by France.
<P>
<LI>Contributions in kind are being provided by a number of
Agency Member States - Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand,
the Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom and the United States of America - and by Fiji,
WHO, the European Commission, UNSCEAR and the South Pacific
Forum.
<P>
<I>Progress</I>
<P>
<LI>The first formal meeting of the International Advisory
Committee was held at Agency Headquarters on 13-14 April 1996,
with the participation of Task and Working Group Chairmen. The
CommiKee established its terms of reference. Also, first
proposals for the Task and Working Groups' terms of reference and
action plans were reviewed. The membership of the Task and
Working Groups was agreed (on the basis of nominations made
by Committee members), as was the format of the final report.
<P>
<LI>Task Group A has agreed upon its terms of reference and drawn
up an action plan for terrestrial and aquatic sampling. The
sampling campaign, aimed at evaluating the results
of French environmental monitoring programmes and producing
additional data useful for radiation dose assessment, has been
taking place since mid-July. During this five-week
sampling campaign, Task Group A's working groups have been
receiving full co-operation and logistic support from the
relevant French authorities. The sample analysis results are
expected to be available by the end of the year.
<P>
<LI>Task Group B has reviewed the work programmes proposed by its
three supporting Working Groups and has identified and resolved a
number of interface problems. Also, it has agreed on schedules
for future work and posed a number of questions to the French
liaison team on matters requiring clarification.
<P>
<I>Outlook</I>
<P>
<LI>The International Advisory Committee will hold its next
meeting, in the South Pacific region, probably in French
Polynesia and in Fiji, late in 1996. It will review the progress
made and discuss an outline of its report.
<P>
<LI>According to its terms of reference, the Study is to be
completed within 18 months after the necessary information and
data have been provided to the relevant Working Groups
by the French Liaison Office.
<P>
<LI>The Study's findings, conclusions and recommendations will be
contained in a report of the Committee to be published by the
Agency. It is expected that the report will be published early in
1998.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat will keep the Board of Governors and the
General Conference informed about the progress of the Study.

<OL>
<LI>This document, which may be regarded as a successor to document <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc39inf8.html">GC(39)/INF/8</A> issued last September and to its predecessors, presents an overview of measures to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety.  It focuses on recent Agency activities concerned with such measures, but also touches on a number of important initiatives taken outside the Agency.
<P>
<LI>There has been growing intergovernmental co-operation in strengthening nuclear, radiation and waste safety worldwide, and in the Nuclear Safety Review 1996 (issued as part of the IAEA Yearbook 1996) the Secretariat reports on this trend towards a "global nuclear safety culture", which involves at least three distinct elements:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>A.	Legally binding international safety agreements such as various conventions which have been adopted or are still being developed;
<P>
<DD>B.	Non-binding international safety standards which have been developed mainly under the auspices of the Agency; and
<P>
<DD>C.	Provisions for the application of those standards.
</DL>
<P>
These three elements form the basis for reporting in the Attachment to this document on recent Agency activities aimed at strengthening international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety.
<P>
<LI><A HREF="gc40inf5pa.html">Part A</A> of the Attachment deals with:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	the status of and recent developments concerning the <I>Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material</I>, the <I>Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident</I> and the <I>Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency</I>;
<P>
<DD>-	the preparations for implementation activities following the entry into force of the <I>Convention on Nuclear Safety</I>; and
<P>
<DD>-	the work under way on developing a <I>convention on the safety of radioactive waste management</I>.
</DL>
<P>
<LI><A HREF="gc40inf5pb.html">Part B</A> of the Attachment concerns the <I>establishment of non-binding international safety standards</I> by the Agency, mostly in collaboration with specialized agencies of the United Nations and with other international bodies, and describes the Secretariat's strengthened process for safety standards preparation and review.
<P>
<LI><A HREF="gc40inf5pc.html">Part C</A> of the Attachment describes how the Agency has been <I>providing for the application of safety standards</I> to - inter alia - its own operations and, at the request of a State, any of that State's activities in the field of atomic energy through:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the provision of safety-related assistance under the Agency's technical co-operation (TC) programmes and by other means;
<P>
<LI>the fostering of safety-related information exchange; and
<P>
<LI>the rendering of safety-related services.

<LI>In Part C, <A HREF="gc40inf5ac-1.html">Annex C-1</A> describes recent developments in the <I>provision of safety-related assistance through TC programmes</I> and <A HREF="gc40inf5ac-2.html">Annex C-2</A> deals with a particular aspect of the provision of safety-related assistance - the <I>provision of assistance related to the safety of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union</I>.  <A HREF="gc40inf5ac-3.html">Annex C-3</A> describes recent efforts to <I>foster safety-related information exchange</I>, while <A HREF="gc40inf5ac-4.html">Annex C-4</A> deals with a particular aspect of such information exchange - the <I>promotion of education and training in nuclear, radiation and waste safety</I>.  <A HREF="gc40inf5ac-5.html">Annex C-5</A> describes the status of a number of <I>safety-related services</I> rendered by the Agency to Member States, while <A HREF="gc40inf5ac-6.html">Annex C-6</A> summarizes the findings of a number of <I>safety assessments</I> which have recently been or are being carried out by the Secretariat in rendering such services.
<P>
<LI>In support of the Agency's efforts to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety, the Secretariat has strengthened its organizational structure - inter alia through the establishment of a Department of Nuclear Safety.  Also, a detailed review of the Agency's safety-related activities has been carried out by senior experts from Member States within the framework of the Agency's Programme Performance Assessment System (PPAS).  The recommendations of the senior experts are reflected in the Agency safety programme for 1997-98 being submitted to the General Conference.  A second detailed peer review of the Agency's safety-related activities will be carried out in January 1997 (the first one was carried out in July 1995).  It will cover all Agency projects relating to nuclear, radiation and waste safety, particular attention being paid to their impact (the benefits to Member States), their cost-effectiveness and their continuing relevance in the Agency context.
<P>
<LI>There have been three safety-related developments which deserve to be particularly highlighted:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Moscow Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security;
<P>
<LI>The establishment of a Contact Expert Group for international co-operation, in radioactive waste management with the Russian Federation; and
<P>
<LI>An increase in intergovernmental collaboration relating to the security of nuclear materials and other radioactive sources, with special emphasis on illicit trafficking.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>In April 1996, in the declaration of the Moscow Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security, the G-7 leaders and the Russian President called for a strengthening of international co-operation in a number of areas ranging from the safety of power reactors to the security of nuclear material.
<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  The declaration referred to the importance of enhancing the international regime of liability for nuclear damage and called for the early finalization and adoption of the convention on the safety of radioactive waste management currently under preparation. All countries were urged to sign and complete internal procedures so that the Convention on Nuclear Safety could be brought into force before the end of 1996. <A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>  Also, the declaration called for the promotion of an effective nuclear safety culture and for greater international transparency in nuclear power activities (to be achieved particularly through peer reviews).
<P>
<LI>The Contact Expert Group (CEG) for international co-operation in radioactive waste management with the Russian Federation was established in Stockholm in September 1995 and held its first meeting on 13-15 March 1996 in Moscow, with the participation of representatives of 12 countries, the European Union and three international organizations.  In April 1996, the Director General appointed - for a period of two years - an executive secretary whose task is to support the CEG in identifying co-operation priorities, projects and partners, the aim being to facilitate the effective use of financial resources and avoid duplication. <A HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>  About 100 projects (20 of them considered by the Russian Federation to be of high priority) have been identified.  Most of the projects are directed towards resolving practical waste management technology issues in the Russian Federation, while others relate to standard-setting, regulatory and radiological safety issues.
<P>
<LI>With the increased governmental interest in strengthening international co-operative efforts to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources, the Secretariat has launched a programme of measures designed to help combat such trafficking.  The measures are reported on by the Director General in document <A HREF="gc40-15.html">GC(40)/15</A>.

Agency's message No. N3. 3 l-2-IRQ/Al. 10.2 dated 12 July 1996 regarding the right

<P>
  "As a result of a number of resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council
a total embargo was imposed on the Republic of Iraq since August 1990. The
embargo is still in effect. In addition, the said resolutions have resulted in freezing
all Iraqi assets abroad and all banks were ordered not to effect any transactions on
behalf of Iraq. Thus force majeure conditions were created which prevent Iraq from
paying its assessed contribution to the regular budget.
<P>
  "The Mission would like to emphasize that Iraq has always made good on its
financial contributions to the IAEA prior to the present situation. Iraq will make
every effort to fulfill its obligations as soon as conditions permit it to do so.
<P>
"The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Iraq requests that this note is brought to the attention of the General Conference with a view to restoring its right to vote in accordance with article XIX.A of the Statute.

On 5 September 1996, the Director General received a note verbale dated 3 September 1996 from the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Cyprus.  The text of the note verbale, which relates to the DG's report on "Composition of regional groups" (attached to document 
<A HREF="gc40-11.html">GC(40)/11</A>), is herewith being issued pursuant to a request made by the Permanent Mission.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>
<B>Text of Note Verbale of 3 September 1996 from the Permanent Mission of Cyprus to the International Atomic Energy Agency</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Cyprus to the International Atomic Energy
Agency presents its compliments to the Secretariat of the IAEA and referring to the document
No. GOV/2864 dated 10 May 1996, under the title "Article VI of the Statute, (b)
Composition of Regional Groups, Report by the Director General on the implications of draft
resolution GC(39)/COM.5/ 10 under the agenda item Amendment of Article VI of the
Statute", and in particular to its annex C concerning the Note sent by the Permanent Mission
of Turkey to the Agency, with regard to Turkey's views on the membership to the list of
eight regional groups mentioned but not identified in Article VI of the IAEA Statute, has the
honour to inform of the following:
<P>
The argumentation of the Permanent Mission of Turkey, in its Note dated 13 October 1995
(annex C of the above mentioned document), that Cyprus "neither geographically nor
politically belongs to the Western European area. Therefore, in the drafting process of such
a list as envisaged by the GC(39)/RES/22, this fact should be reflected accordingly ...", is
at least superficial and misleading.
<P>
Each organization, whether it belongs to the UN system or not, maintains its autonomy, has
its own particularities and is master of its own procedures, including the classification
(grouping) of its members in various groups, regions or areas. Thus, the participation of
Cyprus in the "Asian Group" at the United Nations, cannot be considered as a criterion or
a rule for Cyprus' inclusion in the various groups or regions of international organizations.
<P>
Furthermore, the classification of the UN regional groups has evolved as an informal
arrangement, basically for consultation and election purposes, and is based on the agreement
of the Member States concerned. As it is known this arrangement emanates form the UNGA
Resolution 1991 (XVIII) of 1963 and UNGA Resolution 33/138 of 1978. Thus, for practical
purposes, different groupings are used for different purposes within the context of the United
Nations. For example, as it is also pointed out in the Report of the Secretary-General (para.
16), Turkey belongs to the "Western European and other Group" for election purposes and
to the "Asian Group" for other purposes.
<P>
In addition to the above, Cyprus, always within the context of the United Nations, is a
member of the Economic Commission for Europe. Furthermore, as in the case of IAEA, in
a big number of international organizations, whether they belong to the UN system (i. e.
UNESCO, ITU, FAO, World Tourism Organization, etc.) or not (i.e. ICRC, IOM, IUCN,
etc. ), Cyprus belongs to the "European Group" or "European Region".
<P>
Cyprus' historical and cultural inheritance, its tradition and institutions, as they have evolved
from Cyprus' participation among others, to the Council of Europe, the CSCE/OSCE, the
Association Agreement with EEC (1972), the application for EU-membership (1990), render
natural Cyprus' inclusion to the "Western Europe" region area.
<P>
Furthermore, the Commission of the European Union, an organ much more competent to
judge the European character of a state, than Turkey is, included the following paragraph in 
its opinion on the Application by the Republic of Cyprus for membership (30.6.1993 - para.
44):
<P>
<I>"VI. CONCLUSIONS</I>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
44, Cyprus' geographical position, the deep-lying bonds which, for two thousand
years, have located the island at the very fount of the European culture and
civilization, the intensity of the European influence apparent in the values shared by
the people of Cyprus and in the conduct of the cultural, political, economic and social
life of its citizens, the wealth of its contacts of every kind with the Community, all
these confer on Cyprus, beyond all doubt, its European identity and character and
confirm its vocation to belong to the Community".
</DL>
<P>
In line with the above facts, as well as the other factors that the Secretariat of the IAEA took
into consideration when it prepared the list of states by Region (according to Article VI of
the IAEA Statute), GC(39)/COM.5/10, Cyprus should remain in the "Western Europe"
region.
<P>
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Cyprus requests that the above mentioned views
be duly reflected in the report of the Director General, which the Board of Governors at its
June 1996 meeting decided to submit to the 40th regular session of the General Conference.
<P>
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Cyprus to the International Atomic Energy
Agency avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Secretariat of the IAEA the
assurances of its highest consideration.

<B>STATE OF NEGOTIATIONS IN THE STANDING COMMITTEE

<P>
Note by the Secretariat
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Since the thirty-ninth (1995) regular session of the General Conference, the Standing Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage has held three sessions as well as several informal drafting meetings.  The Committee resolved many of the outstanding issues regarding both the draft protocol to amend the Vienna Convention and the draft supplementary funding convention and was able to prepare full texts of both draft instruments.  
<P>
<LI>On revision of the Vienna Convention, the Committee has taken a decision on the important question of maximum compensation amounts.  In particular, the draft amending protocol provides that the liability of the operator may be limited to not less than 300 million SDRs or to not less than 150 million SDRs provided that the difference will be made up by public funds.  
<P>
<LI>It was also agreed, albeit with some reservations, to insert in the revised Vienna Convention a new definition of nuclear damage and related provisions.
<P>
<LI>Much progress has also been made on supplementary funding.  Only a limited number of issues remain in the draft convention text.  In particular, the Committee is now close to reaching agreement on the fundamental issue of the structure of supplementary funding; the two alternative provisions  currently being discussed follow the same basic approach as regards compensation of domestic and transboundary damage.  
<P>
<LI>There is agreement that the required national compensation amount should be at least 300 million SDRs which will serve as the threshold for bringing the supplementary fund into operation.  This amount corresponds to the limit of liability of the operator   contained in the draft protocol to amend the Vienna Convention.
<P>
<LI>Since the two drafts significantly increase the limit of liability of the operator, the possibility of phasing-in the revised amounts is also being considered.  This will allow States with lower national compensation amounts to adhere to the convention without delay.
<P>
<LI>In light of the considerable progress made at its last, fifteenth session, the Committee agreed to make all efforts to finalize its work during the sixteenth session so that a diplomatic conference may be convened to adopt the protocol to amend the Vienna Convention as well as the convention on supplementary funding.  
<P>
<LI>The next (sixteenth) session of the Committee is scheduled for 14 to 18 October 1996.  It will be preceded by open-ended informal consultations from 10 to 11 October. 
<P>
<LI>In July, at the request of the Committee, the Secretariat prepared in consultation with experts a consolidated text of each draft instrument with annotations.  These texts were circulated for review in the capitals prior to the sixteenth session in order to facilitate the preparation by that session of the final texts of the draft protocol and draft supplementary funding convention for submission to the diplomatic conference.
<P>
<LI>Attached to this note are the reports of the Committee on its fourteenth and fifteenth sessions excluding the draft texts for the two instruments under consideration and outstanding proposals and non-papers.  The full reports of these sessions, as well as the Thirteenth session of the Committee are available from the Legal Division of the Agency on request.

         Director General

         International Atomic Energy Agency
<BR>         
         V I E N N A
<P>
Excellency,
<P>
         We have the honour to refer to the International Atomic
         Energy Agency Annual Report for 1995 (Document <A HREF=" http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/inforesource/annual/anrep95/">GC(40)/8</A>).
<P>         
         On page iv, the list of member states of the International
         Atomic Energy Agency includes also "Yugoslavia" as a member
         state.
<P>         
         On page 68, in Annex that shows the situation on 31 December
         1995 with respect to the conclusion of safeguards agreements
         between the Agency and non-nuclear weapon States in
         connection with NPT, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
         and Montenegro) is listed among states which have signed,
         ratified, acceded to or succeeded to NPT, with Date of
         ratification accession or succession on 3 March 1970.
<P>         
         Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, the
         Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Slovenia would
         like to emphasise, that the above mentioned data in The
         Annual Report for 1995, concerning "Yugoslavia" and Federal
         Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), are not
         acceptable.
<P>         
With regard to this issues, once again, we would like
         to recall the relevant resolutions, the United Nations
         Security Council resolution 777(1992) and the General
         Assembly resolution A/47/1 of 1992, stating that the State
         formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of
         Yugoslavia-SFRY has ceased to exist, that the Federal
         Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot
         continue automatically the membership of the former SFRY in
         the United Nations and require that the Federal Republic of
         Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for
         membership in the United Nations.
<P>         
         International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference
         resolution GC(XXXVI)576 of 1992 decided along the same
         lines.
<P>         
         We would also like to recall that the (Badinter)
         Arbitration Commission of the Conference on the Former
         Yugoslavia found in its legal opinion No.8 (1992), that the
         process of dissolution of the SFRY has completed and that
         SFRY no longer existed.
<P>         
         In legal opinion No.9 (1992) it found that the successor
         states to the SFRY must together settle all aspects of the 
         succession by agreement drawing on the principles embodied
         in the 1978 and 1983 Vienna Conventions and general
         international law, taking full account of the principle of
         equality of rights and duties between states in respect of
         international law.
<P>         
         Furthermore, the SFRY's membership in international
         organizations must be terminated according to their statutes
         and none of the successor states may thereupon claim for
         itself alone the membership rights previously enjoyed by the
         former SFRY.
<P>         
         And lastly, in legal opinion No.10 (1992) it found, since
         there was no agreement among the successor states of the
         SFRY as to the succession of the rights and obligations of
         the SFRY, general rules of the international law dealing
         with succession of states with respect to treaties,
         possessions, debts and archives should be applied.

<P>
We should like to request your kind assistance in
         distributing this letter as an official document for the
         forthcoming fortieth regular session of the General
         Conference.
<P>         
         Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of our highest consideration.

<B>TEXT OF LETTER OF 10 SEPTEMBER 1996 FROM THE PERMANENT MISSION OF ALBANIA</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Dear Mr. Director General,
<P>
On behalf of the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Albania, I would like to draw your attention to a document of the IAEA, namely the Agency's Annual Report for 1995 (Document <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/inforesource/annual/anrep95/">GC(40)/8</A>), which has been made available to all the Member States, and which has several references that called for the political attention and consideration of this Mission.
<P>
On page iv of the said document, "Yugoslavia" is included as a Member State of the Agency in the list of all other Member States, when the status of that country is well-known to all Member States of the Agency and the whole international community.
<P>
On page 68, the Annex describing the situation of  the conclusion of safeguards agreements between the Agency and non-nuclear weapon states with regard to the NPT on 31 December 1995, again the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is listed among the states that have signed, ratified, acceded or succeeded to the NPT, the date of ratification, accession or succession being 3 March 1970.
<P>
I would like to recall the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolution 777 (1992) and the General Assembly Resolution A/47/1 of the same year, which state that the "state formerly known as the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has ceased to exist" and that "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former SFRY in the United Nations" and require that "the FRY (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations".
<P>
The Arbitration (Badinter) Commission of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia found in its legal opinion No. 8 (1992) that the "...SFRY no longer existed". The same spirit prevails in legal opinions No. 9 and legal opinion No.10 on the question of succession, which lead to the conclusion that none of the successor states alone may thereupon claim for itself alone the membership rights previously enjoyed by the former SFRY.
<P>
Also, the Agency's General Conference resolution (GC (XXXVI) 576 of 1992 decided along the same lines as the UNSC Res. and the other findings above.
<P>
With all the above in mind, the Republic of Albania wishes to reiterate that the above mentioned data and references as they appear in the Agency's Annual Report for 1995 concerning "Yugoslavia" and the RFY (Serbia and Montenegro) are not acceptable and would like to see rectified.
<P>
I would like to kindly request you to pass this letter to the relevant department which takes care of its distribution as an official document for the upcoming regular session of the General Conference.
<P>
(signed)

<I>The General Conference,</I>
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(a) <I>Recalling</I> its resolutions embodying principles for
the assessment of Members' contributions towards the safeguards
component of the Agency's Regular Budget<A HREF="#note_a">*</A>
and operative paragraph 2 of resolution GC(XXXVI)/RES/589,
<P>
<DD>(b) <I>Having considered</I> the Board's recommendation in
document GC(39)/23 concerning the arrangements for the assessment
of Members' contributions towards the safeguards component of the
Agency's Regular Budget for each of the years 1996 through 2000, 
<P>
<DD>(c) <I>Believing</I> that the arrangements now being approved
for the period 1996 through 2000 should not prejudge whatever may
be decided during that period, and
<P>
<DD>(d) <I>Taking note</I> of the Board's intention to continue
its efforts to arrive at long-term arrangements for the financing
of safeguards,
</DL>
<P>
1. <I>Establishes</I> the following revised arrangements for the
assessment of Members' contributions towards the Agency's Regular
Budget, to be applicable for each of the years 1996 through 2000,
to supplement those contained in resolutions GC(III)/RES/50 and
GC(XXI)/RES/351 and to replace those which it approved by
resolution GC(XXXVI)/RES/589:
<P>
<DL>   
<DD>(a) Each Member's contribution towards the Agency's Regular
Budget shall comprise a non-safeguards component and a safeguards
component, corresponding respectively to that Member's assessment
in respect of:
<P>
<DL> 
<DD>(i) non-safeguards expenses, which shall include all expenses
required to be apportioned among Members in accordance with
Article XIV.D of the Statute except safeguards expenses; and
<P>
<DD>(ii) safeguards expenses, which shall include all expenses
relating to the Agency's safeguards activities.
</DL>
<P> 
<DD>(b) Non-safeguards expenses shall be borne by Members in
proportion to their respective base rates of assessment
calculated by application of the principles set forth in
resolution GC(III)/RES/50, as amended by resolution
GC(XXI)/RES/351.
<P>
<DD>(c) Safeguards expenses, after deduction of such amounts as
are recoverable under agreements relating to safeguards between
the Agency and parties to such agreements that are not Members of
the Agency, shall be borne by Members as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i) each Member included in the list referred to in
sub-paragraph (ii) below shall contribute an amount corresponding
to one half of its base rate of assessment in respect of the
safeguards component of the Regular Budget with the proviso that
no such Member shall be obliged to contribute to any increase in
the safeguards budget beyond zero real growth;
<P>
<DD>(ii) the list (hereinafter referred to as the "shielded"
list), which shall be drawn up by the Director General (and be
kept under review by the Board of Governors), shall comprise the
Members - except the ten Members with the highest base rates of
assessment and those Members which have notified the Director
General that they do not wish to be included - having per capita
net national products of less than one third of the average per
capita net national product of the fifteen Members with the
highest per capita net national products, the per capita net
national products being identified by examination of the
documents used by the Committee on Contributions of the General
Assembly of the United Nations and the "shielded" list being
reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, each time new documents on
per capita net national products are made available by that
Committee;
<P>
<DD>(iii) any Member not included in the "shielded" list shall
contribute on the basis of a scale to be determined for the year
in question by proportionately increasing its base rate of
assessment in such a way that the total contributions of such
Members make up the balance of the safeguards expenses; and
<P>
<DD>(iv) in the case of admission of a new Member of the Agency
which is to be included in the "shielded" list referred to in
sub-paragraph (ii) above, that Member shall contribute in the
year its membership becomes effective in accordance with the
provisions set out in sub- paragraph (i) above.
</DL>
<P> 
<DD>(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph 1(c)(i)
above, the following transitional arrangements shall apply in
order to mitigate the burden of significant increases for Members
having received partial relief under the existing arrangements in
respect of their assessments for the safeguards component of the
Regular Budget<A HREF="#note_b">**</A>.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i) for those Members which remain in the "shielded" list
referred to in sub-paragraph l(c)(ii) above, the contributions
shall be determined as follows:
<P>
In each of the years 1996 through 1999 the contribution of each
Member will be calculated at half of its base rate and then
compared with its contribution for 1995. A portion of the
resulting difference will be incrementally added to the
contribution for 1995, as follows:
<P>
in the first year (1996) - one fifth of the difference,<BR>
in the second year (1997) - two fifths of the difference,<BR>
in the third year (1998) - three fifths of the difference and<BR>
in the fourth year (1999) - four fifths of the difference.
<P>
In the fifth year (2000), each Member included in the "shielded"
list will contribute its full share, i.e. in accordance with half
of its base rate.
<P>
<DD>(ii) for those Members which no longer qualify for inclusion
in the "shielded" list, the contributions shall be determined as
follows:
<P>
In each of the years 1996 through 2004 the contribution of each
Member will be calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph
1(c)(iii) and then compared with its contribution for 1995. A
portion of the resulting difference will be incrementally added
to the contribution for 1995, as follows:
<P>
in the first year (1996) -  one tenth of the difference,<BR>
in the second year (1997) - two tenths of the difference,<BR>
in the third year (1998) - three tenths of the difference,<BR>
in the fourth year (1999) - four tenths of the difference,<BR>
in the fifth year (2000) - five tenths of the difference,<BR>
in the sixth year (2001) - six tenths of the difference,<BR>
in the seventh year (2002) - seven tenths of the difference,<BR>
in the eighth year (2003) - eight tenths of the difference
and<BR>
in the ninth year (2004) - nine tenths of the difference.
<P>
In the tenth year (2005), each of those Members will contribute
its full share in accordance with sub-paragraph l(c)(iii).
 </DL>
<P>
<DD>(e)   These arrangements, applicable for each of the years
1996 through 2000, shall be reviewed by the Board in 2000 at the
latest.
</DL>
<P>
2. <I>Requests</I> the Board, in conducting the review referred
to in sub-paragraph l(e), to include consideration of changes in
the contributions of "shielded" countries, the criteria for
determining contributions, and other relevant issues.

<DD>(a) <I>Appreciating</I> the work done by the Agency in the
area of isotope hydrology in response to resolution
GC(XXXVIII)/RES/9,
<P>
<DD>(b) <I>Recognizing</I> that the quality and quantity of
available water resources, particularly in arid and semi-arid

drinking water directly improves human health and hence
contributes to the optimum utilization of economic resources,
<P>
<DD>(d) <I>Conscious</I> of the proven techno-economic benefits
of using isotope hydrology techniques in water resources
management,
<P>
<DD>(e) <I>Aware</I> that these techniques can be very valuable
in studying processes like groundwater recharge, surface and
sub-surface water interaction, water salination, seepage and the
pollution of water bodies and that their use should be integrated
with conventional techniques, and
<P>
<DD>(f) <I>Noting</I> that the initiatives taken by the Agency to
strengthen the end-user benefits and socio-economic impact of the
utilization of isotope techniques in water resources development
and management in Member States, as mentioned in document

3. <I>Expects</I> that the negotiations for a Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty will be completed and the Treaty signed
in 1996 as may be further specified by the Fiftieth Session of
the United Nations General Assembly, and <I>urges</I> all
participants in the negotiations to further intensify their
efforts to this end;
<P>
4. <I>Affirms</I> that cessation of nuclear testing would
contribute to the successful conclusion of a Comprehensive

<H3>The Financing of Technical Assistance: Technical Assistance to Territories
under the Jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority</H3>
<P>
<I>The General Conference endorsed the following conclusion proposed by the President:</I>
<P>         
"Based on my consultations, I believe that in view of the ongoing peace
process in the Middle East and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority
pursuant to the Cairo Agreement of 4 May 1994 between the PLO and Israel, it is the
wish of the General Conference, as a contribution to the peace process and in line
with actions of other organizations in the UN system and consistent with the afore
mentioned agreement, that the Board of Governors through its Technical Assistance
and Co-operation Committee, identify technical assistance projects that could be
implemented in the territories under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority
through appropriate international organizations."
<P>     
<I>23 September 1994<BR>
Agenda item 19</I>
<HR>
<B>GC(XXXVIII)/DEC/I9 </B>
<H3>Restoration of Technical Assistance to Israel</H3>
<P>
<I>The General Conference endorsed the following statement made by the President:</I>
<P>         
"Over the past few days, I have held extensive consultations with many
delegations. They have revealed a clear preference for a conclusion of this item
through an agreed Presidential Statement.
<P>         
"I have, however, also been made aware of much impatience that
arrangements have not yet been achieved to ensure that the Middle East is free of
nuclear weapons, and I have found unanimous support for a nuclear weapon-free zone
in that region.
<P>         
"It is recognized that, in principle, technical assistance should be available for
the benefit of all Member States, in accordance with the Agency' s Statute. A number
of delegations feel strongly that it would be wrong to try and settle the issue of
technical co-operation with Israel at this time. Others feel equally strongly that
restoring it is warranted at this time. My dominant impression is that the delegates
to this Conference wish to do what they can to accelerate the peace process in the
Middle East and to contribute to the goal of nuclear non-proliferation in the region.
<P>         
"It is therefore my understanding that the Conference is now ready to restore
technical assistance to Israel and looks forward to closer co-operation between the
Agency and Israel in Agency activities in accordance with the Agency's Statute and
objectives. "
<P>

<H3>ANNOUNCEMENTS</H3>

<P><STRONG>GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS</STRONG></P>

<P>The Conference is meeting in the Austria Center Vienna (ACV), Am
Hubertusdamm 6, 1220 Vienna, which is located next to the Vienna
International Centre (VIC). Entry to the ACV is from the
Hubertusdamm. The telephone number is 212 44 00.</P>

<P>The starting times of each meeting will be announced in the
Journal. Delegates are requested to be in their places by those times
to allow meetings to start punctually. Evening meetings will be
announced during the session if they become necessary.</P>

<P>General information about the Conference, such as the location of
meeting rooms and offices, telephone extensions and the various
services, may be obtained at the Information Desk (second floor, No.
11 on the attached floor plan, extension 2141).</P>

<P><STRONG>FORMALITIES ON ARRIVAL</STRONG></P>

<P>Each participant will require a badge with a photograph for entry
into the ACV during the session. Badges will be issued by the staff
at the Registration Desk to those designated participants who are not
in possession of a valid VIC ground pass. Badges issued for the
General Conference will also be valid for entering the VIC.
Participants may register on Friday, 13 September, at the Agency's
Registration Desk in the Rotunda at the VIC between 9 a.m. and 5.30
p.m. and on Sunday, 15 September, between 2 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. on the
ground floor, No. 1, at the ACV. Registration will continue
throughout the week of the Conference's session at the Registration
Desk at the ACV.</P>

<P><STRONG>CREDENTIALS</STRONG></P>

<P>Delegates (but not other members of a delegation) will require
credentials specifically for the session, even if they are already
accredited to the Agency in some other capacity - for example, as
Resident Representative. Credentials have to be delivered in due
time; this helps to avoid difficulties, particularly for the General
Committee. If credentials cannot be submitted by Friday, 13
September, delegates should deliver them direct to the Credentials
Officer at the ACV (second floor, No. 5, extension 2092) either on
Sunday, 15 September, between 2.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. or on the
following Monday morning.</P>

<P><STRONG>SPEAKERS' LIST FOR PLENARY MEETINGS</STRONG></P>

<P>At plenary meetings the President calls upon speakers to each item
in the order in which they have entered their names on a written
list. Delegates wishing to speak to an item are requested to inform
Mr. A. Don&agrave;, on the second floor, No. 7, extension 2133, who
will also have a table in the Plenary Hall near the podium.</P>

<P><STRONG>DELEGATES' LIST</STRONG></P>

<P>The first official list of members of delegations will be issued
on Sunday, 15 September; it will contain information on the
composition of delegations which has been communicated to the
Secretariat before Friday, 13 September. If, during the session,
changes are required in the particulars provided at the time of
registration, delegates are requested to inform the Protocol Office
(second floor, No. 5, extension 2090), in writing, so that the list
of delegation members may be brought up to date.</P>

<P><STRONG>STATEMENTS OF DELEGATES</STRONG></P>

<P>To facilitate interpretation, it would be greatly appreciated if,
as in the past, the texts of statements to be delivered during the
general debate were handed to the Conference Officer in advance. In
order to enable the Conference to make the best possible use of the
time available, delegates are urged to keep the duration of their
oral presentations down to 15 minutes at the most.</P>

<P>Copies of statement texts (in the original language) will, if
delegates so request, be made available to other delegates during the
session.</P>

<P><STRONG>TEXTS OF DELEGATES' STATEMENTS</STRONG></P>

<P>To facilitate the preparation of records of proceedings, it would
be appreciated if delegates intending to provide the Secretariat with
texts of statements would have them typed double-spaced.</P>

<P><STRONG>DOCUMENTS</STRONG></P>

<P>Each delegation will be assigned a special box at the Documents
Station (second floor, No. 8), where all working documents of the
Conference are distributed.</P>

<P>Delegates wishing to submit draft resolutions or other documents
to the Conference during the session are requested to provide the
Conference Secretary, or the most appropriate Committee Secretary,
with the text as early as possible.</P>

<P>A limited amount of typing can be arranged for delegations by
Documents Services (second floor, No. 8).</P>

<P><STRONG>SMOKING</STRONG></P>

<P>Participants are requested not to smoke in the meeting rooms.</P>

<P><STRONG>USE OF RADIO RECEIVERS IN MEETING ROOMS</STRONG></P>

<P>In meeting rooms A, B, C, M, N and O of the ACV, portable radio
receivers will be available, enabling participants to follow the
proceedings in the original language and in the working languages of
the Conference. As these receivers must be serviced between meetings,
participants are requested not to remove them from the meeting rooms.

<B>IDENTIFICATION BADGES</B>
<p>
In the interest of security, conference participants are requested to wear their badges when entering the ACV and for as long as they are in the building.

<P>
<B>DELEGATES' LIST</B>

The first official list of members of delegations was issued on Sunday, 15 September; it contains information on the composition of delegations which had been communicated to the Secretariat before Friday, 13 September.  If, during the session, changes are required in the particulars provided at the time of registration, delegates are requested to inform the Protocol Office (second floor, No. 5, extension 2090), in writing, so that the list of delegation members may be brought up to date.
<P>
<STRONG>SPEAKERS' LIST FOR PLENARY MEETINGS</STRONG>
<p>
At plenary meetings the President calls upon speakers to each item in the order in which they have entered their names on a written list.  Delegates wishing to speak to an item are requested to inform Mr. A. Don, on the second floor, No. 7, extension 2133, who will also have a table in the Plenary Hall near the podium. Delegates of ministerial rank will be given preference.

<P>
Microphones have been placed on all tables. Delegates are requested to use them for voting by roll call, for explanation of vote, for interventions in the exercise of the right of reply and for procedural motions.
<P>
At other times, and especially during the general debate, delegates are requested to deliver their statements from the rostrum. Delegates about to make their statement are asked to come forward to the front when the preceding speaker is making his concluding remarks and wait at the table marked "next speaker".
<p>
<STRONG>STATEMENTS OF DELEGATES</STRONG>
<p>
To facilitate interpretation, it would be greatly appreciated if, as in the past, the texts of statements to be delivered during the general debate were handed to the Conference Officer in advance.  In order to enable the Conference to make the best possible use of the time available, delegates are urged to keep the duration of their oral presentations to a maximum of 15 minutes.
<p>
Copies of statement texts (in the original language) will, if delegates so request, be made available to other delegates during the session.
<p>
<STRONG>TEXTS OF DELEGATES' STATEMENTS</STRONG>
<p>
To facilitate the preparation of records of proceedings, it would be appreciated if delegates intending to provide 
the Secretariat with texts of statements would have them typed double-spaced.
<p>

<p>
Each delegation will be assigned a special box at the Documents Station (second floor, No. 8), where all working documents of the Conference are distributed.
<p>

<p>
In meeting rooms A, B, C, M, N and O of the ACV, portable radio receivers will be available, enabling participants
to follow the proceedings in the original language and in the working languages of the Conference.  As these

rooms.

<p>
<STRONG>STATEMENTS OF DELEGATES</STRONG>
<p>
To facilitate interpretation, it would be greatly appreciated if, as in the past, the texts of statements to be delivered during the general debate were handed to the Conference Officer in advance.

<p>
Copies of statement texts (in the original language) will, if delegates so request, be made available to other delegates during the session.

<STRONG>DOCUMENTS</STRONG>
<p>
Each delegation will be assigned a special box at the Documents Station (second floor, No. 8), where all working documents of the Conference are distributed.

rooms.

<H4><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H4>

The IAEA is authorized under its Statute to establish and administer safeguards designed to verify that nuclear material and other nuclear related items are not used to further any military purpose and to apply safeguards at the request of States, to any of the States activities in the field of atomic energy. It is important to note that the IAEA's safeguards system is distinct from its work in the area of nuclear safety.
<BR><BR>
The IAEA carries out most of its verification activities under agreements made pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to two regional treaties -- the Treaty of Tlatelolco (in Latin America and the Caribbean) and the Rarotonga Treaty (in the South Pacific) -- and to the Guadalajara Declaration (between Argentina and Brazil). These instruments require each State to declare and submit to IAEA safeguards all the nuclear material under its jurisdiction or control (comprehensive safeguards). The IAEA also applies safeguards to nuclear material in the five declared nuclear-weapon States under what are called "voluntary-offer agreements". In some States which are not party to any of the above instruments, the IAEA applies safeguards under agreements which specify, in addition to nuclear material, non-nuclear material (e.g. heavy water, graphite), facilities and equipment to be verified.
<BR><BR>
The application of IAEA safeguards encompasses a set of activities through which the IAEA seeks to verify that a State is not using nuclear material, or nuclear related items to acquire nuclear weapons or other explosive devices. Safeguards verification activities are based principally on the accountancy of nuclear material and include: on-site inspections, independent measurements, regular checks of nuclear material inventories, examination of the State's records and reports, verification of design information, confirmation that there is no unreported production of high enriched uranium or plutonium and verification of the completeness and correctness of the State's declaration. The aim is to ascertain with confidence that no diversion of nuclear material has taken place. The IAEA installs "containment and surveillance" equipment in facilities to verify that no material is removed without notification to the IAEA. Such equipment includes tamperproof seals and video and photographic cameras that monitor preselected areas to detect access.
<BR><BR>
The IAEA's safeguards system has been successful in providing assurance regarding declared nuclear activities, but the revelation of a clandestine nuclear programme in Iraq in 1991 drew world-wide attention to the need to increase the IAEA's capability to detect undeclared nuclear activities.

<H4><A NAME="impl">Safeguards Implementation</A></H4>

At the end of 1994, safeguards agreements were in force with 118 States (and Taiwan, China). Sixty-two of these States (and Taiwan, China) had nuclear activities and were inspected, the majority under comprehensive safeguards agreements arising from the NPT, the Tlatelolco Treaty or the Rarotonga Treaty. The remaining 56 States party to these treaties do not yet engage in nuclear activities calling for inspection. In six States not party to comprehensive safeguards agreements during 1994, the IAEA applied safeguards under bilateral or multilateral safeguards agreements covering specified nuclear or non-nuclear material, facilities or equipment. The IAEA also applied safeguards at facilities in the five nuclear-weapon States.
<BR><BR>
There were 842 nuclear facilities and other locations subject to IAEA safeguards at the end of 1994. Of these, 543 were inspected at least once in 1994. Verification concentrated on activities and locations involving the production, processing or storage of nuclear material from which nuclear weapons could be manufactured. A total of 2349 inspections were carried out, requiring 9152 person-days of inspection, with a staff of 197 inspectors.
<BR><BR>
In 1994, the IAEA's safeguards activities designed to detect diversion of nuclear material were effective, but some implementation difficulties were identified. These difficulties were related to technical problems with certain equipment at facilities, continuing restrictions imposed by some States on inspector designations, and the unavailability of long term/multiple entry visas for designated inspectors in many countries. During the course of 1994, the IAEA took steps to resolve these problems in co-operation with the States concerned.
<BR><BR>
There was also the continuing impact of resource limitations on staff recruitment and on equipment purchase, preventive maintenance and replacement. This was partially alleviated by the extrabudgetary assistance made available to the IAEA. Also, in the area of research and development and implementation support, valuable benefits were drawn from the technical support programmes provided by 16 Member States and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM).

<H4><A NAME="concl">Conclusion</A></H4>

During its safeguards activities in 1994, the IAEA did not find any indication of a diversion of a significant amount of nuclear material, or of the misuse of any facility or equipment or non-nuclear material which had been placed under IAEA safeguards. On the basis of all the information available to the IAEA, it is considered reasonable to conclude that the nuclear material and other items which had been placed under safeguards remained in peaceful use or were otherwise adequately accounted for.
<BR><BR>
In the case of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), questions raised during IAEA inspections in 1992 regarding possible undeclared nuclear activities have not been resolved.

<H4><A NAME="highlights">Highlights</A></H4>

<H5><A NAME="dprk">DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA</A></H5>

In 1992, following the entry into force of the comprehensive safeguards agreement between the IAEA and the DPRK, when the IAEA began its verification of the DPRK's initial declaration, inconsistencies were detected between the technical information provided by the DPRK and the IAEA's findings from chemical and physical analyses. The IAEA sought to resolve those inconsistencies and requested access, under the 
terms of the special inspection provision, to two undeclared installations at the Nyongbyon nuclear complex, which the IAEA had reason to believe were related to nuclear waste. The DPRK refused to grant the IAEA the requested access to these sites and to additional information required for the verification of the completeness and correctness of the DPRK's declaration.
<BR><BR>
In May 1994, the DPRK began discharging irradiated fuel rods from the 5 MW(e) Experimental Nuclear Power Plant without the presence of IAEA inspectors. When an IAEA inspection team arrived, it was not allowed to select and segregate discharged fuel rods for later measurement, which would have provided information on the core history and hence on the completeness and correctness of the DPRK's initial declaration on nuclear material and facilities. The IAEA reported the matter to the United Nations Security Council, and on 30 May the President of the Security Council urged the DPRK to proceed with the discharge operation in accordance with the IAEA's requirements; however, the core discharge continued and the opportunity for later measurement of the fuel was irretrievably lost.
<BR><BR>
In June 1994, the DPRK withdrew from IAEA membership. Notwithstanding this withdrawal, the safeguards agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA continues in force.
<BR><BR>
In October 1994, the United States of America and the DPRK signed an "Agreed Framework", under which a "freeze" was effected at the DPRK's graphite moderated reactors and related facilities. Under the terms of the Agreed Framework, there are to be no operations at the facilities covered by the freeze and no construction work of any kind, at either existing facilities or new, related facilities. On 11 November, the IAEA Board of Governors authorized the IAEA to act upon a Security Council request concerning inspections in the DPRK, including monitoring of the freeze. The activities necessary for such monitoring are within the scope of the safeguards agreement. Although the activities performed have been sufficient to verify the freeze, the IAEA is still unable to conclude that there has been no diversion of nuclear material subject to safeguards in the DPRK. The DPRK has still not complied with its safeguards agreement.

<H5><A NAME="iraq">IRAQ</A></H5>

In 1994, the IAEA's activities in Iraq under the safeguards agreement between Iraq and the IAEA continued to be subsumed under activities pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolutions. The IAEA has maintained a continuous presence of its inspectors in Iraq since August 1994 to carry out the
IAEA's plan for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.

<H5><A NAME="argbra">ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL</A></H5>

In May 1994, the IAEA received the initial declaration on nuclear material and facilities in Argentina and Brazil under their comprehensive safeguards agreement. Verification of the nuclear material as part of the verification of the completeness and correctness of their initial declaration was performed in the majority of the facilities in 1994.

<H5>SOUTH AFRICA</H5>

In 1994, the IAEA continued its efforts to clarify questions about the production of low enriched uranium at South Africa's semi-commercial enrichment plant, as part of the verification of the completeness and correctness of its initial declaration on nuclear material and facilities. As a result it was considered reasonable to conclude that the reported amounts of low enriched uranium produced by the plant were consistent with past plant operations as documented and evaluated.

<H5><A NAME="nic">NEWLY INDEPENDENT STATES</A></H5>

By the end of 1994, three (Armenia, Latvia and Lithuania) of the twelve Newly Independent States (NISs - NISs here denotes those States which belong to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) which regained their independence in 1990 and 1991) which have acceded to the NPT had also concluded safeguards agreements with the IAEA, and inspections to verify the completeness and correctness of their initial declarations on nuclear material and facilities were being carried out. In the other NISs, technical visits were made to most major facilities. Preliminary information regarding nuclear installations, nuclear material, nuclear material accountancy and control systems was obtained.

<H5><A NAME="military">NUCLEAR MATERIAL RELEASED FROM MILITARY PROGRAMMES</A></H5>

Safeguards were applied in the USA under its voluntary-offer agreement with the IAEA on a first quantity of nuclear material released from its military programme in September 1994; by the end of the year, the inventories at two sites in the USA had been verified.

<H4><A NAME="outlook">Outlook</A></H4>

The IAEA safeguards and verification system represents one element of international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This system has evolved over the last 25 years, incorporating continual improvements based on experience, new concepts, advances in technology and the emergence of new safeguards methods and techniques. The system has proved to be reliable in providing assurance about the peaceful use of declared nuclear material, declared facilities and installations.
<BR><BR>
Since 1991, the IAEA has given priority to strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system, a primary objective being to provide assurance of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements. In 1993, these efforts were consolidated under "Programme 93 + 2". Significant progress was made under that programme in 1994 in developing proposals and evaluating their technical, legal and financial implications. These proposals will be considered by the Board of Governors during 1995. Implementation of the improved safeguards system will take place over a period of time.

<H2>IAEA safeguards in the 1990's:  Building from experience</H2>
<P>
<I>A key element of the NPT, the IAEA's verification system will be enhanced to strengthen its efficiency and effectiveness</I>
<P>
<B>by Bruno Pellaud and Richard Hooper</B>
<HR>
<P>
When Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) meet in New York beginning in April 1995 to decide the Treaty's future, one point of focus will be the IAEA's nuclear safeguards and verification system, the world's first on-site international inspectorate.  Among its provisions, the Treaty requires each State Party to conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the State.  
<P>
Since the NPT came into force in 1970, the IAEA has been applying safeguards under "NPT-type" agreements in a growing number of countries.  Today, most of the IAEA's safeguards agreements are of this type, making the outcome of the NPT Review and Extension Conference of major importance to the IAEA and the international community.
<P>
Throughout the 1990's, extensive efforts have been directed at reinforcing elements of the IAEA's safeguards system.  During 1991-93, for example, the IAEA Board of Governors confirmed the right of the Agency to use special inspections; took decisions regarding the early provision and use of design information of facilities under construction or undergoing changes; and endorsed a reporting scheme on imports and exports of nuclear material and exports of specified equipment and non-nuclear material.
<P>
The case of Iraq underscored the importance of following up these initial steps.  During 1992, the IAEA carried out technical studies of specific areas of safeguards application that might be improved, and to identify mechanisms and activities through which improvements could be achieved.  In July 1993, the IAEA launched a programme - known as "Programme 93+2" - to develop a solid proposal for a strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards system.  As intended, the proposal is being submitted to the IAEA Board of Governors in March 1995, in advance of the NPT conference itself.
<P>
This article summarizes major elements of that proposal, while allowing for an overview and an assessment of possible trade-offs and synergies in what should be a comprehensive and integrated approach for strengthening safeguards and improving their cost-effectiveness. Implementation of the overall approach will, of necessity, be incremental over time.
<P>
<H3>Main areas of emphasis</H3>
<P>
Ideas and proposals in "Programme 93+2" are broad in scope and diverse in nature.  They deal with both declared and undeclared nuclear activities.  They include possible new measures for strengthening safeguards; further efficiencies in how current safeguards activities are carried out; and alternative procedures and techniques that may be more effective in carrying out safeguards or that maintain the effectiveness of safeguards but require less effort and lower cost. <A HREF=#footnote_1>*</A>
<P>
Three main areas of reform are tackled:
<P>
<B>Access to information.</B>  Measures already taken in this area in recent years are early provision of design information on declared facilities; greater use of data on nuclear activities that are available publicly, in-house or otherwise; and the reporting scheme on export and import of nuclear material, non-nuclear material, and specified equipment.
<P>
The major new elements contemplated for this area are:
<UL>
<LI>broader information on States' nuclear activities, resulting in greater nuclear transparency; and
<LI> the use of environmental monitoring techniques.
</UL>
<B>Access to sites and the effectiveness of the access.</B>  Measures already taken are the IAEA Board's expressed positions regarding special inspections; and voluntary offers by some governments to accept Agency visits "any time, any place".
<P>
New developments may comprise proposals regarding:
<UL>
<LI>routine access at nuclear-related sites beyond "strategic point";
<LI>expanded right to prompt access on short notice or no notice; and
<LI>"managed access" to sensitive sites under a scheme of expanded access.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Rationalization and administrative streamlining. </B> Measures already taken include the expanded regional use of the IAEA's two safeguards offices in Toronto and Tokyo; the partnership agreement with the Euratom Inspectorate; and the proposal for simplified designation procedures for inspectors.
<P>
Further measures might be:
<UL>
<LI>greater use of unattended, remote readout equipment in lieu of some inspections;
<LI>additional regional safeguards offices to save travel costs  and facilitate short notice/no notice safeguards;
<LI>multiple-entry visas for inspectors;
<LI>expanded capability for inspectors to freely communicate with headquarters;
<LI>retraining of inspectors; and
<LI>joint use of equipment and laboratories by the IAEA and State Systems of Accountancy for and Control (SSAC) of nuclear materials. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Access to information</H3>
<P>
<B>Expanded declaration</B>.  Currently, the State submits a declaration covering only nuclear materials, associated processes (to the extent that process-related information is needed to safeguard the nuclear material), and nuclear facilities containing or expected to contain declared nuclear material within a States's territory or under its jurisdiction or control.  A broader declaration is considered in "Programme 93+2".  This declaration, in combination with certain verification activities, would make a State's nuclear fuel cycle and associated activities more "transparent".  "Transparency" would result from a high level of co-operation between the State and the IAEA.
<P>
A broader or expanded declaration of a State's nuclear activities should provide - in addition to information on all nuclear material - information on all other nuclear and nuclear-related activities of the State.  This information would include a description and the location of all nuclear-related processes; production; research and development; and training.  In addition, the industrial, commercial, and military installations in close proximity to nuclear installations would be identified in the expanded declaration.  Within the scope of "Programme 93+2", a model expanded declaration is evolving in the course of field trials being hosted by a number of States.
<P>
<B>Information sources.</B>  Effective verification depends on the availability of reliable information about nuclear activities in the countries being inspected.  Information could come from IAEA databases and from open sources, e.g. media reports and scientific publications. Internal sources comprise safeguards inspection data; information received on imports and exports of nuclear material and exports of specified equipment and non-nuclear material; and the expanded declaration referred to above.  Regarding open sources, the IAEA has established a computerized system for storage and retrieval of safeguards-relevant information.  The system incorporates selected information from existing IAEA databases on power reactors, research reactors, and nuclear fuel cycle facilities.  It also contains a broad spectrum of information on States' nuclear regulations, energy requirements, production and resources, nuclear and nuclear-related programmes, international co-operation, and companies, firms, and organizations working in the nuclear field.  The system also considers public commercial information on nuclear material, technologies, facilities, and equipment, including dual-use items. 
<P>
<B>Environmental monitoring.</B>  Environmental monitoring techniques could crucially enhance the IAEA's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities.  Therefore, "Programme 93+2" devotes much attention to this promising avenue.  Through field trials in 11 countries (among those having invited the IAEA for that purpose) during 1993-94, substantive progress has been made in:
<UL>
<LI>evaluating the practicality, effectiveness, and cost of the use of environmental monitoring under a range of representative conditions;
<LI>establishing and documenting environmental signatures associated with a variety of nuclear activities (with an emphasis on uranium enrichment, reactor, and reprocessing operations) at both long and short range;
<LI>establishing and documenting sample collection and analytical procedures and quality control requirements; and 
<LI>establishing a "clean room" sample handling and screening capability at the IAEA's Seibersdorf Laboratories <A HREF=#footnote_2>*</A>; extending the existing network of analytical laboratories to include the capabilities for the analysis of environmental samples; and establishing certification requirements for laboratories added to the network. 
</UL>
<P>
Any production or manufacturing process loses some small fraction of the process materials to the immediate environment.  The extent of the losses depends on a wide variety of things including the nature of the process, the material, the control measure to limit losses, and the migration of losses beyond the immediate environment.  The processing of nuclear materials is no exception, and even though losses are limited to a level well below that of health and environmental concerns, they inevitably occur.  Still, nuclear materials have specific physical properties (e.g., radioactivity) that make it possible to detect and characterize extremely small quantities.  This capability - together with the possibility that specific signatures can be unambiguously correlated with specific nuclear processes - is why environmental monitoring is seen as having promise with respect to the detection of undeclared activities.  The goal of the environmental monitoring field trials is to demonstrate and, where possible, calibrate the utilization of these methods for safeguards application.
<P>
Typical sample media are swipe samples from inside and outside buildings, vegetation and soil samples, and hydrological samples (grab water, high-volume water, sediments, and biota).  In field trials under "Programme 93+2", the emphasis was on short-range monitoring; that is, most samples were collected in the immediate vicinity of nuclear facilities.  Currently planned field trails do not foresee the collection and evaluation of high-volume air samples of the sampling for gaseous effluents.
<P>
As part of the field trials, a sample distribution and reporting protocol has been developed to protect the identity of the samples.  All samples distributed to the expanded network of laboratories are coded in a way that does not permit tracing of the original sampling point. The samples from the field trials carried out so far have been distributed to specialized laboratories in several IAEA Member States, including Australia, Canada, Finland, Hungary, the Russian Federation, United Kingdom, and United States.  IAEA Member States hosting environmental monitoring field trials have been invited to participate in the analysis of parallel samples.
<P>
The results for some field trials have been reviewed with representatives of the respective Member States.  Some findings can be reported here:
<P>
<B>Field trial in Sweden.</B>  In mid-September 1993, water, sediment, and biota samples were collected in Sweden's coastal waters in the vicinity of five nuclear facilities.  A total of 30 locations were selected for sampling.  The sampling locations were chosen to extend from the outfall of each facility to 20-30 kilometers in each direction along the coast.  Results from the trial showed that the nuclear operations in this coastal area can be detected in water and sediment samples up to 20 kilometers from the facility depending on local transport and mixing conditions.  Nuclear reactor operations could be detected by the presence of activation products.  A minute quantity of plutonium (~10-15 grams/liter) isolated from a high-volume water sample taken near a research facility showed high burn-up isotopes consistent with spent fuel characterization studies being conducted there.  Sediments from other locations showed only fallout plutonium and were clearly distinct form those collected in the vicinity of the facility.
<P>
<B>Field trial in South Africa.</B>  In early 1994, an extensive environmental sampling field trial was carried out a the Pelindaba site in South Africa.  During this trial, soil, vegetation, and hydrological samples were collected in and near the facilities.  Swipe samples were taken inside and outside the main process buildings of the shut-down prototype enrichment facility (which earlier produced highly enriched uranium), from the semi-commercial low enrichment facility, and from related process buildings.  The various types of vegetation collected showed, at very low levels, evidence of uranium enrichment activities.  The swipe samples gave clear signatures of the uranium enrichment processes and enrichment levels.  In particular, the results obtained on small particles showed comparable distributions in uranium- 235 enrichments in samples from the process area, auxiliary rooms, and outside the buildings.
<P>
<B>Field trial in Australia.</B>  In April 1994, environmental samples were collected at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization's Lucas Heights Research Laboratories in Australia as part of a field trial.  Swipes taken in laboratories related to the production of the radioisotope molybdenum-99 gave clear indications of the different target materials used and of the relating irradiation products.  Swipes from laboratories involved in metallurgical worked showed uranium-235 signatures of the different types of source materials processed.  Swipes collected in a building that housed R&D installations for centrifuge enrichment dismantled 14 years ago clearly revealed the presence of such activities.
<P>
<B>Field trial in Argentina.</B>  Results are available for swipe and vegetation samples taken in May 1994 during a sampling field trial in and around the Pilcaniyeu enrichment plant in Argentina.  During this field trial, the following samples were taken: soil and vegetation samples from a river up- and downstream of the facility; and swipes in five location inside process and general purpose buildings.  Results from particle analyses on swipes, vegetation, and soil samples clearly showed the presence of depleted, natural, and low-enriched uranium consistent with the operation of the facility.
<P>
The findings based on these results are consistent with the activities declared by the States for these facilities.  The results from environmental monitoring field trials show that these techniques constitute a powerful tool to confirm declared activities or to detect the presence of undeclared nuclear activities.  It should be noted that the sampling methods have proven effective in preventing cross-contamination of the samples.  Furthermore, the analytical techniques available in the expanded network of laboratories have demonstrated their capability to carry  out extremely low-level radiochemical and isotopic measurements.  Data reported by laboratories from the analysis of splits from the same samples are consistent and the results from "bulk" or whole analyses of samples are also consistent with the particle results from the same samples.  The consistency between the results from "bulk" sample analyses and the more detailed particle analyses is important.  It indicates that 'bulk" analyses can be effectively used to screen samples before committing to the more detailed and expensive particle level analysis. 
<P>
<B>Proliferation critical path and associated rules.</B>  As more information becomes available for systematic analysis, the IAEA should be in the position to find out at an early stage any instance in which the State's nuclear activities become inconsistent with the State's declaration.  With expert assistance from several of its Member States, the IAEA is developing a proliferation critical path - which is designed to include all known pathways for the production of weapons-usable material and subsequent weaponization - to structure both the requirements for information and for analysis.  The path can be represented graphically as a series of increasingly specific and detailed levels of all processes for the production of weapons-usable material and weaponization.  The first and top level contains the main steps, e.g., enrichment, reprocessing, etc.  Each block in this level is broken down into more specific routes or processes.  For example, the enrichment block is broken down into nine possible processes (gas centrifuge, electromagnetic, aerodynamic, gaseous diffusion, molecular laser, atomic vapour laser, plasma separation, chemical exchange, and ion exchange), which form in this case the second level of the proliferation critical path model.
<P>
Each process is then characterized by indicators which would be associated with the existence or development of the process, such as specialized equipment, dual-use equipment, nuclear and non-nuclear materials, training, and environmental signatures.  These indicators represent the third level of the proliferation critical path.  As an example, some of the indicators related to gaseous diffusion enrichment would be diffusion barriers, gas blowers, uranium hexafluoride, chlorine trifluoride, fluorinated compounds and heat releases in the environment, and large power lines.  The weaponization-related activities, which appear in the top level, comprise such processes as the production of tritium, enriched lithium and alpha-emitting radionuclides, and the procurement of high technology equipment such as X-ray flash photography.
<P>
With the help of experts, the proliferation critical path is being formulated as logically connected "if-then" rules.  The primary purpose of this formulation is to recognize and place information (e.g., export data)  in the appropriate place(s) of the critical path structure.  The critical path takes into account the possibility that any of the pathways to weaponization might be shortened through external procurement (e.g., procurement of source material, uranium hexafluoride (UF6), enriched uranium, etc.).
<P>
<H3>Access to sites</H3>
<P>
Inspector access has been a key  issue since the beginning of safeguards.  For routine inspections under a comprehensive safeguards agreement, access is provided to specific points (called "strategic points") deemed necessary to enable the IAEA to meet its safeguards obligations related to material accountancy.  Wider access is a key for a strengthened safeguards system.  It would represent an improvement over the current practice with respect to increased assurance regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear activities.  
<P> 
Increased physical access is being assessed in the field trails to a number of different types of locations.  Firstly, there is access beyond the "strategic points" in safeguarded facilities to any location on the facility site.  Secondly, there is access to locations included in the expanded declaration which do not contain nuclear material, or contain only small amounts exempted from safeguards, but which contain or have contained nuclear-related activities. These first two types of locations include all nuclear and nuclear-related locations identified in the expanded declaration.  Thirdly, as an important contribution to increased co- operation and transparency, the State would seek to facilitate access to other locations on the expanded declaration, i.e. industrial, commercial, or military installations in the immediate vicinity of nuclear installations.  Finally, there is access to locations other than those identified in the expanded declaration; the request for access would be prompted by specific information or by the need to implement a technical measure, e.g. environmental monitoring.
<P>
A concept somewhat similar to that of "managed access" in the Chemical Weapons Convention is also being tested.  This would allow IAEA access to sensitive locations while recognizing the State's right to protect sensitive information.  Measures such as shrouding of equipment, dials, and electronic systems are included.
<P> 
For effectiveness, this broader access being investigated in the field trials should to the extent possible be without prior notice to the State.  "No notice" is taken to mean no advance notification regarding the timing, activities, or locations of an inspection.  In practice this means that the State is informed of the IAEA's intention to perform such an inspection when its inspector arrives at the entrance to the site in question.  A requirement for the effective implementation of such no-notice inspections is that States require no visas, or grant multiple- entry visas, for IAEA inspectors while on inspections.
<P>
An issue closely related to the "notice" is the time taken, from arrival at the site, to get to the specific location to be inspected.  In most circumstances this time period is not critical. There are some circumstances, however, in which the IAEA may need to reach a location quickly in order to meet its objectives.  In testing the procedures for these circumstances, a maximum time of two hours was used as a target in most trials.
<P>
<H3>Rational use of resources</H3> 
<P>
<B>Cost analysis of present safeguards.</B>  "Programme 93+2" includes an assessment of the costs of implementing safeguards as a function of the magnitude of the technical safeguards parameters (timeliness, significant quantities or SQ, and probabilities of detection).  The specific implementation costs associated with current values of these parameters and the cost sensitivity to changes in the values have been determined.  A reasonable range in the value of each parameter has been defined for this cost assessment.  In parallel to these studies, the technical cases are being considered for changes in these parameters, e.g., for changing the timeliness goal for metallic plutonium/highly enriched uranium and for changing the conversion time/timeliness goal for depleted, natural, and low- enriched uranium.  The financial aspects, as well as the inherent technical merits, are being addressed.
<P>
<B>Potential cost savings.</B>  The programme also deals with the identification and evaluation of a number of technical and administrative measures that have the potential to reduce costs associated with the current implementation of safeguards.  
<P>
Major cost sectors associated with the implementation of safeguards, and thus the areas targeted for potential cost savings, are staff, equipment, and travel.  As the number of facilities and the quantities of nuclear material under IAEA safeguards continue to increase, reduction in trained staff is not realistic.  However, more efficient use of staff and travel resources may be achieved through use of modern technology, through economies in the way safeguards operation are carried out, by enlarging existing field offices or establishing new ones, and through efficient use of office automation equipment.  Cost savings in the equipment sector may be achieved through greater standardization and by sharing with the operator the use and costs of equipment and analytical services.  Two examples may be illustrative:
<P>
<B>Equipment in unattended mode.</B>  The use of advanced technology, assay, and monitoring equipment that can be operated in an unattended mode offers the possibility of reducing the physical presence of inspectors in facilities.  As a result, reductions can be realized in terms of inspection effort; the radiation exposure of inspectors; and the level of intrusiveness of inspections in the daily routine of the operator.  Examples of such cases include the use of bundle counters, core discharge monitors, video surveillance, a system known as Consulha (Containment and Surveillance for La Hague), and non-destructive measurements at mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facilities.  Other cases where similar measures might be applied include the verification of inter-bay transfers of spent fuel in on- load reactors; verification of transfers of spent fuel to dry-storage canisters; verification of receipts, storage, and shipments of nuclear material at MOX fuel fabrication facilities; verification of feed to and production form enrichment plants; and tank monitoring and sampling at reprocessing plants.
<P>
<B>Mail-in of data.</B>  Safeguards criteria presently require periodic verification of inventories of safeguarded nuclear material.  In the majority of cases, the nuclear material, e.g. spent fuel, is kept under containment and surveillance.  Routine inspections for timeliness are made to service the surveillance equipment; replace/verify seals; or retrieve non-destructive data collected over a period of time.  Transmission of the safeguards data through mail-in by the SSAC/operator, or by remote transmission, offers possible reduction in the number of interim inspections and, hence, savings in inspection effort.
<P>
In 1992-93, the IAEA, though established safeguards support programmes of Finland, Hungary, Sweden, successfully conducted field tests for SSAC mailing of surveillance video tapes to the IAEA for review and evaluation.  In principle, this measure could be applied in all situations where Agency cameras are installed.  Alternatively, the data could be retrieved electronically through remote transmission.  In both cases, new equipment is required to protect data during transmission.  Remote transmission is the preferred means for transfer of data between facilities and the IAEA or its field offices wherever, inter alia, modern telephone communication systems exist.  Where this is not the case, the mail-in method can be used on an interim basis.
<P>
<B>Increased co-operation with State Systems.</B>  Co-operation between an SSAC and the IAEA is a necessary condition for achieving effective safeguards implementation. Traditionally, the SSAC's role in such co-operation has mostly been limited to the provision of information required under the safeguards agreement with regard to inventories of nuclear material and their changes, the securing of access to facilities and to nuclear material, and the establishment of an accountancy system at facility and State levels.
<P>
As previously noted, a high level of co-operation between the SSAC and the IAEA will be needed to facilitate the measures implied by increased access and transparency.  This co- operation could also permit reductions in the costs for safeguarding declared nuclear material, even though the IAEA would need to maintain its own ability to draw independent conclusions.  The experience gained in developing the New Partnership Approach with Euratom has been useful in this regard. <A HREF=chitumbo.html>(Click to see related article)</A>  A model pattern of increased co-operation has been derived by identifying all candidate activities which an SSAC could perform, either by itself or jointly with the IAEA, in order to increase the efficiency of IAEA verification activities, and hence to reduce the IAEA's costs or the extent of its activities.  These candidate activities are largely, but not entirely, related to inspections.
<P>
Finally, the issue of regional systems for accounting and control is being addressed.  This includes the examination of criteria that could characterize a regional system in the context of increased co-operation and from which the international community could derive non- proliferation assurance.  On this basis, guidelines are being developed for assessing the degree to which any particular system possess these features.  The features being considered include the existence of a binding non-proliferation agreement between the States concerned; the technical effectiveness of the relevant system; the number of States in the system; the independence of the States within the system; the independence and transparency of the system; and the legal powers of the system.  
<P>
<B>Cost savings in traditional safeguards activities.</B>  If an increased assurance about the absence of undeclared activities were to be achieved through some strengthening measures, would it not be possible for elements of the present safeguards system (e.g. timeliness inspections for irradiated fuel) to be done differently, less often, or not at all?  The cost savings and impact on effectiveness of such approaches indeed deserve serious consideration, since such savings could possibly absorb the cost of the strengthening measures.
<P>
Approaches are being designed to be equally applicable in all States with comprehensive safeguards agreements, in terms of generic facility types or broad categories of nuclear material.  Approaches are being tested in various field trials at light water reactors, fuel fabrication plants, irradiated fuel storage facilities, and research reactors which address more cost-effective safeguards on declared material and assurance regarding undeclared activities. The activities and effort required to achieve the same level of assurance regarding undeclared nuclear activities may vary among States due to, for example, differences in their programmes.
<P>
<H3>Implementing the next steps</H3>
<P>
The findings of investigations carried out under "Programme 93+2" are being reported to the IAEA Board of Governors in March 1995.  The report will combine into an integrated whole the strengths of the present system and the enhancements brought by new techniques, new information gathering, and new administrative measures.  It will further address the technical, legal, and financial implications.
<P> 
In this context, it is important to keep in mind that the fundamental legal document of NPT verification [INFCIRC/153 (Corrected)] was drafted in such a way as to leave to the IAEA Inspectorate many of the details of safeguards implementation.  To that extent, the drafters intentionally built into the related agreements a certain flexibility of interpretation. Accordingly, many measures thus far identified under the programme may be interpreted as falling within the IAEA's existing authority.  Such should be the case, for example, with the implementation of short-range environmental monitoring in the vicinity of locations declared by the State as containing nuclear material and nuclear activities, as well as with most of the cost-reduction measures outlined here.

In carrying out the safeguards obligations of the Agency in 1994, the Secretariat did not find any    
indication of the diversion of a significant amount of nuclear material for the manufacture of any nuclear    
weapon, of for any other military purpose, of for the manufacture of any other nuclear explosive device or    
for purposes unknown. Nor did the Secretariat find any evidence of misuse of safeguarded  facilities,    
equipment or non-nuclear material. On the basis of all the information available to the Agency, it is    
considered reasonable to conclude that the nuclear material and other items which had been placed under    
Agency safeguards remained in peaceful nuclear activities or were otherwise adequately accounted for. <A    
NAME=1 HREF="#1"><I><U><tt><FONT SIZE= 4><B>1</B></FONT></tt></U></i></A>   
<P>   
Although the Agency is progressively strengthening its ability to detect any nuclear material or facilities    
which have not been declared to the Agency and placed under safeguards, it is not possible to draw    
conclusions regarding the absence of undeclared material and facilities with the level of confidence that is    
attainable for nuclear material and facilities which were placed under safeguards.   
<P>   
With respect to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the questions raised in 1992,    
regarding the correctness and completeness of its initial declaration, have not been resolved. In October    
1994, the United States of America and the DPRK signed an "Agreed Framework" providing for -- inter    
alia -- a "freeze" at the DPRK's graphite moderated reactors and related facilities. In November 1994, the    
Board of Governors authorized the Agency to act upon a United Nations Security Council request    
(contained in the 4 November 1994 Statement of the President of the Security Council) regarding    
inspection activities in the DPRK. At the end of November 1994, the Agency resumed inspection activities    
to continue implementation of safeguards in the DPRK, including measures required for monitoring the    
freeze. However, the DPRK is still not co-operating with the Agency to verify the correctness and    
completeness of its initial declaration. As a result, the Agency is still unable to conclude that there has    
been no diversion of nuclear material, and the DPRK remains in non-compliance with its safeguards    
agreement.

<P>   
As of 31 December 1994, 199 safeguards agreements were in force with 118 States (and with Taiwan,    
China), compared to 194 agreements with 116 States (and with Taiwan, China) at the end of 1993.     
<P>   
Safeguards agreements pursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons   
(NPT) entered into force with Armenia in May and with Zambia in September. The quadripartite    
safeguards agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and   
Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) and the Agency entered into force in March 1994. A unilateral    
submission agreement with India for the application of safeguards to all nuclear material   
previously subject to Agency safeguards under the expired trilateral safeguards agreement between India,    
the USA and the Agency (INFCIRC/154) entered into force in March 1994, and an amendment thereto in    
September covering nuclear material supplied by any State to India for use in the Tarapur Atomic Power    
Station. A project agreement with Colombia covering the supply of enriched uranium entered into force in    
June and a project agreement with Ghana covering the supply of a research reactor and enriched uranium    
entered into force in October.   
<P>   
The Board of Governors approved draft safeguards agreements pursuant to NPT with Belarus, Croatia,    
Dominica, Kazakhstan, St. Kitts and Nevis, Slovenia and Uzbekistan. It also approved a comprehensive    
safeguards agreement with Ukraine covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities. None    
of these agreements had entered into force at the end of 1994. In addition, there were 14 agreements    
pursuant to NPT or NPT and the Treaty of Tlatelolco, one agreement pursuant to Additional Protocol I to    
the Treaty of Tlatelolco and one project agreement, all of which had previously been approved by the    
Board of Governors but none of which had entered into force at the end of 1994.   
<P>   
At the end of 1994, there were still five States of the former USSR which the Agency believes to have    
significant nuclear activities but without any safeguards agreement in force.     
<P>   
At the end of 1994, safeguards were applied in 48 States under agreements pursuant to NPT or to NPT    
and the Treaty of Tlatelolco, in 1 State under an agreement pursuant to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, in 2   
States pursuant to a comprehensive safeguards agreement and in 7 States under INFCIRC/66/Rev.2-type    
agreements. Safeguards activities pursuant to NPT in Iraq continued to be subsumed under activities    
pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 687. The Agency also applies safeguards to    
nuclear installations in Taiwan, China.     
<P>   
Voluntary-offer agreements were in force with the five nuclear-weapon States and safeguards were applied    
pursuant to these agreements at designated facilities in all nuclear-weapon States. Safeguards activities in    
nuclear-weapon States also continued where other obligations existed, e.g. INFCIRC/66/Rev.2-type     
agreements.   
<P>   
Each State that concludes a safeguards agreement with the Agency pursuant to the NPT undertakes   
to accept safeguards, in accordance with the guidelines for safeguards agreements contained in document    
INFCIRC/153 (Corrected), on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities    
within the territory of the State, under its jurisdiction or carried out under its control anywhere.   
Safeguards agreements based on INFCIRC/66/Rev.2 require that safeguards be applied to the nuclear    
material, facilities, equipment and non-nuclear material  and with regard to certain technological    
information  specified in them. In the case of nuclear-weapon States, safeguards agreements do not    
provide for safeguards on all nuclear material, and these States have unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.    
<P>   
As of 31 December 1994, safeguards agreements were in force with 102 States pursuant to NPT. For 61    
non-nuclear-weapon States party to NPT there is still no safeguards agreement in force required in    
accordance with Article III.4 of the Treaty. As far as the Agency is aware, six of these States have    
significant nuclear activities. Safeguards were being applied in one State pursuant to another safeguards   
agreement, and preparatory work for the application of safeguards is under way in the other five States.    
<P>   
NPT safeguards agreements are in force with all 11 signatories of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone    
Treaty (Rarotonga Treaty); safeguards were applied in one of these States pursuant to such an agreement.    
<P>   
Twenty of the 29 States party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco have concluded safeguards agreements with the    
Agency pursuant to that Treaty and at the end of 1994 safeguards agreements pursuant to the Treaty of    
Tlatelolco were in force with 18 States. Safeguards agreements pursuant to Additional Protocol I of the    
Treaty of Tlatelolco are in force with two States with territories in the zone of application of the Treaty,    
and a similar agreement with a third such State has been approved by the Board of Governors, but has not    
yet entered into force. Negotiation of a safeguards agreement between Chile and the Agency pursuant to    
the Treaty has entered into its final stage. In addition, the Secretariat has taken the view that the    
safeguards agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the ABACC and the Agency (INFCIRC/435) is    
compatible with the Treaty of Tlatelolco.   
<P>   
As a result of the revelations regarding the existence of a clandestine nuclear weapons programme in Iraq    
and various developments elsewhere, Member States of the Agency are strongly supportive of a    
strengthened safeguards regime that inter alia is better equipped to provide assurance regarding both the    
correctness and the completeness of a State's nuclear programme declaration. In April 1993, the Standing    
Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation (SAGSI), acting on a request by the Director General,    
submitted its recommendations for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system.    
Drawing on SAGSI's recommendations and other proposals, the Agency embarked on a major    
development programme (Programme '93+2') for a more cost effective system. The programme   
proceeded with the direct involvement of a number of Member States in testing the proposed measures.   
<P>   
Two meetings held in 1994 provided the opportunity for exchanges of information on recent developments    
in safeguards: a seminar on the current and future safeguards role of the Agency was held in January and    
a symposium on international nuclear safeguards was held in March.    
<P>   
Extensive discussions took place during 1994 with a view to finding remedies to the problem of    
trafficking in nuclear materials. The General Conference adopted a resolution calling upon Member States    
to take all necessary measures to prevent trafficking in nuclear material and inviting the Director General    
to intensify the Agency's activities and to prepare proposals for additional activities. In November a    
meeting of governmental experts was held. While confirming that the primary responsibility for    
preventing and responding to trafficking rests with the governments concerned, the meeting urged that    
practical and effective additional measures be taken at the international level  particularly by and through    
the Agency. Proposals were submitted to the Board of Governors in December aimed at intensifying the    
Agency's activities, particularly in assistance with physical protection measures, improving State systems    
of accounting and control, and developing a reliable database of information on incidents of trafficking to    
assist governments of Member States and to better inform the public.   
<P>   
Owing to the 10% cut in the financial plan for 1994, there were delays in filling a number of vacant posts.    
The shortfall in funds also meant that the ability to co-ordinate the implementation of new safeguards    
equipment was adversely affected. Inspections in nuclear-weapon States under voluntary-offer agreements    
remained at a minimum. On the other hand, the release of deferred funds and the provision by several    
States of extrabudgetary resources for equipment procurement helped to alleviate the equipment shortages.   
<P>   
<B><A NAME="A1.220">Events in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea</B></A>   
<P>   
In January 1994, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) indicated its readiness to accept    
inspection of declared nuclear material and installations required to provide the continuity of safeguards.    
A detailed list of inspection activities was agreed upon with the Agency on 15 February.   
<P>   
Following these discussions with the DPRK, an inspection was carried out in March to provide a   
continuity of knowledge at the declared facilities. However, at one of the seven declared facilities, a    
reprocessing plant known as the Radiochemical Laboratory, Agency inspectors were denied access to   
perform certain required and agreed safeguards activities. On 21 March this was reported to the Board of    
Governors, which adopted a resolution which, inter alia, called upon the DPRK immediately to   
allow the Agency to complete all requested inspection activities and requested the Director General to    
transmit the resolution to the Security Council. On 31 March, the President of the United Nations Security    
Council called upon the DPRK to enable Agency inspectors to complete the inspection activities    
outstanding since March.   
<P>   
The DPRK started the discharge of spent fuel from the reactor core of the experimental nuclear power    
plant at Nyongbyon on 9 May without the presence of Agency inspectors. The Agency confirmed to the    
DPRK that the discharge of fuel without the required safeguards measures related to the selection,    
segregation and securing of certain fuel rods would constitute a serious violation of the DPRK's safeguards    
agreement and requested that arrangements be made promptly for the necessary safeguards measures   
and urged that, until these were in place, further discharge should be deferred. The DPRK declined to    
accede to this request but nevertheless agreed to receive Agency officials to discuss the issue. However,    
although an Agency team had extensive discussions with DPRK officials from 25 to 27 May in an attempt    
to reach agreement about how to proceed with the implementation of the safeguards measures required, no    
agreement was reached. The Agency concluded that if  the discharge of fuel from the reactor were to   
continue at the same pace as it had proceeded up until the time of the Agency teams visit, the opportunity    
to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements in accordance with Agency standards    
would be lost  within days.   
<P>   
On 30 May, the President of the Security Council stated, inter alia, that the Council strongly   
urges the DPRK only to proceed with the discharge operation at the 5 MW(e) reactor in a manner which    
preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements, in accordance with the Agency's   
requirements in this regard and that the Council calls for immediate consultations between the Agency    
and the DPRK on the necessary technical measures. In response to this statement, the Agency put forward    
three viable options but, despite such efforts, the core discharge was irreversible and seriously eroded the   
Agency's ability to undertake further measures crucial to its ability to ascertain whether all the plutonium    
produced in the DPRK had been declared to the Agency. In a further resolution on 10 June, the Board of    
Governors found that the DPRK was continuing to widen its non-compliance with its safeguards    
agreement, decided, in conformity with the provisions of Article XII.C of the Agency's Statute, to suspend    
non-medical Agency assistance to the DPRK and asked the Director General to transmit the resolution to    
all Members of the Agency, to the Security Council and to the United Nations General Assembly.    
<P>   
On 15 June, the USA, in its capacity as depositary of the Statute, notified the Agency that the DPRK had   
decided to withdraw from Agency membership. This withdrawal did not affect the validity of the    
safeguards agreement between the DPRK and the Agency, which remains in force.    
<P>   
Bilateral talks between the DPRK and the USA culminated in an Agreed Framework signed in Geneva   
on 21 October. This document envisages specific functions for the Agency, notably to monitor a freeze on    
the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities, to continue with verification activities at    
facilities not covered by the freeze and to take measures to verify the accuracy and completeness of the    
DPRKs initial report on all nuclear material in the DPRK. A statement of 4 November by the President of    
the Security Council requested the Agency to take all steps necessary as a consequence of the Agreed    
Framework to monitor the freeze and requested the Agency to continue to report to it on the     
implementation of the safeguards agreement until the DPRK has come into full compliance with that    
agreement.   
<P>   
On 11 November the Board of Governors authorized the Agency to act upon the Security Council's request   
concerning inspections in the DPRK, including monitoring of the freeze. The activities required are part    
of activities which the Agency may perform while implementing safeguards agreements. Later in    
November, an Agency technical team visited the DPRK to explain the verification measures required.   
<P>   
The Agency's understanding of the freeze is that there will be no operations at the facilities covered by the    
freeze and no construction work of any kind, at either existing facilities or new, related facilities. The   
facilities covered by the freeze are the Nyongbyon 5 MW(e) Experimental Nuclear Power Plant, the    
Nyongbyon Nuclear Fuel Rod Fabrication Plant, the Radiochemical Laboratory of the Institute of    
Radiochemistry of Nyongbyon, the Nyongbyon 50 MW(e) Nuclear Power Plant (under construction) and    
the Taechon 200 MW(e) Nuclear Power Plant (under construction). The Agency team visited the facilities   
subject to the freeze and was able to confirm that they were not in operation and that construction work    
had stopped.    
<P>   
The November discussions were constructive and arrangements were made to enable the Agency to meet    
most of its objectives. Further technical discussions with DPRK representatives were necessary regarding    
a few areas. Notwithstanding a continuing difference of view between the Agency and the DPRK as to the    
current status of the safeguards agreement, the DPRK has responded positively towards a number of   
safeguards measures that the Agency needs to perform to continue implementation of safeguards in the    
DPRK, including measures required for monitoring the freeze. Other issues remain open.    
<P>   
<B><A NAME="A1.221">Activities in Iraq under United Nations Security Council resolutions</B></A>   
<P>   
In 1994, the Agency's safeguards activities in Iraq pursuant to the safeguards agreement between Iraq and    
the Agency (INFCIRC/172) continued to be subsumed under activities pursuant to United Nations    
Security Council resolutions calling for activities beyond those specified in that agreement. The Agency,    
which carried out five inspection missions to Iraq in 1994, continued to perform activities relating to the    
destruction, removal and rendering harmless of items pursuant to resolution 687 (1991). The removal of   
spent fuel from Iraq under a contract with the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy was completed; the    
second and last shipment of 96 fuel assemblies out of Iraq, for processing and storage in the Russian    
Federation, was carried out in February. In accordance with its obligations under Security Council    
Resolution 715 (1991), with regard to ongoing monitoring and verification activities, the Agency has    
maintained a continuous presence of its inspectors in Iraq since August 1994. Office space and technical    
support (communications, transportation, interpretation and medical services) have been obtained in    
Baghdad, at the Monitoring and Verification Center which has been established by the United Nations    
Special Commission in consultation with the Agency. With the continuous presence of Agency inspectors    
in Iraq, the elements of the Agency's plan for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's    
compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions are in place and operational.

Steps were taken to arrange for the introduction of new or modified safeguards approaches in order to    
increase the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards activities. For example:    
<UL>   
<LI>Further substantial progress was achieved in implementing with EURATOM more cost effective    
safeguards in the ten non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union. The new partnership approach    
(NPA) was rapidly replacing the previous observation and joint team arrangements, allowing both the    
Agency and EURATOM to meet their respective responsibilities more effectively and efficiently. Practical   
arrangements were agreed upon for most facilities, including 40 LWRs not using mixed oxide(MOX) fuel    
and six which did use such fuel, low enriched fuel fabrication plants and various storage facilities.    
Implementation of the NPA, coupled with the shutdown of two large facilities, has led to a substantial    
decrease in Agency inspection effort in the States concerned. The savings in inspection effort has allowed    
the Secretariat to direct resources to the requirements in the newly independent States of the former     
USSR. The cost effective measures which had been developed under the NPA were tested in the field trials    
of Programme 93+2 and the results will be reflected in the proposals for a strengthened and more cost    
effective safeguards system. 	   
<LI>Dual containment and surveillance (C/S) systems were approved for use at three facilities.    
<LI>Improved procedures for interim inspections at a reprocessing facility were agreed and implemented.   
<LI> Procedures were agreed with one State for the recovery of a substantial hold-up in a MOX facility.   
<LI> Improved approaches, including the use of reactor monitors and C/S have been introduced at certain    
research reactors.    
<LI>Safeguards measures for a power reactor in a nuclear-weapon State were fully implemented at the    
time of refuelling. These measures included the installation of a video surveillance system in the spent    
fuel storage area.   
</UL>   
New methods, procedures and techniques were developed and/or introduced in order to improve the    
quality and cost-effectiveness of Agency verification. For example:    
<UL>   
<LI>A new generation Cerenkov viewing device with higher sensitivity became available for general use   
in early 1994 and was systematically utilized thereafter in the spent fuel ponds containing low burnup or    
long cooled fuel at LWRs, resulting in a significant improvement in the verification of spent fuel.    
<LI>Further development of improved procedures for the joint use of NDA and C/S equipment continued    
with one State.   
<LI> Monitors to verify the movement of spent fuel from the core of a single unit on-load reactor were    
installed for the first time.    
<LI>Specialized equipment for reverification of the spent fuel at on-load reactors after failure of    
surveillance was developed and introduced at two facilities.   
<LI>Arrangements were made to improve safeguards implementation at MOX facilities in one State,    
including better characterization of scrap inventories, enhanced near-real-time accountancy and review of    
MUF calculations.   
<LI>Techniques and equipment have been developed and tested for item counting and verification of    
spent fuel stored in layers in storage ponds.     
</UL>   
The recent entry into force of a number of new safeguards agreements and the anticipated conclusion of    
other agreements required additional inspection effort. In particular:    
<UL>   
<LI> In May, the Agency received the initial report on the inventory of nuclear material in Argentina and    
Brazil under the safeguards agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the ABACC and the Agency    
(INFCIRC/435). Activities to verify the nuclear material in the majority of the facilities or locations    
outside facilities were performed during 1994. Discussions were initiated between Argentina and the    
Agency and between Brazil and the Agency on the implementation of Agency safeguards at enrichment    
facilities in each of the countries. Technical visits by the Agency were carried out to obtain information    
necessary to design a safeguards approach for these facilities.    
<LI>The Agency continued its efforts to clarify apparent discrepancies with respect to the production of    
low enriched uranium (LEU) at the South African semi-commercial enrichment plant to be able to assess    
the completeness of the initial inventory. On the basis of examination of operational records, sampling    
and analysis, it was assessed that the amounts of LEU reported to have been produced by the plant were    
consistent with the documented operations of the plant.   
<LI>With regard to the States of the former USSR, inspections to verify the initial inventories were    
carried out in Armenia, Lithuania and Latvia. In other States with substantial nuclear programmes,    
preparations for the implementation of safeguards were undertaken and technical visits carried out to most    
of the major facilities, particularly in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Preliminary information    
regarding nuclear installations, nuclear materials and nuclear material accountancy and control systems    
was obtained.    
</UL>   
<P>   
Pursuant to the proposal made by the President of the United States of America in September 1993 to    
submit to Agency safeguards nuclear material deemed by the USA to be excess to its weapon needs,    
Agency officials made several technical visits to the USA in order to discuss the implementation of    
Agency safeguards with respect to the material concerned. On the basis of an exchange of letters and in    
the framework of the voluntary-offer safeguards agreement between the Agency and the USA, safeguards    
began to be applied on a first quantity of excess nuclear material in September. By the end of December,    
the Agency had verified the initial inventories of high enriched uranium and plutonium at two sites.     
<P>   
The Regional Offices continued to contribute to the implementation of Agency safeguards in a cost    
effective manner. The Toronto Regional Office was able to provide a base for carrying out field trials    
under Programme 93+2 in Canada.    
<P>   
<B><A NAME="A1.224">Negotiation of subsidiary arrangements</B></A>

Some progress was made in the negotiation of Subsidiary Arrangements. One new and five revised    
General Parts of Subsidiary Arrangements (three new and 6 revised in 1993) and 29(15 new and 14    
revised) facility attachments (29 in 1993) entered into force. In particular, the following should be noted:  	   
<P>   
<UL>   
<LI>The General Part of the Subsidiary Arrangements of the safeguards agreement between Argentina,    
Brazil, the ABACC and the Agency entered into force in March. Discussions on facility attachments for    
71 facilities or locations outside facilities began. Following verification of design information, drafting of    
the facility attachments was started.    
<LI>Following the endorsement by the Board of Governors of the proposed improvements in the early    
provision and use of nuclear design information, revision of the relevant code of the General Parts of the    
Subsidiary Arrangements entered into force for five agreements (5 in 1993).    
<LI>Draft Subsidiary Arrangements were sent to Lithuania and Latvia for comments or approval. At the

Committee meetings and other regular forms of contact between the Agency and Member States continued    
to contribute to the further improvement of safeguards implementation. In particular, discussion were held   
on implementing measures to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system and on the    
Agency's Programme '93+2'.     
<P>   
As part of the effort to establish State systems of accounting and control in States formed after the    
dissolution of the former USSR, several donor States have provided financial assistance. The Agency co- 
ordinated the identification of safeguards requirements and State needs for the support by these donor    
States. An important part of the support involving the Agency's assistance was the training in nuclear    
material accountancy organized for State and facility personnel. On the basis of information collected    
during technical visits, safeguards equipment requirements have been identified and   
budgeted, and initial purchases made for items with long lead times.     
<P>   
A large plutonium oxide store, incorporating state-of-the art technology, was selected to be placed under    
safeguards under a voluntary-offer agreement with a nuclear-weapon State. A safeguards system which    
includes on-line verification of nuclear material transfers in unattended mode was developed jointly with    
EURATOM. The installation of the equipment is scheduled to be completed before the first receipt of    
nuclear material into the store.     
<P>

During 1994, 216 semi-annual statements of book inventory were provided to States pursuant to    
comprehensive safeguards agreements. Fourteen reports of annual inventory were provided to States    
pursuant to INFCIRC/66/Rev.2-type agreements. Nuclear material accounting information was received    
from 54 States, following the INFCIRC/153-type reporting requirements and seven States submitted    
reports pursuant to INFCIRC/66/Rev.2 type agreements. A total of 20 613 nuclear material accounting   
reports were processed, consisting of 1 386 588 line entries.   
<P>   
Efforts to obtain universal acceptance of the reporting scheme endorsed by the Board of   
Governors at its meeting in February 1993 were continued. Forty-three States and the European Union    
have so far indicated their willingness to participate in the scheme. A computer system was developed to    
store and process the information received. The Board of Governors at its December meeting approved a

The extrabudgetary Member State support programmes continued to provide major contributions to the    
research and development and safeguards implementation support activities. The role of support    
programmes is important in realizing the expectations for strengthening the safeguards system and for    
developing and testing new techniques, concepts and procedures. Some 250 projects were under way,    
addressing safeguards needs identified by the Agency. During the year, bilateral meetings were held to    
review the status and activities of all the programmes.     
<P>   
Work continued on the development of instruments for specific applications in particular facilities as well    
as for general use. The following development and application tasks were successfully carried out:     
<UL>   
<LI>Tasks within the integrated safeguards instrumentation programme were initiated to implement the    
internationally recognized instrument bus standard VXI in the next generation bundle counter and core    
discharge monitor. The VXI based bundle counter underwent tests at a power reactor facility.   
<LI>Production models for the generic review station MORE(multisystem optical review station) and    
MIVS advanced review station (MARS) were evaluated and approved for inspection use.	   
<LI>The unattended fuel flow monitor was completed, tested and authorized for inspection use.    
<LI>As part of the optical surveillance data reduction programme, a field test of front end motion    
triggering was successfully carried out at a dry storage facility in Germany. This programme is designed    
to reduce the frames of surveillance data which must be reviewed scene by scene by inspectors.    
<LI>A new procedure for plutonium concentration measurements in solid bulk plutonium samples was    
developed, together with the relevant software, and tested.   
<LI>Five instrument instruction manuals and eight standard procedures were issued.    
<LI>A CANDU spent fuel interbay transfer verification system was installed, tested and implemented at a    
power reactor facility; a facility specific procedure was prepared. 	   
<LI>An acceptance test of a prototype telephoto lens for the improved Cerenkov viewing device system,    
developed under a Member State support programme, was successfully performed; the production units    
will be available for inspection use in 1995.    
<LI>Hardware, software and implementation procedures for CANDU bundle verifiers were improved.    
These devices were installed in two more facilities and a similar device was used for the re-verification of    
the inventories of three spent fuel ponds for which either C/S had been lost or an initial inventory had to    
be verified.    
<LI>A new, lightweight spent fuel attribute tester (SFAT) for the verification of LWR spent fuel    
assemblies with more than ten years cooling time was developed and successfully tested at an away-from-   
reactor storage. The use of a CdTe detector permits a reduction in the weight of the SFAT by   of about 10    
compared to the previous version based on an NaI detector.    
<LI>A highly sensitive miniature CdTe detection probe was developed under a Member State support    
programme. The detection probe is 23 times more sensitive than the previous one and permits a    
corresponding reduction in the measurement time. A commercial supplier was identified and the first    
units purchased and implemented.    
<LI>An automated computer analysis program for unattended spent fuel rod counter data was developed,   
tested and implemented, providing a significant saving in inspector time.	   
<LI>The tamper resistant TV link was successfully tested with a MUX surveillance system and    
implemented at a power reactor, meeting  the requirements for authentication of data for safeguards   
applications.   
</UL>   
<P>   
An Advisory Group meeting on containment and surveillance was held to discuss remote instrumentation    
and data transport for safeguards application. The final report of the Advisory Group contains six     
recommendations which are in the process of being implemented by the Agency.   
<P>   
Implementation, maintenance and calibration services for safeguards equipment used by the inspectorate    
including preventive maintenance and the servicing of equipment in facilities continued to be provided. A    
programme for the replacement of aged equipment was implemented. Work on the standardization of    
gamma spectroscopy instrumentation for inspection use was completed. A gamma detector testing facility    
resulting in more streamlined and effective calibration and testing of gamma measurement systems    
became operational. A total of 15 portable multichannel analysers, 105 MIVS systems and 3 MXTV    
systems were upgraded. An additional 23 MIVS systems, 3 MUX systems and 8 COSMOS systems were    
installed. A total of 117 calibrations and 379 equipment maintenance actions were performed.     
<P>   
A meeting was convened with the MIVS developer and manufacturer as well as with representatives of    
EURATOM to review the status of MIVS performance, and to identify possible technical and procedural    
means to improve field performance. It was concluded that MIVS performance limitations are caused by a    
broad range of facility, procedural, training and reporting issues. Recommendations resulting from the    
meeting are being implemented.

Work progressed on the development of the equipment management information system, including a    
subsystem designed to provide up to date information regarding equipment needs, procurement and   
funding status and inventory.   
<P>   
The Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) and the Network of Analytical Laboratories (NWAL)    
performed 3067 measurements for calibration and quality control on NDA techniques, for certification of    
secondary reference samples, for maintenance and improvement of off-site destructive analysis (DA) and    
for testing procedures for on-site DA. In addition, 3062 measurements were performed by SAL   
and the NWAL for the routine quality control of the analysis of inspection samples. SAL also assisted in    
the measurement of samples taken in Iraq during inspections carried out pursuant to relevant United    
Nations Security Council resolutions, and performed 418 such measurements. A total of 268   
analytical results were reported by SAL on non-nuclear and environmental type samples. The median    
times required to complete verification by off-site DA were 51 days for uranium, 59 days for plutonium    
and 74 days for spent fuel samples.

Ground breaking took place on 14 October for the construction of a class 100 clean room at the SAL for    
the handling and analyses of environmental samples. Construction is scheduled to be completed by the    
end of 1995. A new high performance thermal ionization mass spectrometer for analyses in the    
subnanogram range of uranium and plutonium in environmental samples was installed. Testing of the    
equipment is in progress. Laboratories from seven Member States provided assistance in the analysis of    
environmental samples taken during environmental monitoring field trials.  With the assistance of    
Member State support programmes and the NWAL, the following major development activities were    
accomplished/pursued:

The Agency's programme to develop proposals for a strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards    
system (Programme 93+2) continued throughout 1994. The measures being developed are broad in scope    
and diverse in nature, dealing both with improvements in the cost effectiveness of safeguards on declared    
nuclear material and with increasing the assurance of the completeness of the declared nuclear activities    
in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements. A feature of the strengthened safeguards system    
under development is a greater transparency in States' nuclear activities. This transparency derives from    
an expanded declaration by the State in relation to all of its nuclear and related activities and broad access    
for the Agency to declared locations to assess that declaration. An information analysis system covering a    
wide range of sources is also being developed to support this assessment. Another key feature being    
developed is a greater level of co-operation with State systems of accounting and control (SSACs); this    
could introduce both safeguards strengthening measures, through the provision of increased access at    
declared locations, and cost-effective measures through, for example, joint activities, enabling a reduction    
in the Agency's efforts on declared nuclear material, while maintaining the Agency's ability to draw   
independent conclusions. Field tests of an integrated approach involving both strengthening measures and    
safeguards on declared material were carried out in four Member States.    
<P>   
In connection with Programme 93+2, as part of re-assessment of the current safeguards implementation,    
the effect (both cost and technical implications) of possible changes in significant quantities, in conversion    
and detection times, and in the starting point of safeguards was considered. Any update of the values    
assigned to safeguards implementation parameters will be further evaluated in the broader context of all    
measures undertaken towards a strengthened and more cost-effective safeguards system.     
<P>   
Twenty Member States assisted the Agency by permitting field trials of environmental monitoring and    
other safeguards strengthening measures or measures designed to make safeguards more cost effective.    
Progress reports were submitted to the Board of Governors in February, June and December and to the    
General Conference in September. SAGSI reviewed the programme at two junctures during the year.

<P>   
SAGSI held two regular meetings and two working group meetings during 1994. It reviewed the    
programme on strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system    
(Programme 93+2) in the light of the recommendations it had presented to the Director General in April    
1993.     
<P>   
The internal review of technical policies placed emphasis on issues associated with Programme 93+2 in    
the areas of the termination of safeguards and exemptions. Technical reviews were carried out (as required    
by the safeguards criteria) on an increasing number of proposed safeguards approaches using dual C/S    
systems.    
<P>   
The mid-term review of the safeguards criteria 1991-1995 was completed and the resulting minor    
modifications were introduced in April. Thereafter, the review of the safeguards criteria was   
continued, addressing in particular criteria for safeguards measures on retained waste.      
<P>   
<B><A NAME="A1.242">Effectiveness evaluation</B></A>   
<P>   
The evaluation of inspection goal attainment in 1993 at facilities under safeguards was performed    
according to the 1991-1995 criteria. The areas in which the inspection goals could not be fully attained,    
for financial or other reasons, were identified and analysed. Conformity was established between the    
results reported to States in summary statements on inspection activities and the final evaluation results    
for 1993. The results of the evaluations were summarized in the SIR for 1993 and provided to the   
Board of Governors.   
<P>   
Provisional evaluations of inspection goal attainment were also performed on a continuous basis to assist    
the Inspectorate resolve problem areas and to aid in effective planning of subsequent inspection activities.    
This information was generated for use in the SIR for 1994.

Legally Binding International Safety Agreements</H3>
</CENTER>
<OL>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>Three legally binding international safety agreements aimed at strengthening international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety and conferring depositary functions on the Director General and various other functions on the Agency have been developed and adopted by the international community and are now being implemented,  with the support of the Agency:  the <I>Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material</I> (which was opened for signature on 3 March 1980 and entered into force on 8 February 1987), the <I>Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident </I> (which was opened for signature on 26 September 1986 and entered into force on 27 October 1986) and the <I>Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency </I> (which was opened for signature on 26 September 1986 and entered into force on 26 February 1987).
<P>
<LI>A further such agreement has been developed and adopted, but implementation is awaiting its entry into force:  the <I>Convention on Nuclear Safety</I> (which was opened for signature on 20 September 1994 and will enter into force on 24 October 1996).  Lastly, work is under way on developing yet a further such agreement:  <I>a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management</I>.<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  The present situation regarding these various conventions is described below.
<P>
<B>Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material - INFCIRC/274/Rev.1</B>
<P>
<LI>As of 31 July 1996, there were 54 parties (53 States and EURATOM) to the Convention - see the following table, which also shows the parties to the Convention (and the non-parties) that have made known to the Secretariat their contact points for the purposes of the Convention. .<A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>
<B>Convention on Early Notification of  a Nuclear Accident (Early Notification Convention) - INFCIRC/335</B>
<P>
<LI>As of 31 July 1996, there were 75 parties (72 States and three organizations) to the Convention - see the following table, which also shows the parties to the Convention (and the non-parties) that have made known to the Secretariat their contact points for the purposes of the Convention.
<P>
<LI>Since the General Conference's 1995 session, there have been no notifications of accidents of the type specified in Article 1 of the Early Notification Convention.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat recently revised the procedures of the Agency's Emergency Response Unit, the unit within the Secretariat responsible for responding to a notification of an accident or to a request for assistance (whether or not made under the terms of the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency) and introduced a number of improvements.  In particular,
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	the Emergency Response Unit's communications facilities have been enhanced, so that there are now dedicated facilities for communications between the Emergency Response Unit, the State where the accident has occurred (the accident State) and the States which have been or may be physically affected by the accident; and
<P>
<DD>-	a standard Notification Form has been circulated to States with a request that it be used in future by the accident State for notifying the Agency in the event of an accident.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>In response to a Secretariat request, the following States have provided the Emergency Response Unit with E-mail addresses of contact points for the Early Notification Convention:  Armenia, Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Greece, Kazakstan, the Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Poland, the Russian Federation, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine and the United States of America.
<P>
<B>Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (Assistance Convention) - INFCIRC/336</B>
<P>
<LI>As of 31 July 1996, there were 71 parties (68 States and three organizations) to the Convention - see the following table, which also shows the parties to the Convention (and the non-parties) that have made known to the Secretariat their contact points for the purposes of the Convention.
<P>
<LI>Since the General Conference's 1995 session there have been no requests for assistance under the terms of the Assistance Convention.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has circulated to States standard forms for use in making future requests for assistance under the terms of the Convention.  Also, the Secretariat is in the process of:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	designing a questionnaire which States could use in informing the Agency more exhaustively about the assistance they could provide;
<P>
<DD>-	looking into the question of how to co-ordinate the assistance provided to States which could be affected by a significant accident at a given nuclear facility but do not have the emergency response infrastructure necessary for co-ordinating that assistance;  and
<P>
<DD>-	revising the Agency's Emergency Notification and Assistance Technical Operations Manual (ENATOM).
</DL>
<P>
<LI>In response to a Secretariat request, the following States have provided the Emergency Response Unit with E-mail addresses of contact points for the Assistance Convention:  Armenia, Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Greece, Kazakstan, the Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Poland, the Russian Federation, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tanzania, Ukraine and the United States of America.
<P>
<B>Convention on Nuclear Safety - INFCIRC/449</B>
<P>
<LI>Paragraph 1 of Article 31 ("Entry into Force") of the Convention states that the "Convention shall enter into force on the ninetieth day after the date of deposit with the Depositary of the twenty-second instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval, including the instruments of seventeen States, each having at least one nuclear installation which has achieved criticality in a reactor core."  On 26 July 1996, the Director General received the twenth-fifth instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval, that instrument being the seventeenth from a State having at least one nuclear installation which has achieved criticality in a reactor core.  Accordingly, the Convention will enter into force on 24 October 1996.
<P>
<LI>As of 31 July 1996, instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval of the Convention had been deposited by the following 25 States (an asterisk indicates a State with at least one nuclear installation which has achieved criticality in a reactor core):
<P>
<LI>Not later than six months after the date of the Convention's entry into force a preparatory meeting of the Contracting Parties has to be held, and the Agency's Secretariat is assisting with preparations for that meeting, as recognized last year by the General Conference, which, in resolution <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r13.html">GC(39)/RES/13</A>, requested the Secretariat to continue with its support to signatory and other interested States in preparing for implementation of the Convention.  The Secretariat has provided support for three open-ended informal meetings of signatory and other interested States (held in March 1995, November 1995 and June 1996) at which draft "Provisional Rules of Procedure" for the preparatory meeting of the Contracting Parties were prepared together with draft "Guidelines for National Reports" and draft "Guidelines for the Conduct of the Review Process" for consideration at the preparatory meeting.
<P>
<A NAME="waste">
<B>Convention on the safety of radioactive waste management</B></A>
<P>
<LI>An open-ended group of legal and technical experts has met four times in Vienna to identify the main legal and technical elements necessary in an "incentive convention" on the safety of radioactive waste management.  Participants from the following 61 countries and observers from the Commission of the European Communities, OECD/NEA, UNEP (Secretariat of the Basel Convention) and WHO have attended at least one meeting of the group:
<P>
<LI>Using the structure of the Convention on Nuclear Safety as a model, the group - under the chairmanship of Professor A.J. Baer, former Deputy Director of Switzerland's Office fdral de l'nergie - has made good progress, agreeing on many provisions which would be included in the envisaged convention.  Among the questions requiring further discussion are:  whether the convention should cover the safety of spent fuel management (notably when the spent fuel has been removed from the reactor site and designated for reprocessing or it has been removed from the reactor site but no decision as to its further use has been taken); how the convention should cover radioactive waste resulting from military operations; and the safety of transboundary movements of radioactive waste.
</OL>
<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
<A NAME="note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Another convention for which the Director General performs depositary functions is the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.  It is expected that the subject of liability for nuclear damage will be dealt with in another General Conference document.
<P>
<A NAME="note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Tajikistan (not an Agency Member State) deposited an instrument of accession to the Convention on 11 July 1996.  It became a party to the Convention on 10 August 1996.

Establishment of International Safety Standards</H3>
</CENTER>
<OL>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>Under Article III.A.6 of its Statute, the Agency is authorized to establish or adopt standards of safety in collaboration with the competent organs of the United Nations and with the specialized agencies concerned, and since soon after the Agency's inception the Secretariat has been involved in developing and setting such standards.
<P>
<LI>The Board of Governors first approved radiation protection and safety measures in March 1960.
<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  Those measures were subsequently revised on the basis of the experience gained from applying them to projects carried out by Member States under agreements concluded with the Agency, the revised version being approved by the Board in 1976. <A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>
<LI>Important early Agency safety standards were the "Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material" (the Transport Regulations), the first version of which was published in 1961 (IAEA Safety Series No. 6).  The Transport Regulations underwent comprehensive revision in 1964, 1967, 1973 and 1985 - and most recently in 1995. <A HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>
<LI>The Board of Governors first approved basic radiation protection and safety standards in 1962 ("Basic Safety Standards for Radiation Protection", IAEA Safety Series No. 9).  Revised versions of those standards were issued in 1967 and 1982, and in 1994 the Board approved the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources (the so-called Basic Safety Standards), which had been sponsored jointly by - in addition to the Agency - FAO, ILO, OECD/NEA, PAHO and WHO. <A HREF="#note_4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>, <A HREF="#note_5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
<P>
<LI>In 1974, the Agency launched a Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) programme for the purpose of establishing internationally agreed nuclear safety standards for land-based thermal-neutron power reactors. Over a period of about ten years, a set of five Safety Standards documents (known as Codes) and 55 Safety Guides was produced on (i) Governmental Organization, (ii) Siting, (iii) Design, (iv) Operation and (v) Quality Assurance.  All five Codes and some of the Safety Guides have since been revised.
<P>
<LI>In 1991, the Agency established a Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS) programme for the preparation of standards in the following subject areas:  (i) Planning, (ii) Pre-disposal, (iii) Near-surface disposal, (iv) Geological disposal, (v) Uranium/thorium mining and milling waste and (vi) Decommissioning.
<P>
<B>International basis for the Agency's safety standards</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency establishes its safety standards on the basis of advice provided by its International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG), of estimates made by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and of recommendations made by a number of international bodies - principally the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). <A HREF="#note_6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
<P>
<B>The hierarchy of Agency safety standards documents</B>
<P>
<LI>In 1989, following a major expansion of the Agency's safety-related activities, the Secretariat introduced a hierarchical structure for IAEA Safety Series publications, which are now divided into:  <B>Safety Fundamentals, Safety Standards<A HREF="#note_7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>, Safety Guides and Safety Practices</B>.
<P>
<B>Safety Fundamentals</B>
<P>
<LI>Publications in the Safety Fundamentals category, which are primary texts for other IAEA Safety Series publications, state the basic objectives, concepts and principles involved in ensuring protection and safety in the development and application of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.  They thereby provide the rationale for such activities having to fulfil certain requirements, but do not state what those requirements are or provide technical details and generally do not discuss the application of principles.
<P>
<LI>The fundamental aspects of protection and safety relevant to the safety of nuclear installations, to the safe management of radioactive waste and to radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources are discussed in the three Safety Fundamentals publications issued since 1993:  "The Safety of Nuclear Installations", "The Principles of Radioactive Waste Management" and "Radiation Protection and the Safety of Radiation Sources".<A HREF="#note_8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
<P>
<LI>In response to suggestions made in the Board of Governors, the Secretariat has initiated a process of revision of these three publications with a view to their amalgamation into a single Safety Fundamentals document covering all aspects. 
<P>
<B>Safety Standards</B>
<P>
<LI>Publications in the Safety Standards category specify basic requirements that must be satisfied in order to ensure safety for particular activities or application areas.  These requirements are governed by the basic objectives, concepts and principles that are stated in Safety Fundamentals.  The publications in this category do not contain recommendations on, or explanations of, how to meet the requirements.
<LI>The written style used in Safety Standards accords with that of regulatory documents since the requirements which they establish - and which are mandatory as far as the Agency's own operations are concerned - may be adopted by Member States, at their own discretion, for use in national regulations to be applied in respect of their own activities.  Regulatory requirements are expressed as "shall" statements.
<P>
<B>Safety Guides</B>
<P>
<LI>Publications in the Safety Guides category supplement Safety Standards by presenting recommendations, based on international experience, regarding measures to ensure the observance of safety standards.
<P>
<LI>Also, Safety Guides may establish specific requirements that are consequential to a basic requirement of a Safety Standard.  In addition, they may provide recommendations on measures to fulfil such subsidiary requirements, the recommendations being presented as "should" statements.
<P>
<LI>Safety Guides may be less formal in written style than Safety Standards and may contain more explanatory and background information.  They may consist largely of such information when this is necessary for the interpretation of a Safety Standard.
<P>
<B>Safety Practices</B>
<P>
<LI>Safety Practices documents give examples and descriptions of methods which can be applied in implementing both Safety Standards and Safety Guides.  They are not strictly regulatory documents but rather documents for fostering information exchange, and the Secretariat is considering the possibility of separating them from the Agency's safety standards (see paragraph 42 below).
<P>
<b>Preparation, approval and publication of the Agency's safety standards</B>
<P>
<LI>In the past, there were different processes for the preparation and review of Safety Series publications in the different safety-related areas in which the Agency is involved.  Safety Fundamentals and Safety Standards have required the approval of the Board of Governors.  Safety Guides and Safety Practices documents have been issued under the authority of the Director General.  The Agency's safety standards have been published in the IAEA Safety Series. <A HREF="#note_9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>
<B>Strengthening the preparation and review process</B>
<P>
<LI>The process of preparation and review of the Agency's safety standards has resulted in a lack of compatibility between some IAEA Safety Series publications.  Since 1 January 1996, however, the recently established Department of Nuclear Safety has had full responsibility for the preparation and review of all IAEA Safety Series publications, although, for programmatic reasons, IAEA Safety Series publications relating to the safety of fuel cycle facilities and to quality assurance are being prepared with major involvement of the Department of Nuclear Energy. 
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has introduced a uniform preparation and review process covering all areas. <A HREF="#note_10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>  To this end, it has created a set of advisory bodies with harmonized terms of reference to assist it in preparing and reviewing all documents - namely, the Advisory Commission for Safety Standards, the Nuclear Safety Standards Advisory Committee, the Radiation Safety Standards Advisory Committee, the Waste Safety Standards Advisory Committee and the Transport Safety Standards Advisory Committee. <A HREF="#note_11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>  It has assigned to each of these bodies a Scientific Secretary who co-ordinates the work of the body with the relevant Agency policies and programmes, and it appoints a Technical Officer for the preparation of each document in accordance with recommendations made by the Advisory Commission for Safety Standards and the relevant Advisory Committee. <A HREF="#note_12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>

<B>Initial activities of the advisory bodies</B>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Nuclear Safety Standards Advisory Committee (NUSSAC)</B> held its first session in February 1996 - under the chairmanship of Mr. P. Govaerts, from Belgium's regulatory body AIB Vincotte-Nucl&eacute;aire - and drew up a programme for future work.  It considered the status of the NUSS programme, concurring with the priorities previously agreed upon by NUSSAG for the revision of NUSS documents (first priority - the Safety Standards document and the Safety Guides on Operation; equal second priority - the Safety Standards documents and the Safety Guides on Governmental Organization and Design).  As regards the Governmental Organization documents, deemed to fall within the terms of reference of all four advisory committees, it referred to the ACSS the question of which advisory committee should take the lead in the revision exercise (it did the same also with regard to the Quality Assurance documents).  A sub-group was formed to look into the subject of safety evaluations of operating nuclear power plants built to earlier standards.
<P>
<LI>The <B>Radiation Safety Standards Advisory Committee (RASSAC)</B> held its first session in January 1996 - under the chairmanship of Mr. L.S. Creswell, from the United Kingdom's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate - and drew up a programme for future work.  It reviewed and endorsed the Secretariat's plans for preparing and reviewing radiation safety standards.  At its second session, in July 1996, it began examining the drafts of new and revised Safety Guides to be issued in support of the Basic Safety Standards (Safety Series No. 115).
<P>
<LI>The <B>Waste Safety Standards Advisory Committee (WASSAC)</B> held its first session in February 1996 - under the chairmanship of Mr. P. Metcalf, from South Africa's Council for Nuclear Safety - and drew up a programme for future work.  It examined the report on a Secretariat review of the RADWASS programme carried out in the second half of 1995 and made proposals for restructuring the programme and the related publication plan.  A sub-group was formed to look into the subject of very low-level waste.
<P>
<LI>The <B>Transport Safety Standards Advisory Committee (TRANSSAC)</B> held its first session in February-March 1996 - under the chairmanship of Mr. W. Collin, from Germany's Bundesamt f&uuml;r Strahlenschutz (Federal Office for Radiation Protection) - and drew up a programme of future work.  It examined a draft of the latest revised version of the Agency's Transport Regulations and recommended that it be submitted, through the ACSS, to the Board for approval.  Also, it made recommendations concerning the Secretariat's plans for the development of documents in support of the Transport Regulations.
<P>
<LI>The <B>Advisory Commission for Safety Standards (ACSS)</B> held its first session in March 1996, under the chairmanship of Ms. A. Bishop, from Canada's Atomic Energy Control Board.  It reviewed the work programmes of NUSSAC, RASSAC, WASSAC and TRANSSAC and made recommendations regarding - inter alia - which advisory committees should take the lead in the preparation and review of safety standards relating to more than one topical area.  Also, following consultations it endorsed the draft of the latest revised version of the Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material for submission to the Board for approval.  In addition, it endorsed, after minor changes had been made, WASSAC's proposals for restructuring the RADWASS programme and the related publication plan.
<P>
<B>Plans for the preparation, review and publication of safety-related documents</B>
<P>
<LI>The <I>tentative</I> document preparation, review and publication plansresulting from the initial activities of the ACSS and the four advisory committees are presented on <A HREF="all.pdf">pages 13-18</A>.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat is looking into the possibility of creating an IAEA Safety Standards Series that would embrace all documents issued by the Agency pursuant to Article III.A.6 of its Statute - i.e. safety standards in the broader sense (see footnote 7 above), which are currently being issued, together with other types of document, in the IAEA Safety Series.  The other types of document - for example, documents that are descriptive rather than prescriptive or regulatory - would be issued in a separate series devoted to the fostering of the exchange of information on safety-related matters.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat is also looking into ways of facilitating the access of interested parties to the Agency's safety standards.

Provisions of Safety-Related Assistance Though the Agency's Technical Co-operation Programme</H3>
</CENTER>
<OL>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>The Agency, pursuant to its Statute, helps Member States to comply with its safety standards through - inter alia - technical co-operation (TC) programmes, and in doing so it attaches high priority to the establishment and strengthening of nuclear, radiation and waste safety infrastructures in Member States.  
<P>
<LI>Under its TC programmes, the Agency provides safety-related technical assistance in the form of experts' services, equipment and training.  The current safety-related TC programme includes more than 150 national, regional and interregional projects (representing total resources of approximately US $14 million), of which about one third are devoted to nuclear safety and two thirds to radiation and waste safety.  In addition, a large number of  national, regional and interregional workshops and training courses are organized and  fellowships granted through TC funding (see 
<A HREF="gc40inf5ac-4.html">Annex C-4</A>).
<P>
<LI>The projects relate - inter alia - to:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	the adoption and updating of radiation protection legislation, regulations and codes of practice on the basis of the International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources (the Basic Safety Standards, Safety Series No. 115) and on the basis of other safety-related documents;
<P>
<DD>-	the establishment and strengthening of regulatory bodies;
<P>
<DD>-	the establishment of systems for the notification, registration and licensing of radiation sources;
<P>
<DD>-	the control and safe use of radiation sources, including their safe disposal;
<P>
<DD>-	the enhancement of radiation dosimetry services;
<P>
<DD>-	the protection of workers exposed to ionizing radiation in medical and industrial applications;
<P>
<DD>-	the strengthening of programmes for radiation protection of the public (including persons being exposed to radiation for medical diagnosis and treatment purposes) and the environment;
<P>
<DD>-	the establishment of emergency planning and preparedness programmes and procedures;
<P>
<DD>-	the strengthening of programmes for the safe management of radioactive waste;
<P>
<DD>-	the improvement of national capabilities in the areas of siting, severe accident management, fire safety, safety-related ageing management, probabilistic safety assessment, and human-machine interface management;
<P>
<DD>-	the enhancement of research reactor safety; and
<P>
<DD>-	the provision of nuclear safety services.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Nuclear safety</B>
<P>
<LI>The main effort relates to the safety of nuclear power plants in countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and it is dealt with separately in <A HREF="gc40inf5ac-2.html">Annex C-2</A>.
<P>
<LI>Among the other technical co-operation projects in the nuclear safety area, the following three warrant special mention:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)	a project for strengthening nuclear safety regulatory bodies, with nine training courses attended by more than 160 participants from 12 countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, on - inter alia - the regulatory control of nuclear power plants, the provision of regulatory information to the public, safety culture and periodic safety reviews (duplication with other international assistance was avoided through close co-operation with the G-24 Nuclear Safety Assistance Co-ordination and major donor countries);
<P>
<DD>(b)	a project through which ten countries of Eastern Europe benefited from the OSART, the ASSET and other services and received assistance with nuclear power plant safety assessments, the promotion of technical information exchange in the region, the preparation of safety guidelines, the organization of peer reviews and the evaluation of plant safety improvements;
<P>
<DD>(c)	a Model Project for "Strengthening the nuclear regulatory body" in Slovakia.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Radiation and waste safety</B>
<P>
<LI>An awareness of the importance of radiation and waste safety has been achieved in most of the countries where the Agency, pursuant to its Statute, has helped to ensure the "adequacy of proposed health and safety standards for handling and storing materials and for operating facilities".
<P>
<LI>Generally, however, in the absence of systematic follow-up, that awareness has not led to the establishment of adequate national radiation and waste safety infrastructures - i.e. infrastructures in line with the requirements derived from the Basic Safety Standards.
<P>
<LI>Consequently, the Secretariat has developed a strategy - endorsed by the 1994 Technical Co-operation Policy Review Seminar - for establishing and assessing such infrastructures.  For the individual Member State, the strategy is being implemented on the basis of data contained in a Country Safety Profile<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> and involves the preparation - in co-operation with the State - of an action plan.
<P>
<LI>In parallel with the development of that strategy, two interregional Model Projects for infrastructure upgrading (project INT/9/143, "Upgrading radiation protection infrastructure", and project INT/9/144, "Upgrading waste management infrastructure") were launched by the Department of Technical Co-operation in 1993.  They were subsequently approved by the Board for inclusion in the Agency's TC programme.  At the time, it was envisaged that a a fairly small number of countries would benefit each year from each of the Model Projects.
<P>
<LI>However, as described last year in document GOV/INF/777, material subsequently gathered by the Secretariat indicated that a large number of countries (about 50 more than originally estimated), including some new Member States of the Agency, needed to improve their radiation protection and radioactive waste management safety infrastructures.  The Department of Technical Co-operation therefore decided to accelerate the implementation of the two aforementioned interregional Model Projects, with a target date of the year 2000 for basic infrastructure upgrading.
<P>
<LI>Currently, 53 countries are being targeted by interregional Model Project INT/9/143, now entitled "Upgrading radiation and waste safety infrastructure".  The Secretariat is dealing with them in four groups:  an African group, a West and East Asian group, a Latin American group and a European group.
<P>
<LI>With a view to expediting the implementation of interregional Model Project INT/9/143 in its expanded form, the Secretariat has appointed four "regional experts" who report to the Department of Technical Co-operation and will operate from "regional offices" located in:  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (for the African group); Beirut, Lebanon (for the West and East Asian group); San Jos&eacute;, Costa Rica (for the Latin American Group); and Bratislava, Slovakia (for the European group).  The "regional office" in Bratislava is already operational, and it is expected that the other three will be operational by the end of September.
<P>
<LI>For almost all the participating countries, assessments have been made by the regional experts and by technical officers in the Division of Radiation and Waste Safety to identify infrastructural weaknesses (for example, inadequate information - or even a complete lack of information - on the radiation sources in the country, on radiation and waste safety legislation and regulations, and on personnel dosimetry services, and poor calibration and state of repair of equipment) and draft work plans prepared in the light of the assessments.  In most cases, after consultations with national counterparts the Secretariat has submitted the draft action plans to the countries' appropriate authorities for approval - and in many cases the proposed action plans have already been approved.
<P>
<LI>Generally, the main priority is the establishment of States' systems for the control of radiation sources (including inventories of such sources) - especially sources which might cause injuries due to accidental exposure.  To this end, the Secretariat has devised a generic system - adaptable to the conditions in different States - for the notification, registration and licensing of radiation sources and for follow-up inspections of the sources.  Also, the Secretariat has issued a manual (IAEA-TECDOC-804, entitled "Methods to identify and locate spent radiation sources") providing guidance for the identification and location of spent radiation sources not properly accounted for.
<P>
<LI>As regards radiation and waste safety regulations, a "model" radiation safety legislation and "model" regulations for protection against ionizing radiation have been prepared by the Division of Radiation and Waste Safety and the regional experts for use in the States targeted by Model Project INT/9/143 and subsequently in other States with infrastructural weaknesses of the kind in question.

<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
<LI>	The Agency has been providing nuclear power plant (NPP) safety assistance to countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union under subprogramme I.7.03 ("Safety of WWER and RBMK plants") of its programme for 1995-96, a subprogramme which includes the provision of technical support to interregional, regional and national TC projects.<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  The activities in question have been funded from the Agency's Regular Budget, from technical co-operation resources and from extrabudgetary contributions.
<P>
<LI>In December 1995, an Advisory Group reviewed project implementation and concluded that the 1995 project objectives had been achieved. <A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
<P>
<LI>Besides the assistance being provided under subprogramme I.7.03, at the request of WWER and RBMK operating countries the Secretariat has been providing site-specific assistance and advice through - for example - the Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) service, the Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team (ASSET) service and the International Peer Review Service (IPERS) for Probabilistic Safety Assessments.
<P>
<B>Safety issues and safety improvement programmes</B>
<P>
<LI>On the basis of - inter alia - the findings of Agency safety review missions to WWER-440/213 NPPs, a list of safety issues has been drawn up; it includes 87 design and operational issues.  At some plants, many of the safety issues have been resolved and much of the backfitting and upgrading work recognized as being necessary has been or is being done.
<P>
<LI>Eighty-four safety issues relating to WWER-1000/320 NPPs have been identified on the basis of - inter alia - the results of Agency safety review missions to the Zaporozhe and Kola NPPs and the results of safety studies carried out by WWER-1000/320 operators and by organizations involved in WWER-1000/320 safety upgrading programmes.  These safety issues suggest that the basic safety concept of WWER-1000/320s is similar to that of the PWR units designed at the same time, but that differences in engineering design stage, manufacturing quality and equipment reliability are reasons for WWER-1000/320 safety shortcomings.  The stage reached in WWER-1000/320 backfitting varies from country to country, depending on national regulatory requirements and the available financial resources.
<P>
<LI>Using the list of 84 WWER-1000 safety issues, an Agency-organized team has reviewed the safety modernization programme for the Czech Republic's Temelin NPP and concluded that all issues have been addressed, many of them through the adoption of Western technology, but that some of them have not yet been completely resolved.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has been requested to review the generic reference programme for WWER-1000/320 modernization prepared by a Russian consortium (MOHT) and Electricit de France.  The programme addresses the WWER-1000/320 safety issues identified by the Agency, and its plant-specific implementation could make a major contribution to plant safety.
<P>
<LI>In the light of review missions to the South Ukraine and Khmelnitsky NPPs, the Secretariat has started to compile a list of safety issues for WWER-1000s of earlier design.
<P>
<LI>The results of technical visits to the Novovoronezh, Kozloduy and Bohunice NPPs for the purpose of reviewing plant-specific safety enhancement actions have been included in the Agency's database on WWER safety issues.
<P>
<LI>RBMK safety issues were examined in April at an international forum organized by the Agency and reported on at the International Conference <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/thisweek/preview/chernobyl">"One decade after Chernobyl:  Summing up the consequences of the accident"</A>.  It was concluded at the forum:  that, although there were still some gaps in knowledge relating to details of some phenomena involved in the Chernobyl accident, the knowledge acquired in the meantime was sufficient for identifying the causes and taking effective measures to prevent a repetition of such an event; and that measures to stabilize the "sarcophagus" built to confine the destroyed Chernobyl Unit 4 were a high priority.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has established a database for technical findings and recommendations relating to WWER and RBMK safety issues, and plant-specific information on backfitting programmes and measures is being entered into the database.  Workshops on the use of this database and of the G-24 Project Data Bank have been held in the Russian Federation, Germany and the United States.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has participated as a technical adviser to the G-24 Nuclear Safety Assistance Co-ordination in G-24 reviews at the Ignalina and Bohunice NPPs, carried out for the purpose of identifying gaps and overlaps in assistance activities.
<P>
<B>Addressing high-priority safety issues</B>
<P>
<LI>In order to assist countries of Eastern Europe in addressing high-priority safety issues, the Secretariat has published guidelines for WWER accident analysis and is preparing guidelines on pressurized thermal shock assessment, containment evaluation, the best estimate approach in accident analysis, accidents during shutdown conditions and the qualification of non-destructive testing.
<P>
<LI>At a topical meeting on thermohydraulic analysis and radiological consequences of primary-to-secondary leakages (a very significant issue associated with WWERs), it was concluded that further assistance was necessary in order to enable countries with operating WWERs to perform additional analyses, carry out plant modifications on the basis of the analytical results, develop emergency operating procedures and prepare evaluations of the radiological hazards associated with steam generator leaks.
<P>
<LI>Reviews carried out at the Bohunice, Dukovany and Mochovce NPPs confirmed that the bubbler condensers require mechanical strengthening, but it was recommended that further thermohydraulic and structural mechanics calculations be performed in order to determine the necessary extent of such strengthening.
<P>
<LI>At meetings on WWER-1000 control rod insertion problems and steam generator integrity, it was concluded that work on these two high-priority safety issues should continue and that the compensatory measures taken should be monitored closely.
<P>
<LI>Modernization of the shutdown system is a high-priority safety issue for RBMKs, and in October 1995 the various conceptual design options for shutdown systems were discussed at a meeting where it was agreed that further work was needed on the design of the second shutdown system.
<P>
<LI>It has been found that the scope and technical quality of PSAs performed for WWERs vary considerably, which limits the sharing of insights among the operators of WWERs - even when these are of the same type.  Consequently, safety measures and priorities determined on the basis of some PSA results should be carefully evaluated before adoption.
<P>
<B>Workshops</B>
<P>
<LI>In May 1996, a workshop on fuel channel integrity in RBMKs provided a forum for an exchange of experience relating to the mechanical integrity, the embrittlement and the geometrical degradation of fuel channels, to graphite behaviour and to fuel channel interactions with the graphite block.
<P>
<LI>At five workshops, information was exchanged on the licensing of plant modifications, preventive maintenance, human reliability analysis and in-service inspection techniques.  The results of the workshops were distributed to WWER operators and regulators.
<P>
<LI>At a workshop held in May it was concluded that RBMK core damage can be defined in the same way as core damage in the case of vessel-type LWRs, including all sequences of events which are beyond the design basis limits.  However, it was recognized that for channel-type reactors (e.g. RBMKs) "core damage" does not necessarily mean a meltdown of the entire reactor core and that Level 2 PSA studies are required in order to define the extent of core damage scenarios.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<P>
<LI>It is expected that, following the identification and ranking of WWER and RBMK safety issues, the Agency's activities will focus on assistance with safety upgrading actions - including, upon request, technical visits, peer reviews of safety studies and improvement programme evaluations.  Topical meetings and workshops will be organized and the preparation of guidelines will continue with a view to helping WWER and RBMK operators and regulators to address high-priority safety issues.  The Agency databases on safety issues will be kept updated in the light of the results of these activities. Extrabudgetary funding will be required in 1997 if the subprogramme objectives are to be met.
<P>
<LI>Three regional safety-related technical co-operation projects - on operational safety, safety assessments and the strengthening of regulatory bodies - have been proposed for the 1997-98 TC cycle.

Fostering of Safety-Related Information Exchange</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>Fostering the exchange of information on nuclear, radiation and waste safety is an integral part of the Agency activities aimed at providing for application of the Agency's safety standards.  Moreover, Article III.A.3 of the Agency's Statute authorizes the Agency to foster the exchange of scientific and technical information on peaceful uses of atomic energy.  
<P>
<B>Meetings and publications</B>
<P>
<LI>An important means of fostering the exchange of safety-related information is the organization of scientific and technical meetings - ranging from large meetings (such as conferences, symposia and seminars) with broad participation to smaller, specialized meetings (such as technical committee meetings) with the participation of selected experts.  Information exchanged at such meetings is subsequently made available by the Agency in priced publications - for example, conference proceedings - or in unpriced ones - for example, technical documents (IAEA-TECDOCs).
<P>
<LI>A subject on which the Agency has been involved in an intensive exchange of information is the health and environmental effects of the Chernobyl accident.  In order to achieve a scientific consensus on the accident's consequences, the Agency, the European Commission and WHO held an international conference entitled <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/thisweek/preview/chernobyl/">"One Decade after Chernobyl:  Summing up the Consequences of the Accident"</A> from 8 to 12 April 1996 in Vienna; five other organizations belonging to the United Nations family (the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, UNESCO, UNEP, UNSCEAR and FAO) and the Nuclear Energy Agency of OECD co-operated in the preparation and organization of the conference.  The conference was presided over by Germany's Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Ms. Angela Merkel, and attended by other high-level political figures, including the President of Belarus, the Prime Minister of Ukraine and Ministers from Russia and France.  More than 800 experts from 71 countries participated, nearly half of the experts coming from developing countries.  Also, the conference was attended by 208 journalists from 31 countries, the level of media coverage being unusual for technical meetings of the Agency.  A summary of the conference results is contained in the Attachment to document INFCIRC/510.
<P>
<LI>The safe management of radioactive waste is another subject on which the Agency has been involved in an intensive exchange of information, holding an international seminar from 28 to 31 August 1995 in Vienna with the participation of more than 160 experts from 52 Member States and six international organizations.  The paper presentations covered a wide spectrum of radioactive waste management issues, and the panel discussions may prove useful in the elaboration of a convention on the safe management of radioactive waste.  The proceedings of the seminar were published in December 1995 as IAEA-TECDOC-853.
<P>
<LI>From 20 to 24 November 1995, radiation protection specialists and regulators participated in an Agency-organized "International Seminar on Advancements in the Implementation of New Basic Safety Standards (Experience in Applying the 1990 Recommendations of the ICRP)".  The discussions focused on practices that give rise to - or could give rise to - radiation exposures, and there were technical sessions on:  the protection of workers, patients and the public; potential exposure situations; emergency and chronic exposure situations; administrative requirements; exemptions; interventions; and national infrastructures for implementation of the Basic Safety Standards.  Over 110 experts from 59 countries and five international organizations (72 experts from 44 developing countries) participated in the seminar.  The contributed papers are available (in document IAEA-SR-193) from the Agency's Division of Radiation and Waste Safety; the proceedings of a seminar are in preparation.
<P>
<LI>In order to promote the dissemination of safety-related scientific and technical information generated by experts from Latin American countries, the Agency co-sponsored a Regional Congress on Radiological and Nuclear Safety held in Cusco, Peru, from 23 to 27 October 1995 - the third such congress held in Latin America with Agency support.  Over 300 experts from 24 countries (six experts from four countries outside Latin America) participated in the congress, the participation of 47 of them being supported by the Agency under the ARCAL programme.  The next congress in this series (to be held in Havana, Cuba) is scheduled for 1998.
<P>
<LI>Information on a number of topical issues and policy matters relating to safety was last year once again brought together by the Secretariat in an annual "Nuclear Safety Review", which was issued as <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/worldatom/publications/yearbook/partd.html">Part D of the IAEA Yearbook 1995</A>.
<P>
<LI>The titles and publication codes of recent Agency publications intended for fostering the exchange of information on nuclear, radiation and waste safety are listed in the Appendix.
<P>
<B>Electronic network systems</B>
<P>
<LI>An "Advisory Group for Peer Reviewing the Agency Safety Related Programme" concluded in July 1995 that it was "worth reviewing the current availability of network systems, such as Internet, to be used as a main vehicle for the future fostering of information exchange by the Agency."
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat has for some time been using electronic network systems (especially e-mail) to communicate with Member States.  Owing to the limitations of e-mail as a means of exchanging scientific and technical information, however, the Secretariat is exploring other electronic communication systems, the principal aim being to make available to Member States - especially those which are developing countries - direct access to nuclear, radiation and waste safety information.  In particular, it is developing pages for the Internet in order to make information on safety available to Member States via an Internet browser.<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  It is expected that the pages will be operational by early 1997.  Also, a file transfer server has been established to facilitate the exchange of large files with Member States.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<P>
<LI>It is expected that an interesting exchange of information on health effects attributable to low ionizing radiation doses will take place at a large Agency conference scheduled for the end of 1997.

<B>Background</B>
<P>
<LI>This Annex describes Agency measures to promote education and training in - primarily - the radiation protection area.  The education and training activities in question are funded from technical co-operation resources, and the information provided below should be viewed as an expansion of information provided in document <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/documents/gc40inf3.html">GC(40)/INF/3</A> ("Technical co-operation report for 1995").
<P>
<LI>Education and training are essential in providing for the application of the Agency's safety standards, and in 1992 the General Conference - in resolution GC(XXXVI)/RES/584 - requested the Director General to prepare a report on "a possible programme of activities on education and training in radiological protection and nuclear safety".  The report prepared in response to that request and outlining an education and training programme was submitted to the General Conference in 1993.  The report included a draft Standard Syllabus of Post-Graduate Educational Courses in Radiation Protection.
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat reported to the General Conference last year on activities relating to the promotion of education and training in <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/annexb-4.html">Annex B-4</A> of the Attachment to document <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc39inf8.html">GC(39)/INF/8</A>.  Activities since the Conference's 1995 regular session are described below.
<P>
<B>Educational courses</B>
<P>
<LI>The three post-graduate courses (one each in English, French and Spanish) planned for 1995 and the first half of 1996 were held, with a total of 57 graduates participating.  The courses were designed to provide multidisciplinary theoretical and practical training related to existing international recommendations and safety standards and to their implementation for young professionals from developing countries who need to acquire a sound basis in radiation protection and a knowledge of related nuclear safety fundamentals in order to become, in the course of time, qualified experts (decision-makers and/or trainers) in their home countries.
<P>
<LI>The courses still being held during 1996 are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a Regional Post-Graduate Educational Course in Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (in Spanish) being held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 9 April to 1 November (15 Agency-sponsored participants)<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>; and
<P>
<LI>a Regional Post-Graduate Educational Course in Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (in Russian) being held at Dubna and Obninsk, Russian Federation, from 19 August to 8 November (20 Agency-sponsored participants) <A HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Meeting in Vienna from 6 to 10 November 1995, an Advisory Group on Policy in Radiation Protection Training considered - inter alia - a working paper and reference material on the Secretariat's radiation protection training efforts over the past 15 years and made recommendations concerning the development of a policy for ensuring the coherence of radiation protection training programmes.  The Group recommended that in assessing needs and planning long-range programmes the Secretariat bear in mind all the mechanisms employed for the provision of training and aim for an appropriate relationship between "basic professional training" and "specialized training".<A HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
<P>
<B>Specialized training courses/workshops</B>
<P>
<LI>Listed in the table on pages 5-7 are the interregional/regional training courses and workshops held within the framework of the Agency's technical co-operation programme during the period 1 July 1995-30 June 1996.  In addition, a number of national training courses, seminars and workshops took place within the framework of technical co-operation projects. <A HREF="#note_4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
<P>
<B>Other mechanisms</B>
<P>
<LI>In addition to organizing courses and workshops, the Agency arranges for scientists and engineers from Member States to receive training through fellowships and scientific visits, organizes seminars and produces educational and training material.
<P>
<B>Seminars</B>
<P>
<LI>An "International Seminar on Advancements in the Implementation of New Basic Safety Standards (Experience in Applying the 1990 Recommendations of the ICRP)" held in Vienna from 20 to 24 November 1995 (see Annex C-3, paragraph 5) was attended by 114 radiation protection and safety specialists and regulators from 59 countries (including 72 from 44 developing countries) and five international organizations.  The discussions focused on practices that give rise to - or could give rise to - radiation exposures, and there were technical sessions on:  the protection of workers; the protection of patients; the protection of the public; potential exposure situations; emergency and chronic exposure situations; administrative requirements; exemptions; interventions; and national infrastructures.
<P>
<LI>A regional (Africa) "Seminar on the Conditions Necessary for the Radiation Protection Infrastructure and the Legislative Framework" was held in Lusaka, Zambia, from 13 to 22 November 1995.  The purpose of the seminar, attended by 35 senior specialists from 15 African Member States, was to help countries in the region as they endeavour to meet the requirements of the Basic Safety Standards.
<P>
<LI>A regional (East Asia and the Pacific) "Seminar on Education and Training in Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety" was held in Melbourne, Australia, from 27 November to 1 December 1995.  The seminar was attended by 16 participants from 12 Member States (including 11 developing countries) - persons involved at the decision-making and the managerial level in the organization of relevant manpower development in their countries.  It provided a comprehensive overview and in-depth information relating both to the general status of education and training in radiation protection and nuclear safety and to the regional activities in that field.
<P>
<B>Educational and training material</B>
<P>
<LI>The training material prepared for one of the 1994 post-graduate courses referred to in paragraph 4 above (held in French) was published in the Agency's Training Course Series in 1995 (reference number IAEA-TCS-5), and a re-run was issued in 1996.
<P>
<LI>The training manual on "The Safe Use of Radiation Sources" was published in the Agency's Training Course Series in 1995 (IAEA-TCS-6).
<P>
<LI>A technical report on "Programmes for Post-Graduate Educational Courses" was finalized for publication in the Agency's Training Course Series.  The report - with model course contents, lecture outlines, a description of practical work and exercises, and guidelines for review/examination sessions and the evaluation of courses - is designed to facilitate integration of the Standard Syllabus into the curricula of educational institutions in Member States.
<P>
<LI>Safety-related Agency publications - including the Basic Safety Standards (Safety Series No. 115) - and guides, technical reports, training and other practical manuals, and technical documents have continued to be used extensively, together with visual aids, at educational courses and specialized training events.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<P>
<LI>In the light of recommendations made by the Advisory Group on Policy in Radiation Training (see paragraph 6 above) and discussions at the regional (East Asia and the Pacific) "Seminar on Education and Training in Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety" (see paragraph 11 above), plans are being made for a Technical Committee to prepare a Safety Guide on qualification and training requirements for radiation safety.  The Safety Guide will include revised standard syllabi for specialized radiation protection training (a revision of Technical Report Series No. 280 published in 1988) in line with the requirements of the Basic Safety Standards.

<OL>
<LI>A major purpose of the Agency's safety review and advisory services is to assist national authorities with the proper application of safety standards. The services are funded on a cost-sharing basis - i.e. Member States provide experts cost-free to recipient countries, which cover the costs of accommodation or full board and of internal travel, and the Agency (from technical co-operation resources) meets the international travel costs of the experts and a certain percentage of the applicable daily subsistence allowance.
<P>
<LI>With a view to strengthening national capabilities in the safety area on the basis of international experience, the Agency renders a wide range of safety-related services to Member States.  The Secretariat has plans for reorienting some of the Agency's safety-related services, the objective being to provide for greater flexibility and for greater emphasis on self-assessment.
<P>
<LI>A peer review of the Agency's safety-related services is being held at the end of August within the framework of the Programme Performance Assessment System (PPAS).

<P>
<LI>At the request of Member States and pursuant to its statutory obligation to provide for the application of its safety standards, the Agency has in recent years organized a wide variety of international radiological assessments.  Three such radiological assessments are described below.  The first two are related to radioactive residues from nuclear weapons testing, the other to radioactive residues from the nuclear propulsion of submarines and icebreakers.  An additional assessment, a study of the radiological situation at the Atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa, is dealt with in a separate information document prepared for the General Conference (<A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc39inf4.html">GC(40)/INF/4</A>). 
<P>
<B>Bikini Atoll</B>
<P>
<LI>At the end of last year, pursuant to a request made by the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which became an Agency Member State in January 1994, the Agency organized an international assessment of the radiological situation at Bikini Atoll.  For that purpose it convened an advisory group of experts from Australia, France, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, WHO, UNSCEAR and the Agency itself to assess the habitability of Bikini Atoll with a view in particular to answering - once and for all - the question whether the Bikini people, who had been evacuated from the atoll before the start of nuclear testing, could return safely to it and resume living there.  In the light of a meeting of the advisory group held at the Agency's Headquarters in December 1995 and attended by a delegation of the Bikini people, the Secretariat is preparing a technical report on the radiological situation at Bikini Atoll and a companion version for the non-scientific public.
<P>
<LI>The following account of the assessment of the radiological situation at Bikini Atoll draws on material which will serve as a basis for those reports.
<P>
<I>Historical context</I>
<P>
<LI>Between 1946 and 1958, Bikini Atoll was used for atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons.  It was the site of 23 of the 66 underwater, ground-level and above-ground tests conducted in the Marshall Islands.  The yield of the tests at Bikini Atoll was about 72% of the total 1.1 x 10<SUP>5</SUP> kilotonnes TNT equivalent.  As a result of the above-ground tests, and in particular the high-yield CASTLE series of tests, the land surfaces and the lagoon became extensively contaminated with radionuclides, of which caesium-137 subsequently proved to be the most radiologically important.
<P>
<LI>The inhabitants of Bikini Atoll were voluntarily relocated to Kili, a small island remote from the testing, but some of them returned after a preliminary radiological survey of the atoll in 1970.
<P>
<LI>Measurements carried out between 1975 and 1978, however, revealed that the caesium-137 body contents of the resettled people had increased by factors of about ten since their return to the atoll.  The increase was attributed to high caesium uptake from the soil by coconut trees, producing high caesium concentrations in the coconut milk and flesh consumed by the Bikini islanders, so that in 1978 the population was again relocated.  Scientific studies of the radiological conditions at Bikini Atoll have continued, but the population has not so far been able to return.
<P>
<I>The present radiological situation</I>
<P>
<LI>It is considered that, without remedial action or restrictions on their behaviour, returnees to Bikini Atoll would on average receive an annual dose of 4 mSv from the remaining contamination.  The highest plausible doses to individuals who might consume only locally grown foods rather than the more typical mix of local and imported foods are estimated to be about 15 mSv/year.
<P>
<LI>The projected doses are largely from caesium-137 in foods and the soil.  As regards the other radionuclides still present at significant levels, strontium-90 uptake in foods is low because of strong competition from high levels of (chemically similar) calcium, while plutonium and americium isotopes are largely "trapped" in lagoon sediments, uptake into fish and other forms of seafood being extremely low.
<P>
<I>Relevant radiological protection criteria</I>
<P>
<LI>In radiological protection terms, the contamination of Bikini Atoll represents a chronic exposure situation in which one form of intervention (evacuation of the population) has already occurred and other forms of intervention (remedial measures) are being considered in order to allow the population to return.  International radiological protection guidance on intervention in a range of chronic exposure situations suggests that some form of intervention to reduce or avert exposure is normally necessary if doses to the most exposed people would otherwise exceed about 10 mSv/year.
<P>
<I>Remedial measures</I>
<P>
<LI>The remedial strategy preferred by the advisory group is soil removal in residential areas and potassium treatment of the existing soil in crop-growing areas.  Soil removal would reduce doses from external exposure, and from inhalation and inadvertent ingestion of soil, in the areas where islanders spend most time.  The potassium treatment would reduce doses from intakes of caesium in food, the main contributor to the overall projected doses.
<P>
<LI>The Bikini soils are deficient in potassium, so that caesium - which is chemically similar - is readily taken up by plants.  Experiments have shown that if potassium, in the form of fertilizer or potassium chloride, is added to soils so that there is much more potassium than caesium available to plants, the uptake of caesium can be reduced dramatically.  On the basis of extensive trials, it has been estimated that a programme of potassium treatment, repeated every 4-5 years, would reduce caesium-137 concentrations in typical Bikini foods to well below the Agency-endorsed FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius guidelines for international trade in foodstuffs.  Projected doses would be reduced to about 0.4 mSv/year from the normal mix of local and imported foods, or to 1.2 mSv/year from a diet of exclusively local produce.
<P>
<LI>An alternative option would be to remove the topsoil from the crop-growing areas as well as the residential ones.  This would undoubtedly be effective in reducing exposures, perhaps more so than the potassium treatment.  However, it would generate very large volumes of soil requiring safe disposal.  Furthermore, replacement soil would need to be imported.  The financial, environmental and social costs of this option would probably be much greater than what is normally considered to be justified by the benefit in terms of reduced radiation exposures.
<P>
<I>Conclusions</I>
<P>
<LI>On the basis of the advisory group's deliberations, it has been concluded that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)	there are technically and financially feasible remedial measures which would allow Bikini Atoll to be reinhabited in accordance with international radiological protection principles;
<P>

<P>
<B>The Semipalatinsk test site</B>
<P>
<LI>In 1994, at the request of the Government of Kazakstan, the Agency initiated a radiological assessment of the former nuclear test site to the east of the Kazakh city of Semipalatinsk (the Semipalatinsk test site).  The site, with an area of some 19 000 km<SUP>2</SUP>, is located in the north-eastern part of Kazakstan, about 800 km north of the capital Almaty.
<P>
<I>Historical background</I>
<P>
<LI>At this site, 467 nuclear tests with a total yield of about 2 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> kilotonnes TNT equivalent were carried out during the period 1949-89, for military and peaceful purposes.
<P>
<LI>The earliest tests were carried out above ground (atmospheric and surface tests), 124 above-ground tests being carried out between 1949 and 1962.  The above-ground tests released significant amounts of caesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium into the atmosphere.  Much of the plutonium was released in the course of five failed tests.
<P>
<LI>The other 343 tests were carried out underground.  In one of them, carried out in 1965 for the purpose of building a dam across a small river, venting resulted in the release of radioactivity into the atmosphere and in the formation of a lake (which became known as "Lake Balapan").
<P>
<I>The Agency expert survey and review team</I>
<P>
<LI>According to records made available to the expert team assembled by the Agency's Secretariat, most of the radioactivity released into the atmosphere (the "radioactive plumes") travelled south to beyond the southern boundary of the test site and then veered sharply east and soon after that sharply north.  There are now some 30-40 000 people living in settlements, close to - but outside - the test site boundary, above which radioactive plumes passed.  It is the radiological situations at these settlements which constitute the principal concern of the Government of Kazakstan.
<P>
<LI>The expert team visited some of the settlements in order to assess the current radiological situations in the areas in question.  The experts measured external gamma dose rates and radionuclide concentrations in food (such as meat, milk and vegetables) and environmental samples (such as grass, soil and moss) and studied the use which people were making of the environment.
<P>
<LI>In view of the fact that the estimated average annual exposure of persons outside the test site due to the residual radioactive material is less than 0.1 mSv<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, or around one twentieth of the average natural background, the expert group has concluded that a more detailed radiological assessment should not be regarded as a priority task. 
<P>
<I>On-site radiological conditions</I>
<P>
<LI>There are fewer measurement data available from within the test site.  However, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that most of the test site is no different from the surrounding region.  Clear exceptions are the Ground Zero and Lake Balapan areas, which are heavily contaminated.  The measurements carried out in the Ground Zero area are sufficient for determining the contamination pattern; they indicate, in particular, that the contamination is relatively localized.  The expert group has recommended a similar type of survey for the Lake Balapan area in order to determine whether the same conclusion applies.
<P>
<LI>There is no restriction of access to the test site, and limited reoccupation has already begun.  An assessment of the exposure of a critical group of settlers who visit the Ground Zero and Lake Balapan areas on a daily basis has been undertaken.  It indicates annual exposures of about 10 mSv, due predominantly to external radiation.  There are not yet any permanent settlements within the Ground Zero and Lake Balapan areas.  Should permanent settlements be established there in the future, the estimated annual exposures would be approximately 140 mSv/year.  This is well in excess of the intervention level for chronic exposure situations given in paragraph 9 above, and restriction of public access to these areas is recommended as the most feasible and effective protective action.
<P>
<B>The International Arctic Seas Assessment Project </B>
<P>
<I>Background</I>
<P>
<LI>An International Arctic Seas Assessment Project (IASAP) was launched in 1993 to address concerns over the potential health and environmental impacts of radioactive waste (including spent fuel in six submarine reactors and in a fuel assembly from an icebreaker reactor) dumped in shallow waters of the Kara and Barents Seas, near the Novaya Zemlya nuclear test site.  The IASAP is being executed in connection with the Agency's responsibilities under the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (the London Convention 1972), and the progress of the IASAP has been reviewed each year by a group of senior scientists who are responsible for preparing the final IASAP report with recommendations for presentation to the Contracting Parties to the London Convention by the end of 1996.
<P>
<LI>A report on the IASAP was submitted to the General Conference last year in Attachment 3 to document GC(39)/11.  As indicated in that report, the dumped waste does not involve a significant environmental risk at present.
<P>
<LI>Since the General Conference's 1995 session, possible time patterns for future releases of long-lived radionuclides from the dumped waste have been worked out on the basis of analyses of the weak points of protective barriers and assessments of protective barrier and spent fuel corrosion.
<P>
<I>Predicted future radiological impact</I>
<P>
<LI>The results of critical group dose and collective dose calculations performed on the basis of predicted radionuclide releases are still being analysed.  They indicate, however, that on the global and regional scale the future risks to human health and the environment associated with the dumped waste are extremely low.  Also, the calculations show that the future radiation doses to members of the indigenous population groups living on the northern coast of Russia are likely to be trivial.  The future doses to one of the potentially critical groups, soldiers patrolling the shores of the bays of Novaya Semlya (the actual dumping sites), are expected to be somewhat higher - but not dissimilar to general background levels.
<P>
<I>Remedial actions</I>
<P>
<LI>The feasibility and costs of potential remedial actions, such as the in situ capping or the retrieval of the major dumped objects, have been assessed for on test case, as have the associated doses to the workforce carrying out the remediation.  The costs would be very high relative to the possible avertable doses.  On the other hand, if the remedial actions were taken for reasons other than radiological protection ones, the associated exposure of the workforce would probably not be significant.
 </OL>
<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
<A NAME="note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>	This estimate is deliberately conservative; actual exposures are likely to be lower and close to the global average from fallout.

<head><title>Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident</title></head>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<h2>Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident</h2>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<h3>Background</h3>
Adopted in 1986 following the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident, this Convention establishes a
notification system for nuclear accidents which have the potential for international
transboundary release that could be of radiological safety significance for another State. It
requires States to report the accident's time, location, radiation releases,
and other data essential for assessing the situation. Notification is to be made to affected
States directly or through the IAEA, and to the IAEA itself.
Reporting is mandatory for any nuclear accident involving facilities and activities listed in
Article 1. Pursuant to Article 3, States may notify other accidents as well. The five
nuclear-weapon States (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and United
States) have all declared their intent also to report accidents involving nuclear weapons and
nuclear weapons tests.<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<h2>Convention on Assistance in the  Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological
Emergency</h2>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<h3>Background</h3>
Adopted in 1986 following the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident, this Convention sets out
an international framework for co-operation among States Parties and with the IAEA to
facilitate prompt assistance and support in the event of
nuclear accidents or radiological emergencies. It requires States to notify the IAEA of their
available experts, equipment,
and other materials for providing assistance. In case of a request, each State Party decides
whether it can render the requested assistance as well as its scope and terms. Assistance may
be offered without costs taking into account inter alia the needs of developing
countries and the particular needs of countries without  nuclear facilities. The IAEA serves as
the focal point for such
cooperation by channelling information, supporting efforts, and providing its available
services.

<H2>Convention on Nuclear Safety</H2>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<H3>Background</H3>
The <A HREF="inf449.html">Convention on Nuclear Safety</A> was adopted in Vienna on
17 June 1994.  The Convention was drawn up during a series of expert level meetings from
1992 to 1994 and was the result of considerable work by Governments, national nuclear
safety authorities and the Agency's Secretariat.  Its aim is to legally commit participating
States operating land-based nuclear power plants to maintain a high level of safety by setting
international benchmarks to which States would subscribe.

     <P>The obligations of the Parties are based to a large extent on the principles
contained in the IAEA Safety Fundamentals document "The Safety of Nuclear Installations". 
These obligations cover for instance, siting, design, construction, operation, the availability of
adequate financial and human resources, the assessment and verification of safety, quality
assurance and emergency preparedness.

     <P>The Convention is an incentive instrument.  It is not designed to ensure fulfillment
of obligations by Parties through control and sanction but is based on their common interest
to achieve higher levels of safety which will be developed and promoted through regular
meetings of the Parties.  The Convention obliges Parties to submit reports on the
implementation of their obligations for "peer review" at meetings of the Parties to be held at
the IAEA.  This mechanism is the main innovative and dynamic element of the Convention.

<P>
The <A HREF="inf274r1.html">Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material</A>, signed at Vienna and at New York on 3 March 1980, obliges Contracting States to ensure during international nuclear transport the protection of nuclear material within their territory or on board their ships or
aircraft.
<P>
Pursuant to Article 16 of the Convention, the first Review Conference was held in Vienna
from 29 September to 1 October 1992 and attended by 35 States Parties. The Review
Conference unanimously expressed its full support for the Convention and urged all States to
take action to become party to the Convention. The Parties considered, in particular, that the
Convention provides an appropriate framework for international co-operation in protection,
recovery and return of stolen nuclear material and in the application of criminal sanctions
against persons who commit criminal acts involving nuclear material.

<H2>IAEA Laboratories at Seibersdorf</H2>
<hr>  
<P>
Established in 1962, the Agency's Seibersdorf Laboratories help implement the IAEA 's programmes in food and agriculture,
human health, environmental and earth sciences, radiation protection, and safeguards. They provide scientific services
including quality control and chemical and radiochemical analyses and conduct research and development related to
the IAEA's coordinated research programmes and technical cooperation activities. The Laboratories also train scientists
from developing countries with emphasis on transferring nuclear and related techniques necessary to carry out Agency projects
<P>
Activities at the Laboratories emphasize quality assurance procedures meant to instill confidence in the use of transferred technologies as well as 
to provide reliance on data generated by national and regional laboratories. Efforts are made to focus on techniques which contribute to environmental
monitoring and protection and lead to sustainable development practices. The Agency's laboratories cooperate and collaborate with
laboratories in developing countries which have been identified as focal points for the creation or strengthening
of national or regional infrastructures in nuclear energy fields. At its headquarters in Vienna, the IAEA also operates
an Isotope Hydrology Laboratory in support of its programs in areas of water resource management and development.
<br>
The IAEA Laboratories in Seibersdorf include the:
<P>
<H3>Agriculture Laboratory</H3>
<P>
The Agriculture Laboratory, operated jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations,
 provides technical and scientific support to joint programmes of the IAEA and FAO in soil fertility, 
irrigation and crop production, plant mutation breeding, animal production and disease diagnosis, insect and pest control and 
agrochemicals and residues. It places particular emphasis on developing appropriate nuclear and related
techniques that could be trasnferred to developing countries. The laboratory includes five branches:
<DL>
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Soil Science Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Plant Breeding Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Entomology Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Agrochemicals Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Animal Production Unit
</DL>
<H3>Physics, Chemistry, Instrumentation Laboratory</H3>
The Physics, Chemistry, Instrumentation (PCI) Laboratory provides technical and experimental support to IAEA 
programmes in physical and chemical sciences, industry and earth sciences and human helath. It also performs specialized tasks for the 
Departmnet of Nuclear Energy in the field of radiation safety and protection, for example, measuring radionuclides in food
and the environment. The PCI Laboratory also helps the Department of Safeguards in special analyses and mechanical and equipment construction.
The PCI laboratory has four branches:
<DL>
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Chemistry Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Instrumentation Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Dosimetry Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Isotope Hydrology Unit
</DL>
<H3>Safeguards Analytical Laboratory</H3>
The Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) analyzes samples taken from key measurement points of the fuel cycle
to meet the requirements of safeguards accounting verification. To accommodate the large number of samples to 
be analyzed, SAL works with a network of analytical laboratories that comply with IAEA quality assurance and are nominated
by Member States. In cooperation with the training section of the Department of Safeguards, SAL also conducts a
training programme for safeguards inspectors to demonstrate the requirements for acquiring and handling samples and for making on-site destructive analyses.
SAL is comprised of the:
<DL>
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Chemical Analysis Unit
<DD><IMG SRC=/worldatom/images/triblue.gif align=bottom> Isotopic Analysis Unit
</DL>
<H3>Clean Laboratory</H3>
Construction has started on a Clean Laboratory in Seibersdorf which will serve as the focal point for environmental
monitoring for safeguards purposes. It will receive, analyze  and distribute to the network of analytical laboratories 
special samples taken during ad hoc safeguards inspections to confirm the absence of undeclared nuclear 
activities.

<H2>IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory</H2></a>
<hr>
<P>
The IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) in Monaco is the only marine laboratory within the United Nations
system. Besides carrying out IAEA core programmes, IAEA-MEL also responds to requests for technical and experimental assistance from
other UN agencies. The application of nuclear and isotopic techniques and the improved understanding of marine radioactivity continue to be central to the Laboratory's
work. The Laboratory has been engaged in studies assessing the impact of radioactive waste dumping in the 
Arctic Seas, marine effects from the Gulf war, the carbon cycle and greenhouse effect, Chernobyl radioactivity in the oceans, and pesticide run-off and toxicity to
coastal fisheries.<P>
<H3>Technical Co-operation</H3>
In co-operation with the IAEA Department of Research and Isotopes, IAEA-MEL organizes training courses on 
topics such as marine radioecology, marine pollutant monitoring.
The general aim is to increase the capacity of the international community to monitor and control pollution of the 
marine environment via a mixed programme of in-house and field training, equipment installation, and maintenance 
and laboratory visits.
<h3>Analytical Quality Assurance Service</h3>
The IAEA-MEL is a worldwide centre for data quality assurance for all kinds of chemical contaminants, both nuclear
and non-nuclear. It carries our regional exercises in the Mediterranean, the Gulf area, the western Pacific, west
and central Africa, and the Black Sea.
<h3>Method Development</h3>
IAEA-MEL continues to work on developing new, more efficient and more cost-effective laboratory methods for monitoring, studying
and controlling marine pollutants, both nuclear and non-nuclear. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is at the forefront of this
activity. It is also developing rapid mapping techniques for use in emergency response, as well as routine surveillance and mineralogical 
prospection.
<h3>Marine Processes</h3>
In order to obtain information on the behaviour and fate of radionuclides and other potential pollutants in the 
marine environment, scientists at IAEA-MEL participate in numerous scientific cruises in the Mediterranean, North Atlantic,
and the Black Sea region, sometimes under the aegis of IAEA co-ordinated research programmes. The Laboratory also participates in 
the "International Mussel Watch" experiment, which studies the global pattern of pesticide residue contamination by 
measuring concentrations of these substances in samples of the common mussels from countries throughout the world.
<h3> Nuclear Techniques in Studies of Non-Nuclear Contaminants</h3>
There is an increasing need in developing countries to gain knowledge in nuclear techniques for studying non-nuclear contaminants.
Among areas in which the Laboratory helps in this transition are in tracer studies using radiolabelled compounds, immunological
analyses and stable isotope techniques and multi-element analyses using mass spectrometry.

The <B>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</B>, in co-operation with the <B>World Meteorological Organization (WMO)</B>, 
is conducting a worldwide survey of oxygen and hydrogen  isotope content in precipitation. The programme was 
initiated in 1958 and became operational in 1961. The main initial objective was the systematic collection of basic 
data on isotope content of precipitation on a global scale to detrmine temporal and spatial variations of environmental
isotopes in precipitation and, consequently, to provide basic isotope data for the use of environmental isotopes in 
hydrological investigations within the scope of water resources inventory, planning and development.
<P>Although this primary objective is still thought to be of importance for the future, in recent years two other objectives 
have become more and more important, namely to provide input data for verification and further improvement of 
atmospheric circulation models, and for climatological investigations.

        Since 1961, more than 500 meteorological stations in 93 countries and territories
  have been collecting monthly precipitation samples for the <B>IAEA/WMO</B>
  Isotopes-in-Precipitation Network. (The locations of the stations which contributed
  to this database are shown in Fig. 1.)<BR><IMG SRC = "sta1.gif">

  month for tritium, deuterium and oxygen-18 analysis.  Samples are then shipped to various laboratories for analysis.
  At present, approximately 40% of the stable isotope and 30% of
  the tritium samples from all network stations are sent to the <B>IAEA</B> Laboratory in
  Vienna for analysis.  The remainder are forwarded to <A HREF="lablist.htm">co-operating laboratories</A> for
  analysis of either tritium, or  deuterium and oxygen-18, or both.

 <H3>2.2. Non-network data</H3>

        The data collected on a routine basis by stations belonging to the national networks
  provided to the <B>IAEA</B> are included in this database if they are compatible with
  the present data reporting system.
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="cont_3"> 3.    STATION AND SAMPLE INFORMATION</A></H2>
 <H3>3.1. Station data</H3>

            Certain basic information is, whenever available, given for each station or
     location for which isotope data are reported.   Other basic information
     has been taken from <B>WMO</B> publications [<A HREF="#ref_1"> 1</A>,<A HREF="#ref_2"> 2</A>,<A HREF="#ref_3"> 3</A> ] or  was  received in answer to enquiries made to <B>WMO</B> or co-operating laboratories submitting the isotope data.  This information
     includes the following items:


<H4>3. 1. 1. Index number</H4>

           The system of station index numbers is based on one evolved by <B>WMO</B> for
     identifying observation stations, but the numbers, names and locations used in the
     <B>IAEA</B> network sometimes differ from those employed by <B>WMO</B>.  This number has
     the general format II iii j, i.e. the block number (II), the station number (iii) and
     the substation number (jj).  Locations for which samples are available are hereafter
     referred to as stations for brevity.
          <P> Each station has a block number (II) which parallels the <B>WMO</B> block number
     and defines the area from which the isotopic data come.  Each station has a station
     number (iii) which parallels the <B>WMO</B> station number.  These correspond to a
     common block number (II), except Block 89, and are usually distributed so that the
     zone covered by the block number is divided into horizontal strips of one or several
     degrees of latitude.  Where possible, station numbers within each strip increase from
     west to east and the first figure of the three-figure station number increases from
     north to south.
          <P> Station index numbers for samples from the Antarctic are allocated under a
     special <B>WMO</B> scheme.
          <P> In addition, each station has a substation number (jj) for which the <B>WMO</B> index
     system does not have an equivalent.  When the sampling station corresponds to the
     location of a <B>WMO</B> station, the substation number will be 00.  When a sampling station 
     is located away from any <B>WMO</B> station it is assigned the block code and station
     number of the nearest <B>WMO</B> station and is given the substation code number 01, 02,
     03, etc.
          <P> In all respects other than the substation number, index numbers for isotope
     sampling stations correspond to the <B>WMO</B> station indexing number (Fig. 2).
<IMG SRC = "map2.gif">
  <H4> 3.1.2. Name</H4>

           Official <B>WMO</B> station names are used for those meteorological stations participating
     in the <B>IAEA/WMO</B> network.  The best known geographic name or the
     name used by the laboratory submitting the data is used in other cases.

   <H4>3.1.3. Latitude and longitude</H4>

           Latitude and longitude are given in degrees and hundredths.

  <H4> 3.1.4. Altitude</H4>

              The altitude is given in metres above (below) mean sea level.  For <B>WMO</B>
        stations it is the elevation of the average level of the terrain in the immediate vicinity
        of the sampling location.

  <H3> 3.2. Meteorological data</H3>

   <H4>3.2.1. General</H4>

              The great majority of annual and monthly meteorological data for network
        stations are supplied by the local authorities in charge of the stations.  For some of
        the network stations and for most of the non-network stations meteorological data
        were compiled from <B>WMO</B> publications <A HREF="#ref_1">[1</A>, <A HREF="#ref_3">3]</A> .

  <H4> 3.2.2. Precipitation</H4>

              Precipitation is given in millimetres (mm). The total monthly precipitation values are rounded off to the
        nearest unit.  Therefore, trace amounts of precipitation in a given month would
        appear as 0 if they are less than 0.5 mm.

  <H4> 3.2.3. Type of precipitation</H4>

              The type of precipitation falling during the month is given when known. R-rain, S-snow, M-rain+snow.

  <H4> 3.2.4.   Vapour pressure</H4>

              Water vapour pressure is given in millibars (mb).
        The vapour pressure values have been calculated from temperature and relative humidity.

   <H4>3.2.5. Temperature</H4>

              The temperature is given in degrees Celsius and tenths.

   <H3>3.3. Sample/analysis information</H3>

  <H4> 3.3.1. Date of sampling</H4>

             The samples are composites from the total precipitation
       at a station during one month.  The time of collection is identified under the columns
       year and month. 

   <H4>3.3.2.   Tritium concentration</H4>

             The tritium content in each sample is given in tritium units (TU) and has been
       corrected for decay to the middle of the month.  One TU is defined as one atom of
       tritium per 10^18 atoms of hydrogen, equivalent to 0.118 becquerels (Bq) per litre of water.
       The tritium half-life has been fixed as 12.43 years <A HREF="#ref_4">[4]</A>.
            <P> The analytical error for tritium analysis is given in TU when known.  <EM><B>Each
       contributing laboratory is responsible for the accuracy and precision of its own
       analyses.</B></EM>

  <H4>3.3.3. Deuterium/oxygen-18 concentration</H4>

             Deuterium and oxygen-18 contents of the samples are measured on a mass
       spectrometer as ratios of deuterium/hydrogen and     oxygen-18/O-16 . They are expressed in terms of the
       per mille deviation of the isotope ratio from a standard.  The measurements reported
       here have a long term precision of about +- 0.1per mil for oxygen-18 and +- 1per mil for
       deuterium, at one standard deviation level.
             <P>The reference standard used is called Vienna-SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean
       Water) as defined by Craig <A HREF="#ref_5">[5]</A> and Gonfiantini <A HREF="#ref_6">[6]</A>.
       The data are expressed in dimensionless delta values as defined by:<BR>

   <H2> <A NAME="cont_4">4. QUALITY OF THE DATA</A></H2>

                 To date, approximately 250 000 isotope and meteorological values have been
           accumulated in the IAEA database.  A critical analysis of the quality of the stored
      information was recently carried out.  In the first instance, obvious errors in the database
      (typing mistakes, reversed signs, etc.) were eliminated.  The second part of the
      data cleaning procedure consisted of rejection of outliers, identified according to the
      chosen statistical criteria <A HREF="#ref_7">[7]</A>.  In a few cases, a substantial portion of the available
      data record had to be removed from the database.  This concerns, for instance, the
      stations Kaitaia and Invercargill in New Zealand <A HREF="#ref_8">[8]</A> and Alexandria, Egypt, where
      errors in the sample collection procedure had been identified.
             <P>The database undergoes frequent updating: new data, corrections or revisions
      received from participating laboratories are introduced at regular intervals.
             <P>In several cases, the tritium values reported for a given station substantially
      exceed the expected level, indicating local sources of technogenic tritium and/or
      contamination during collection of the samples (e.g. Bern, Switzerland; St. Petersburg, Russia).

<HR>

  <H2> <A NAME="cont_5">5. AVAILABILITY OF THE DATA</A></H2>
             All data collected since 1961 has been published by the <B>IAEA</B> in the form as Technical Report Series <a href="#ref_10">[10]</a>.
            <p> It is intended to discontinue publication of future network data in the form of
      printed Technical Reports.  The entire, cleaned database is <B>now available for <A HREF="gnipmain.htm#download">downloading</A>
      in the form of compressed, self-extracting files in Lotus&reg; or ASCII format for stations grouped by regions.</B>
             <P>The statistical evaluation of isotope and meteorological data accumulated up to
      the end of 1987 has been published as IAEA Technical Reports Series No. 331,
      entitled "Statistical Treatment of Data on Environmental Isotopes in Precipitation"
      <A HREF="#ref_7">[7]</A>.  In this publication, tables and graphs are presented for each station, illustrating the most
      characteristic features of the accumulated data.
             <P>The basic features of the spatial and temporal distribution of deuterium and
      oxygen-18 in global precipitation, as derived from the IAEA/WMO database, have been
      discussed in a review paper <A HREF="#ref_9">[9]</A>.

<center><p><b><font SIZE=+2>WHAT IS PRIS</font></b></p></center>

<p>Since 1970, the IAEA has been collecting and publishing data about the
world's nuclear power plants. In order to facilitate the analysis of power
plant performance and to produce relevant publications, the data were computerized
in 1980, and the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) was implemented.
Since then, PRIS has been continuously updated and improved and it now
constitutes the most complete data bank on nuclear power reactors in the
world. It has been widely used and today constitutes an essential source
of information on nuclear power. </p>

<p>PRIS covers two kinds of data: general and design information on power
reactors, and information about operating experience with nuclear power
plants. General and design information covers all reactors that are in
operation, under construction, or shut-down in IAEA Member States, and
in Taiwan, China. Data on operating experience cover operational reactors,
and historical data cover shutdown reactors, in IAEA Member States and
in Taiwan, China. In these areas PRIS is considered the most complete and
authoritative source of statistical data. </p>

<p>PRIS makes it possible to easily identify individual nuclear units and
their main characteristics, and to determine nuclear power development
status and trends worldwide, in regions, or in individual countries. The
IAEA has compiled information on additional technical characteristics.
It covers items related to the mode of plant operation, safety characteristics,
safety features, existence of safety analysis reports and of emergency
plans, and the plant environment, for example. This additional information
on plant characteristics provides a better overview of plant design and
mode of operation. </p>

<p>In order to assess plant performance, indicators are used. PRIS provides
information on availability and unavailability factors, load factor, planned
unavailability factor, and unplanned unavailability factors due to causes
at the plant and externally. </p>

<p>Outage analysis provides indications on the reasons for a plant's unavailability.
Statistical analysis, as well as studies of individual units or utilities,
can provide indications about problem areas and what remedial actions and
measures can be applied to achieve performance improvements. PRIS provides
data in support of such analyses.

The acronym WWER stands for Water Water Energetic Reactors, which are pressurized water reactors designed in the former Soviet Union. The reactor core is composed of fuel rods made of low enriched uranium dioxide, enclosed in zirconium cladding, in a hexagonal geometry. The steam generators are horizontal types.
<HR SIZE=3>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>WWER-440/230</STRONG>
<DD>This is the oldest model. It has six loops and six horizontal steam generators. It produces 440 MWe in two turbines. It has no containment; the primary circuit is contained in compartments which serve to localize accidents. The emergency core cooling system was originally designed only to cope with a rupture of a maximum diameter of 32mm.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>WWER-440/213</STRONG>
<DD>This is the second generation of WWERs. It has also six loops and six steam generators. The total electrical output is 440 MWe in two turbines. It has a containment of the barbotage tower type. The emergency core cooling system is composed of four hydro-accumulators, four high pressure safety injection trains and four low pressure safety injection trains, designed to cope with a doubleended guillotine break.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>WWER-1000</STRONG>
<DD>This is the latest design of WWER's. It has four loops and four steam generators. The electrical output is 1000 MWe in a single turbine-generator set. It has a large dry containment. The emergency core cooling system is composed of four trains, each one of them containing hydro-accumulators, high pressure safety injection pumps, and low pressure safety injection pumps.

<HR SIZE=3>
RBMK is the acronym for graphite moderated, boiling water cooled channel type reactors designed in the former Soviet Union. The core is composed of fuel rods of low enriched uranium dioxide pellets enclosed in zirconium (2.5 % niobium) cladding. The rods are arranged in hexagonal fuel assemblies which are placed inside pressure fuel channels. The fuel channels are installed in a graphite matrix. The channels are cooled by water which boils as it goes through the channels. Drums separate the steam from the water. The steam drives the turbine and the water is recirculated to the channels via main circulating pumps and group distribution headers.

<HR><P><H3>WHAT IS AGRIS</H3><P>
                                                                          

AGRIS, the International Information System for Agricultural Sciences and Technology, was created by <A HREF="http://www.fao.org/">FAO</A> (link to FAO homepage, Rome, Italy) to facilitate the exchange of information and to identify the worldwide literature dealing with all aspects of agriculture including: plant and animal production and protection; post harvest processing of primary agricultural products; forestry; fisheries; agricultural engineering; natural resources and the environment as related to agriculture; food; human nutrition; agricultural economics; rural development; and agricultural administration, legislation, information, education and extension.<P>

AGRIS collects bibliographic references to materials, which may be either conventional (journal articles, books) or non-conventional (sometimes called "grey literature"), e.g. theses, reports, etc., not available through normal commercial channels.<P>

AGRIS is a cooperative system in which participating countries input references to the literature produced within their boundaries and, in return, draw on the information provided by the other participants.  158 national and 28 regional and international centres participate and submit about 13.000 items per month.  Two regional centres submit input on behalf of 9 countries in their respective regions.<P>

The system is managed by the AGRIS/CARIS Coordinating Group, Library and Documentation Systems Division, FAO, Rome, which also maintains the AGRIS methodology, the working tools, provides training and furnishes self-teaching material.<P>

To open the system to non-English-speaking users, FAO and the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) developed a multilingual agricultural vocabulary, AGROVOC, which has been used by AGRIS for indexing and retrieval since 1986.  The English, French, Spanish, German and Italian versions of AGROVOC appeared in 1982, and the Arabic version in 1993. The Portuguese version is presently being prepared. At present, the database can only be searched with the aid of AGROVOC, in English, French and Spanish. The second edition of AGROVOC was used for the AGRIS database from 1992 to 1995. As of 1996 the third preliminary edition is in use. It is being printed by FAO.<P>

AGRIN, a microcomputer package based on Unesco's CDS/ISIS, is a new working tool for the AGRIS participating centres.  It enables them to exchange data with the Coordinating Centre as well as build up local data bases compatible with AGRIS.

<P><H3>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</H3><P>

Since 1975, when the system became operational, AGRIS has accumulated a data base of more than 2.6 million references.  The data forwarded by participating countries is processed in Vienna at the AGRIS Processing Unit which is hosted, under contractual arrangement, by the Division of Scientific and Technical Information of the IAEA.  It is made available to users in several forms: 
<P><UL>
<LI>
   <B> Agrindex</B>, the AGRIS monthly bibliography issued in English, French and Spanish versions (discontinued December 1995); approximately 21% of the entries in Agrindex include abstracts;
   <LI><B> Magnetic tapes</B> with the same information, which are sent to AGRIS centres on demand; 

 
<LI>
<B>On-line access</B> to the global data base is provided by a number of hosts: DIALOG (Palo Alto, non-US portion only) and DIMDI (Cologne). The portion of the AGRIS database which does not appear in the current AGRIS CD-ROM is available on-line at IAEA (Vienna).  Users, who must be equipped with a suitable microcomputer or terminal, can reach the hosts via telephone, telex, or through various public packet switching networks and international telecommunication networks such as TYMNET or DATEX-P; 

   
<LI>
<B>CD-ROM</B>, Compact Disk Read-Only-Memory, is a medium capable of storing large quantities of information (500 million characters).  Any user with a relatively inexpensive microcomputer and CD-ROM reader may benefit from it. The AGRIS archival 6-disc set covering 1975-1994 and the current 1995- (updated quarterly), and the AGRIS FHN (Food and Human Nutrition) disc covering 1975-present (updated semi-annually), are available from <A HREF="#Silverplatter">SilverPlatter.</A>

<HR><P><H3>QU'EST-CE QU'AGRIS ?</H3><P>

AGRIS, Syst&egraveme international d'information sur les sciences et la technologie
agricoles a &eacutet&eacute cr&eacute&eacute par la <A HREF="http://www.fao.org/">FAO</A> (lien page d'accueil FAO, Rome, Italie) pour faciliter l'&eacutechange
d'informations et identifier la litt&eacuterature mondiale traitant des divers aspects de
l'agriculture y compris : production et protection v&eacuteg&eacutetales et animales,
technologie apr&egraves r&eacutecolte, foresterie, p&ecircches, g&eacutenie agricole,
ressources naturelles et environnement, alimentation, nutrition humaine, &eacuteconomie
agricole, d&eacuteveloppement rural, administration agricole, l&eacutegislation agricole,
information, &eacuteducation et vulgarisation agricoles.<P>

AGRIS collecte les notices bibliographiques des documents qui peuvent &ecirctre
conventionnels (articles de p&eacuteriodiques, livres) ou non-conventionnels,
appel&eacutes parfois litt&eacuterature grise, exemple: th&egraveses, rapports, etc.., non
disponibles &agrave travers les circuits commerciaux du livre.<P>

AGRIS est un syst&egraveme coop&eacuteratif auquel les pays participants entrent les
r&eacutef&eacuterences de la litt&eacuterature produite &agrave l'int&eacuterieur de
leurs fronti&egraveres et re&ccedil;oivent, en retour, l'information fournie par les autres
participants.  158 centres nationaux et 28 centres r&eacutegionaux et internationaux
participent et fournissent pr&egraves de 14.000 r&eacutef&eacuterences par mois.  2
centres r&eacutegionaux pr&eacuteparent les entr&eacutees de 9 autres pays de leurs
r&eacutegions respectives.<P>

Le syst&egraveme est g&eacuter&eacute par le Groupe de coordination AGRIS/CARIS,
Division de la biblioth&egraveque et des syst&egravemes documentaires, FAO, Rome,
qui maintient aussi la m&eacutethodologie AGRIS, les outils de travail, assure la
formation et fournit le mat&eacuteriel autodidactique.<P>

Pour permettre l'exploitation du syst&egraveme par les utilisateurs non-anglophones, la
FAO et la CCE ont pr&eacutepar&eacute un Th&eacutesaurus agricole multilingue,
AGROVOC, utilis&eacute depuis 1986, pour l'indexation et la recherche dans AGRIS. 
Les versions: anglaise, fran&ccedil;aise, espagnole, allemande et italienne de ce
Th&eacutesaurus ont &eacutet&eacute publi&eacutees en 1982 et la version arabe en
1993, tandis que la version  portugaise est en pr&eacuteparation.  Pour le moment la base
de donn&eacutees peut &ecirctre interrog&eacutee en utilisant AGROVOC en anglais,
fran&ccedil;ais et espagnol.  La deuxi&egraveme &eacutedition d'AGROVOC a
&eacutet&eacute utilis&eacutee pour la base de donn&eacutees depuis 1992
jusqu'&agrave 1995. A partir de 1996 la troisi&egraveme &eacutedition
pr&eacuteliminaire d'AGROVOC est utilis&eacutee. Cette &eacutedition se fait imprimer
par la FAO.<P>

AGRIN, le programme pour micro-ordinateur bas&eacute sur Micro CDS/ISIS de
l'Unesco, est un outil moderne de travail pour les centres participant &agrave AGRIS; il
leur permet d'&eacutechanger leurs donn&eacutees avec le Centre de coordination tout en
construisant des bases de donn&eacutees locales compatibles avec AGRIS.<P>

<H3>PRODUITS ET SERVICES</H3><P>

Depuis que le syst&egraveme est devenu op&eacuterationnel en 1975, la base de
donn&eacutees AGRIS a accumul&eacute plus de 2.6 millions de
r&eacutef&eacuterences. Les donn&eacutees fournies par les centres participants sont trait&eacutees &agrave Vienne par l'Unit&eacute de traitement AGRIS maintenue sous
contrat aupr&egraves de la Divison d'information scientifique et technique de l'AIEA. Les
donn&eacutees AGRIS sont disponibles sous plusieurs formes:

<LI>
<STRONG>Agrindex,</STRONG> la bibliographie mensuelle d'AGRIS publi&eacutee en anglais, fran&ccedil;ais
     et espagnol; environ 21% des entr&eacutees dans Agrindex comprennent des

<HR><P><H3>QUE ES EL AGRIS?</H3><P>
El AGRIS, Sistema internacional de informacin sobre ciencias y tecnologa agrcolas, fue 
creado por la <A HREF="http://www.fao.org/">FAO</A> (FAO homepage, Rome, Italia) para facilitar el intercambio de informacin e identificar la literatura 
mundial relativa a los diversos aspectos de la agricultura: produccin y proteccin de las 
plantas y los animales, tecnologa postcosecha, actividades forestales, pesca, ingeniera 
agrcola, recursos naturales y medio ambiente, alimentacin, nutricin humana, economa 
agrcola, desarrollo rural, administracin agrcola, legislacin agrcola, informacin, enseanza 
y extensin agrarias.<P>

El AGRIS recoge las referencias bibliogrficas de documentos que pueden ser tradicionales 
(artculos de peridicos, libros) o no tradicionales, que podran definirse como literatura gris, 
como por ejemplo: tesis, informes, etc., no disponibles a travs de los circuitos comerciales 
de las publicaciones.<P>  

El AGRIS es un sistema cooperativo al cual incorporan los pases participantes las referencias 
de la literatura producida dentro de sus fronteras y, a cambio, reciben la informacin facilitada 
por los dems participantes.  Son 158 los centros nacionales y 28 los centros regionales e 
internacionales que participan en el suministro de unas 13 000 referencias al mes.  Hay dos 
centros regionales que preparan las entradas de otros 9 pases de sus regiones respectivas.<P>

El sistema est dirigido por el Grupo de Coordinacin AGRIS/CARIS, de la Direccin de la Biblioteca 
y Sistemas de Documentacin de la FAO, Roma, que mantiene tambin la metodologa AGRIS 
y los instrumentos de trabajo y asegura la formacin y proporciona el material autodidctico.<P>

Para permitir la utilizacin del sistema por los usuarios que no son de lengua inglesa, la FAO y 
la CCE han preparado un tesauro agrcola multilinge, AGROVOC, que se utiliza desde 1986, 
para la indizacin y la bsqueda en el AGRIS.  En 1982 se publicaron las versiones inglesa, 
francesa, espaola, alemana e italiana del tesauro, y  la version rabe en 1993; est en 
preparacin la version portuguesa.  Por el momento, con el AGROVOC se pueden efectuar 
bsquedas en la base de datos en ingls, francs y espaol. La segunda edicin del 
AGROVOC se ha utilizado para la base de datos AGRIS desde 1992 hasta 1995. Desde 1996 
se utiliza la tercera edicin preliminar del AGROVOC la cual se est imprimiendo por la FAO.<P>

El AGRIN, programa para microcomputadora basado en el Micro CDS/ISIS de la Unesco, es un 
sistema moderno de trabajo para los centros participantes en el AGRIS; les permite 
intercambiar sus datos con el Centro de Coordinacin, al mismo tiempo que crean bases de 
datos locales compatibles con el AGRIS.

Desde que entr en funcionamiento el sistema en 1975, la base de datos AGRIS ha 
acumulado ms de 2.6 miliones de referencias.  Los datos suministrados por los centros 
participantes se procesan en Viena en la Unidad de Procesamiento AGRIS, que se mantiene 
por contrato con la Divisin de Informacin Scient&iacute;fico y Tcnica del OIEA. Los datos del AGRIS estn 
disponibles en las siguientes formas:
<P><UL>
<LI>
   <B> Agrindex</B>, bibliografa mensual del AGRIS publicada en espaol, francs e ingls; 
alrededor del 21 por ciento de las entradas del Agrindex contienen resmenes 
(discontinuado en diciembre de 1995).
 
<LI><B> Cintas magnticas</B> con la misma informacin del Agrindex; se envan a los centros participantes que las solicitan.
 
<LI>
<B>Acceso en lnea</B> a la base mundial a travs de numerosos servicios de bsqueda: DIALOG 
 (Palo Alto, slo para datos no de los Estados Unidos), DIMDI (Colonia), y OIEA (Viena) 
para los datos non disponibles en el disco corriente AGRIS CD-ROM. Los usuarios, que 
deben disponer de una microcomputadora o un terminal, pueden establecer conexin con 
los servicios de bsqueda por telfono, tlex o redes de telecomunicaciones o de 
transmisin pblica, tales como TYMNET o DATEX-P.
 
<LI>
<B>CD-ROM</B>, disco compacto de memoria fija, que permite el almacenamiento de una gran 
cantidad de informacin (500 millones de caracteres).  Es fcil de utilizar con una 
microcomputadora y un lector de discos. <A HREF="#Silverplatter">SilverPlatter</A> tiene disponibles seis discos 
retrospectivos 1975 - 1994 y uno corriente otro de 1995- (con una puesta al da 
trimestral) y un Disco AGRIS FHN (Alimentacin y nutricin humana)  de 1975- (con una puesta al dia semianual)

International Scientific Teams Complete Sample-Taking at Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>   
Teams of scientists from around the world, working in the framework of a
radiological study requested from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
by the Government of France, have just completed the collection of marine and
terrestrial samples at the atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa in the South Pacific,
where French nuclear testing took place until earlier this year.
<P>             
The samples -- including soil, vegetation, coconuts, coral, seawater, fish, lagoon
sediment and plankton -- will now be shared among a network of laboratories for
analysis. The laboratories include scientific establishments in the Pacific region.
Results will subsequently be collated by the IAEA in Vienna, and comparisons will be
made with data provided by France based on its own earlier national studies.
A total of 11 scientists from 5 countries, as well as staff members of the IAEA's own
laboratories in Seibersdorf (Austria) and Monaco, participated during a five week
period in the collection of samples on-site, with full logistic support and cooperation
from the French authorities.
<P>             
Results of this part of the study -- which will provide an overview of the current
radiological situation at the atolls -- are expected by the end of the year. The second
part of the study, in which geologists will examine possible future scenarios including
the medium and longer terms, using modelling techniques, will be performed by the
end of next year. A full report will be published in early 1998.
<P>             
Guidance and direction for the study are being given by an International Advisory
Committee of distinguished scientists from ten countries, chaired by Dr. E. Gail de
Planque of the United States, with ex officio representatives of the South Pacific
Forum, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, the World
Health Organization and the European Commission. The Advisory Committee itself
plans to meet in French Polynesia in the coming months.
<P>
Note: A short spot for TV stations and still photography oi the sample-taking can be
obtained from the IAEA Division of Public lniormation in Vienna upon request.

International teams of scientists will be collecting terrestrial
and marine samples at the Pacific atolls of Mururoa and
Fangataufa for about one month starting in early July in the
context of the radiological study requested from the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) by the Government of
France. Teams will visit the atolls in relays, to collect samples
including plankton, fish, seawater, lagoon sediment, coral, soil,
coconuts and vegetation.
<P>         
The samples will be shared subsequently for analysis with a grid
of laboratories worldwide, including the Pacific region. Results
will be forwarded to the International Atomic Energy (IAEA) in
Vienna, whose own laboratories in Seibersdorf, Austria and in
Monaco will also be participating both in the sample-taking and
the analytical work. Data from French studies already undertaken
will be available for comparative purposes in the scientific work
to determine the radiological situation at the atolls. This part
of the overall study is expected to take up to six months to
complete.
<P>         
Separately, geological specialists will be examining the
situation regarding possible future scenarios, including the very
long-term, using modelling techniques taking as their starting
point inter alia the geological characteristics of the atolls,
experience gained at other nuclear test sites, and information
provided by the French authorities regarding their own series of
tests. The results of this work will then be consolidated with
the other part of the study and be made publicly available. The
estimated date of publication of the complete, final report is
early 1998.
<P>         
The study is being conducted under the guidance and direction of
an International Advisory Committee of distinguished scientists
from ten countries, chaired by Dr. E. Gail de Planque of the
United States, and including ex officio representatives
of the South Pacific Forum, the UN Scientific Committee on the
Effects of Atomic Radiation, the World Health Organization and
the European Commission. The Committee itself intends to visit
French Polynesia at a later date, at which time a press
conference is foreseen.
<P>         
Note: For practical reasons it will not be possible for print or
electronic media to cover the scientific field work. However, an
IAEA film crew will be present to shoot footage which can be
obtained, with descriptive material, on request from the IAEA
as of the end of July (tel. in Vienna 43-1-206021276 or fax
43-1-206029616).

A study of the radiological situation at the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls in French
Polynesia will get underway next week.
<P>
The study, which has been requested by the French authorities, will be under the
guidance and direction of an International Advisory Committee convened by the
Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr. Hans Blix
and chaired by a nuclear radiation specialist and former member of the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Dr. Gail de Planque.  The Committee, which is expected to
hold its first formal meeting in the spring, will bring together experts from
Argentina, Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, the Russian
Federation, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.  In addition, there
will be ex officio experts selected by relevant intergovernmental bodies -- the South
Pacific Forum, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, the
World Health Organization and the European Commission.
<BR CLEAR="RIGHT">
<P>
Project management and coordination will be undertaken by the IAEA.
<P>
The study will cover not only the current radiological situation at the atolls but also
an evaluation of the long-term radiological situation.
<P>
The French authorities have agreed to provide the IAEA with information and data
required for performing the study.  In addition, the study will involve the taking of
terrestrial and marine samples which will occur in mid-year.  Analysis of the samples
will be carried out thereafter by the Agency's laboratories in Seibersdorf (Austria)
and Monaco, as well as by a network of laboratories worldwide.
<P>
Next week a reconnaissance mision will travel to the atolls to prepare the logistics for
the measurements and sample-taking.  The study will take approximately 18 months. 
The study's findings, conclusions and recommendations will be contained in a report
of the Committee to be published by the IAEA.
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today in Vienna, Dr. de Planque said she was pleased
with the experts who have been invited to participate in the Advisory Group.  She
was confident that the study could be accomplished successfully and that the French
authorities would fully co-operate as agreed.

<H3>Radiological Situation at the Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
An informal meeting at IAEA Headquarters in Vienna
29-31 January provided advice and recommendations to the Agency's
Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, on the modalities of a study of the
overall radiological situation at the Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls.
Such a study was requested by the French Foreign Minister last year.
The Agency has already responded favourably in principle but formal
agreement to undertake the study has yet to be signified to the
French Government, pending agreement on the terms of reference and
other matters.
<P>
Experts at the meeting came from ten IAEA Member States and four
international organizations (European Commission, South Pacific
Forum, UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation and
World Health Organization) in addition to IAEA specialists from the
Secretariat and its two laboratories at Seibersdorf and Monaco.
It is intended to set up an International Advisory Committee to
oversee the conduct of the study.
<P>
A press conference will be held in Vienna when the Advisory Committee
holds its first formal meeting in the near future and arrangements
have been finalized with the French authorities.
<P>
The study as presently conceived would <I>post facto</I> take into account all past events of radiological significance.  As such, it would not be limited to the study of the latest series of tests carried out by the French Government. It would focus on two main elements:
the present radiological situation at the atolls, comparing data
gathered with existing available data from the French authorities and
possibly any additional data that may be deemed appropriate and
necessary in the future; and, secondly, a projection as to possible
future radiological impact.This latter part of the study would
require an input from geological modelling experts.
<P>
The intention would be to try to complete the study within 18 months.
The IAEA Secretariat would be responsible for coordination of the
necessary work and for publishing the Advisory Committee's report
upon completion.

<B>The French Nuclear Tests </B>
<P>
Before I leave the question of nuclear weapon testing, let me report to you, as I did to the Board of Governors last
week, that I have recently received a letter from the Foreign Minister of France in which reference is made to the
irreversible commitment of France to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty in 1996 and its intention to
undertake a final series of nuclear tests before that time. The Minister asked whether the IAEA would be willing to
conduct a scientific mission to assess the radiological impact of these tests. Such assessment would have to be
complemented by an assessment of the geological situation of the test site. In reply I have indicated that for the
Agency to take a decision on the matter, a number of preliminary questions would need to be carefully considered -
including the objective and the scope of the mission, its modalities and the composition of a team. I added that the
Secretariat wanted to consult with the French authorities as well as with others on these issues. Consultations with
French experts are scheduled for this week. 
<P>
As you are aware, the Agency provides numerous services to its Member States in the field of nuclear safety and
radiological protection and has established radiation safety standards. The French inquiry is being considered in that
context. You may also be aware that a mission was sent by the Agency to Kazakhstan last year to assess the
radiological situation at the Semipalatinsk test site, and that a similar mission is being planned for the Marshall
Islands. Also, our Monaco Laboratory has co-ordinated two inter-laboratory calibration exercises using various
samples taken in 1991 and 1994 from the area of the French Pacific test sites. We therefore have some first hand
experience in this field.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>This summary of the results of the Joint EC/IAEA/WHO
International Conference: One
Decade after Chernobyl: Summing up the Consequences of the
Accident, held in Vienna, 8-12
April 1996, was formulated on the basis of the following:
updating reports and keynote
presentations; Background Papers prepared by expert panels, and
discussions of  these by the
Conference; and the Session Chairpersons' conclusions, which also
took into account material
submitted in posters and in technical exhibitions.  It does not
necessarily reflect the views of
governments of Member States of the Sponsoring Organizations. 
<P>
The Joint Secretariat of the Conference <B>recommends</B> that
this summary of the
Conference results be used as the basis for decisions concerning
future work and
collaboration with the aim of alleviating the consequences of the
Chernobyl accident.
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>On 26 April 1986, the most serious accident in the history of
the nuclear industry
occurred at Unit 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
former Ukrainian Republic of
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, near the present borders
of Belarus, the Russian
Federation and Ukraine. The reactor was destroyed and, over the
ensuing 10 days or so, large
amounts of radioactive material were released to the environment.
<A NAME="initial"><P>
<B><I>INITIAL RESPONSE</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>Emergency measures had to be taken to bring the release of
radioactive material under
control, to deal with the debris from the reactor, and
subsequently to construct a confinement
structure, the so-called 'sarcophagus', which was completed in
November 1986, to contain the
remains of the reactor core.
<P>
<LI>The response to the accident was carried out by a large
number of ad hoc workers,
including operators of the plant, emergency volunteers such as
fire-fighters, and military
personnel, as well as many non-professional personnel. All these
people became known by the
Russian term <I>likvidator</I>. About 200,000 'liquidators'
worked in the region of
Chernobyl during the period 1986-1987, when radiation exposures
were highest. They
were among some 600,000 to 800,000 persons who were registered as
involved in activities
relating to alleviating the consequences of the accident. This
includes persons who
participated in the cleanup after the accident (including
cleaning up around the reactor,
construction of the sarcophagus, decontamination, road building,
and destruction and burial of
contaminated buildings, forests and equipment), as well as many
other general personnel
who worked in the territories designated as 'contaminated' and
who generally received low
doses.
<P>
<LI>Over the period from 27 April to mid-August 1986, about
116,000 members of the
public were evacuated from their homes in the region around the
Chernobyl plant, the
intention being to protect them against radiation exposure. A
so-called 'exclusion zone'  was
established, which included territories with the highest dose
rates,
to which public access was prohibited. This exclusion was
continued in the independent
successor countries of
Belarus and Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
The exclusion zone covers in
total 4300 km<SUP>2</SUP>.
<A NAME="releases"><P>
<B><I>RELEASES</I></B><A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P></A>
<LI>The total activity of all the radioactive material released
in the accident is today
estimated to have been around 12 x 10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq, including
some 6 7 x
10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq due to noble gases. About 3-4% of the used
fuel in the reactor at the
time of the accident as well as up to 100% of noble gases and
20-60% of the volatile
radionuclides were released. This current estimate of activity of
the material released is higher
than the estimate of activity reported in 1986 by the authorities
of the former USSR, which
was made on the basis of summing the activity of the material
deposited within the countries
of the former USSR. However, this reassessment of the source term
does not alter the
estimations of individual doses.
<P>
<LI>The radionuclide composition of the material released in the
accident was complex. The
radioactive isotopes of iodine and caesium are of the greatest
radiological significance: the
iodines, with their short radioactive half-lives, had the greater
radiological impact in the short
term; the caesiums, with half-lives of the order of tens of
years, have the greater radiological
impact in the long term. The estimates for the activity of the
amounts of the key radionuclides
released are as follows: <SUP>131</SUP>I: ~1.3 - 1.8 x
10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq;
<SUP>134</SUP>Cs: ~0.05 x 10<SUP>18</SUP> Bq; <SUP>137</SUP>Cs:

<LI>Material released to the atmosphere was widely dispersed and
eventually deposited onto
the surface of the earth. It was measurable over practically the
entire northern hemisphere.
Most of the material was deposited in the region around the plant
site, with wide variations in
deposition density. The areas of the surrounding territories of
Belarus, Russia and Ukraine in
which activity levels of <SUP>137</SUP>Cs in excess of 185

<P></A>
<LI>The 200,000 persons who participated in 1986 1987 in the
'liquidation'  of the
consequences of the accident received average doses of the order
of 100 mSv<A
HREF="#note_2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.
Around 10% of them received doses of the order of 250 mSv; a few
per cent received doses
greater than 500 mSv; while perhaps several tens of the people
who responded initially to the
accident received potentially lethal doses of a few thousands of
millisieverts.
<P>
<LI>The 116,000 people who were evacuated from the exclusion zone
in 1986 had already
been exposed to
radiation. Fewer than 10% had received doses of more than 50 mSv
and fewer than 5% had
received doses of
more than 100 mSv.
<P>
<LI>The radioiodines released delivered radiation doses to the
thyroid gland. Iodine was
absorbed into the
bloodstream, generally by ingestion in foodstuffs, mainly
contaminated milk, and also by
inhalation from the
initial radioactive cloud, and accumulated in the thyroid gland.
Doses to the thyroid were
anticipated to be
particularly high compared with those to other body organs,
especially for children. Estimated
equivalent doses
to the thyroid (made primarily on the basis of measurements
reported for 150,000 people in
Ukraine and also
in Belarus and the Russian Federation) of up to several sieverts
or more<A
HREF="#note_3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> were
made available for the
Post-Accident Review Meeting on the Chernobyl Accident held in
Vienna in 1986, the
International Chernobyl
Project (carried out in 1990 in order to determine the safety of
continued living in
contaminated territories), and
all other international evaluations to date. However, no
independent international verification
of the reported
absorbed thyroid dose was possible.
<P>
<LI>The long term doses to the populations in various countries
of the northern hemisphere
as a result of the
accident, including average doses in various countries, have been
assessed by the United
Nations Scientific
Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). UNSCEAR
estimated that
individual doses outside
the former USSR as a result of the accident were as follows: the
highest national average first
year dose was
0.8 mSv; the highest European regional average committed dose
over the 70 years to 2056
was estimated to be
1.2 mSv. In the International Chernobyl Project, it was estimated
that the highest committed
doses for the 70
years from 1986 to 2056 for people living in the most
contaminated territories were of the
order of 160 mSv.
Recent, more detailed, studies have produced similar results. For
the period from 1996 to
2056, committed doses
to the population living in areas with a contamination density of
185-555 kBq/m<sup>2</sup>
will typically be of the order
of 5-20 mSv; for the population living in areas with a
contamination density of 555-1480
kBq/m<SUP>2</SUP>,
doses over this period will be of the order of 20-50 mSv, mainly
from external exposure.
However, in localities where there are particularly high transfer
coefficients from soil into
foodstuffs, the internal exposure alone to the population could
exceed 50 mSv over the 70
years.
<A NAME="clinically"><P>
<B><I>CLINICALLY OBSERVED EFFECTS</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>A total of 237 occupationally exposed individuals were
suggested to be suffering from
clinical syndromes attributable to radiation exposure and were
admitted to hospital. Acute
radiation syndrome (ARS) was diagnosed in 134 cases. Of these 134
patients, 28 died as a
consequence of radiation injuries, all within the first three
months. Two more persons had
died at Unit 4 from injuries unrelated to radiation (and one
additional death was
thought to have been due to a coronary thrombosis).
Gastrointestinal damage was a serious
concern, causing early
and lethal changes in intestinal function among 11 patients who
had received doses greater
than 10 Gy. The
deaths of 26 of the 28 patients who died were associated with
skin lesions that affected over
50% of the total
body surface area. After the acute phase, 14 additional patients
have died over the past ten
years; however, their
deaths do not correlate with the original severity of ARS and are
therefore not necessarily  
and in some cases
are certainly not   directly attributable to radiation exposure. 
<P>
<LI>There is little doubt that the patients received the best
possible treatment in line with the
state of knowledge
at the time, in the most experienced centre available. However,
the therapy of bone marrow
transplantation
recommended at the time was of little benefit. With today's
knowledge, this is readily
understandable in view
of the inherent immunological risks of the procedure, the
heterogeneous exposure
characteristics and the other
complicating injuries due to radiation, such as unmanageable
gastrointestinal damage or skin
lesions. Bone
marrow damage can best be managed in future by the prompt
administration of haemopoietic
growth factors.
The most optimal combination and dose scheduling for these still
need to be determined,
however. For other
radiation damage also, new diagnostic tools have become available
which may contribute to a
more accurate
prognosis and more individually tailored treatment.
<P>
<LI>At present, the more severely affected patients suffer from
multiple ailments, including
effects of mental
stress, and are in need of up to date treatment and preventive
measures against secondary
effects. Health care
should be ensured for these patients, and their state of health
should be monitored over the
forthcoming two to
three decades. Among the disease patterns encountered, it will be
important to distinguish
between those that are
attributable to radiation exposure and those due to confounding
factors intrinsic to the
populations affected by
the accident.
<A NAME="thyroid"><P>
<B><I>THYROID EFFECTS</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>A highly significant increase in the incidence of thyroid
cancer among those persons in
the affected areas who were children in 1986 is the only clear
evidence to date of a public
health impact of
radiation exposure as
a result of the Chernobyl accident. (In 1991, the report on the
International Chernobyl Project
had stated that
"it is expected that there will be a radiogenic excess of thyroid
cancer cases in the decades to
come. This risk
relates to thyroid doses received in the first months after the
accident..."<A
HREF="#note_4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>.)
This increase in
incidence has been observed in Belarus and to a lesser extent in
Ukraine and in the Russian
Federation. The
number of reported cases up to the end of 1995 is about 800 in
children under 15 years old at
the time of
diagnosis; more than 400 of these cases were in Belarus. In most
cases the diagnoses have
been confirmed by
international experts.
<P>
<LI>The increase has been observed in children who were born
before or within six months
of the accident; the
incidence of thyroid cancer in children born more than six months
after the accident drops
dramatically to the
low levels expected in unexposed populations. Moreover, most of
the cases of thyroid cancer
are concentrated
in areas thought to have been contaminated by radioiodines as a
result of the accident. Thus
both temporal and
geographical distributions clearly indicate a relationship of the
increase in incidence to
radiation exposure due
to the Chernobyl accident. Furthermore, since the thyroid gland
concentrates iodine, one or
more radioactive
isotopes of iodine are presumed to be the causative agents of the
increase in incidence of
thyroid cancer in
children. 
<P>
<LI>At presentation, the majority of thyroid tumours were in an
advanced stage, showing
extension to tissues
outside the thyroid gland and/or lymph node metastases and, less
frequently, distant
metastases. This finding is
strong evidence that the observed increase could only to a small
degree be attributed to
increased ascertainment
due to screening.
<P>
<LI>The pathology of virtually all the thyroid cancer cases shows
papillary carcinomas, many
with an unusual
solid/follicular pattern of growth. The type of molecular
alterations so far studied has not
shown any major
differences from tumours of the same type in thyroids not exposed
to radiation. However,
these alterations are
more frequent in tumours of thyroids exposed to radiation.
<P>
<LI>Analyses by age at exposure confirmed the hypothesis that
very young children were at
the greatest risk.
It is now considered that the increase in the incidence of
thyroid cancer in those exposed as
young children may
persist. This could increase the prevalence of thyroid cancer in
the affected group in the
future, requiring
adequate resources for dealing with it.
<P>
<LI>In the present case, the minimum latency period between
exposure and diagnosis of
thyroid cancer seems
to be about 4 years. This latency period is somewhat shorter than
expected on the basis of
previous experience
related to acute exposure to external radiation. 
<P>
<LI>To date, only three children in the cohort of diagnosed cases
have died of thyroid cancer.
These post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid cancers in children, in
spite of their aggressiveness,
appear to respond favorably to standard therapeutic procedures if
appropriately applied;
however, only short term follow-up data are available
as yet. There is thus a need for complete and continuing
follow-up of the affected children in
order to establish the optimal therapy. Life-long administration
of L-thyroxine to children is
mandatory after thyroidectomy. 
<P>
<LI>The extent of the future incidence of thyroid cancers as a
result of the Chernobyl
accident is very difficult to predict. There remain uncertainties
in dose estimates and, although
it is not certain that the present increase
in the incidence will be sustained in the future, it will most
probably persist for several
decades. If the current
high relative risk is sustained, there would be a large increase
over the coming decades in the
incidence of
thyroid carcinoma in adults who received high radiation doses as
children.
<P>
<LI>In the event of any future accident, recognized measures
should be taken under strictly
defined conditions
to protect populations at risk from exposure of the thyroid to
radioiodine, such as prevention
of the consumption
of contaminated food and iodine prophylaxis through the
distribution of pharmacological
doses of stable iodine.
The populations living around the Chernobyl plant have
historically been subject to iodine
deficiency, and
remedy of this deficiency through the consumption of iodized salt
in food is in any case
recommended. 
<A NAME="health"><P>
<B><I>LONGER TERM HEALTH EFFECTS</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>Apart from the confirmed increase in the incidence of thyroid
cancer in young people,
there have been some
reports of increases in the incidence of specific malignancies in
some populations living in
contaminated
territories and in liquidators. These reports are not consistent,
however, and the reported
increases could reflect
differences in the follow-up of exposed populations and increased
ascertainment following the
Chernobyl
accident; they may require further investigation. 
<P>
<LI>Leukaemia, a rare disease, is a major concern after radiation
exposure. Few fatalities due
to radiation
induced leukaemia would theoretically be expected according to
predictive models (based on
data from the
survivors of the Japanese atomic bombing and others). The total
expected excess fatalities due
to leukaemia
would be of the order of 470 among the 7.1 million residents of
'contaminated'  territories and
'strict control zones', which would be impossible to distinguish
from the spontaneous
incidence of about 25,000 fatalities. The total expected figure
among the 200,000 liquidators
(who worked in 1986-1987) would be of the order of 200 fatalities
against a spontaneous
number of 800 deaths due to leukaemia. According to current
models, about 150
of these 200 excess leukaemia deaths among the liquidators would
have been expected to
have occurred in the
first ten years after exposure, for which the spontaneous
incidence is 40. In summary, to date,
no consistent
attributable increase has been detected either in the rate of
leukaemia or in the incidence of
any malignancies
other than thyroid carcinomas.
<P>
<LI>Among the 7.1 million residents of 'contaminated' territories
and 'strict control zones',
the number of fatal
cancers due to the accident is calculated, using the predictive
models, to be of the order of
6600 over the next
85 years, against a spontaneous number of 870,000 deaths due to
cancer. Future increases
over the natural
incidence of all cancers, except for thyroid cancer, or
hereditary effects among the public
would be difficult to
discern, even with large and well designed long term
epidemiological studies, as had already
been stated in the
report on the International Chernobyl Project.
<P>
<LI>Increases in the frequency of a number of non-specific
detrimental health effects other
than cancer among
exposed populations, and particularly among liquidators, have
been reported. It is difficult to
interpret these
findings because exposed populations undergo a much more
intensive and active follow-up of
their state of health
than does the general population. Any such increases, if real,
might also reflect effects of
stress and anxiety. 
<P>
<LI>Existing population based cancer and mortality registries
should be improved or, where
appropriate, such
registries should be set up. In addition, specific studies to
investigate the reported increases
and also the predicted
increases, particularly in leukaemia among liquidators, should be
carried out. This should be
done using carefully
designed protocols applied uniformly to analyse, and possibly to
distinguish the effects of,
confounding factors.
<A NAME="psycho"><P>
<B><I>PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>Several important studies and programmes have been conducted
over the past ten years
in the area of social
and psychological effects of and reactions to the Chernobyl
accident. These have confirmed
earlier findings
(including those of the International Chernobyl Project) that
there are significant psychological
health disorders
and symptoms among the populations affected by the Chernobyl
accident, such as anxiety,
depression and various
psychosomatic disorders attributable to mental distress. It is
extremely difficult to distinguish
the psychological
effects of the Chernobyl accident from effects of economic
hardship and the dissolution of the
USSR.
<P>
<LI>The psychological effects of the Chernobyl accident resulted
from the lack of public
information,
particularly immediately after the accident, the stress and
trauma of relocation, the breaking of
social ties, and
the fear that any radiation exposure is damaging and could damage
people's health and their
children's health
in the future. It is understandable that people who were not told
the truth for several years
after the accident
continue to be sceptical of official statements and to believe
that illnesses of all kinds that
now seem more
prevalent must be due to radiation. The distress caused by this
misperception of radiation risks
is extremely
harmful to people.
<P>
<LI>The lack of consensus about the accident s consequences and
the politicized way in
which they have been
dealt with has led to psychological effects among the populations
that are extensive, serious
and long lasting.
Severe effects include feelings of helplessness and despair,
leading to social withdrawal and
loss of hope for the
future. The effects are being prolonged by the protracted debate
over radiation risks,
countermeasures and general
social policy, and also by the occurrence of thyroid cancers
attributed to the early exposures. 
<P>
<LI>There is an urgent need to foster trust in the personal
ability to change one s life for the
better; to
encourage small-scale and communal projects to improve matters
locally and to support
organizations promoting
rehabilitation of the populations concerned; to increase public
knowledge of the health effects
of radiation and
radiation protection; and to develop, integrate and sustain
existing networks of local
authorities, specialists and
researchers in the social and psychological field.
<A NAME="environment"><P>
<B><I>ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>Concerning direct consequences for animals and plants, lethal
radiation doses were
reached in some
radiosensitive local ecosystems, notably for coniferous trees and
for some small mammals
within 10 km of the
reactor site, in the first few weeks after the accident. By the
autumn of 1986 dose rates had
fallen by a factor
of 100. By 1989 the natural environment in these localities had
begun to recover. No
sustained severe impacts
on populations or ecosystems have been observed. The possibility
of long term genetic effects
and their
significance remains to be studied.
<P>
<LI>For the human populations, the significance of the
environmental contamination depends
on the pathways
for their exposure. The main pathways are by external irradiation
from radioactive material
deposited on the
ground and by internal irradiation due to the contamination of
foodstuffs. In the first few
weeks after the
accident, radioiodines were the radionuclides of the greatest
radiological importance. Since
1987, most of the
radiation dose received has been due to <SUP>134</SUP>Cs and
<SUP>137</SUP>Cs, with
a minor contribution from
<SUP>90</SUP>Sr, while <SUP>239</SUP>Pu has made a minimal
contribution to dose. 
<P>
<LI>Several items of the normal diet were contaminated by
radioactive materials. Early after
the accident, key
foodstuffs such as milk and green vegetables had contamination
levels in excess of what is
today considered
acceptable by the WHO/FAO Codex Alimentarius Commission, set as
maximum permitted
contamination levels
for foodstuffs moving in international trade. (These levels are
now globally established by the
International Basic
Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and
for the Safety of Radiation
Sources.) There are
some questions about the effectiveness of the control measures
that were taken in the early
stages following the
accident. 
<P>
<LI>Countermeasures are relatively inefficient in reducing
external exposures but can be very
efficient in
reducing the uptake of radioactive material. In the long term,
the appropriate application of
agricultural
countermeasures can effectively reduce the uptake of caesium into
food. Which are the most
appropriate
countermeasures and their effectiveness strongly depend on local
conditions such as soil type.
For example, in
some localities where the amount of caesium deposited on the
ground was relatively small,
the transfer to milk
could nevertheless be high. In general, no food produced by
collective farms now exceeds the
WHO/FAO Codex
Alimentarius levels, although some foods produced by private
farmers do exceed these levels. 
<P>
<LI>The seminatural environment, i.e. with characteristics
intermediate between those of
managed agricultural
land and those of natural environments, may have a predominant
influence on the levels of
future doses to the
human population. The transfer factor for radionuclides from soil
to the milk of cows grazing
on meadows varies
by a factor of several hundred, depending on the type of soil.
Some food products derived
from animals that
graze in seminatural pastures, forests and mountain areas and
wild foods (such as game,
berries and mushrooms)
will continue to show levels of <SUP>137</SUP>Cs that exceed the
Codex Alimentarius
levels -  in some cases greatly - over the next decades and are
likely to be a major source of
internal doses in the future.
<P>
<LI>Local dose rates due to radioactive material buried at the
Chernobyl site can be
considerable. Furthermore,
for orderly management of the provisional depositories of
radioactive residues from the
accident, the potential
contamination of the local groundwater  in the long term should
be considered.
<A NAME="social"><P>
<B><I>SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL
IMPACT</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>Between 1990 and the end of 1995, decisions were taken by the
authorities to further
resettle people in
Ukraine (about 53,000 persons), Belarus (about 107,000 persons)
and Russia (about 50,000
persons). Evacuation
and resettlement has created a series of serious social problems,
linked to the difficulties and
hardships of
adjusting to the new living conditions. 
<P>
<LI>Demographic indicators in 'contaminated' regions have
worsened: the birth rate has
decreased, and the work
force is migrating from 'contaminated'  areas to 'uncontaminated' 
areas, creating shortages of
labour and
professional staff. 
<P>
<LI>The control measures imposed by the authorities to limit
radiation exposure in
'contaminated'  territories
have limited industrial and agricultural activities. Moreover,
the attitude of the general
population towards
products from 'contaminated'  areas makes it difficult for
produce to be sold or exported,
leading to reductions
in local incomes. 

<P>
<LI>Restrictions on people's customary activities make everyday
life difficult and distressing.
Major
rehabilitative actions have been undertaken over the past years.
However, it is necessary to
provide the public
with more and better information on the measures taken to limit
the consequences of the
accident, on present
radiation levels and on radionuclide concentrations measured in
foodstuffs.
<P>
<LI>The social and economic conditions of people living and
working in  contaminated 
territories are heavily
dependent on public subsidies. If the compensation system in
force were to be reconsidered,
some of the funds
could be redirected to new industrial and agricultural projects.
<P>
<LI>The consequences of the Chernobyl accident and the measures
taken in response,
exacerbated by the
political, economic and social changes of the past years, have
led to a worsening in the
quality of life and of
public health and to unfavourable effects on social activity. The
situation was further
complicated in the years
after the accident by incomplete and inaccurate public
information on the accident s
consequences and on
measures for their alleviation.
<A NAME="safety"><P>
<B><I>NUCLEAR SAFETY</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>The main cause of the Chernobyl accident lay in the
coincidence of severe deficiencies
in the design of the
reactor and of the shutdown system and the violation of
procedures. The lack of 'safety
culture' in the
responsible organizations of the Soviet Union resulted in an
inability to remedy such design
weaknesses, even
though they had been known of before the accident.
<P>
<LI>In addition to those features of direct relevance to the
causes of the accident, the original
design of plants
with RBMK reactors (Soviet light water cooled graphite moderated
reactors) had further
deficiencies. In
particular, the original design of the first generation of RBMK
reactors falls short of present
safety objectives.
Remaining deficiencies, such as the partial containment, require
further attention.
<P>
<LI>In accordance with a dynamic approach to safety, all nuclear
power plants that do not
meet an
internationally acceptable level of safety need appropriate
upgrading or should be shut down.
In September 1991,
the IAEA Conference on The Safety of Nuclear Power: Strategy for
the Future expressed a
consensus that the
safety standards<A HREF="#note_5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> of older
operating plants should
be reasonably compliant with
current safety
objectives. Active commitment to this objective remains of prime
importance for ensuring an
acceptable level
of safety for nuclear installations and for enhancing public
confidence in nuclear energy.
<P>
<LI>A significant number of remedial measures to enhance nuclear
safety have been taken
over the past decade
at existing plants with RBMK reactors: technical and
organizational measures were taken
immediately after the
Chernobyl accident, as well as safety upgrades performed between
1987 and 1991 which
essentially remedied
the design deficiencies that contributed to the accident.
Progress has also been achieved in
areas such as plant
management, training of personnel, non-destructive testing and
safety analysis. As a result, a
repetition of the
same accident scenario seems no longer practically possible.
However, the possibility of other
accidents leading
to substantial releases cannot be excluded.
<P>
<LI>Some of the concerns regarding safety might also apply to
other reactors designed to
earlier standards if
no adequate improvements have been made. The importance of
periodic safety reviews is
widely recognized in
this regard.
<P>
<LI>For all RBMK plants, there are plans for further safety
improvements to remedy those
design deficiencies
of RBMK reactors that are not directly related to the Chernobyl
accident. The implementation
of these plans is
lagging behind what is needed because the countries concerned
lack the necessary resources.
<P>
<LI>Expedited implementation of what has been agreed to be
necessary and has already been
planned is a top
priority for the national nuclear programmes as well as for
international co-operation: 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- necessary safety improvements must be carried out
independently from
consideration of early           decommissioning of the plants;
<DD>- more resources must be made available for enhancing the
safety of the RBMK
plants that are currently
          operated;
<DD>- the status of national regulatory authorities and their
support organizations must be
strengthened.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Similar backfits as for other RBMK units were also performed
at the Chernobyl plant.
However, safety
concerns with RBMK units are not only related to the remaining
generic design deficiencies,
but also to the
quality of equipment.
<P>
<LI>The decision of the Ukrainian authorities to close down the
remaining units at Chernobyl
is not a reason
for neglecting the need for safety measures and backfits during
the remaining time of
operation.
<A NAME="sarcophagus"><P>
<B><I>THE SARCOPHAGUS</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>The sarcophagus that was constructed around the destroyed
reactor presently contains
about 200 tonnes of
irradiated and fresh nuclear fuel, mixed with other materials in
various forms, mainly as dust.
The total activity
of this material is estimated to be 700 x 10<SUP>15</SUP> Bq of
long lived radionuclides.
The sarcophagus has met
the objectives set for the purposes of protection over the past
ten years. In the long term,
however, its stability
and the quality of its confinement are in doubt. A collapse of
the structure could lead to a
release of radioactive
dust and the exposure to radiation of the personnel employed at
the site. However, even in a
worst case,
widespread effects (beyond 30 km away) would not be expected. 
<P>
<LI>It has been found that the sarcophagus is currently safe from
the point of view of the
occurrence of a
criticality. It cannot be completely excluded that there exist
configurations of fuel masses
inside the sarcophagus
that could reach a critical state when in contact with water.
However, even if such a condition
were to lead to
elevated radiation levels inside the sarcophagus, large off-site
releases would not be expected.
The possible
impact of such a state on site personnel needs to be clarified.
<P>
<LI>Opinions differ widely about the significance of the risk of
an accident in Chernobyl
Unit 3 caused by a
collapse of the sarcophagus. More detailed investigations of this
issue are required.
<P>
<LI>The safety of the remaining units and the stability of the
sarcophagus are not the only
major issues still to
be resolved at the Chernobyl site. Further concerns relate to the
potential for contamination, in
particular to the
radioactive material buried at the site. These issues are
interrelated and an integrated approach
is required to
resolve them. The proposed construction of a second shelter over
the sarcophagus should be
part of such an
approach. The actions financed by the European Commission in this
area have contributed to
achieving an
integrated approach. This approach now needs to be generalized,
and the know-how of the
competent
organizations of the former USSR should be more effectively
integrated. Research and
development of an
adequate design and its construction are necessary in order to
ensure that the sarcophagus is
ecologically safe.
<P>
<LI>A cost-effective procedure requires that suitable steps be
taken, in accordance with the
progress of studies
and the financial circumstances. The first measure should be the
stabilization of the existing
sarcophagus. This
would significantly reduce the risk of its collapse and would
provide the time required for the
careful planning
of further measures (such as a second shelter).
<A NAME="future"><P>
<B><I>PERSPECTIVE AND PROGNOSIS</I></B>
<P></A>
<LI>Full rehabilitation of the exclusion zone is not currently
possible owing to: the existence
of `hot spots' of
contamination near residential areas; the possibility of local
radioactive contamination of
groundwater; the hazard
associated with the possible collapse of the sarcophagus; and
severe restrictions imposed on
diet and lifestyle.
<P>
<LI>Any estimates of the total number of fatal and non-fatal
cancers attributable to the
accident should be
interpreted with caution in view of the uncertainties associated
with the assumptions on which
they must be
based. Such projections do, however, provide a perspective on the
magnitude of the long term
impact and help
in identifying areas needing special attention, both now (such as
the incidence of leukaemia
among the liquidators
and of thyroid cancer among children living in 'contaminated'
areas) and in the future.
<P>
<LI>There is a major discrepancy between the number of thyroid
cancers appearing in those
who were children
at the time of the accident and the predicted number of such
cancers on the basis of standard
thyroid dosimetry
and current risk projection models. This difference may be the
result of several factors unique
to the accident
which are not typically incorporated into standard models. It is
important to clarify these
issues as well as to
continue the programmes for the detection of thyroid tumours.
<P>
<LI>The increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer will most
probably persist for several
decades. While it is
not possible to predict with certainty on the basis of current
data, the estimated number of
thyroid cancers to be
expected among those who were children in 1986 is of the order of
a few thousand. The
number of fatalities
should be much lower than this, if cancer is diagnosed in the
early stage and if appropriate
treatment is given.
These people should continue to be closely monitored throughout
their lives.
<P>
<LI>Despite the extensive scientific and medical knowledge of
radiation effects, there remain
important open
questions with regard to the human health effects of radiation.
It is necessary to continue to
support research into
the biological effects of radiation.
<P>
<LI>Different factors, such as economic hardship, are having a
marked effect on the health of
the population
in general, including the various groups exposed as a result of
the accident. The statistics for
the exposed
populations are being examined in the light of the clear general
increase in morbidity and
mortality in the
countries of the former Soviet Union so as to preclude the
misinterpretation of these trends as
being due to the
accident.
<P>
<LI>The public perception of the present and future impact of the
accident may have been
exacerbated by the
difficult socioeconomic circumstances in the USSR at the time, by
the countermeasures that
the authorities took
to minimize the accident's impact, and by the public's impression
of the risks from the
continuing levels of
radioactive contamination.
<P>
<LI>Past experience of accidents unrelated to radiation has shown
that the psychological
impact may persist for
a long period. In fact, ten years after the Chernobyl accident,
the evolution of symptoms has
not ended. It can
be expected that the importance of this effect will decrease with
time. However, the
continuing debate over
radiation risks and countermeasures, combined with the fact that
effects of the early exposures
are now being
seen (i.e. the significant rise in thyroid cancers among
children), may prolong the symptoms.
In evaluating the
psychological impact, account should be taken of the
psychological effects of the breakup of
the USSR, and any
forecast should take into account the economic, political and
sociological circumstances of the
three countries.
The symptoms such as anxiety associated with mental stress may be
among the major legacies
of the accident.
<P>
<LI>In view of the low risk associated with the present radiation
levels in most of the
'contaminated' areas, the
benefits of future efforts to reduce doses still further to the
public would be outweighed by
the negative
economic, social and psychological impacts. It is important to
develop a strategy that takes
into account both
the real radiological risk and the economic, social and
psychological disbenefits in order to
yield the greatest net
benefit in human terms. In addition, measures to mitigate the
psychological impact should be
considered.

<H3>ONE DECADE AFTER CHERNOBYL: SUMMING UP THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACCIDENT</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
Ten years after the tragic accident at Unit-4, the world rightly continues to take a keen interest in Chernobyl
and wants to know what the consequences have been, notably as regards people's health and the environment.
<P>
In an endeavour to shed as much light as possible on the many issues involved -- scientific, medical,
psychological, socio-economic, environmental and political -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
is co-sponsoring, with the European Commission (EC) and the World Health Organization (WHO),
a major international conference to take stock of the situation as it is now known.
<P>
The Conference, which will be chaired by the German Environment Minister, Dr. Angela Merkel,
will take place at the Austria Center, Vienna 8-12 April, and is open to the media. Some
700 delegates are expected to attend, from the three affected republics (at high level) as well as from the
international community. Speakers will be making a broad spectrum of presentations and the aim is to sum up,
synthesize and draw conclusions from the findings of work done to date, including the outcome of two major
international conferences, one hosted last fall by WHO, the other currently underway under EC auspices in Minsk.
An <A HREF="/worldatom/thisweek/preview/outline.html">overview </A>of the conference programme is available on-line.
<P>
Briefings for the media on the day's proceedings will be held  on April 10 and 11 at 5:30 p.m. near the conference hall,
and Dr. Merkel will hold a press conference at the close, on Friday, 12 April at 1 p.m. Press accreditation will
begin on the afternoon of April 8 at the Austria Center, where facilities for journalists will be available.
<P>
Media representatives intending to participate are invited to notify the IAEA, Division of Public Information in Vienna
(Tel. 43-1 2060 21276 or Fax 43-1 2060 29616) in advance to facilitate their accreditation upon arrival.

<P>         
<IMG SRC="merkel.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>At the opening of the International Conference One Decade After
Chernobyl: Summing up the Consequences on 9 April 1996, Mrs.
Angela Merkel, German Environment Minister and President of     
the Conference made a number of points in response to questions
from journalists of the international media:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the aim of the present conference was not to determine which
reactors of former Soviet design should be closed and which
should be backfitted, but the conference could contribute to
outlining practical, agreed solutions of the kind that the G-7   
safety summit in Moscow would seek in 10 days' time;
<P>
<LI>the medical consequences, including the need to take more
account of stress-related illnesses provoked by Chernobyl fears
and the priority of focussing on vulnerable population groups
such as children, would be principal issues for discussion;
<P>         
<LI>claims by Greenpeace that Western governments had backed away
from their position of wanting all RBMK reactors closed and were
now - under pressure from the "atom lobby" - co-operating in
improving them instead were absurd: the fact was that the safety
of these reactors had to be improved irrespective of their  
ultimate fate, the conditions for which had to be agreed
constructively with the States concerned, where the G-7
Memorandum of Understanding with the Ukrainians on Chernobyl's
future had been an important first step;
<P>
<LI>she herself would welcome closure of Chernobyl in the year
2000 although this was not precisely formulated in the Memorandum
of Understanding, but realistically if the West kept its promise
(US$ 2 billion in credits and aid were foreseen, and there had to
be more than just an ambitious theoretical study of a new
sarcophagus)  then the closure process could begin as of 2000;
<P>         
<LI>there was a growing and welcome realization that maximizing
nuclear safety was in the joint interests of the affected States
and Western donor countries alike: it was no longer a case of
demands by the latter and the setting of price tags in response
by the former - there had to be help from the West to foster
self-help in the East.

<A NAME="topic1"><P>
<B><I>Topical Session 1:</I></A>   Clinically observed
effects</B>
<P>
The Clinically Observed Effects of the Chernobyl Accident in 1986
are as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Total number of patients treated for Acute Radiation Syndrome
following the accident - 237
<P>
<LI>The number of patients who survived the acute phase of the
syndrome - 209
<P>
<LI>Number of persons who died in the acute phase of radiation
syndrome (in 1986) - 28
</UL>
<P>
Following the acute phase, 14 additional patients have died in
the ten years following the accident.  Their deaths, however, do
not correlate with the original severity of the acute radiation
syndrome and may not be directly attributable to the radiation
exposure at the time of the accident.
<P>
There is evidence that the quality of life of the surviving
patients may need  improvement.  The more severely affected
patients suffer from multiple ailments and are still in need of
treatment.  Their mental health is less than optimal. 
Conclusions of the session are:
<DL>
<DD>1.  Medical care and follow-up should be provided to the
survivors for many years (two to three
decades) from qualified medical centres.
<P>
<DD>2.  Research efforts, in the event of possible radiation
emergencies, should focus on
the emergency care needed for victims within the first two days
of any radiation accident.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="topic2">
<HR NOSHADE>
<P>
<B><I>Topical Session 2:</I></A> Thyroid effects</B>
<P>
Thyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare disease.  In the United
Kingdom, the incidence is 0.5 per million children per year;  in
other countries it may reach one per million, three per million,
and very occasionally 6 per million.  
<P>
In the case of southern Belarus and northern Ukraine since 1990
there have been substantial increases in the number of cases
which prior to the Chernobyl accident are believed to have been
comparable to the UK figure.  In Gomel Oblast, the
rate has reached 200 times the British figure.
<P>
Gomel is thus currently showing over one hundred cases per
million children per year whilst the rate for Belarus as a whole
is 14.6 per million.  
<P>
Thyroid cancer of the papillary type known to be
radiation-related and which attacks the muscles of the thyroid
represents 94 to 98 per cent of the cases seen in Belarus and
Ukraine, compared to 30 percent in the United Kingdom.  (Other
types of thyroid cancer which are relatively rare are follicular
and madullary, the latter not induced by an uptake of
radioiodine.)
<P>
Uptake of radioiodine from Chernobyl appears to have occurred in
children starting as of three months into their mothers' 
pregnancy to approximately three years of age at the time of the
accident.  Plotting the incidence of cases (some 500 to 600 in
total so far) indicates that vulnerability to contracting cancers
after the age of three at the time of the accident falls off
rapidly.  Geographic plotting correlates closely with the known
distribution of fallout.  It can therefore be reasonably
concluded, given the geographical spread and the age correlation,
that the great majority of the thyroid cancer cases in children
showing this steep increase are due with virtual certainty to the
uptake of radioiodine from the Chernobyl fallout.  It can also be
assumed, although more study is necessary, that children in the
relevant age group will continue to carry the risk of developing
thyroid cancers for several decades.
<P>
The only mitigating circumstance is that thyroid cancer has a low
mortality rate following appropriate treatment (normally surgery
followed by medication such as thyroxine).
<P>
<A NAME="topic3"><HR NOSHADE>
<P>
<B><I>Topical Session 3:</I></A> Estimated long term health
effects of the Chernobyl accident</B>
<P>      
Besides the dramatic thyroid cancer in persons exposed when they
were children, no evidence of a major public health impact is in
evidence as a result of the radiation exposure in the Chernobyl
accident in the three affected countries (Belarus, Russia or the
Ukraine). It is believed that the major radiological impact of
the accident will be greatest in the group known as the
"liquidators" (those who worked at the Chernobyl plant and 
helped with the clean up activities following the accident).
<P>         
The conclusions reached in the session are that continued studies
are needed in the future and they include: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Passive monitoring of the radiation exposed populations (in
the form of a population registry) from the Chernobyl accident to
prove data about disease patterns.
<P>
<LI>Focused studies of selected populations with exposures in the
low to medium radiation dose range. 
<P>
<LI>Studies of radiation-induced cancer risks through studies of
the thyroid cancers occurring in the young people. Although the
studies may not benefit today's patients from the Chernobyl
accident, they will be valuable for protection of future   
populations with possible radiation exposure.
</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="topic4"><HR NOSHADE>
<P>
<B><I>Topical Session 4:</I> </A> Other health-related effects: 
psychological consequences, stress, anxiety</B>
<P>
Widespread public anxiety and pessimism about the Chernobyl
accident among hundreds of thousands of people in the affected
areas appears to be out of all proportion to the verifiable
radiation induced health effects. This stress is nonetheless very
real and has caused widespread damage to the general health and
wellbeing of the population.
<P>
A large proportion of the relevant inhabitants - whether
evacuated or not - complain of ailments they believe to be due to
radiation exposure.  The level of
general health is in any case low, and radiation fears are
compounded by poor public understanding of radiation; initial
secrecy; subsequent lack of effective communication; and the
collapse of the former centralized political and economic
systems.  Distrust of 'authorities' is widespread.  It may be in
this comparatively low-cost field of better communication that
more needs to be done to help offset what is probably the most
pervasive after-effect of the 1986 accident.
<P>
<A NAME="topic5"><HR NOSHADE>
<P>
<B><I>Topical Session 5:</I></A>  Consequences for the
Environment</B>
<P>
Studies of the direct impacts of radiation on the natural and
human environments surrounding the Chernobyl accident indicate
that: 1.  At high radiation levels, surrounding the site of the
accident, the natural environment showed short term impacts but
any long term impacts remain to be seen and require further
study; 2. Countermeasures are effective when taken to reduce the
transfer of contamination from the environment to humans.  These
measures produce some waste, reduce some of the radiation dose
and are very site specific; their practicality must be
considered; 3. The majority of lifetime radiation doses have been
already received by the human population in the years since the
accident.
<P>
Future research is recommended to improve the ability
to assess the present and future doses to the affected
populations and to apply effective countermeasures.  The work
should include: monitoring of migration of groundwater around the
small radioactive waste burial sites to protect drinking
water supplies for future; research on radiation dose estimates
for internal human doses based on diet measurements which differ
from whole body count doses; research on whether food processing
of wild foods (mushrooms, etc.) can control contamination levels
enough to allow restrictions to be removed for human consumption;
research on whether natural and seminatural (forrests and
meadows) can be completely rehabilitated during the next
generation; research on whether work on cost effectiveness of
countermeasures and long-term intervention is needed for the use
of decision makers in the future.
<P>
<A NAME="topic7"><HR NOSHADE>
<P>
<B><I>Topical Session 7:</I> </A> Nuclear safety remedial
measures</B>
<P>
Remedial measures taken immediately after the Chernobyl accident
included a ban on experiments, disabling reactor protection
systems or installation in the control room of any extra controls
for reactor equipment; instructing staff to strictly adhere to
regulations on operating reactivity margin and coolant/feedwater
flow rate ration; and setting stricter requirements on procedures
for restart of the reactor after shutdown.
</DL>
<P>
Since then, the following safety concerns have been addressed:
design features of the reactor and shutdown systems relevant
for the control of reactivity; core cooling of first generation
of RBMKs; consequences of a possible multiple tube rupture; and
protection against fires and flooding.
<P>
Void reactivity  has been reduced by installing 80-90 additional
absorbers;  an increase in operative reactivity margin up to 43-
45 manual control rods;  and adjustment of fuel enrichment to
2.4%.  In addition to increasing the speed of control rod
insertion, a new fast acting shutdown system is being added.
<P>
As regards remaining problems for RBMKs, it must be recognized
that sound implementation of  defence in depth is vital.  This
means that RBMK safety concepts need to ensure  appropriate 
redundancy, diversity, functional segregation and quality of
systems assuring the basic safety function under accident
conditions.  Quality assurance, in particular of the material
properties of pressure tubes, needs due attention.
<P>
As regards the sarcophagus, the most important issues are the
risk of the release of radioactive dust caused by the 
possible collapse of structural elements; contamination of the
environment by water from the shelter; and possible recriticality
of masses containing fuel material.
<P>
In the short term the stability of the sarcophagus needs to be
reinforced while measures are pursued on how to construct a
second sarcophagus in the medium and long term.
<P>
<A NAME="topic8"><HR NOSHADE>
<P>
<B><I>Topical Session 8:</I>  The consequences in perspective: 
Prognosis for the future</B>
<P>
Evaluation of the Chernobyl accident is very complex because of
the following facts:
<P>
Assessing the health effects of radiation exposure is difficult
since the precise radiation doses received as a result of the
accident are not well known.  Neither is there a clear
understanding of the relationship between radiation dose received
and cancer induction.  Because of these facts, projections of
future numbers of excess cancer cases (above the normal number
expected in given populations) depends upon a number of
assumptions which are at best crude estimates.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The only health effects to date that are directly
attributable to radiation exposure are the increase in childhood
thyroid cancers and the health
effects among the so called "liquidators" (those persons cleaning
the site after the accident).
<P>
<LI>Even though the widespread psychological effects among the
population are unrelated
to radiation effects, they are attributable to the
accident.
<P>
<LI>The increase in the incidence of childhood thyroid cancer has
been dramatic and if it continues to persist, as those affected
grow older, it could result in several thousand cases over the
coming decades.
<P>
<LI>Increases in leukaemia and thyroid cancers among the most
highly exposed groups (the "liquidators" and people who were
evacuated from the exclusion zone - 30 kms around the accident
site) may be detectable in the future but are not yet apparent.
</UL>
<P>
Persons who would benefit from careful monitoring in the future:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Children with distinct possibility of incurring thyroid
cancer.
<P>
<LI>The most highly exposed of the "liquidators".
<P>
<LI>First workers called upon to tackle the accident.

Summary of Press Briefing, 10 April 1996
</H3>
<P>
<I>(Editor's Note: These are unofficial summaries and not
official records.)</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Podium speakers were Professor Fred Mettler (USA), Dr. W.
Kreisel (WHO) and Dr. A. Kaul (Germany).
<P>
The main points emerging form the answers to questions were as
follows:
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>Some 240 people had been hospitalized after the 1986 accident
believed to be suffering from Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS),
having been exposed to doses of 1 Gry or more.  134 of these
cases were confirmed as ARS.  28 died very soon from multiple
injuries and three from other causes (including one heart
attack).  In the ensuing 10 years 14 more have died, not all
from radiation effects.  The others have survived but are in
generally poor health and psychological condition.
<P>
<LI>Of the various treatments given (e.g. antibiotics and
transfusions) bone marrow transplants (of which 15 were done)
proved to be the least effective.  Two patients of those given
marrow transplants survived but simply because their own bone
marrow was strong enough "to fight off" the transplants.  The
lesson drawn is that it is better to stimulate regeneration of
the patient's own bone marrow.
<P>
<LI>According to calculations that had been made one could expect
2500 additional cancers in "liquidators" and 2500 in the
population at large starting from 1996 due to radiation
exposure.  Given that half a million people in the affected
areas could be expected to die of cancers in the same
reference period, in any case, this projected increase
equivalent to one percent may well be hard to detect.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to expectation, leukemia deaths that had been
predicted have not been found, although further monitoring
remains necessary.
<P>
<LI>As regards thyroid cancer in children in the age group below
3 at the time of the accident, it is predicted that there could
be 4000-8000 cases in total in the coming years.  However, 90%
or more of these cases will be curable.
<P>
<LI>"Liquidators" will need to be followed with particular
attention to thyroid and leukemia risks and the WHO study
provides the basis for co-operation in that area.  Each
republic has its own register of liquidators and there are
170,000 individuals on the Russian register alone.  Of these
some had died, particularly in '86-87 from traumas and
cardiovascular ailments, but the subsequent death rate has
been very similar to  that of men of the same age who had no
involvement in the Chernobyl aftermath.  650,000 "liquidators"
are believed to be listed, but only a much smaller number were
exposed to high doses of radiation through intensive clean-up
activity.
<P>
<LI>Regarding the pervasive psychological stress of both
evacuated
and non-evacuated population groups, the impact on general
health has been substantial and the need to rebuild trust
vis-&agrave;-vis authorities is very evident.
<P>
<LI>As regards the type of cancers most likely to be
radiation-related, Dr. Mettler mentioned breast, lung and
gastro-intestinal cancers.  Uterine and pancreas cancers are less
radiation sensitive.
<P>
<LI>One million children live in the affected areas and so
screening has been difficult.  However, experience shows that
80% of the thyroid cancers detected so far resulted from
parental action, detection by local doctors or from school
medical examinations.  Only a small number had been identified
through screening exercises.  Regarding thyroid cancers to
date, the number of <I>reported</I> cases were 424 in Belarus,
104 in
Russia, and 362 in Ukraine, making a total of 890.  (The
number of <I>confirmed</I> cases where analysis of tissue had
been
made by international medical experts is just over 500.)
<P>

Summary of Press Briefing <I>No. 2</I>, 11 April 1996
</H3>
<P>
<I>(Editor's Note: These are unofficial summaries and not
official records.)</I>
</CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
The Press Briefing on April 11 was led by Professor
Birkhofer (Germany), Mr. H&ouml;gberg (Sweden), Mr. Bouville
(USA) and Dr. Alexakhin (Russia).
<P>
In response to questions the following points were made:
<P>
The confinement concept of later model RBMKs can and should be
improved to enable them to cope with a wide spectrum of
anomalies; however, it is not designed to resist the force of
an explosion.
<P>
The effect of collapse of the roof of the sarcophagus could be
serious. Despite recent structural work to strengthen the roof
beams, the sarcophagus is not leaktight and rain water can still
penetrate although to a lesser degree.  Analyses of what further
improvements should be undertaken ought to be completed within
one year.
<P>
A probability safety analysis (PSA) level-1 has been performed
at Ignalina and a similar exercise is envisaged at the oldest
units at St. Petersburg.
<P>
Short term environmental damage after the accident was widely
reported to forests (and some mammals); however great capacity
for recovery has been apparent among flora and fauna, vegetation,
cereals, insects, etc.  The main long term damage has been the
total destruction of some 600 hectares of pine forest and the
partial destruction of a further 3000 hectares.  Where forests
have died, those forms of life dependent on them for survival
have also died as a secondary effect.
<P>
The concentration of cesium-137 and 134 is known to be highest
in wild mushrooms, but although it may be imprudent to consume
large amounts in the three affected States there ought to
be very little risk in consuming such mushrooms in Western
Europe today.

International Chernobyl Conference Concludes in Vienna
</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
An International Conference in Vienna has summed up the
scientific understanding of the major social, health, and
environmental consequences attributed to the Chernobyl accident
that occurred in Ukraine a decade ago. More than 800 scientists
and government officials in fields of nuclear energy, radiation
safety, and health care attended the meeting, which was jointly
sponsored by the IAEA, European Commission (EC), and World Health
Organization (WHO). Participants included high-level governmental
representatives from the accident's three most heavily affected
countries - Belarus, Russian Federation, and Ukraine - and
delegates from more than 70 other States and intergovernmental
organizations. The Conference carefully reviewed the many
scientific, medical, environmental, social, and political
issues involved in assessing Chernobyl's impact, in the context
of major changes over the past decade in countries of the former
Soviet Union.
<P>       
"The Chernobyl reactor accident covers a dimension which goes far
beyond the boundaries of nuclear safety and radiation
protection," said Dr. Angela Merkel, Germany's Environment
Minister and President of the Conference. "The actual effects of
this disaster have social and economic aspects which are possibly
far more
significant than radiation exposure itself."
<P>         
While the Conference (April 8-12) did not expect to reach
scientific consensus on all issues involved, its Joint
Secretariat did issue conclusions and recommendations that
place the Chernobyl consequences into perspective and can serve
as the factual basis for decision about future work and
collaboration.
<P>         
Highlights of the findings include those related to:
<P>         
<I>Accident Initial Fatalities and Injuries.</I> The explosion on
26
April 1986 and early release of radionuclides resulted in 30
deaths, including 28 deaths attributed to acute radiation
sickness. These fatalities occurred among the 134 plant staff,
firefighters, and emergency workers  (liquidators) who initially
responded to the accident and who suffered from severe radiation
sickness that was treated in hospitals. Since then, over the past
decade, whilst 14 additional patients have died, only some of
these might be attributable to radiation exposure.
<P>         
<I>Incidence of Thyroid Cancer.</I> There has been a substantial
increase in reported cases of thyroid cancer in Belarus, Ukraine,
and some parts of Russia, especially in young children, generally
attributed to exposure to radioiodine during the early phases of 
the accident in 1986. Up to the end of 1995, a total of about 800
cases (including 400 in Belarus alone) have been reported in
children who were under age 15 at the time of diagnosis. To date,
three children have died from thyroid cancer. Over the next
decades, there will most probably be an increase in the
incidence of thyroid cancer among those who were children in
1986;
the estimated number of cases is in the range of a few thousand
but
there is considerable uncertainty about this. The group at risk
should be closely monitored throughout their lives, since
treatment should be successful in most cases that are diagnosed
early.
<P>         
<I>Long-Term Radiation Health Effects.</I> Apart from increase in
thyroid
cancer, there has been no statistically significant deviation in
the incidence rates of other cancers that can be attributed to
radiation exposure due to the accident. Based on predictive
models,
it is estimated that the number of future deaths from leukaemia
is
of the order of 200 among the 3.7 million residents of the
contaminated territories and 200 among the 200,000 liquidators
who
worked at Chernobyl in 1986-87. Leukaemia is an early indicator
of
radiation health impact. The fact that it has not been seen to
date provides reassurance that early predictions are not severely
in error.
<P>         
<I>Other Health Related Factors.</I> Many changes in health have
been
seen
in the exposed population that are not the result of radiation
exposure. There are significant health disorders and symptoms,
such as anxiety, depression, and various psychosomatic disorders
attributable to mental stress among the population of the region.
These are widespread and may well be the most important legacy of
the accident. The  psychological impact cannot be completely
dissociated from that of the breakup of the Soviet Union, and any
forecast should therefore take into account the economic, social,
and political circumstances of the three countries.
<P>         
<I>Environmental Consequences.</I> No dramatically obvious
long-term
impacts on populations or ecosystems have been observed.
Effective
countermeasures can be taken at specific sites to achieve
significant reduction in the uptake of radiocaesium into food. In
general, no food produced by the collective farm system exceeds
established international radiation levels, although some foods
produced by private farmers do, as well as mushrooms, game and
other wild foods.
<P>         
<I>Nuclear Safety Remedial Measures.</I> The technical causes of
the
Chernobyl accident are well known and the safety levels of the 15
similar types of RBMK plants operating in Lithuania, Russia and
Ukraine have been raised to practically prevent the same type of
accident from occurring again. More RBMK safety improvements are
required however, and further steps are needed to stabilize the
sarcophagus built to confine the destroyed Chernobyl Unit 4. RBMK
safety issues were examined at an international forum in early
April in Vienna and were reported to the subsequent Chernobyl
Conference.
<P>         
The Conference featured a range of sessions at which experts
reviewed
the findings of work carried out to date, including the outcome
of
two major international conferences, one hosted in November 1995
by WHO and the other in March 1996 under EC auspices in Minsk.
Opening addresses were made by IAEA Director General Hans Blix;
WHO
Director General Hiroshi Nakajima; H. Tent, Director General for
Science, Research and Development of the EC; and M. Griffiths,
Director of the United Nations Department for Humanitarian
Affairs
(UNDHA). The Conference further featured national statements by
Alyaksandr Lukashenko, President of Belarus; A. Shoigu, Minister
for Emergencies, Russia and Yevgeni Marchuk, Prime Minister of
Ukraine; and seven keynote presentations by representatives of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO); United Nations Scientific Committee on the
Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR); Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations; Nuclear Energy Agency
(NEA) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development; and of organizations in Germany, Japan and the
United States on the results of major bilateral post-Chernobyl
assistance projects with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
<P>         
The technical symposium featured eight separate topical sessions
on the range of social, health, and environmental subjects.
Topics
included clinically observed health effects; thyroid effects;
longer term health efffects; other health-related
effects,including
psychological effects, stress and anxiety; consequences for the
environment; the social, economic, institutional and political
impart; nuclear safety remedial measures; and the consequences in
perspective, a prognosis for the future. A panel discussion
further
explored the public's perception of the Chernobyl accident.
<P>

<p><strong>FRONT COVER.</strong> Through a range of activities and projects, nuclear and related techniques
are helping scientists to better understand the changing world we live
in. They are being fruitfully applied in studies of urbanization and air
pollution, climate change and global warming, environmental protection
and restoration, and water resources, for example, in many countries and
regions. In other ways, nuclear power for electricity production is contributing
to sustainable energy and environmental goals, including those related
to the sound management of wastes. To assist decision-makers in selecting
energy options, the IAEA is supporting efforts to evaluate methods for
comparing environmental and related impacts of waste disposal from different
sources of electricity generation. </p>

Ten years after the tragic accident in April 1986 at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the consequences are
still being debated.  In many cases, speculation clouds public
perceptions and obscures the factual scientific record.  In this
edition of the IAEA Bulletin, feature articles examine aspects of
the post-Chernobyl nuclear picture, including nuclear power's
development and future in many countries and the sharper global
focus on issues of nuclear and radiation safety.  A forthcoming
edition will report on the outcome of an International Conference
at the IAEA in April 1996 that will sum up the known radiological
consequences of the Chernobyl accident.

The year ahead promises to bring issues of nuclear safety into
sharper focus. On many fronts, international experts are
working through IAEA-supported programmes to help raise levels
of nuclear safety - at power plants, waste sites, and research
institutes.  Some are putting into practice better systems for
ensuring even safer nuclear operations, while other experts
lay the groundwork for safety standards of future plants.  In
other fields, specialists assess national plans for deep
underground disposal of radioactive wastes, even as teams of
scientists from around the world pool their expertise to move
closer toward the goal of obtaining electricity from fusion,
the process powering the sun.

<H3>Front Cover</H3></A>
The United Nations officially commemorates its 50th anniversary in October, with the international community taking stock of both its accomplishments and shortcomings as the world's instrument for peace and sustainable development. The road ahead is full of challenge and opportunity. For the IAEA -- which works closely with the UN and its family of organizations in the nuclear sphere -- the future is unfolding along a compelling new course. Problems and needs have emerged which demand greater vigilance and cooperation among States -- particularly concerning issues of nuclear non-proliferation, arms control, and safety. As they build toward the next 50 years, the IAEA and its UN partners will need renewed support to effectively help countries take steps on the road ahead for achieving a better, safer world.

Electrical power remains the engine of economic development, yet much of the world cannot depend on reliable sources of fuel. As populations grow, and electricity needs rise, the situation may become more acute as we head into the next century. Many countries today are taking closer looks at their electricity options and strategies in a changing and more competitive marketplace. In many cases, the IAEA is working with national and international experts to help countries comparatively plan for and assess their energy futures. Several articles in this edition report on aspects of this work, and at the roles nuclear power can play to ensure a sustainable electricity generation. In October 1995, a major international conference on electricity options sponsored by the IAEA in Vienna will examine many of the issues in more depth.

<H3>Front Cover</H3></A>
Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the words "atoms for peace" have embodied all the hope and promise of nuclear energy -- and raised the spectre of all its peril.  At the United Nations in New York this April, States will once again confront the dual challenge, as they decide the future of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which since 1968 has been adopted by more than 170 States. The outcome of the NPT Conference is of major importance to the international community, and to the IAEA. The Agency's responsibilities include the implementation of nuclear safeguards under agreements that States are required to conclude as NPT Parties for verifying the peaceful nature of their nuclear activities. Articles in this edition take a close look at the IAEA and its relationship to the NPT, and at some global developments influencing the future.

Children embracing in the countryside teach us anew about how closely our health is bound to the world around us. Too many people suffer, and often die prematurely, from illnesses linked to industrial pollution, poor nutrition, contaminated food and water, and other unsafe environmental conditions. In important ways, the IAEA is supporting global efforts promoting better health for all. Targeted research and technology-transfer projects are helping physicians and medical researchers use health-related nuclear technologies in their fight against some of the world's most serious diseases and health disorders.

<H3>Front cover</H3></A>
The end of the cold war has opened a new  vision for the future, one bringing renewed hope for universality against the spread of nuclear weapons. Helping to shape that vision is the lAEA's nuclear safeguards and verification system, the world's first on-site international inspectorate. The lAEA's work  in Iraq, South Africa, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and elsewhere, for example, has answered -- and raised -- critical questions about the nature of nuclear programmes. As importantly, it has yielded valuable lessons that now are being evaluated and applied to improve the system's capabilities, especially with respect to possible undeclared nuclear activities. The Agency's long-standing experience further is being singled out for  tomorrow's veritication tasks. These include verification responsibilities under a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, toward which work has started, and under a US-proposed treaty prohibiting the production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for  nuclear explosives.

Radiation is all around us, and the extent of our exposure to it varies. In the interests of preventing harmful exposures, national and international regulatory bodies have adopted standards of radiation protection and safety, both for people in the workplace and the general public. Over the past 3 years, the IAEA and five other international organizations have headed an unprecedented joint global effort to update and harmonize the international basic standards of radiation safety. Once endorsed by all sponsoring organizations, these new standards will supercede any previous ones in this field, providing renewed  practical guidance for the protection of public health and safety.

Radiation at work -- for industrial safety and efficiency, health care, environmental protection, and a range of other beneficial applications -- is an unfamiliar phrase for many people. Yet nuclear and radiation technologies are helping to improve the way we live and work, the products we use, and the  environment we share. This edition features some of the everyday industrial applications of these modern and innovative tools.

Development of nuclear fusion as a practical energy source could
	provide great benefits. This fact has been widely recognized and fusion research
	has enjoyed a high level of international co-operation. Since early in its history,	
	the International Atomic Energy Agency has actively promoted the international
	exchange of fusion information.	 
<P>
	In this context, the IAEA responded in 1986 to calls at summit
	level for expansion of international co-operation in fusion energy development. 
	At the invitation of the Director General there was a series of meetings in Vienna		
during 1987, at which representatives of the world's four major fusion programmes
developed a detailed proposal for co-operation on the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Conceptual Design Activities
(CDA). The Director General then invited each interested Party to co-operate
in the CDA in accordance with the Terms of Reference that had been worked
out. All four Parties accepted this invitation.
<P>
The ITER  CDA, under the auspices of the IAEA, began in April 1988 and were successfully completed in December 1990. The information produced within the CDA has been made available to ITER Parties and IAEA Member States for use either in their own programmes or as part of an international collaboration.
<P>
After completing the CDA, the ITER Parties entered into a series of consultations on how ITER should proceed further, resulting in the signing of the ITER EDA (Engineering Design Activities) Agreement and Protocol 1 on 21 July 1992 in Washington by representatives of the four Parties. The Agreement entered into force upon signature of the Parties and shall remain in force for six years, with the EDA being conducted under the auspices of the IAEA. Protocol 1 expired on 21 March 1994. On this very day representatives of the ITER Parties signed in Vienna Protocol 2, which entered into force upon signature. This Protocol covers the remaining part of the EDA.
<P>
As part of its support of ITER, the IAEA is pleased to publish the ITER EDA Newsletter on a monthly basis. Copies can be requested from the ITER Office Vienna, IAEA, Wagramerstrasse 5, P.O. Box 100, A-1400 Vienna, Austria, or by fax: +43 1 237762.

<H2>Progress Reviewed on Technical Support to Newly Independent States in Non-proliferation Field
</H2>

<HR NOSHADE SIZE="1">
<P>
A meeting was held at the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna 6-8 November to review implementation of agreed plans to help Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union in fulfilling their nuclear non-proliferation commitments.
<P>
As most NIS have become parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as non-nuclear weapon states, a number of donor countries have offered bilateral assistance to set up: State Systems of Accounting and Control (SSACs) of nuclear material; physical protection of such material; and import/export controls. The IAEA has played a coordinating role by helping to identify specific needs in individual states and appropriate donor support.
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives of 14 Newly Independent States and 9 donor States -- Australia, Finland, France, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. In addition, Argentina, Canada, the Republic of Korea and Turkey attended as observers.
<P>
The meeting underlined the need for an integrated approach to nuclear nonproliferation encompassing SSACs, physical protection and import/export controls. Also stressed as basic requirements were the establishment of an appropriate framework of national nuclear laws and regulations in each recipient state, plus the necessary political commitment and coordination.
<P>
The IAEA's continued role in coordinating technical support for the NIS was welcomed, and the Agency has offered to organize similar annual reviews in future, provided the necessary assistance is forthcoming.

<H2> IAEA Director General Hans Blix Addresses United Nations General Assembly</H2>
</CENTER>

<HR NOSHADE SIZE="1">
<P>
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly today in New York, IAEA Director General Hans Blix underlined the Agency's growing role to help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to verify nuclear arms control and disarmament agreements. Dr. Blix also reviewed the changing agenda in other areas of nuclear energy's safe development worldwide.
<P>
"With the nuclear arms race over, a number of arms control or disarmament treaties have been concluded or are in the making that may require additional verification tasks from the IAEA," he said.  In this context, he noted that the United States and  Russian Federation are exploring with the IAEA technical and other issues connected to the further verification of certain nuclear material from dismantled nuclear weapons.  Verification in nuclear-weapon States, he said, can provide "assurance that fissionable material from dismantled weapons does not go into new weapons".  Additionally, he noted, it could assure that a possible future cut-off agreement prohibiting the production of plutonium or highly enriched uranium for weapons is respected.
<P>
In reviewing the IAEA's verification role, Dr. Blix also pointed to the increasing number of regional nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties and to the longstanding multilateral Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which all require and rely upon IAEA safeguards. Though the  recently adopted Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will have its own verification organization, Dr. Blix  emphasized the IAEA's existing  role under the NPT, which obliges non-nuclear-weapon States to refrain from nuclear weapons tests and entrusts the verification of these obligations to the IAEA.
<P>
Dr. Blix  underlined the IAEA's ongoing efforts to strengthen its safeguards system, noting that many measures already have been introduced under the Agency's existing legal authority.  Other measures that go beyond this authority remain under discussion by the IAEA's Board of Governors.  Most of these measures have been tried out in several States without great problems for the Agency or the State concerned, Dr. Blix said. While a few other countries have raised objections about the burden they may impose, Dr. Blix said the measures were needed for improving the IAEA's verification capabilities. "Regrettably, as we all know from our experience of controls at airports, security against possible violations by a few requires some inconveniencing of many," he said.
<P>
Following are other highlights of the Director General's address.  <I>(Editor's advisory:  The full text of the statement is accessible on line through the IAEA's World Atom Internet services on the World Wide Web at <A HREF="/worldatom/">http://www.iaea.org/worldatom</A>)</I>
<P>
<I>Programmes and resources.</I> The changing global agenda continues to significantly influence the IAEA's programmes and resources:    "There is no lack of challenges in the nuclear sphere," he said  "Over time the work of the Agency has both expanded and changed considerably....Suffice it to mention the names Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, Iraq and the DPRK, Semipalatinsk and Mururoa to evoke the growing engagement of the IAEA in the fields of nuclear safety, safeguards verification, and assessment of the radiological situation at nuclear weapons test sites." He emphasized, however, that the IAEA's budget frequently "limits what can be tackled."  Many new tasks, he said, such as measures countering illicit trafficking in nuclear materials or projects concerning nuclear safety and waste are, in fact, handled in large measure on the basis of extrabudgetary voluntary contributions from countries.  "This is not satisfactory," he said, "but far better than inaction."
<P>
<I>Energy and the environment.</I>  Dr. Blix emphasized concerns over issues of global warming and climate change, and the need for full assessments of all energy options.  "At the IAEA, the goal of sustainable development is fully accepted and it has been considered important that all energy sources be impartially and scientifically analysed for their impact upon life, health and the environment, including climate," he said.  Although governments are aware that greater use of nuclear power and renewable sources can help to restrain greenhouse gas emissions, he pointed out that most countries continue to expand their use of fossil fuels and are falling short of carbon emission targets.  "There is a regrettable gap between the rhetoric of restraint and the reality of growing greenhouse gas emissions," he said.
<P>
<I>Nuclear and radiation safety.</I>  Dr. Blix focused on elements of  an "international nuclear safety culture" to which countries are committing themselves.  Elements include the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which entered into force 24 October and commits States to a process of expert safety reviews for nuclear power plants.  He noted that three new legal instruments relevant to safety are expected to be finalized over the coming year.  They include a convention  on the safe management, including disposal, of radioactive waste; revision of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage; and an arrangement for nuclear liability supplementary funding.
<P>
<I>Technical cooperation for development.</I>  He placed particular emphasis on IAEA-supported projects in Africa that are helping countries to develop and manage their water resources, and to eradicate some insect pests that affect food production and health.  Within a major regional project in Africa, for example, scarce groundwater resources in Ethiopia are being more fully assessed using nuclear-related techniques.  On the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania, a radiation-based technology is being applied effectively to eradicate the health-threatening  tsetse fly over the next twelve months.  Similar projects are foreseen in other parts of Africa.
<P>
<I>Inspections in Iraq.</I>  As part of its on going monitoring and verification in Iraq under terms of UN Security Council resolutions, the IAEA now is assessing Iraq's re-issued "full, final and complete declaration" of its former nuclear weapons programme, Dr. Blix said.  Since August 1994, he noted, more than 600 inspections have been carried out in Iraq, most of them without prior notice, by the IAEA Action Team itself or jointly with UNSCOM.
<P>
<I>Safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).</I> Existing verification arrangements give confidence that nuclear installations subjected to a freeze under the US-DPRK Agreed Framework are actually frozen, he said.  Yet questions remain about the completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration of nuclear activities because the IAEA's access to information and sites remains insufficient for a comprehensive picture.  Greater confidence about the DPRK's compliance with its non-proliferation commitments under the NPT can only come about through more information and full implementation of the DPRK's safeguards agreement with the Agency, he said.

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
The Convention on Nuclear Safety -- the first international legal instrument on the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide -- enters into force today, 24 October 1996.  The Convention  commits States Parties to ensure the safety of land-based civil nuclear power plants.  This includes a legislative and regulatory framework; general safety considerations such as quality assurance, assessment, and verification of safety; human factors; radiation protection; emergency preparedness; and specific obligations on the safety of nuclear installations; siting; design and construction; and operation.  Among its requirements, the Convention obliges Parties to submit reports at periodic review meetings. These reports will focus on the measures each State has taken to implement obligations under the Convention.
<P>
"The Convention marks a major step forward in strengthening international co-operation in the safety field," said IAEA Director General Hans Blix. "Though the safe use of nuclear energy remains clearly a national responsibility, the Convention signals the growing recognition of the global interdependence of safe nuclear development.We now look forward to finishing work on other legal instruments, notably in the field of radioactive waste management, also being negotiated through the efforts of the Agency and its Member States." 
<P>
Twenty-seven States so far have consented to be bound by the Convention on Nuclear Safety.  These are Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mali, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The Convention has been signed by 65 States.
<P>
Under terms of the Convention, a preparatory meeting of States Parties will be convened within the next six months.  At that meeting, among other matters, guidelines will be established regarding the form and structure of reports that States are required to submit for review at periodic meetings, and the process for reviewing such reports. The Convention calls for  the first review meeting to be convened as soon as possible, but no later than 30 months from today's entry into force.

Secretary of Energy of the United States, Hazel R. O'Leary, Minister of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, Viktor Mikhailov, and Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Hans Blix, met in Vienna on 17 September 1996 to consider practical measures to fulfill statements by the President of the United States of September 1993 and the President of the Russian Federation of April 1996 concerning the application of IAEA verification of weapon origin fissile materials.  The participants noted the importance of these commitments of the U.S. and Russia as a significant contribution to the fulfilment of the Principles and Objectives agreed upon at the 1995 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review and Extension Conference.  Further, the Ministers noted that this endeavour is parallel to, and complementary to, the commitments made by Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin in September 1994 and May 1995 regarding the transparency and irreversibility of nuclear arms reductions.  Specifically, in this meeting:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- The Ministers of the United States and the Russian Federation agreed to discuss technical methods designed to protect sensitive nuclear weapons information and to prevent its disclosure, and to hold appropriate consultations with the IAEA on this matter. It was agreed that it was essential to ensure that IAEA verification of relevant fissile materials would not undermine the obligations of the United States and the Russian Federation under Article I of the NPT.
<P>
<DD>- It was agreed that, to address the various technical, legal, and financial issues associated with implementing IAEA verification of relevant fissile materials, a joint group should be formed and shall report on progress in addressing these issues within nine months.
<P>
<DD>- All parties agreed that within six weeks of this meeting a trilateral visit to the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site and Hanford Site will occur to examine how the IAEA safeguards have been implemented at plutonium facilities under the existing U.S. Voluntary Offer.  The trip will also include a visit to Argonne National Laboratory - West for a demonstration of remote monitoring technology.

Entering its 40th year of international service for the safe and peaceful development of nuclear energy, the IAEA continues to change the thrust of many  programmes in response to changes in the international climate and the needs and interests of its 124 Member States, IAEA Director General Dr. Hans Blix said today in an opening statement to the Agency's General Conference.  The Conference, which is being attended by Ministers and high-level governmental delegates from more than 100 countries, is meeting this week in Vienna, Austria.
<P>
In commenting upon the international agenda,  Dr. Blix noted that attention increasingly is concentrated on how to improve the well-being of the Earth and its population, rather than on how to avoid extinction through nuclear war.  "This is a welcome change of focus with important consequences for the work of international organizations, including the IAEA," he said.  
<P>
In reviewing the Agency's programmes, the Director General highlighted specific developments in various areas related to nuclear verification, safety, energy and the environment, and technology transfer.  He pointed out that despite limitations on resources, the Agency's work has expanded in recent years to take on new activities, both through the phasing out of some programmes and through efficiency gains.  "This process continues," he said, noting that the budget for 1997 assumes substantial cuts in overhead costs and provides an increase of some US $10 million in programmatic activities.
<P>
Selected highlights of the Director General's address follow.
<P>
<I>Safeguards and verification.</I>  Both the dimension and direction of the Agency's safeguards activities have changed considerably over time, Dr. Blix said, noting that 120 States to date have concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA.  He pointed out that the  IAEA is about to take a major step forward in further developing its safeguards system,  a step he called "essential to introduce new cost-effective methods and techniques and to provide vitally needed confidence that non-proliferation commitments are fully respected".  This step -- which is designed to provide the IAEA inspectorate with more information from States having comprehensive safeguards agreements and with greater access to data for its inspectors -- will also help to make the safeguards system an adequate instrument that can be used to verify future nuclear arms control and disarmament measures, he noted.   The Director General also said he would be meeting on 17 September with the United States and Russian Ministers present to discuss the possibility of verification by the IAEA that nuclear material released through dismantling of weapons is irreversibly transferred to the peaceful sector.
<P>
<I>Nuclear inspections in Iraq.</I>  The IAEA's ongoing monitoring and verification activities under terms of United Nations Security Council resolutions have included more than 600 inspections since August 1994, the Director General said.  Activities are continuing, he noted, though some activities that should take place outside of the Baghdad region can only be resumed when conditions permit, given the prevailing circumstances in Iraq, he said.  Over the past year, he said that the Agency's activities in Iraq have involved extensive efforts to analyze the vast amount of information that was handed over to the IAEA and the UN Special Commission in August 1995.  Work soon will start to verify the completeness and correctness of Iraq's re-issued Declaration of its former nuclear weapons programme, which last week was formally transmitted to the Agency's Nuclear Monitoring Group in Baghdad, he said.  
<P>
<I>Safeguards in the DPRK.</I>  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) still is not in full compliance with its safeguards agreement, he said.  Recent technical discussions resulted in some progress, he said, although the DPRK still did not accept various measures which the IAEA considers important for verifying the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration, in particular measures for the preservation of data and the provision of information about certain facilities.  A next round of technical talks is being scheduled, he noted.
<P>
<I>Radiological assessments of test sites.</I>  The IAEA has become engaged over recent years in the assessment of the radiological situation at three former nuclear weapons test sites, the Director General pointed out.  These are the Semipalatinsk site in Kazakstan, the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls in French Polynesia.  A final report on this assessment is expected by the end of 1997, he said. 
<P>
<I>Nuclear safety and waste management.</I>   The global nuclear safety regime is becoming more firmly established through a range of Agency services and  programmes, Dr. Blix said.  He pointed to the increasing number of international conventions providing legally binding norms as part of the regulatory framework, noting that the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which covers nuclear power plants worldwide, will enter into force 24 October 1996.  Progress is also being registered toward the adoption of new rules in the field of nuclear liability, and in the preparation of a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management, he said.
<P>
<I>Nuclear power.</I>    Studies are needed for a more factual understanding of the benefits, costs, and risks of all energy options at the national and global levels, including discussions connected with the Climate Change Convention and the International Panel on Climate Change, Dr. Blix said.  "Global energy consumption is going to increase and the present tendency is for an increase in the use of fossil fuels which accelerates the emission of carbon dioxide," he said.   Scenarios for future energy mixes that show the greatest promise of restraining greenhouse gas emissions, he noted,  include a strong expansion of nuclear-generated electricity.  
<P>
<I>Technology transfer.</I>   The use of nuclear power for purposes other than electricity production, such as the production of heat for industrial processes and for potable water, is receiving greater attention, Dr. Blix said.  Agency programmes are facilitating the transfer of nuclear and radiation technologies and helping to ensure that basic infrastructures are in place for their safe use and sound regulation.   In areas of technical co-operation, he cited  new approaches that place a premium on projects that effectively help end users attain benefits for better health, greater food supply, and  sufficient water resources.  He specifically cited projects to eradicate the tsetse fly from Zanzibar, Tanzania; to help countries combat soil salinity, which is a major problem worldwide; and to assess problems of pollution affecting the Black Sea.

<H3> Strengthening the Effectiveness and Increasing the Efficiency of Safeguards: "93+2"
<P>
<SMALL><I>9 September 1996</I></SMALL>
</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
In June the Board decided to establish an open-ended committee to draft a model protocol additional to comprehensive type safeguards agreements.
<P>
The Committee on Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the Efficiency of the Safeguards System met in early July and a next meeting is planned for October.  As agreed in June, the Chairman of the Board will provide a progress report on the work of the Committee.  As requested, a compendium of Member State proposals for changes to the draft protocol has been prepared by the Secretariat.
<P>
The Secretariat has also distributed the complete texts of Member States' comments as Committee Working Papers.
<P>
While the Board is engaged in finalizing the Protocol, the Secretariat has been working on implementation of the Part 1 measures for strengthening safeguards - that is those measures that can be undertaken within the authority of existing safeguards agreements.  A brief account of progress is contained in the <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/documents/gc40-17.html">General Conference document on strengthening safeguards</A>.
<P>
Implementation of these measures is generally proving to be satisfactory but, as is apparent from the document, it would be facilitated by further co-operation of States and the timely responses from  concerned States to the Secretariat's requests for information.  I urge such co-operation. 
<P>
<B>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)</B>
<P>
As was reported in the June 1996 meeting of the Board of Governors, the DPRK had postponed the fifth round of the technical discussions which finally took place in Pyongyang from 25 to 28 June 1996.  While the discussions resulted in some progress in certain areas, the DPRK still did not accept some important technical measures.
<P>
One matter discussed was the Agency's technical paper on the preservation of information required for the Agency to verify the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration under the Safeguards Agreement.  In this connection, the DPRK made, <I>inter alia</I>, the following points:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- the verification of the correctness and completeness of the initial declaration of the DPRK's nuclear material is to be carried out following consultations between the IAEA and the DPRk when a significant portion of the LWR project is completed, but prior to the delivery of key, nuclear related components;
<P>
<DD>- the DPRK is ready to discuss verification measures at facilities both subject to and not subject to the freeze.  However, issues related to "other" facilities would be discussed when "the time comes".
</DL>
<P>
During the discussions, the Agency team made it clear that a crucial element in the verification of the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration is information about the "other" facilities, such as the nuclear waste sites.  The Agency could not agree to the DPRK's intention to split provision of the information into two parts.  Further discussions will take place during the next technical meeting which is due to take place in Vienna during the week of 23 September 1996.
<P>
I am also able to report that the canning of spent fuel from the 5 Mwe reactor is proceeding and about one third of the spent fuel rods are now canned.  The operation is now expected to be completed during the first half of 1997.  Until then, three to four Agency inspectors will need to be stationed in the Nyongbyon area to cover all the required activities, including inspections at locations outside facilities at different areas in the country.  In the light of increased technical activities, the DPRK has agreed to take measures necessary to improve communications from the DPRK and has also agreed to accept the designation of nine more Agency inspectors.
<P>
<B>Illicit Trafficking</B>
<P>
Before turning to the next item on the Agenda , I should note that at the end of August, a second meeting of a group of international organizations was held in Vienna to discuss ways of assisting States in combatting the illicit cross-border movement of nuclear materials and other radioactive sources.  The meeting indicated general satisfaction with the Agency's activities in the area:  specifically the development of technical guidance, the provision of training and the operation of the Agency's Illicit Trafficking Database.  The meeting agreed that States should be urged to consider possible funding strategies to support programmes in this area.  A strong interest was also expressed in developing better mechanisms for co-operation among the various organizations, including more timely exchange of information and the joint development of new programmes.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Front Cover:</B></FONT> Just over ten years after the world's tragic nuclear plant
accident at Chernobyl, how much have we learned about its actual
consequences?  The scientific and technical answers are many and
cover much ground and an array of complex topics.  Fortunately,
as the accident's true effects, and the needs of its victims. 
While open issues still must be resolved, a factual framework was
set in April 1996 at the International Chernobyl Conference in
Vienna to support decisions - especially those affecting the
millions of men, women, and children living in the towns,
villages, and farms most in need of assistance.

The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Dr. Hans
Blix, as Depositary of the Convention on Nuclear safety, has now received the
necessary number of ratifications from States for the Convention to enter into force
this autumn.
<P>
With the Agency having received a total of twenty-five instruments of ratification,
acceptance or approval to date,  including seventeen from States having at least one
nuclear installation which has achieved criticality in a reactor core*, the Convention
will officially enter into force in 3 months' time -- on October 24, 1996. According to
the terms of the Convention, a preparatory meeting of the States Parties will take
place within six months of that date. The drafting of guideline documents for
consideration at that time is already in hand. 
<P>
The Convention, which was negotiated under the auspices of the IAEA, was opened
for signature in September 1994 and has so far been signed by a total of 63 States
(further signatures and ratifications are awaited). It is the first legal instrument that
directly addresses the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide.It foresees inter alia
the submission of safety reports by the States concerned which will be examined by
them collectively at review meetings to be held at regular intervals. The Convention
commits subscribing States to ensure the safety of land-based civil nuclear power
plants including storage, handling and treatment facilities for radioactiove materials
located on the same site and directly related to the plant's operation. 
<P>
Commenting on this development, Dr. Blix said: "This is the culmination of a great
deal of effort on the part of Member States, with support from the Secretariat. It is a
major step forward in strengthening international cooperation in the safety field and
towards creating a truly international safety culture. The IAEA, which already serves
as the forum for developing safety norms and provides safety review services on
request, looks forward to the conclusion of further instruments in the future, notably
in the field of waste management safety. The safe use of nuclear, as of other forms of
energy, will clearly remain a national responsibility, but international efforts have
brought increasing recognition of the interdependence of all participants in the
nuclear field, as the Convention bears witness." 
<P>
*Note: The 25 countries, in alphabetical order, are: Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mali, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Romania, the
Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United
Kingdom.

As decided by the Board of Governors of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 14 June 1996, the "Committee on
Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the Efficiency
of the Safeguards System" of the IAEA met at the IAEA
headquarters in Vienna, Austria, from 2-4 July 1996 under the
chairmanship of Ambassador J. Th.H.C. van Ebbenhorst
Tengbergen of the Netherlands.  Representatives from 65 States
and the European Commission and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency
for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC)
attended the meeting.
<P>
The focus of discussions was a draft Protocol additional to
comprehensive safeguards agreements between the IAEA and
States prepared by the IAEA Secretariat.  The aim of the draft
Protocol is to provide the IAEA with additional verification
objectives, particularly the ability to detect possible
undeclared activities.  During the discussion wide support was
expressed for the need to further strengthen the IAEA
safeguards system.  The committee had a first reading of the
draft Protocol and decided to resume its work on 1 October
1996.

<H3>Nuclear Energy and Sustainable Development</H3>      
<STRONG><I>Comments by Hans Blix, Director General of the IAEA,
at Regional Seminar on Atoms for Development<BR>       
Organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) and
hosted by the National Institute of Nuclear Research
(ININ)
at 40th Anniversary of ININ
<BR></I>
Mexico, D.F., 18-20 June 1996</STRONG>

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
A hundred years ago radioactivity was discovered. The
nuclear science and technology that have followed this discovery
have had a tremendous impact in the world - some of it
terrifying, most of it beneficial. My comments will illustrate
how we are trying to prevent the terrifying uses of nuclear
energy and how we can use nuclear energy for our benefit and for
sustainable development without harming the environment
or compromising the welfare of future generations. To put it
differently, how we can use nuclear energy for development that
is sustainable.
<P>
At the end of the Second World War - almost 50 years
after the discovery of radioactivity - the first nuclear bomb was
dropped, demonstrating to the world the destructive
use that can be made of nuclear energy. The same year - 1945 -
the United Nations was established "to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war", but facing almost from
the outset the cold war and a nuclear arms race which for many
years confronted the superpowers with the risk of mutually
assured destruction and which threatened to destroy the
rest of the world as well.<P>
Some fifty years later - in 1995 and 1996 - the
situation is much more hopeful. The cold war is over and the
former superpower adversaries are dismantling their nuclear
weapons at such a pace that managing and making peaceful use of
the fissionable material from the dismantled weapons is a serious
problem. The Non-Proliferation Treaty, with some 180
parties, has been prolonged for an indefinite period of time. If
nuclear disarmament continues and accelerates and were to extend
to all the five declared nuclear-weapon States; if the three
threshold States, India, Pakistan and Israel, were - like South
Africa - to roll back from their military nuclear potential,
whatever it is, and if stronger verification of arms control and
disarmament commitments were accepted by all, we would all move
out from the horror theatre in which mega-death has stared at us
for decades. The next steps in this march are a complete
test ban treaty, an agreement prohibiting further production of
nuclear material for weapons purposes and - following detente in
the areas - nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East
and on the Indian subcontinent. 
<P>
A great deal of credit for pushing us all in the direction of
arms control and disarmament goes to Latin America and
particularly Mexico whose disarmament diplomacy has
been persistently active. The Tlatelolco Treaty for a
nuclear-weapons-free Latin America and Caribbean was dynamically
advocated by Mexico - with Garcia Robles as the leading
negotiator, and my friend Sergio Gonzalez Galvez assisting him.
The Latin American treaty was ready before the NPT - showing the
world the way to go. For most States in this reglon
it has long been in operation and I trust that soon Cuba's
ratification and the remaining
safeguards agreements will have been completed? allowing
the Treaty to enter into force for all
its parties.
<P>
Let me now turn to the beneficial uses of nuclear energy
and recall that Mexico's
National Institute of Nuclear Research (ININ) as well as
the International Atomic Energy
Agency were both established to harness nuclear energy
for peaceful development - in line with
the Atoms for Peace policy which was declared by
President Eisenhower in 1953. ININ is now
celebrating its 40th anniversary. Representing the IAEA,
which will be 40 only next year, I
convey warm and respectful congratulations to the older
institution. In the past 40 years the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy have become of great
importance to Mexico and to the world
and they have great potential in our quest for
sustainable development. Radiation allows us to
detect, trace, image and measure what our own eyes
cannot see, to destroy cancer cells and
germs, to provoke mutations in plants, and to generate
large amounts of electricity, heat and
steam economically and without adding dangerous
emissions to the world ' s atmosphere. I shall
comment on some of these uses, but I must first discuss
the issue of safety which is
fundamental for all uses of nuclear energy.
<P>
The problems of safely disposing of <I>waste</I> that remains
radioactive for tens of thousands
of years have scared the public at a time when
increasing pollution and poisoning have
undermined its confidence in high technology. Some
opponents of nuclear power try to argue
that it is irresponsible to leave any long-lived
radioactive waste behind us. They and the public
need to become convinced that, due to its limited
volume, nuclear waste can technically and
economically be safely taken care of and be put into the
crust of the earth from where the
uranium originally came. It is possible that future
techniques will provide us with even better
ways of handling - and perhaps even making use of - what
today we regard as nuclear waste.
We should be aware, however, that our present waste
disposal concepts satisfy very high
demands for safety and are vastly preferable to the ways
we deal - or neglect to deal - with the
wastes originating from fossil fuels.
<P>
No accidents in the world have had more publicity than
those at Three Mile Island and
at Chernobyl. This has tended to overshadow the fact
that by now the world has the experience
of some 7700 reactor years of operation without any
other major accidents. Through national
regulatory organizations, through the World Association
of Nuclear Operators and through the
IAEA these many years of experience are made available
for all to learn from.
<P>      
The Three Mile Island accident in 1979, which was an
economic disaster, but spread
no radioactivity into the environment, triggered
extensive safety reviews, strengthening nuclear
safety in the non-Communist world. And the Chernobyl
accident, which occurred 10 years
ago, similarly led to reviews and new safety measures in
Russia and Eastern Europe. Thus
these two major nuclear accidents, which provoked so
much opposition to nuclear power, also
set in motion determined and extensive action in the
field of safety - at the national and
international level, at the design level and at the
operations level. Nuclear power safety became
an important international concern and the IAEA became
a central instrument through which
governments co-operate to establish important elements
of what is now termed an " international
nuclear safety culture".
<P>   
A first, fundamental, component of this safety culture
consists of a number of
international <I>conventions</I> which lay down binding
rules on safety, liability, physical protection.
waste management and disposal, the notification of
nuclear accidents and emergency assistance.
A next component consists of a large number of more
detailed <I>norms</I> - standards and guides
regarding nuclear safety, radiation safety and
radioactive waste safety - NUSS. RADWASS.
etc. Although they are not legally binding on States,
these standards build on the continuously
updated collective experience of the international
community. They have considerable authority
and often serve as basis for or input to national
regulations. The third component consists of a series of
international safety <I>services</I>
provided by the IAEA: at the request of individual
governments the IAEA sends international teams of
experts to review and advise on plant
safety, incidents or other events and waste disposal
programmes. The fourth component is the
worldwide <I>exchange of experience </I>that goes on
continuously in the nuclear field within the
IAEA and elsewhere
<P>
Today 17% of the world's electricity is generated by
nuclear power with minimal
environmental consequences. It is almost as much
electricity as we get from hydro power.
Toward the end of my presentation I shall come back to
the benefits of nuclear power in the
context of sustainable development. But I should first
like to discuss a number of other uses
that can be made of nuclear energy for our development -
in the fields of medicine, agriculture
and industry. In this context I want also to give some
examples from the excellent co-operation
between Mexico and the IAEA in several projects.
<P>
Let me begin with <I>health and medicine.</I>
<P>
There is probably no area in which nuclear techniques
are so well accepted as in the
medical fields of diagnosis, imaging and cancer
treatment. The existence in Mexico of some
70 radiotherapy installations comprising some 92 Cobalt
60 therapy units and 15 clinical linear
accelerators shows the dimensions of the use of these
nuclear techniques in Mexico. You also
have some 25 000 X-ray diagnostic units. Needless to say
a high professional competence of
all those who operate these installations is vital to
maximize their benefits to the population. It is against this
background that the lnstituto
Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares (ININ) of
Mexico and the IAEA have combined forces in a project,
the goal of which is to improve
quality in both diagnosis and radiation therapy
throughout Mexico.<I> Phase I</I> of the project aims at updating
the knowledge and practical skills of
medical physicists who are currently working
in radiology, radiotherapy and nuclear medicine.
Successful completion of this programme will
require 1480 hours work of the participants plus a
stringent examination before a diploma is
awarded. The project's<I> second phase,</I> which begins in
Mexico City in September 1996, consists of a Master's degree
(M.Sc.) programme. It is to be followed by a Ph.D. in Medical
Physics from the Autonomous University of Mexico (UAEM)
School of Medicine. The top-flight graduates of this programme
will also become the teachers of Mexico's future medical
physicists. This, briefly, is a project to assure the
development of a <I>high quality radiation
diagnosis and treatment infrastructure for Mexico.</I> Our
hope is that the project - and the
IAEA's assistance - will be of benefit to large numbers
of Mexico's citizens for decades to come.
<P>         
The use of nuclear techniques in the field of <I>nutrition</I>
is less well known to the public.
A separate presentation will be given on it,-but let me
briefly mention that the application of
isotope techniques for evaluating human nutritional
status and measuring the effects of nutritional programmes is a
subject of increasing interest in our Member States. 
These techniques have many advantages over alternative
procedures. The IAEA is involved in some
pioneering work using these techniques to evaluate
Vitamin A and iron deficiencies, bone disease, 
undernutrition and nutritional requirements of
mothers and children. The isotope
techniques which are used, help us to know exactly what
nutritional deficiencies there are and
thus facilitate devising the right remedies. The IAEA
gives assistance in nutritional evaluation
programmes in many countries throughout the world.
<P>
Let me turn to another - very special - nuclear
technique used to improve food
production through the eradication of certain insect
pests. I have in, mind the <I>Sterile Insect Technique </I>-
championed both by Mexico and the IAEA. Each
year great losses in crop and ivestock production are caused
throughout the world by such insect pests as the Mediterranean
Fruit Fly and the New World Screwworm. The Medfly alone
attacks 260 varieties of fruit and
vegetables in 82 countries. The New World Screwworm
attacks and causes large losses of
livestock and wildlife. While insecticides are mostly
indispensible for a full-scale onslaught on
a large insect population, the environmental and health
disadvantages of a continuous use of insecticides are well known
<P>         
Mexico is presently world leader in the Sterile Insect
Technique (SIT), which involves the sterilization of male insects
by irradiation prior to hatching and thereafter massive aerial
releases of the sterile insects into infested areas. The
mating which then occurs between sterile
males and native fertile females produce no offspring
and the insect population can thus be
gradually decimated and finally eradicated. It is a
technique which releases no chemicals into
the envlronment.<P>
         
The SIT requires large-scale rearing and sterilization
of insects in factories, such as the
one in Tapachula, Mexico, which is the largest sterile
Medfly rearing facility in the world.
Mexico has also a large Screwworm rearing facility at
Tuxtla and was able to declare final
eradication of the New World Screwworm in 1991.
<P>
Over a 30-year period the cost benefit ratio of the
screwworm eradication is
conservatively estimated at 1 to 10. A few years ago the
IAEA and the EAO, together with
Libya, succeeded in eradicating the screwworm in Libya
where a large infestation had occurred.
We flew huge quantities of sterile flies from Mexico to
Tripoli by Boeing 707 - tourist class -
and then released them weekly over the infested area in
Libya. Mexico is presently providing sterile screwworm flies for
the eradication campaign in
Central America and will provide flies
for similar campaigns in the Caribbean.
<P>
The use of isotope techniques in hydrology is of great
use to seGure sustainable development. <I>Water</I> deficits
throughout the world have become increasingly troublesome and
isotopic techniques are often of great help to trace and
measure underground water resources.
Let me give an example. The aquifer between Chapala and
Guadalajara is the main source of
drinking water in the area and it has been found that it
is being overexploited. A study is now
being undertaken by the Institution of Mexican Water
Technology (IMTA) and the IAEA using
chemical and isotope hydrological techniques to map this
area's water patterns . The results will
allow recommendations for the planning and management of
the sustainable use of these water resources.
<P>
For the sustainable exploitation of <I>geothermal</I>
sources a precise knowledge of the location and quantities of
underground hot,water is crucial. Geothermal field exploration is
costly, so care must be taken in locating optimum sites
for drilling. Geology, geophysics and geochemistry - including
isotopes - techniques are used to get information prior to even
drilling the first well. I need not remind you that geothermal
energy provides about 5% of Mexico's electricity.
<P>
Let me now turn to agriculture. Nuclear techniques offer
some of the most effective
methods for assessing availability and losses of plant
nutrients and water. The IAEA is
promoting the transfer of such nuclear techniques to a
number of agriculture institutes in
Mexico. The goal is to increase food production and
protect the environment, e.g. by
optimizing fertilizer nitrogen applications to irrigated
wheat; and by carrying out field
experiments for measuring the biological nitrogen fixing
potential of beans.
<P>
<I>Increasing the genetic variability of plant species</I>
through mutations provoked by
irradiation is another nuclear technique of great
importance in Mexico and throughout the
world. The School of Agronomy and Zootechnia, University
of Guanajuato, has used ionizing
radiation for mutation breeding for several years to
meet changes in the economic situation for
agriculture in the Bajio region. The school is doing
research on crops which are of great
importance to Mexico. I am glad to note that funding
from the IAEA has been used to good
advantage on a project which includes the establishment
of a phytopathology laboratory.
Combining mutation and in vitro plant propagation
strategies, the school has successfully
produced new genotypes/mutant lines of sorghum, garlic,
wheat and beans. Building on these
successes, the school recently initiated work on avocado
and pepper, two food items which are
very valuable for Mexican agriculture.
<P>      
Let me return now to <I>nuclear power.</I> The view that
I am presenting is that nuclear power must and will be an
important part of future sustainable development. I shall explain
why.
<P>     
There is absolutely no doubt that global energy use will
increase sharply, in part because
the world population is increasing so much, in part
because energy - and especially electricity
use - is a vital part of the higher living standard that
we all seek.
<P>  
Let me give you some figures: Bangladesh and Tanzania
use less than 100 kWh electricity per capita and year. My own
country, Sweden, uses 15 000 kWh per capita and year. 
Mexico uses about 1250. It is not surprising that the World
Energy Council predicts that
the world use of electricity will increase by 50 to 75%
by the year 2020. From which sources
will this electricity come? At present 63% of the
world's electricity comes flom thermal power (coal, oil and gas),
19% from hydro, 17% from nuclear,
0.5% from geothermal and less than
0.1% from solar, wind power and biomass. Is nuclear
power sustainable?
<P>
In the 1970s there was great enthusiasm for nuclear
power and expectations for rapid
growth, not least to reduce dependence on oil. As
increase in energy demand was slower than
expected, due to slow international economic
development, and as resistance to nuclear power
began to build up after the Three Mile Island accident,
nuclear power was slowed in its
development. The contemplated large programmes in Mexico
and Brazil, for instance, were
not realized. With the many safety related changes and
additions required after Three Mile
Island, nuclear power also lost some of its economic
competitive edge. There is at present a
stagnation in the construction of further nuclear plants
in Western Europe and in the Americas.
Construction is continuing vigorously only in East Asia:
Japan, Republic of Korea and China.
<P>         
The reasons why I predict a nuclear power revival are
the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the economic point of view nuclear power is at
present roughly on par with coal.
However, nuclear plants require larger up front
investments, which is a drawback in
capital starved developing countries. As nuclear
technology is relatively young there
should be scope for rationalization, standardization,
modular construction, higher
burnup, simpliflcation - all resulting in greater
efficiency and lower cost. Prices of oil
and gas are likely to rise over time, while uranium is
likely to remain cheap. Even
though opponents of nuclear power often ignore the
economic side of energy choices,
the economic competitiveness of energy options remains
important to countries, utilities and the consumers;
<P>
<LI> The objections advanced to nuclear power on the
grounds of safety, I trust, will
gradually weaken. The impact of the nuclear safety
culture, which is developing, can
be seen in the improved production figures for nuclear
power plants around the world,
lower doses to their personnel and fewer unplanned
stoppages. There will, of course,
be incidents and accidents, but the risk for core melts
will be - not zero - but extremely
small. The International Nuclear Event Scale, which the
IAEA has helped to create,
and which is now adopted everywhere, will make it easier
for media and the public to
realize that most accidents - like most earthquakes -
are very minor. Also new types
of advanced reactors, some of them available in the
market today, have new safety
features which build on our experience. These reactors
can be expected to have even
better records on reliability and safety than the
current dominant reactor types;
<P>
<LI> Energy independence is an important factor. Not all
countries have abundant energy
resources - hydrocarbons or waterfalls. To France,
Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Sweden and Finland, all without oil and gas, the measure
of self-reliance and the
measure of immunity against international crises which
nuclear power offers, has been and remains important;
<P>
<LI> To me it appears quite likely that another
important factor for a nuclear revival will be
the environment. Maybe even green movements will change
their attitude to nuclear power, when they see that it is the
least damaging of the <I>realistic</I> energy options. The
Club of Rome changed its attitude to nuclear power
several years ago. Indeed, it is not
nuclear power plants - but an excessive burning of
fossil fuels - that have caused acid
rains, dead forests and a threat of global climate
change. Nuclear power is
exceptionally clean in operation. Concern is usually
focussed on the highly toxic and
radioactive spent fuel and nuclear waste. What is
characteristic of these, however, in
addition to their toxicity and radioactivity, is, as I
noted earlier, that they are so limited
in volume which facilitates waste disposal.
<P>         
Let me give you a concrete example. Austria decided in a
referendum in 1978 not to
operate the nuclear plant which it had constructed, and
built instead two coal fired units
of about the same capacity. The nuclear plant would have
consumed about 30 tons of
low-enriched uranium per year. The coal plant consumes
about five train loads of coal
per day! The volumes of wastes are accordingly: from the
uranium a very limited
quantity of nuclear waste that can be isolated in its
entirety, and from the coal huge
quantities of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and ashes containing heavy
metals
which remain toxic forever. The
disposal site for all this waste from burnt coal - as
from other fossil fuels - is our
atmosphere and the surface of our world.
<P>
It is true that the scientists are not yet certain that
there will, indeed, be a global
warming as early as S0 years from now as a result of
emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from the
burning of fossil fuels, the leakage of methane from gas
production and transportation
etc. Because of this uncertainty many advocate that the
world should pursue so-called
"no regret" policies, by which they mean energy policies
which we would not regret
even if the fear of global warming were to prove
unfounded. I think the nuclear power
option fits the requirement of a no regret policy, as it
does not contribute to global
warming and is roughly competitive with the fossil
fuels. That is not true of the energy
that can be obtained from the renewable sources - apart
from hydropower. Photovoltaic
cells for solar energy, windmills, biomass are all
favoured by green movements and
further research and development of these sources should
certainly be encouraged.
<P>
However, serious energy institutions, like the World
Energy Council and the
International Energy Agency of the OECD do not predict
that these sources will become
economically competitive in the foreseeable future. For
that and other reasons they are
forecast to play only a minor role in the decades to
come. Conservation on the other
hand, meaning both a more efficient generation and use
of energy, remains very
important to restrain demand for more energy generating
capacity. However, this, too,
is no panacea. As we become more efficient in our energy
generation and use, we also
increase our demands. Cars will use less gasoline per
mile, yes, but there will be more
cars. New light bulbs may use much less electricity,
yes, but we may use more lights,
etc.
<P>
I am not suggesting that nuclear power, alone, is a
solution to the threat of global
warming. Many different approaches will be needed,
including renewables and
conservation, but I submit nuclear power is the single
most promising element in the
response policies which need to be worked out. At
present there is much talk about the
need to reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. I am sorry to
note that
the reality goes in the opposite
direction. The tendency in the world at large is
mirrored in Mexico. Mexico has built
two nuclear units in Laguna Verde but has many more oil
and coal fired plants. Of
Mexico's electricity, 65% is oil-fuelled; 5-6% is
coal-fuelled; 23% is hydro; and 6%
is nuclear. Let me use this occasion to congratulate
Mexico on the completion of the
two nuclear units at Laguna Verde. Admittedly it took
much too long a time, but once
they were operative, they have operated very well indeed
with very high availability
factors. I am happy to note that Laguna Verde is making
full use of IAEA safety
services. Last April a seminar was held at Laguna Verde,
devoted to an "Evaluation
of Operational Safety" with some 70 participants from
the plant, from the regulatory body and supporting organizations.
Next April an
international IAEA team is invited
to review the operational safety of the plant.         
<P>
Is it not against the interest of oil producing
countries to promote nuclear power? I
don't think so. For one thing we <I>all</I> live in the same
atmosphere! Moreover, if oil
consumption were to slow somewhat, this resource does
not disappear! It stays in the
ground as a capital left to coming generations. Groucho
Marx said he did not
understand why we should do something for the coming
generations. They never did
anything for us! Well, I think most of us feel a kind of
responsibility not to leave the
earth depleted and poisoned. We want development that is
sustainable. There are
ample supplies of uranium. And should it get scarce we
could build breeder reactors -
as the French and Russians have done on a fairly large,
albeit experimental scale.
These fast reactors use the energy content of uranium 60
times as much as the common
light water reactors. And should uranium nevertheless
get scarce we could use thorium
of which there is ample supply.
</OL><P>
Let me conclude by congratulating not only ININ but
Mexico on the country's
harnessing of nuclear energy for sustainable development
- in medicine, agriculture and power
production. The use of nuclear techniques is a spearhead
for the future. This use is demanding
- as regards safety standards and management. Only
industrialized countries and technologically
advanced developing countries can use the whole spectrum
of nuclear energy technology
Mexico is among them.
