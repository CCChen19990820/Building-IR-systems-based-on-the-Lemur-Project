<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The unconventional threats to national security are not based on
the ability to seize territory and defeat military forces;
rather, they affect U.S. interests through less direct means and
often take advantage of, or are directed by, non-state actors or
forces. Terrorism, insurgency, subversion, narcotics trafficking,
and refugee flows, for example, are all means that foreign
adversaries may employ or manipulate to their advantage and at
the expense of U.S. national interests. Such unconventional
threats are distinct from the threat posed by the military forces
of other nations and the routine political and economic
competition that mark interstate relations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The importance of unconventional threats to national security is
often debated. Some hold that unconventional threats do not
challenge vital national security interests and do not typically
evolve into major threats to peace. Others, however, maintain
that the cumulative effect of unconventional threats is a slow
but steady erosion of the U.S. security posture, and that it is
best to deal with these threats while they are smaller and more
easily managed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The end of the Cold War produced two countervailing effects on
unconventional threats to U.S. national security. On the other
hand, the dissolution of the Soviet Union eliminated a primary
source of support for international terrorism, regional
subversion, and insurgency directed against U.S. interests. On
the other hand, with the passing of the bipolar world, many
regional, intrastate, and transnational antagonisms that had been
held in check by the Cold War have erupted, and some have
precipitated unconventional challenges to U.S. policy and
security. For instance, the withdrawal of superpower support for
Siad Barre's regime in Somalia was largely responsible for his
fall from power, an event that set the stage for a humanitarian
disaster that prompted a complicated U.S./U.N. intervention.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ironically, the unparalleled success of U.S. forces in the Gulf
War has also contributed to the likelihood of unconventional
threats. Having witnessed the proficiency of conventional U.S.
military forces in Operation Desert Storm, foes of U.S. interests
will probably be more inclined to challenge the United States
through unconventional means.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead2">Instruments</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></h2>
Conventional threats to national security generally evoke a
response in kind. <BR>
But for legal, moral, political, and practical reasons, the
United States usually cannot <BR>
respond in kind to unconventional threats. More often than not it
must use tools other than those adopted by its foes. Diplomatic
and military responses are, respectively, the first and last
lines of defense against unconventional threats, but the United
States may also augment these options with its own unconventional
tools, such as nonlethal weapons and special operations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Managing unconventional threats with unconventional instruments
presents problems for the United States, for a variety of
reasons. The American tendency to see war and peace as discrete,
discontinuous states makes it difficult to build public support
for unconventional options, which often employ limited means to
obtain limited ends. An unconventional campaign may require
restraint, patience, perseverance, and acceptance of ambiguous
results, all of which may be unpopular. Because of the political
sensitivity attached to such options, they require special
management.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Besides being politically sensitive, unconventional options often
fall between or beyond the typical mandates and missions of
government agencies. For example, encouraging an adversary to
desist from destabilizing a government friendly to the United
States might involve a covert act of sabotage that requires
military expertise resident in DOD and tradecraft skills resident
in the Central Intelligence Agency. Negotiating migrant camp
rules with Haitian refugees in Panama may require the legal
background of Department of Justice personnel but the linguistic
and cultural capabilities of special operations forces or
diplomats. Delivering large amounts of aid to Bosnian refugees
may require DOD logistics and the Agency for International
Development's contacts with the humanitarian organizations.
Hence, applying unconventional instruments to unconventional
security problems requires an unusually high degree of
interagency cooperation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This chapter begins with general response options to the
unconventional threats of terrorism, narcotics, and
refugee/migrant flows. It then considers a number of
unconventional capabilities at the disposal of the United States:
special forces, unconventional warfare, nonlethal weapons,
psychological operations, and foreign law enforcement and
constabulary training.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Combatting Terrorism</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By themselves, terrorist organizations have never threatened
vital U.S. interests. But when used by states in a deliberate
way, they have adversely affected U.S. actions and policies, if
only by imposing higher costs. State support gives these
terrorists money, weapons, training, diplomatic passports for
their travel, diplomatic pouches for their weapons and
explosives, intelligence, and safe havens. The terrorists'
organizations give them resiliency, durability, and, through the
division of skilled labor, expertise in the destructive arts
greater than any individual could muster. Thus, state-sponsored
terrorist organizations were and are formidable adversaries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since the mid-1960s, states have supported and sponsored
terrorist attacks against the interests of the United States in
an effort to undermine American policies in Europe, the Middle
East, and Latin America. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States responds to the threat of international
terrorism by:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Encouraging cooperation among targeted countries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Refusing to make concessions to terrorists' demands.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Seizing terrorists overseas and transporting them to the United
States for trial.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Imposing economic sanctions on countries that sponsor
terrorists.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Retaliating against sponsoring countries with military force.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Attempting to prevent, preempt, and disrupt terrorist
activities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
None of these measures alone constitutes a sufficient response.
However, when used in combination as part of an integrated,
consistent strategy, they can be effective, despite the
inevitable exceptions to the strategy that must be made to serve
more pressing national interests. The decline in international
terrorism between 1985 and 1995 resulted not merely from
worldwide political and economic changes but from the application
of just such an integrated, consistent strategy toward a number
of countries known to sponsor terrorists, especially Libya and
Syria.<p><img src="ch1201.gif"><p><b>U.S. Special Operations
Forces rehearse counter-terrorism actions.</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last two of the six enumerated methods deserve special
comment. The United States has used military retaliation twice:
the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps raid against Libya in 1986;
and the Navy cruise-missile attack on Iraqi intelligence
headquarters in 1993. The raid on Libya quieted its leader,
Mu`ammar al-Qaddafi, for approximately eighteen months and,
according to some experts, has had a residual chastening effect.
Yet more Americans died from Libyan terrorism following the raid
than before it--even excluding those killed in the bombing of Pan
Am flight 103--suggesting a limit to the usefulness of
retaliating with overt military force. However, a less public use
of force might sacrifice the coercive effect the raid produced on
other countries as various as Syria and East Germany.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Preventing terrorism entails the use of defensive measures, such
as perimeter security around facilities, as well as efforts to
address what are sometimes called the underlying causes of
terrorism, such as economic inequalities, injustice, or racial or
religious discrimination. The former sort of prevention is the
least glamorous but perhaps the most effective way to combat
terrorism; the latter, because of limits in our knowledge and
resources, is perhaps the least effective.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Preemption does not mean assassination. It means only preventing
a specific act of terrorism from taking place. That may be
accomplished by sending a d&eacute;marche to a sponsoring state
or by apprehending terrorists before they act. Preemption
requires good intelligence, however, which is often not
available.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Disrupting terrorist activity means targeting a terrorist
organization and taking measures, not to stop one of its
particular operations, but to render all its activities more
difficult. The ultimate goal is to make the organization
completely ineffective. How that is done depends on how the
terrorists are organized, but it can include all of the measures
mentioned above, especially attacks on the means by which
terrorists are supported.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Increasingly, international terrorism has been marked by the
appearance of less-organized groups, which coalesce around a
leader for a specific operation or series of operations,
receiving various kinds and levels of support from different
governments and individuals. Such a group carried out the bombing
of the World Trade Center. Because they are not tied directly to
any one country's political agenda, these groups may be less
restrained in their use of violence. For the same reason, it is
more difficult for the United States to influence them by
pressuring their state sponsors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is too early to tell how serious a problem these groups pose.
While they are capable of horrendous acts of violence, they
generally are more vulnerable to penetration and less capable
than terrorists who are more organized. All the measures used
against the more highly organized terrorists may be useful to a
degree against these groups, but countering them will require
that we disrupt the activities of both the operators and their
supporters. Tracking and arresting the ringleaders, as was done
after the World Trade Center bombing, or having another
government seize them are important ways to counter this
terrorism. Such anti-terrorist operations will require a
continued emphasis on intelligence and close cooperation between
intelligence and law enforcement.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead4">Counternarcotics

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The flow of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana into the U.S. from
South American and Southeast and Southwest Asian source nations
continues to constitute a critical national security threat to
the U.S. The violence accompanying the distribution and sale of
these illegal drugs and the societal toll that drug use imposes
are national problems that affect every U.S. citizen. Moreover,
the violence and official corruption that the narcotics smuggling
cartels bring pose significant threats to democratic institutions
throughout the world.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The programs used in international counternarcotics operations
include, but are not limited to, enforcement measures such as
aerial and manual eradication of coca and poppy crops, crop
substitution programs, destruction of drug laboratories, and the
disruption and dismantlement of major narcotics trafficking
organizations through arrests, prosecutions, and asset seizures.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The demise of the USSR has significantly changed the
international political and geographical landscape, and the drug
industry is responding to an array of new business and criminal
opportunities. Traffickers now use new smuggling routes that
traverse the poorly guarded borders of the Caucasus, Central
Asia, and Eastern Europe, where local law enforcement is poorly
staffed and ill equipped to oppose smugglers. In some cases the
"new" routes are in fact old smuggling highways that had been
blocked by the Soviet Union and <BR>
Yugoslavia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To attack this threat, the U.S. has called for a shift of
emphasis away from efforts to disrupt the flow of cocaine in
transit and toward efforts in source countries, beginning in the
Western Hemisphere. Thus, interdiction activities now make up
only 8.8 percent of the total U.S. FY 1996 counterdrug budget,
while a major effort has been made to assist other nations in
developing and implementing policies to destroy narcotrafficking
organizations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Numerous federal agencies are involved in international
counternarcotics efforts. The Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), the lead agency enforcing federal drug laws, has 3,000
agents in 100 offices in the U.S. and 65 countries abroad, as
well as an intelligence center in El Paso and an air wing active
both in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Customs Service, as the
primary border-enforcement agency, plays a key role in
interdicting the flow of illegal drugs; it also maintains an
extensive money-laundering control program. The U.S. Coast Guard,
the principal maritime law enforcement agency, conducts patrols
and special operations in maritime areas to intercept drugs, and
maintains an intelligence capability on vessels and aircraft
engaged in smuggling drugs. The State <BR>
Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law
Enforcement (INL) has primary responsibility for the U.S.
government's international supply-reduction strategies, in which
it is aided by the Agency for International Development.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Defense's role in anti-drug operations includes
domestic activities, such as the use of National Guard forces, as
well as an array of international programs, including aerial and
ground reconnaissance, detection and monitoring, and
administering the distribution of excess military equipment to
law enforcement agencies for use in counterdrug operations.
Despite budget cuts and competing requirements, DOD has made a
concerted effort to enhance programs in source nations, while
maintaining a strong presence in the transit zone. For example,
DOD provides training and operational support to strengthen
foreign police and military counterdrug activities. It also
provides a continuum of specialized training teams to other
countries' counterdrug forces, both in those countries and in
military schools in the United States. This training ranges from
aircraft maintenance to small-unit tactics and operational
planning. DOD also provides intelligence to other countries'
counterdrug forces through Tactical Analysis Teams, which help
coordinate intelligence and build tactical-information portfolios
on key drug traffickers. Joint Planning Assistance Teams assist
foreign forces in developing operational plans around
intelligence collection activities. Lastly, DOD assists other
countries' interdiction forces by providing their interceptors
with essential real-time tracking information on suspected
narcotrafficking aircraft.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Partly as a result of international cooperation during 1995, Peru
and Colombia have had greater success in intercepting illegal
flights between the two countries, significantly disrupting the
movement of cocaine base into Colombia. Moreover, cooperative
counterdrug efforts with the government of Colombia led to the
arrest of six of the top seven Cali mafia kingpins. With U.S.
encouragement, Colombia and Bolivia have also launched active
coca eradication campaigns. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although cocaine remains the primary drug threat to the U.S.,
heroin has reemerged as a major threat. The heroin threat may
require a significantly different approach than that prescribed
for cocaine. The heroin industry internationally is much more
decentralized, diversified, and difficult to monitor for purposes
of enforcement operations. Also, in many of the major heroin
source and transit countries, particularly in Southeast and
Southwest Asia, the U.S. has important security interests that
must be taken into account; however, to pursue these other
interests, the drug industry and its criminal activities must be
dealt with as well.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Large population movements can be intentional tools of statecraft
as well as humanitarian problems. By employing emigration as an
instrument for creating international friction, regimes are able
to embarrass or frighten their enemies, influence other states'
domestic and foreign policies, divert another state's resources,
negotiate preferred outcomes from international organizations,
stabilize their internal politics by expelling dissident groups,
and even fill their coffers by extorting payments either from
those leaving or states receiving the emigrants. Among the
countries that have used this tool successfully in the last two
decades are Vietnam, East Germany, Cuba, and Haiti. The use of
emigrants as an instrument costs little, is highly effective in
attracting international attention, and is readily available to
virtually every state, particularly those of the developing world
that may lack more traditional tools of statecraft.<p><b>Cuban
Refugees at Guatanamo.<p></b><img src="ch1202.gif">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Emigration from both Haiti and Cuba in 1994 illustrates many of
these general statements. Although not an organized initiative of
the junta in Port-au-Prince, the emigrant flow created strong
political pressure that affected U.S. policies. Simultaneously,
the Cuban regime successfully manipulated mass emigration to
extract concessions from the United States on several issues. As
in the past, Castro used emigration not only to embarrass
Washington but also to gain a favorable change in the annual
quota of legal emigration from Cuba to the United States, a move
that helped stabilize his own domestic political situation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dealing with a sudden emigration crisis requires the diversion of
resources from other government activities. In the 1994-95
emigrant operations in the Caribbean, for example, DOD provided a
broad range of goods and services, including camp facilities,
rations, health care, security, crowd control, and mail delivery.
The Navy provided the principal forces for a massive interdiction
operation, including the tracking, interception, and inspection
of all craft departing either Cuba or Haiti, as well as the
transportation of all emigrants to DOD facilities throughout the
Caribbean. These activities significantly impaired military
operations and readiness. In order to deal with emigrants at the
Guantanamo base alone, Atlantic Command had to cease fleet
training and base maintenance operations, suspend contracts, halt
base construction, and send home all non-essential civilian
personnel.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Responding successfully to the strategic use of emigration
requires, first distinguishing between population movements that
are initiated or manipulated for political purposes from those
resulting from humanitarian problems. Since the former are
largely efforts at extortion, they may multiply if the targeted
states repeatedly succumb to pressure and accommodate the
objectives of the state from which the movement originated.
Countermeasures to stem emigrant flows depend largely on the role
of the originating state. If, as in the case of Cuba, a
government manipulates an emigrant flow for political gain,
countermeasures focus on altering the behavior of the government,
through sanctions, blockades, or other diplomatic and/or military
means. Interdiction can limit the number of emigrants that reach
U.S. territory. Programs for the transport, protection,
processing, or repatriation of the emigrants handle those that
do. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In cases such as Haiti's, where the emigrant flow is exploited
but not originated by the sending country, countermeasures
primarily focus upon the emigrants themselves. Measures include
interdiction at sea or by land, repatriation, or transfer of
migrants to a third location. In addition, psychological
operations (PSYOP) can help convince would-be emigrants that they
have little or no hope of reaching U.S. territory. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All countermeasures must be applied carefully. For example,
sanctions that affect a country's population more than its
leadership may only increase emigration by adding a humanitarian
exodus to a forced one. Forcible repatriation can serve as a
deterrent, but may present legal and political problems. Often,
public information campaigns are neccessary to cast the country
of origin a bad light and to apprise domestic and foreign
citizens of the true character of the refugee problem.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The cases in which forced emigrant flows might affect the United
States directly are few in number but, particularly in the case
of Cuba, are difficult to handle politically and logistically.
Ethnic cleansing in the Balkans will probably suggest to those
engaged in ethnic conflicts that forced emigration is an
effective tool. It helps attain a war aim, ethnic purity, while
causing difficulties for your enemies, who must receive and take
care of the emigrants. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">Special Operations
Forces</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Special operations forces (SOF) are an exceptionally flexible
instrument for responding to unconventional threats. The small
size, unique capabilities, and relatively self-sufficient nature
of SOF units often mean that their employment will not entail the
degree of political liability or risk of escalation normally
associated with the employment of larger, more visible
conventional forces. Those traits, in turn, make SOF a
particularly attractive option for responding to indirect
aggression.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SOF may be used to maximize the effectiveness of conventional
forces, for example, by augmenting the Navy and Coast Guard
enforcement of sanctions. Or they may be used to provide decision
makers with an unconventional alternative to diplomacy or
conventional force, such as a hostage rescue operation. Or they
may be used to perform a variety of nontraditional military
missions, such as emergency medical procedures or de-mining
operations, that are especially appropriate for unconventional
threats.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SOF as Commandos. In general terms, SOF perform two roles for the
National Command Authority that may prove useful in responding to
unconventional threats. SOF exercise their commando role when
they utilize stealth, speed, precision, and audacity to undertake
precision penetration and strike operations against selected
targets. Such missions may be designed to seize, damage, or
destroy a target; to recover personnel or materiel; or to conduct
reconnaissance/surveillance operations. In the context of
unconventional threats, SOF commando capabilities can be used for
gathering intelligence and evidence against terrorists;
recovering valued persons, such as hostages; or destroying an
adversary's selected national assets in support of an aggressive
sanctions effort.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dramatic improvements over the past decade in conventional
standoff precision-strike and long-range reconnaissance
capabilities mean that the undesirable risk of putting SOF
personnel on the ground can often be avoided. However, to
retrieve personnel or materiel or to make critical on-the-scene
judgments still requires putting men on the ground. Moreover,
advances in long-range reconnaissance and strike capabilities
have been partially offset by improvements in integrated enemy
air defenses and the trend toward moving high-value targets
underground.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The airborne platforms carrying U.S. advanced reconnaissance and
strike systems are not invulnerable. They can be shot down,
risking loss of life or the taking of hostages, as well as the
embarrassing loss of a high-value platform, as occurred in
Lebanon in 1983 and Bosnia in 1995. Depending on the target and
circumstances, SOF used alone or in conjunction with conventional
forces to assist in target designation, location, and tracking
may reduce the overall risk of a reprisal attack or sensitive
reconnaissance mission. To improve their reconnaissance and
precision-strike capabilities, SOF are taking advantage of
advanced technologies in such areas as thermal imagery,
electronic-signals collection, radiation and magnetic-detection
equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, secure real-time
communications, and placed, unattended systems that increase the
team's survivability and enable it to cover a larger
area.<hr><blockquote><b>SOF Definition and Forces</b><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Special operations forces (SOF) consist of Army Special Forces,
Rangers, and Special Operations Aviation; Navy Sea-Air-Land
(SEAL) and SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) teams and special boat
squadrons/units; Air Force special operations units; special
operations support units; psychological operations units; and
civil affairs units.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In defense planning, decision makers look to SOF to provide a
strategic economy of force in support of conventional forces, to
expand the range of available options, and to provide unique
capabilities. The small, self-contained, and highly trained units
can support conventional military forces before, during, and
after a conflict. Their skills include intelligence gathering,
surgical strikes, and language training and regional orientation,
which make them particularly suited to support coalition warfare
with advisory and liaison capabilities. Small, self-contained SOF
units also provide the United States with rapid, focused military
options that avoid the political and military ramifications of a
larger, more visible conventional force.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SOF are often defined in contradistinction with conventional or
general-purpose forces, with the observation that SOF conduct
operations that conventional forces cannot accomplish or
undertake without unacceptable risks and commitments of
resources. A more technical definition of special operations is
that they manifest at least three of the following
characteristics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unorthodox Approaches. Special operations require tactics,
techniques, and procedures that cannot be employed efficiently or
effectively by conventional forces. This does not mean that
special operations negate the traditional principles of war, but
rather that they put a different emphasis on their combination or
ranking of importance. For example, in comparison with
conventional operations, mass is less important in special
operations, while surprise achieved by speed, stealth, audacity,
deception, and new tactics and techniques is far more important.
Special operations forces can target a conventional enemy's
weaknesses through unorthodox approaches or counter
unconventional adversaries by meeting them on their own
unorthodox terms.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unconventional Training and Equipment. All military training and
equipment, from boot camp to the cockpit of a B-1 bomber or
Abrams tank, is to some extent special. Moreover, as General
Wayne Downing (Commander-in-Chief, Special Operations Command)
noted in 1995, the definition of what is unconventional changes
over time. SOF pioneered techniques that today are considered
conventional, such as the use of night- vision devices and deep
precision-strike capabilities. At any given time, however, there
are mission requirements that must be defined as unconventional
when compared with existing conventional capabilities. Because
special operations are often conducted at great distances from
support facilities, beyond the limits of conventional military
forces, and using a broad range of specialized skills, they often
require special training and equipment compared to their
conventional counterparts.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Political Context/Implications. Army special forces doctrine
rightly identifies recognizing political implications as an
imperative. Political considerations define the general
parameters of almost all military operations, but special
operations are often conducted in a politically sensitive context
that constrains virtually every aspect of the operation. Local
mores may dictate methods, and more general political
considerations may require clandestine, covert, or low-visibility
techniques, as well as oversight at the national level.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Special Intelligence Requirements. Special operations require
special intelligence. This may sometimes mean very fine-grained
intelligence about a difficult target; other times it may mean
in-depth information on political, social, and cultural issues.
In certain instances, the intelligence picture will not only help
design the special operation but may in fact determine its very
feasibility.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SOF as Diplomat-Warriors. SOF perform their second type of
role--sometimes referred to as their indirect, diplomat-warrior,
or unconventional-warrior role--when they influence, advise,
train, and conduct operations with foreign forces and
populations. In this indirect role, SOF may help manage refugee
camps, train and advise allied counterinsurgency forces, train
and assist allied indigenous forces in unconventional warfare,
and help stabilize friendly governments via psychological
operations and advice and assistance on civil-sector activities.
The quiet deployment of SOF to assist allies can signal U.S.
determination and provide a low-risk, high-payoff option for
decision makers. Performing the unconventional-warrior role
requires not only language and cross-cultural skills but also
cutting-edge lethal force capabilities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nevertheless, there is a nonlethal dimension to SOF's indirect
role that is attracting more attention and providing a more
balanced view of these versatile forces so long associated in the
public imagination with "mission impossible" commando operations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Immediately following the Gulf War, the relief effort in Northern
Iraq, to save the Kurds from Saddam Hussein's wrath and the harsh
mountain environment showcased SOF's nonlethal skills. While
cognizant of tribal prerogatives and an ongoing insurgency, the
civil affairs and special forces soldiers were able to earn the
confidence of Kurdish leaders, organize camps, and deliver
lifesaving food, shelter, and medical supplies. PSYOP detachments
used loudspeakers and on-the-spot newsletters to reassure the
Kurds and coax them down from the mountains, and civil affairs
units designed way stations and camps that reflected religious,
tribal, and family customs. These units also negotiated the
transition between U.S. military forces and the U.N. and other
international relief agencies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other examples of nonlethal applications of SOF in their indirect
role include the mine-awareness and de-mining training conducted
by Special Forces and PSYOP units in support of U.N. peacekeeping
efforts in the early 1990s. The use of civil affairs units to set
up and manage the Haitian refugee camps at Guantanamo and to
manage rural security and presence for U.N. forces in Haiti are
other examples of the way SOF can be used in response to
unconventional security problems.<hr><blockquote><b>SOF in
Haiti</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Special operations forces (SOF) performed a number of key
functions in Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. Navy SEALs used
their Coastal Patrol Craft to interdict embargo violators and
intercept refugees during the long buildup. Special forces and
Ranger personnel were prepared to remove the illegal military
regime by force (some elements were en route when a negotiated
settlement was reached). Capitalizing on their flexibility, SOF
changed their plan and made a rapid transition to a peacekeeping
role. During the peak of the multinational force phase of the
operation, there were approximately 1,350 SOF personnel operating
in small teams, based in thirty population centers throughout
Haiti. From those centers, SOF visited over five hundred towns
and villages, where they were essential to establishing a safe
and secure environment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From their bases in the countryside, Army Special-Forces teams
acted as an extension of the larger conventional force. When
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide abolished the section chiefs as
the chief local authority, Special Forces ensured their removal
(and security), then helped establish local government by
organizing town meetings and helping restore basic public
services. In addition, they provided some limited emergency
medical care (for both Haitians and other foreign nationals) and
assisted the numerous private volunteer organizations operating
in the countryside. Special Forces also provided area
familiarization and tactical training to the foreign military
members of the multinational forces supporting the U.N. mission
in Haiti. In addition, they provided most of the secure tactical
communications support required for the U.N. peacekeeping force.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
PSYOP forces used radio and TV broadcasts, loudspeaker
announcements, leaflet drops, handbills, and other dissemination
measures to inform and reassure the Haitian people. With the
approval of President Clinton, DOD initiated Radio Democracy, an
aircraft-based PSYOP radio broadcast that enabled President
Aristide to communicate directly with Haitian citizens. His
appeals for restraint and a peaceful return, coupled with his
assurances of security and justice for all, were a key element in
restraining the population from violence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Civil Affairs (CA) forces were primarily drawn from the U.S. Army
Reserves. A contingent of active CA soldiers from the 96th CA
Batallion initially deployed until the reservists could be
mobilized and sent into theater. Nearly 97 percent of the U.S. CA
capability is in the Army Reserves because it needs to draw
heavily on civilian acquired skills, which would be impractical
or impossible to maintain in the active force. Such professionals
as international bankers, transportation system managers,
civilian judges, city managers and others bring their education,
training, and years of job experience to assist the local and
national community in restoring its services, capability, and
infrastructure. By alleviating the civilian problems, CA troops
can reduce the demands on the military commander for emergency
and humanitarian assistance and allow him to comply with his
responsibilities, both legal and moral, to the civilian
population. The recent history of this type of assistance ranges
from Grenada to Kuwait. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Haiti these CA reservists provided technical advice and
assistance to twelve Haitian government ministries for up to
ninety days. The advisors assisted the ministries in assessing
priorities for their offices and developing plans to carry out
their responsibilities. Other assistance included helping to
develop department budgets, establishing an immunization system
against rabies and anthrax, identifying timber thefts in the
national forest, and assisting ministries in preparing for
participation in numerous international meetings and conferences.
A special group of fifteen civilian judges, prosecutors, and
civil lawyers provided an assessment of the Haitian judicial
system, codifying the laws, providing training for judges and law
clerks, and passing out legal references and forms to court
officials. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Civil affairs personnel also provided direct support to all major
subordinate units of the multinational force, staffed the Civil
Military Operations Center (CMOC), and manned the Humanitarian
Assistance Coordination Center.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Special operations forces include civil affairs units, which are
largely in the Reserves. They are trained to provide the
interface between the military and the civilian population and
government in the area of military operations. They are also
increasingly taking on a role of coordination with Private
Voluntary Organizations (PVOs). An example of the importance of
such coordination came during Operation Restore Hope in Somalia.
The Civil-Military Operations Center (CMOC), with liaison
officers from each of the major contingents in the multinational
coalition, including the U.S., worked closely with the
Humanitarian Operations Center run by the United Nations, thereby
providing a single focal point for all relief agencies in the
country. Eventually, nine parallel CMOCs controlled the issue of
ID cards and maintained a data matrix on the status of food
relief supplies.<p><b>Special Operations Funding 1984-

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead7">Unconventional Warfare</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unconventional warfare is military operations conducted in
enemy-held, enemy-controlled, or politically sensitive territory,
including guerrilla warfare and support to insurgency, that are
carried <BR>
out by indigenous personnel supported or directed in varying
degrees by external forces. There are three ways in which the
United States might engage in unconventional warfare: as part of
a major regional conflict (MRC); in support of a citizen/partisan
defense intended as a deterrent; and as an effort to support an
insurgency. Engaging in unconventional warfare as part of an MRC
is not always possible, however, because some regimes oppose the
arming and training of any significant number of their general
citizenry. Preparing and assisting a partisan deterrence force
can likewise present political problems by what it may suggest:
that the United States believes the partisans' country is
unprepared to fight, or will be overrun in any case, or should
mount a holding action while the United States improves its
negotiating position.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. experience in the 1980s--for example, in Afghanistan and
Nicaragua--proved that support for an insurgency can be an
effective way of putting indirect pressure on adversaries. But it
also showed that such support can be hard to control, and that
once training and equipment have been provided, they can be used
in ways contrary to U.S. precepts or interests. Thus, a careful
weighing of costs and benefits is necessary to determine the
merits of using unconventional warfare against states that
support insurgencies against U.S. allies, support terrorism, or
acquire weapons of mass destruction, perhaps the three most
important future uses of this blunt instrument.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead8">Nonlethal Weapons</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nonlethal weapons are characterized by their ability to disable
or incapacitate people or things while minimizing physical harm
to them, either because their effects are highly discriminate or
relatively reversible. The concept of nonlethal weapons is not
new. Tear gas, for example, is a familiar option generally
employed to nonlethal effect. For example, tear gas was used
during the Vietnam conflict, not only to quell disturbances, but
to flush Vietcong guerrillas from underground hiding places. In
addition, anti-traction compounds were applied experimentally to
sections of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. <hr><blockquote><b>Nonlethal
Weapons in the Evacuation from Somalia</b><p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In early 1995, the U.N. Security Council called for the
withdrawal of all U.N. peacekeepers from Somalia by the end of
March. The withdrawal--Operation United Shield--was executed by a
combined task force commanded by Lt. Gen. Anthony Zinni of the
U.S. Marine Corps. Based in part on previous experience, planners
knew that unarmed but hostile elements in Somalia could attempt
to disrupt the withdrawal. General Zinni determined that
nonlethal weapons were needed to help save lives and minimize the
impact of any possible confrontation. On an emergency basis, the
Marines identified off-the-shelf nonlethal weapons and
near-mature developmental nonlethal weapons that showed promise
of being useful in this role. The main concerns were: how well
the individual devices would perform in the Somali environment;
how much time would be required to train individuals with no
previous experience in their employment; and how the nonlethal
munitions could be fired from weapons already possessed by a
marine rifle company, specifically, the M203 grenade launcher,
the M-16 rifle, and the 12-gauge shotgun.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the support of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department; the
Office of the Secretary of Defense; the U.S. Army Armaments
Research, Development, and Engineering Center; the U.S. Army
Edgewood Research, Development, and Engineering Center; Phillips
Laboratory; and Sandia National Laboratory, the Marines very
quickly identified, located, tested, and obtained the appropriate
systems, which included:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Nonlethal projectiles (bean-bag rounds, rubber-baton rounds,
and rubber-pellet rounds).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Stinger grenades (which dispense rubber pellets instead of
metal shrapnel).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Sticky foam (dispensed by an operator against an individual
human target).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Barrier foam (resembles soap suds, but laced with irritating
gas).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The nonlethal weapons and their operators were brought to
Mombassa, Kenya, for training, and shipboard training was also
conducted. At the same time, legal and policy reviews to validate
these new systems were undertaken in the Pentagon, with generally
favorable results, and rules of engagement were developed and
approved. Also, Somali clan leaders were warned not to attempt to
interfere with the operation, and a press briefing in the
Pentagon described some of the nonlethal weapons the Marines
would have available. It is known that the Somalis became aware
of these systems, and the Marines believe the weapons played a
significant role in deterring the Somalis from hostile actions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The withdrawal operation was conducted with no significant
problems with crowds or rioters, and no task-force casualties.
Thus, it was not necessary to employ any of the nonlethal weapons
directly against Somalis. This experience presented a number of
lessons.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* There are significant shortcomings in the Department of
Defense's ability to identify, acquire, and deploy nonlethal
weapons. In particular, there is no unified process in place to
coordinate the fragmented efforts in nonlethal weapons research
and development.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Since the use of nonlethal weapons was allowed only in
situations where lethal force would be authorized, current U.S.
military rules of engagement with respect to the tactical
decision to use nonlethal or lethal means need to be clarified.
Thus, the Marines believed nonlethal weapons could not be used
readily to control escalation or to apply a graduated response to
the threat.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* In training for operations other than war, traditional wartime
skills, such as the return of a high volume of fire immediately
when fired upon, must be modified, since there is a premium on
restraint in the use of firepower and violence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A media plan must be carefully crafted and conscientiously
followed by commanders and spokesperson, releasing sufficient
information to deter, but not so much information that U.S.
tactics could be easily defeated by a cognizant adversary.
</BLOCKQUOTE><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several elements of the post-Cold War era have affected the use
of nonlethal force. First, a new political and strategic
significance attaches to nonlethal weapons in an era of
increasingly comprehensive and instantaneous multimedia global
news coverage. Secondly, the increased likelihood <BR>
of operating in densely populated urban areas and against
unconventional foes using human shields has focused renewed
attention on alternative applications of force with maximum
restraint and minimum violence. Many adversaries understand that
the United States is deterred from taking steps that can harm
innocent civilians, and so deliberately intermingle with them
while engaging in hostile or provocative actions. Nonlethal
weapons untie U.S. hands by allowing forces to initiate action
against a mixed group of noncombatants, combatants, and agents
pro- vocateurs. Even in cases where civilians are consciously
abetting foes or acting to disrupt or impede U.S. efforts, it
often is inappropriate and counterproductive to respond with
indiscriminate lethal force, or sometimes with any lethal force
at all.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But not least among post-Cold War developments affecting the use
of nonlethal weapons has been the advent of highly advanced and,
in some cases, exotic technologies, with subtle damage <img
src="ch1204.gif" align="left"><b>Non-lethal
bullet</b><p>mechanisms.
These weapons can be highly discriminate or relatively
reversible. For example, an electromagnetic pulse can
short-circuit  electronic subsystems within adversary assets such
as vehicles or weapons, rendering them useless; but the pulse
leaves human beings unharmed. Or a large crowd might be
temporarily incapacitated by a powerful, low-frequency acoustic
signal without permanent effect. Ideally, no one dies, and all
eventually recover fully, suffering no lasting deleterious
effects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In general, nonlethal weapons are an attractive means of
expanding the options available to policymakers and commanders in
that thin gray area between no application of military force at
all and application of lethal force. Nonlethal weapons can
stretch out the gray area and control the evolution of
situations, providing better management of an escalation. It was
precisely that desire to achieve military objectives while
minimizing human fatalities and collateral material damage that
led the U.S. Marine Corps to obtain nonlethal weapons to assist
in the withdrawal of UNOSOM II forces from Somalia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nevertheless, nonlethal weapons are not without problems. Left
unqualified, the term "nonlethal" can lead to unrealistic public
expectations that no fatalities will result from using such
weapons. In fact, there will always be some residual risk of
fatalities or permanent physical harm to people or physical
assets, even though the U.S. intention is to develop nonlethal
weapons that cause no lasting harm. Having nonlethal weapons in
the U.S. arsenal may also lead some to believe erroneously that
the United States is constrained to try them first in any
encounter, and escalate to lethal means only if other measures
fail. Others may misunderstand the nature of certain nonlethal
weapons and incorrectly infer that they violate arms-control
treaties or international legal constraints.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Witness the controversy surrounding anti-personnel lasers, which
could be used to blind enemy soldiers. The U.S. program is
designed to develop lasers that would take enemy equipment, such
as anti-tank-weapon sights, out of commission without causing
lasting damage to the eyesight of enemy soldiers. That is
consistent with the October 1995 laser weapon protocol to the
Convention on Conventional Weapons, supported by the U.S.
However, a protocol banning anti-personnel devices has been
proposed by the Swedish government, illustrating the political
sensitivity of nonlethal weapons.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More to the point, the employment of nonlethal weapons will not
always be fully successful. Not all prospective nonlethal
technologies will prove technically, legally, or politically
feasible. Those weapons that are fielded will require special
training and new doctrines, as well as careful planning. Unless
the United States is very shrewd in the way it conceives of and
employs nonlethal weapons, paying particular attention to the
psychological and political dimension of such operations, a
military success could be thwarted by political countermeasures.
Even a perfectly executed attack in which nonlethal weapons
perform as expected might be countered by ruthless adversaries
willing to kill their own compatriots and blame it on the United
States.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Thus, while nonlethal weapons appear to provide important
advantages to the United States in the post-Cold War environment,
they are subject to a number of cautions. Fully realizing their
promise requires coordination of the operational needs of
military commanders, the political priorities and concerns of top
civilian leadership, and the creativity and resourcefulness of
the acquisition and technical communities. Since several
agencies, including the Department of Transportation and
Department of Justice, have a role in countering unconventional
threats, such coordination will require an interagency effort as
well.<p><img src="ch1203.gif"><b>PSYOP: UH-60 dropping leaflets
in Thailand during the Cobra Gold 94.</b>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead9">Psychological Operations
(PSYOPS)</a><p></h3>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For years, the subject of PSYOP remained shrouded in mystery,
despite its use by the U.S. armed forces since the earliest days
of the Republic. It was viewed as a black art that employed
falsehoods, half-truths, and deception. In fact, to capture an
audience, hold its attention, and foster a particular belief or
behavior, PSYOP messages normally must be truthful.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The successful use of PSYOP during military operations in Grenada
(1983), Panama (1989), the Persian Gulf (1991), Somalia
(1993-94), and Haiti (1994-95) helped lift PSYOP's shroud and
demonstrated its utility and flexibility across a wide range of
military activity.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. Army's PSYOP force structure, active and reserves, is
relatively small: 1,200 active-duty soldiers and civilians and
3,000 reserves. The force is regionally oriented and trained, and
recruited according to language skills, cultural awareness, and
ethnicity. A core of highly qualified civilians provides the
cultural skills so vital in the conduct of successful PSYOP. The
force has many highly qualified linguists but usually relies on
local hires and Army-wide searches to obtain native-born
speakers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. Air Force also maintains the capability to deliver
leaflets and conduct airborne radio-TV broadcast operations. This
capability has been demonstrated, for example, by the deployment
of EC-130 aircraft that conducted television and radio broadcasts
of PSYOP messages in Haiti.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a result of the information revolution and the concurrent
explosion of global telecommunication capabilities, a degree of
international interconnectivity has evolved that was unimaginable
even in the mid-1980s. In this environment, cyberspace may become
the battlespace of the information warrior. In addition to
PSYOP's usual arsenal of printing presses, loudspeakers, radio,
and TV transmitters, efforts are underway to use emerging
technologies to enhance PSYOP effectiveness. PSYOP payloads in
unmanned aerial vehicles, for example, can be used to extend
current broadcast and leaflet-delivery capabilities to previously
denied areas. Faxes can be sent to recipients worldwide,
autodialers can deliver recorded messages to individuals via
telephone, and direct broadcast satellites can be used to provide
televised "news" to large segments of the world's population.
PSYOP billboards can be established on the Internet to send
messages to anyone with access to it. The explosion of
information and communication technology will continue to offer
new opportunities for PSYOP; the challenge will be to incorporate
this technology in the most cost-effective manner.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Information systems represent the medium over which messages are
carried; it is the job of PSYOP to tailor the message that is
received. PSYOP will be more effective to the extent to which its
messages are culturally sound, linguistically perfect, and highly
persuasive, that is, messages that resonate with and reinforce
attitudes that can work to produce the desired behavioral
results. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead10">Foreign Law-Enforcement and
Constabulary Training</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Responding to unconventional threats very often requires working
with the law enforcement communities of other nations. Managing
refugees, enforcing sanctions, preempting or disrupting
terrorists, interdicting narcotics trafficking, or establishing
public order after military operations or a natural or man-made
disaster all involve working with indigenous security forces. As
with the other unconventional instruments described above,
foreign police assistance is both politically sensitive and
complex in that several U.S. government agencies may become
involved in these kinds of activities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In response to abuses related to police-training assistance
programs in Vietnam, Congress passed legislation in the 1970s
prohibiting the use of any Foreign Assistance Act funds for the
purpose of training or assisting foreign police, a general
prohibition that applied to all government agencies. In
subsequent years, however, Congress allowed several broad
legislative exceptions to this general prohibition, particularly
in the area of cooperative international counternarcotics and
antiterrorism efforts, which also applied generally to all
agencies. DOD, for example, has trained foreign civilian police
under the counterdrug program and other special exceptions to the
Foreign Assistance Act in Costa Rica, the eastern Caribbean,
Honduras, and El Salvador. Under the auspices of the Department
of State's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, the Departments of
Defense, Justice, Transportation, and Treasury, as well as the
CIA, provide antiterrorism assistance to friendly governments. By
1995, more than 16,000 people from 83 countries had received
training since the program's inception in 1983. The general trend
toward acknowledging the importance of human rights and the rule
of law continued in 1986, when the Department of Justice created
its International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance
Program (ICITAP). ICITAP activities are funded by the Department
of State and structured to provide advice and assistance on the
long-term development of law enforcement institutions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unfortunately, in military contingency operations where there is
little warning or where the environment is not permissive, ICITAP
does not have the authority, structure, or capability to quickly
reconstitute police forces and police services. Dependent on
funding from Congress to pay for consultants or award a contract
to a civilian firm to conduct training classes, ICITAP may
require several months to establish a training program. ICITAP
civilian consultants and contractors generally do not accompany
indigenous security personnel on joint police patrols to provide
on-the-job training or operate at the precinct/substation level.
ICITAP is designed to professionalize existing police forces over
an extended period of time by teaching detailed classes in police
methods, often in a police academy setting.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consequently, the Department of Defense often is called upon to
shoulder the burden of emergency law enforcement and short-term
support of foreign police. Over the past two decades, DOD
personnel had to assist in the creation of rudimentary public
security forces following short interventions in Grenada, Panama,
Somalia, and Haiti. Since military police, civil affairs, special
forces, engineers, and other supporting forces normally are
already on the ground to conduct U.S. force protection and public
safety activities, in some cases it may be possible to extend
these capabilities to support for internal security forces. The
DOD has been slow to plan for and undertake these potential
activities, being concerned about legal constraints, the
political sensitivities surrounding public safety issues, and the
budgetary implications of assuming even partial responsibility
for what ultimately is a job for other government agencies. While
acknowledging that it is occasionally required to support foreign
internal security forces, the department responded to the 1995
Roles and Missions Commission's recommendations for greater DOD
involvement in this area by emphasizing that "the training of
foreign constabulary forces is not and should not be a DOD
mission."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One barrier to greater DOD involvement in foreign law enforcement
training and constabulary operations is that DOD has no role in
such activities inside the U.S. The 1868 Posse Comitatus law
prohibits the Army and Air Force from engaging in domestic law
enforcement; a long-standing order from the Secretary of Navy
extends that prohibition to the the Navy and Marines. Despite a
few exceptions made over the years, Congress remains extremely
reluctant to relax the Posse Comitatus restrictions. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since 1975, a provision known as Section 660 (of the Foreign
Assistance Act) has restricted use of foreign assistance funds
for foreign law enforcement, including training. These
restrictions were designed to distance the U.S. from controversy
over police violatinos of human rights, and they do not apply in
countries with longstanding democratic traditions. A variety of
execptions to Section 660 have been exacted over the years, but
it still restricts DOD's role in foreign law enforcement
training.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite past and present legal and bureaucratic disagreements
over divisions of responsibility, some elements in the Congress
and many senior civilian leaders in the executive branch
recognize that it is often not possible to pursue U.S. national
security interests without working with foreign internal security
forces. Civilian police who support democracy, respect
internationally recognized standards of human rights and the rule
of law, and are free of corruption can support U.S. regional
defense strategy by contributing to the restoration of peace and
stability following conflicts or crises; countering terrorist
acts and terrorist groups; strengthening local authority at the
grassroots level; and fighting subversion of their democratic
governments. In late 1995, Congress was considering legislation
that would relax some restrictions on the use of Foreign
Assistance Act funding for police support and training activities
overseas under specific conditions.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead11">Conclusions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the United States must expect more unconventional
challenges to its interests in the future, this does not
necessarily mean that unconventional threats are growing in
importance or that unconventional instruments will be a policy
option of choice for U.S. decision makers. With respect to
unconventional threats, the extent to which they have a
cumulative effect on U.S. security interests, and thus must be
taken more seriously, depends in part on how the United States
defines its interests and on how one assesses trends in the
international security environment. For example, a U.S. national
security strategy of engagement designed to preserve a position
of world leadership will treat unconventional threats more
seriously than a strategy that reflects less concern for
developments overseas. Likewise, unconventional threats will be
deemed more important if they are directed or manipulated by
growing regional powers intent on systematically challenging U.S.
interests than if they seem to be isolated and discrete events.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is also difficult to generalize about the applicability of
unconventional instruments to future national security problems.
The instruments discussed in this chapter seem to be of
increasing importance because they can broaden the range of
options open to decision makers reluctant to resort to
higher-cost military measures, and they often minimize the
collateral damage associated with the use of coercive measures.
Nevertheless, all unconventional options will continue to be
politically sensitive and hard to manage. Unconventional
instruments, which often are slow to produce even limited
results, may seem attractive to decision makers who consider all
the alternative policy options even less satisfactory, but they
may not be sustainable without a carefully managed effort to
marshal public support. To the extent unconventional measures are
seen as innovative, proportionate, and discriminate responses to
real threats, the public is more likely to be supportive. If they
are interpreted as unethical and ineffective half-measures, they
will receive less support and be difficult to sustain.

Military intervention comprises violent and nonviolent operations
to protect or advance U.S. national interests. But this chapter
includes only those operations in the middle ground above the
level of a covert or unconventional action and below the level of
a major war. Thus, the limited military interventions analyzed
here include such undertakings as:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Military deployment in support of diplomacy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The evacuation or rescue of U.S. and allied citizens.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The enforcement of sanctions, embargoes and exclusion zones.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Limited air strikes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Noncombat support for allies in small wars.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Combat operations by U.S. forces in small wars.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because limited military intervention differs from full-scale war
by involving limited numbers of personnel and is often of shorter
duration, it also differs politically. Historical precedent and
Supreme Court decisions have given the President significant
latitude in initiating interventions without prior congressional
approval. Of course, Presidents frequently <I>have</I> consulted
with Congress prior to initiating military intervention, and
Congress has been able to terminate such operations, particularly
by withdrawing funds. Domestic U.S. politics can play an
important role in the success or failure of an intervention; the
depth and breadth of public support for the operation can vitally
influence decisions about operational matters, such as the
numbers and kinds of forces deployed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though military intervention is a limited instrument, it remains
very much a weapon--an instrument with the potential to injure
and to kill. Consequently, military intervention is inherently
threatening and as such carries particular risks. No matter how
benevolent U.S. intentions may be, the very act of wielding a
weapon may produce an adverse reaction in others. Even in the
case of military intervention to aid disaster victims, there may
be some whose interests are threatened by the amelioration of
local suffering or simply by the deployment of U.S. forces. When
military intervention takes place with the threat of even a
low-level use of force--for example, in the establishment of
exclusion zones--the danger of violent opposition increases. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a result, those proposing military intervention need to answer
two separate but equally important sets of questions: What do
they intend to accomplish by their use of the U.S. armed forces,
and how do they plan to do it? What are the possible responses of
governments and populations in the region where intervention is
planned? Once these questions have been answered, planners can
decide whether the aim of military intervention would be worth
the likely price of achieving it. In this sense, a proposed
military intervention needs to be analyzed as if it were a
limited war in two meanings of the term: limited as to resources
to be invested, and limited as to goals to be achieved. That is
true even in the case of nonviolent operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1302.gif" align="left"><b>USS Wasp off Haiti during
Operation Restore Democracy</b><p>Limited military intervention
can exert great pressure, particularly against a weak foe. But
U.S. military intervention may provoke total resistance on the
part of a moderately powerful adversary. Although a commitment to
total war on the part of such an adversary does not necessarily
guarantee defeat for an intervening power, such a situation does
raise the possibility of a military intervention's progressively
escalating as the intervening power is forced to commit ever
greater resources to accomplish its original aims. Such an
increasing commitment can also create a logic of its own,
obscuring the goals of the intervention, introducing questions of
national prestige and credibility, and evoking a determination to
justify heavy casualties by victory. Such a dilemma faced the
United States in Vietnam and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
Nonetheless, such cases are the exception rather than the rule.
Generally, military intervention provides a highly flexible
weapon that allows a government an option lying somewhere between
the extremes of passively accepting injury to national interests
and waging all-out war.

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the past half century, U.S. military intervention has
involved so many activities on so vast a scale that categorizing
and analyzing them can hardly be attempted in a few pages.
Nonetheless, some general patterns do present themselves. It is
more difficult to make educated guesses about how American
military intervention may evolve in the post-Cold War world. The
fundamental nature of warfare seems in the process of a major
shift, what is commonly referred to as a "revolution in military
affairs." Even small wars and military intervention short of war
seem likely to be affected by such developments.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Military Deployments in
Support of Diplomacy</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cold War diplomacy was inextricably linked with the threat of
force. The Berlin crises of 1948-49 and 1961 offer prime
examples. These were resolved not on the battlefield but in
secret exchanges between U.S. and Soviet diplomats over the
status and survival of the West Berlin enclave. However, U.S.
military deployments were an important factor in the West's
diplomatic successes. The deployments offered concrete proof of
the United States's ability to sustain Berlin and Washington's
resolve to go to war to defend the city, if necessary.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States so routinely deployed aircraft carriers to back
up its diplomacy during the Cold War that listing all the
instances would prove tedious. Still, a number of examples stand
out: the introduction of a Marine landing team into the
Mediterranean aboard the USS <I>Midway</I> in 1948 to support
Greece and Turkey; the movement of the USS <I>Enterprise</I> into
the Bay of Bengal during the India-Pakistan war of 1971; and the
crossing by Sixth Fleet carriers of the Libyan government's "line
of death" in the Gulf of Sidra in the 1980s. On other occasions,
the U.S. backed up diplomacy with aerospace assets (e.g.,
deploying AWACS or fighters to a crisis zone, placing strategic
bombers and missiles on alert, and, most famously, organizing the
1948-49 airlift to Berlin). Less frequently, ground forces were
employed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The life-or-death rationale that underlay armed diplomacy during
the Cold War is gone. In the post-Cold War world, U.S. leaders
must be extremely careful about ensuring public support before
threatening or promising the use of U.S. ground forces as a form
of diplomatic leverage. To make such declarations, only to
discover that Congress does not approve, would be damaging to
U.S. credibility. For such deployments to succeed, the President
will have to make clear that serious national interests are
involved and, thereafter, gain and sustain the support of the
public for the duration of the intervention.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Operations in support of diplomacy continued after the end of the
Cold War, notable examples being President Clinton's military
response to the Iraqi buildup along the Kuwaiti border in October
1994, and similar deployments to Kuwait and Jordan in August
1995. These temporary force movements and exercises demonstrated
American resolve to defend Iraq's Arab neighbors against
aggression. But one can presume that private warnings conveyed
through third parties or secret channels were also important in
making U.S. resolve clear to Baghdad.<hr><blockquote><b>Secretary
Perry's Criteria for Military Intervention</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After evaluating the interests at stake and the costs of the
operation, the administration will consider many specific factors
before deciding whether to commit forces, what objectives to
assign to them, and what level of forces to employ. Prominent
among these factors are:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Existing treaty commitments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The willingness and ability of like-minded nations,
particularly those most directly affected by the conflict, to
contribute to the operation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Whether, in the absence of coalition partners, U.S. unilateral
action is justified.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Clear military objectives supporting political objectives.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Judgments about the necessary duration and costs of the
operation. In other words, can it be achieved in a reasonable
amount of time with an acceptable expenditure of resources and
concluded in an acceptable manner.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The willingness to commit sufficient forces to achieve the
defined objectives.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The extent to which support for U.S. involvement exists among
Congress and the American people, and the extent to which such
support can be marshaled.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The acceptability, in the case of multilateral operations, of
proposed arrangements for command and control of U.S. forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The relationship among the size, composition, and disposition of
forces committed and U.S. objectives must be continually
reasserted and, if necessary, adjusted.

and the Congress</I>, February 1995.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In striking contrast to the United States's success in deterring
aggression against Kuwait were its difficulties in achieving its
diplomatic aims in the western Balkans in 1993-94. While U.S.
peacekeepers in Macedonia helped prevent the spread of fighting
to that country, a lasting cease-fire in Bosnia was achieved only
in November 1995 after negotiations in Dayton, Ohio, organized by
the U.S. government. Some argue that this delay may have been
because Washington announced a priori that it would not deploy
large-scale ground forces to the region until a peace agreement
had been achieved, greatly reducing the power of U.S. diplomacy.
The U.S.-encouraged NATO air strikes in the former Yugoslavia in
summer 1995 were an important contributing factor to the Serbian
side's decision to agree to peace talks. But as a sign of
Washington's commitment, they could not substitute for the
placement of U.S. military personnel on the ground. Compare the
failed 1993 mission of the USS <I>Harlan County </I>in Haiti with
the success of the 1994 Carter-Nunn-Powell mission to
Port-au-Prince (backed up by the imminent arrival of thousands of
U.S. ground troops).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the far greater control ground forces can exercise in a
region, compared to air or naval operations, the threat of their
deployment is a powerful tool with which to support a diplomatic
initiative. However, introducing ground forces greatly ups the
dangers (e.g., of casualties and hostages) and therefore the
domestic political stakes of an operation. The American public
and Congress displayed great unease over the idea of dispatching
U.S. ground forces to Haiti. A similar attitude regarding the use
of U.S. ground forces to guarantee the peace settlement in Bosnia
was overcome only after considerable efforts by President Clinton
to persuade Congress and the U.S. public that the deployment was
vital to U.S. interests for leadership in NATO and peace in a
volatile part of Europe. One reason is the danger that such
deployments could bring casualties to which the American public
is increasingly sensitive. Another factor is the degree to which
U.S. national interests are seen to be at stake. There was little
hesitation in sending ground forces to Saudi Arabia in 1990,
despite the risk of casualties, because there was a consensus
that important U.S. interests were at stake (in contrast to the
congressional debate in January 1991 about whether to liberate
Kuwait).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Uses of military intervention such as the force movements in the
Middle East during the Clinton administration will likely
continue even in an age of decreasing overseas presence,
information warfare, and cruise missiles. Nothing so demonstrates
U.S. determination to honor a diplomatic commitment as the
placing of U.S. military personnel in harm's way to fulfill such
a pledge.<hr><blockquote><b>Military Intervention in Support of
Diplomacy: Korea 1993-95</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. armed forces have played a major role in support of
diplomatic efforts to end the North Korean development of nuclear
weapons. Through both activity and inactivity, the U.S.
military--especially the Army and Air Force units stationed in
South Korea--has given the United States special political and
psychological  as well as military leverage with the Pyongyang
regime.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The public phase of the crisis began in March 1993 with the North
Korean announcement that it would withdraw from the Treaty on the
Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and would not allow
the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its suspected
nuclear-weapons program. Throughout the spring of that year, U.S.
government spokesmen offered high-level talks with the Pyongyang
regime. But these offers seemed to accomplish nothing. Finally,
in June, the United States offered to cancel the annual joint
military exercises in South Korea--exercises that Pyongyang has
long denounced as provocative and as preparatory for an invasion
of the North. This concession was rapidly followed by North
Korean-U.S. negotiations and the announcement in June 1993 that
Pyongyang would continue to honor the NPT.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The following month, President Clinton visited South Korea.
American forces were presented for his inspection, and the
president reassured the South Korean people that U.S. forces
would remain in their country as long as they were needed. In
September, in order to reassure America's other major ally in the
region, the United States and Japan began talks on developing an
antimissile system for deployment on Japanese soil. The talks
were in obvious response to North Korean testing of missiles that
could be armed with nuclear warheads.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Negotiations between the United States and North Korea continued
throughout the fall of 1993, with little result. In December, the
Defense Department announced it was considering options to
strengthen both American forces in South Korea and the South
Korean forces themselves. Within days, Pyongyang declared that it
would allow inspectors access to its officially disclosed
nuclear-program sites. Despite this breakthrough, the U.S.
government revealed in January 1994 that it would ship Patriot
antimissile batteries to South Korea.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The crisis worsened in the spring of 1994. Pyongyang blocked
nuclear inspectors from carrying out their work and renewed its
threat to withdraw from the NPT. Washington annouced its
intention to seek UN economic sanctions on North Korea, but other
major powers were reluctant to support sanctions at that stage.
In June, President Clinton began studying plans for a major
military buildup in South Korea.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As tensions mounted, former President Jimmy Carter visited both
halves of Korea and returned to the United States announcing that
he had found North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung reasonable and
willing to negotiate. Although Kim died in July 1994, U.S.-North
Korean talks continued to press on into the fall, culminating in
an agreement in October 1994. Pyongyang would suspend its nuclear
program, in return for which the United States would provide oil
as a short-term fix to North Korea's energy problems and create
an international consortium to provide proliferation-resistant
light-water reactors to replace the North's graphite-moderated
reactors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the spring of 1995, repeating the pattern of the crisis since
it had begun, the North Koreans rejected the delivery of South
Korean nuclear reactors. These formed an essential part of the
aid package assembled the previous fall. U.S. diplomats insisted
that the Pyongyang regime accept the reactors, and in May, the
North Koreans acquiesced. For the time being, the crisis
subsided.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Without knowing the ultimate resolution of the delicate situation
on the Korean peninsula, it is still obvious that the U.S.
military presence provides the security foundation on which rest
U.S. diplomatic efforts to prevent Pyongyang from building
nuclear weapons. Looming over every other reality was the
unmentioned stick of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The final argument
for American diplomats in their negotiations with the North
Koreans was that even if Pyongyang produced a few warheads and
married them to ballistic missiles, the United States could
obliterate North Korea if it came to nuclear
blows.</blockquote><hr>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead4">Evacuation and Rescue
Missions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. armed forces frequently engaged in evacuation and rescue
operations during the Cold War: to pull Americans away from
hostile mobs during the Middle East wars and crises from 1948 to
1991; to protect missionaries in the Congo during the bloody
chaos following independence in the early 1960s; and to evacuate
hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese and Cambodians from Indochina
in 1975. These missions were in support of humanitarian ideals,
the centuries-old European principle of protecting Western
nationals abroad (if necessary by armed force), and the U.S. Cold
War policy of offering refuge to those who had placed their lives
at risk by opposing communism.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More recent examples of this form of military intervention
include the evacuations of imperiled foreigners from Liberia,
Somalia, and Rwanda. The anarchy that led to these missions adds
weight to the widespread expectation that other states throughout
Africa and southwest Asia will fail over the coming decades. If
these pessimistic predictions prove correct, U.S. armed forces
will most likely be called upon to engage in numerous evacuation
and rescue missions for Westerners over the next quarter of a
century. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, the collapse of the Soviet empire has ended
the U.S. policy of rescuing anti-communist refugees. Furthermore,
hostility is growing within North American and Western European
public opinion to offering assistance to refugees and would-be
immigrants from Third World and Fourth World countries. This
raises questions about the future willingness of the U.S.
government to employ armed forces to rescue non-American citizens
or citizens of countries closely allied to the United States. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other problems facing the implementation of such missions in the
future may arise from logistics and transportation availability.
The armed forces of the United States and its allies are
shrinking. Washington is also in the process of reducing the
number of its overseas bases, so that, in several decades' time,
the U.S. military may no longer have bases on foreign soil. For
these reasons, the future ability of the American military to
launch successful evacuation and rescue missions may be somewhat
circumscribed. Particularly large operations may require
cooperation between U.S. and foreign militaries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, compared to all other countries, the sea and air
transport resources of the U.S. armed forces remain enormous,
<BR>
although many Air Force C-141 transports are reaching the end of
their operational lives. In order to project military force, the
U.S. armed forces is likely to retain such lift capability
through modernization and upgrading. It will therefore also be
available for evacuation and rescue operations. Thus, U.S.
superiority in the ability to evacuate large numbers of people by
ship or aircraft is certain to endure for decades to come. In
cases where a relatively small number of people are involved, it
may be possible for such missions to be conducted by other
countries' armed forces. But when a sizable number of people
require rescue or evacuation, U.S. participation will be
necessary.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1303.gif" align="left"><b>U.S. Marine on patrol in
Somalia during Operation Resote Hope in Somalia</b><p>The rescue
of U.S. military personnel under combat conditions, particularly
downed flight crews, will also continue to be carried out on a
fairly frequent basis. The June 1995 extraction from Bosnia of
Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady by U.S. Marines offers one recent
example of this type of operation. Since the United States
remains committed to various surveillance, exclusion,
humanitarian, peacekeeping, and covert operations involving
manned aircraft and special-operations units, the rescue of their
personnel will almost certainly be required from time to time.
The practice by certain societies of abusing U.S. military
prisoners to put psychological pressure on the U.S. government
and public will only make such rescue operations more imperative.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Sanctions Enforcement</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the United States generally was not able to
gain adherence to sanctions such as exclusion areas, in which
certain types of activity (e.g., moving military units) are
prohibited, or embargoes, which prohibit the import or export of
certain types of materiel (e.g., arms or petroleum). Any U.N.
Security Council resolution to create such zones favored by the
United States was almost certain to be vetoed by the Soviet
Union. And without U.N. approval, it was virtually impossible to
create the legal and moral authority to establish such restricted
areas. However, in a few cases in which the Soviets favored such
U.N. resolutions and the United States chose to agree, exclusion
zones and embargoes were established. The major cases were the
embargoes on arms sales to Portugal during the final years of its
colonial wars in Guinea, Angola, and Mozambique, and to South
Africa because of its policy of apartheid. After its 1965
unilateral and illegal declaration of independence from Britain,
the white minority government in Rhodesia was placed under a
near-total embargo.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite U.S. adherence to these U.N. resolutions, the role of the
U.S. military in enforcing them was minimal. In a small number of
cases during the decades of East-West confrontation, the United
States chose to use its armed forces unilaterally to enforce
blockades or exclusion zones, even at the risk of war. The most
famous case was the blockade of Cuba in the fall of 1962; another
was the counterinvasion patrol in the Formosa Strait from 1950 to
1972.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the early 1990s, the permanent members of the Security Council
cooperated far more, with the result that exclusion-zone and
embargo resolutions became fairly common. Examples included the
no-fly zones established over Bosnia and Iraq, and the embargo on
arms deliveries to Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia-Montenegro.
Decision makers often turn to sanctions because they represent a
stronger step than a diplomatic d&eacute;marche but avoid the
drawbacks and risks of military force. Unlike the latter,
sanctions can easily be ratcheted up or down. Sanctions also can
be used to weaken the military capabilities of a target state,
thus improving chances for success should military force become
necessary. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although other U.S. government agencies take the lead on
sanctions policy, military forces play the dominant role in
enforcing embargoes and exclusion zones. The ever-increasing C4I
and surveillance capabilities enjoyed by the U.S. armed forces
make such operations easier from a technical standpoint. No other
military enjoys a comparable ability to monitor the locations,
dimensions, directions, speeds, and communications of ships,
aircraft, and land vehicles. Similar capabilities from both
technical and human intelligence resources allow the United
States to keep track of foreign economic and financial
activities, giving U.S. forces unparalleled ability to enforce
blockades and exclusion zones. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1305.gif" align="left"><b>Coast Guard intercepts an
Iraqi ship, 1990mm.</b><p>In the enforcement of embargoes, the
military's largest responsibility is interdicting goods on land
and at sea. In the case of Haiti, for example, the U.S. Navy and
the U.S. Coast Guard contributed most of the ships in the U.N.'s
maritime interdiction force, while U.S. Army forces, working with
their Dominican Republic counterparts, limited smuggling across
the land border into Haiti. U.S. forces have also contributed
most of the capabilities to enforce the embargo against Iraq
imposed in 1990. In the former Yugoslavia, the U.S. Navy helped
enforce economic sanctions against Serbia, as well as the arms
embargo applying to all the former Yugoslav republics. At the
same time, DOD contractors, mostly retired U.S. military
personnel, helped monitor border traffic between Serbia and
Serb-occupied areas of Bosnia, thereby slowing the flow of fuel,
arms, and other war materiel to Bosnian Serbs. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The effectiveness of sanctions could be enhanced by more
aggressive interdiction, more precise focus of sanctions within
the target state, and mitigation of unintended economic and
political consequences. For example, interdiction missions could
be strengthened by using nonlethal technologies to stop ships,
planes, and other forms of transport. More precise focusing of
sanctions within a target state could be achieved through direct
action, such as sabotage of transportation nodes, or through
forms of information warfare, including the disruption of
communications, especially those affecting the banking and
trading system. More precise focusing might also be feasible by
imposing sanctions in ways that would damage the interests of
political elites in the target state more than ordinary citizens.
Lastly, psychological operations could be used more effectively
to mitigate the unwanted side effects of sanctions by garnering
support for U.S. policy from within the target state as well as
without. Greater consideration could also be given to using
psychological operations as a means of maximizing popular
resistance against the leadership of a sanctioned regime. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sanctions work most effectively when they are accompanied by
other, forceful military initiatives. In the case of Haiti, the
deployment of U.S. forces offshore helped keep pressure on the
C&eacute;dras regime via threats of direct U.S. military
intervention. Deployment of U.S. forces in Iraq serves a similar
purpose, with the U.S. military having the additional important
role of protecting the Kurdish population, which is an important
source of opposition to Saddam's regime. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When using U.S. forces to support sanctions, U.S. policymakers
sometimes face conflicts between political and military
objectives. For example, stopping intercoastal smuggling between
Haiti and the Dominican Republic was a top U.S. priority.
However, devising adequate rules of engagement for the maritime
patrols proved very difficult, because most smuggling took place
on small boats piloted by Haitian and Dominican civilians. The
dilemma was that stopping this trade required strong action,
including warning and disabling shots that would have produced
conflict and casualties, including casualties for U.S. forces. In
the end, the United States decided against strong action to block
intercoastal smuggling, because the political and diplomatic
fallout could have undermined support for the sanctions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lastly, U.S. military forces help mitigate the effects of
sanctions so that U.S. policy gains are maximized. In Haiti, for
example, U.S. forces delivered aid and improved Haiti's ability
to absorb the aid through civil affairs programs, thus
significantly improving Haiti's economic condition.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">Limited Air Strikes</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bombardment by non-nuclear explosives, particularly air-delivered
bombardment, has become increasingly attractive to the U.S.
government in applying military force while minimizing risk. Such
operations present a smaller likelihood of U.S. casualties than
those involving ground forces in contact with the enemy. The
chances of U.S. forces suffering loss or capture in bombardment
operations have been further reduced since the end of the Cold
War. The collapse of Soviet military power has granted
overwhelming superiority over any conceivable foe of the U.S. Air
Force and the U.S. Navy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Area bombing, naval gunfire, and rocket fire have been superceded
by the use of "smart bombs," cruise missiles, and other
precision-guided munitions. Accurate strikes on military targets
reduce the possibility of collateral damage, that is, unintended
civilian casualties or destruction of non-military targets. The
growing ubiquity and versatility of television technology and the
appearance of international broadcasting networks have given the
public the ability to observe the results of bombardments carried
out by their forces. Precision strikes greatly lessen the chances
that television viewers will be presented with disturbing images
of civilian dead, wrecked hospitals, or burning houses of worship
caused by U.S. bombs. The reduction of such damage by
bombardment, compared with that inflicted by U.S. forces in World
War II or even the Vietnam War, also lessens the chances that
outraged international opinion can be mobilized against the U.S.
government.<hr><blockquote><b>Small Wars Waged by U.S. Forces:
Panama 1989</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega enjoyed a complicated
relationship with the United States throughout the 1980s. On the
one hand, he assisted the Reagan administration in the covert war
against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua and was a source of
intelligence for the CIA. But Noriega also sold weapons and
provided intelligence to various communist and Middle Eastern
enemies of the United States. Worse, from Washington's viewpoint,
beginning in 1985, he was seen as a threat to Panamanian
democracy after having pressured the elected president to step
down because the military could no longer work with his
presidency. At the same time, General Noriega was clearly
identified as a major actor in drug and money-laundering
activities. From late 1986 until late 1989, the objective of the
United States' Panama policy was deceptively simple: Noriega must
go. The question was how to accomplish this end.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. was not ready to use force to remove Noriega. Unlike
Marcos, Somosa, and Duvalier, Noriega was the general in charge
of the armed forces, and he was not ready to retire. A crisis
developed between 1987 and 1989 during which Noriega was indicted
in Miami on twelve counts of racketeering and cocaine
trafficking; the Panamanian president was ousted by the military;
and the United States applied various alternatives to
force--diplomatic, economic, and legal measures--to remove the
general, without success. At the same time, the U.S. government
ruled out U.S. military intervention except to protect the Panama
Canal from attack and to protect U.S. lives. However, beginning
in the spring of 1988, the Reagan administration did begin to
reinforce U.S. forces in Panama, and contingency planning began
in earnest.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In May 1989, Noriega allowed national elections, convinced that
his puppet candidates would win. The Panamanian people disagreed.
Although Noriega's candidates were proclaimed the winners,
international observers announced that the Noriega regime had
stolen the election by fraud. President Bush recalled the U.S.
ambassador to Panama and persuaded every Latin American
government--save those of Cuba and Nicaragua--to condemn the
Noriega regime. While a war of nerves between the United States
and Panama intensified during the summer of 1989, the
Organization of American States tried unsuccessfully to negotiate
with Noriega, attempting to persuade him to relinquish power. In
September, President Bush announced that the United States no
longer recognized the Panamanian government as legitimate, while
at the same time reinforcing the U.S. presence in Panama.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A final Panamanian move to unseat Noriega, a coup attempt against
the dictator by disaffected members of the Panamanian Defense
Forces (PDF), failed in early October 1989. After this pivotal
event, the Bush administration looked at its military options in
a different light. On December 15, Noriega ordered his National
Assembly of Representatives to declare Panama in "a state of war"
with the United States. The next day, PDF forces opened fire on a
car carrying four American servicemen, seriously wounding one.
Late on December 17, President Bush ordered Operation Just Cause
to be launched early on December 20, 1989.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Just Cause was carried out by a joint all-service task force
based on two Army divisions, an independent Army brigade, a
Marine Expeditionary Brigade, and smaller elite Special Forces
and Army Ranger units. The task force was overwhelmingly superior
in size, capability, and training to the PDF. By the end of
daylight on the second day of the operation, SOUTHCOM forces had
effectively crushed all resistance. By December 25, military
operations were over--with the exception of efforts to capture
Noriega. On December 24, he had taken refuge in the quarters of
the papal nuncio.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Noriega was subjected to an intense psychological operations
effort to break his morale and induce his surrender. Finally, on
the evening of January 3, 1990, Noriega walked out of the
nunciature and delivered himself to the Special Forces unit that
had surrounded his hiding place. The Panamanian government that
had been elected but prevented from taking office in May 1989
already had been installed by the American forces and recognized
by Washington two weeks earlier. Operation Just Cause cost the
U.S. military 23 dead and 324 wounded. The PDF lost over 300 men
and had about 125 wounded. At least 200 Panamanian civilians were
killed in the fighting and over 1500 were wounded.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Just Cause represents an excellent example of a small war. U.S.
casualties were relatively light, operations were concluded in a
very short time, all objectives were met, and the war received
the overwhelming support not only of the American people but of
Panamanians as well. However, Panamanian civilian losses were
high. Although U.S. firepower was carefully planned and
skillfully executed in an effort to keep casualties to a minimum,
suppressive fires were heavy. In the densely urbanized areas
where much of Just Cause was conducted, this inevitably led to
the death or injury of many noncombatants.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the increasing urbanization of the world population and the
growth of slum cities throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America,
Just Cause may indicate some sobering trends in the evolution of
warfare. The application of heavy firepower in huge slums
constructed from cardboard, plywood, and sheet metal may produce
horrific civilian casualties. For psychological and political
reasons, U.S. armed forces may need to rethink their doctrine for
urban warfare.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, the rapid improvement over the past several decades in
the accuracy, range, and power of bombardment by non-nuclear
munitions has created unrealistic attitudes in the minds of some
about the capabilities of such weapons. From the time when
rapid-fire, long-range, high explosive artillery was developed in
the late nineteenth century, through the creation of strategic
aerial bombing forces in the 1930s, to the contemporary use of
cruise missiles, expectations have arisen about the ability of
such weapons to make wars both short and free from high
casualties. Strategic bombing theorists such as Giulio Douhet
argued that no modern state could long withstand massive attacks
on its urban centers. Aerial warfare prophets predicted that
bombardment of enemy cities would rapidly lead to panic, the
collapse of morale, and the crumbling of all resistance in a
matter of days.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, as the results of aerial bombing campaigns from the
Second World War to the Gulf War have demonstrated, such
operations can be an effective form of attrition warfare, slowly
wearing down enemy will and destroying his means to resist. But
human beings, whether military or civilian, have shown themselves
to be far tougher psychologically under bombardment than had been
supposed. Eventually, people may crumble under the weight of
heavy sustained bombardment. But such resistance can last for
years. In the interim, anger at the losses inflicted by the
bombardment can actually increase determination to hold on and
fight back.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, lengthy bombardment operations by manned aircraft
inevitably result in the destruction of aircraft and the death,
injury, or capture of aircrews. For this reason alone, the use of
unmanned means of bombardment has become increasingly attractive
to the U.S. government. But even in bombardment operations in
which U.S. forces risk little or no chance of casualties, such
campaigns can still evolve into a test of wills between the U.S.
and enemy public. The enemy may employ psychological warfare to
induce doubts about the justice of the U.S. cause or guilt over
the suffering being inflicted and thus persuade U.S. public
opinion to end the bombardment. Even cruise missiles can go
astray or be misguided due to faulty intelligence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given continuing improvement in guidance and explosives
technology and the unwillingness of the U.S. public to suffer
heavy casualties in limited war, bombardment will be an even more
attractive option than in the past. Such operations may prove
highly effective under appropriate circumstances. But they will
not solve every military problem, nor will they be carried out
without loss of innocent life.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1306.gif" align="left"><b>Missile launching from USS
Arleigh Burke</B><p>Bombardment can be a useful instrument when
applied with appropriate expectations of its utility. When used
in concert with other instruments, it can be a key factor in
bringing an adversary to the negotiating table or causing him to
cease hostile behavior. The bombing of the Bosnian Serb
facilities in the late summer and early fall of 1995 did not stop
the hostilities, but, coupled with the economic embargo on Serbia
and with diplomatic pressure, did play a key role in bringing
Serbia and its Bosnian Serb allies into serious peace
negotiations. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead7">Support for Allies in Small
Wars and Insurgencies</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Post-World War II, Soviet expansion and the resulting U.S.
strategy of containment led to numerous violent conflicts along
the East-West divide and throughout the so-called Third World. In
only a few cases, notably in Korea, was there a classic military
confrontation of invasion and defense. Insurgency, an organized
movement aimed at the overthrow of a constituted government
through the use of subversion and armed conflict, was the
principal means by which the Cold War struggle was fought on the
peripheries of its major theaters. In these small wars between
U.S. and Soviet allies, the U.S. role took such forms as
small-scale training and advisory roles, sometimes coupled with
large aid flows (from the Greek civil war of the 1940s to El
Salvador in the 1980s), or large-scale semi-covert operations
with little if any involvement by the U.S. military (as in
Afghanistan and Nicaragua). 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After the national U.S. debate of 1946-49 was resolved in favor
of containing Soviet expansion, public support for military
assistance to embattled anti-communist governments became
virtually pro forma for twenty years. In general, the deployments
of small numbers of U.S. troops to various anti-communist
conflicts were not weighed on a case-by-case basis. Instead, they
were regarded as part of the overall anti-Soviet effort that the
country had resolved to wage indefinitely. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the trauma of Vietnam destroyed this consensus. As in other
conflicts, the commitment of U.S. troops to the defense of the
Republic of Vietnam began as an advisory and training effort. The
U.S. resources invested in the struggle grew to enormous levels,
with nearly 60,000 battle deaths, exceeding those suffered by
U.S. forces in any other war save the Civil War and World War II.
Following the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, no U.S.
administration could continue to count on automatic public
acceptance of military support for U.S. clients in small
anti-communist conflicts.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The possibility of the establishment of communist regimes in
Central America in the 1980s did persuade a majority of the U.S.
public to support a small-scale and temporary military presence
in Honduras and El Salvador. But with the memory of Vietnam still
fresh, such support was given reluctantly and was carefully
circumscribed. After the collapse of the Soviet threat in
1989-1991, the rationale for such use of U.S. armed forces
disappeared altogether. Unless and until the United States finds
itself engaged in a protracted struggle with another world power,
it seems certain that the American people will accept the
deployment of military advisory and training missions to
countries at war only after careful consideration of the
particular circumstances and the U.S. interests involved.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Insurgencies remain capable of adversely affecting U. S.
interests. When they do, Washington can provide the party it is
supporting with advice, financial and material support, training,
and, as a last resort, advisors or other U.S. military personnel
operating with indigenous forces. In the past, based on theories
of conflict and development espoused by social scientists and
economists, U.S. counterinsurgency efforts placed great emphasis
on addressing the insurgency's supposed socioeconomic causes.
Experience and further reflection have indicated that such
theories were inadequate. The grievances expressed by those
involved--typically political--are also important causes of the
insurgencies.<hr><blockquote><b>Civilian Resistance</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Civilian resistance by means of mass nonviolent direction,
sometimes called "people power," has often been regarded by
national security analysts with skepticism. They have seen it as
perhaps playing a role in peripheral situations but not as an
important factor when vital interests are at stake. In fact, mass
demonstrations, strikes, and boycotts have played a major role in
shaping the post-Cold-War international system. Civilian
resistance was a prominent feature of the East European
revolutions that ended communist rule in 1989-1991 and in
reversing the 1991 Russian coup, which were events as important
as any in recent decades. Since the late 1980s, civilian
resistance has been relatively successful against authoritarian
rule from the Philippines to South Africa. However, as of late
1995, it has been unsuccessful in Burma, Tibet, and China.
Whether for good or ill, direct action by civilians has become
part of the strategic mix.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Civilian resistance has rarely been discussed as something that
can be encouraged and planned, either by governments or even by
the participants. Nonviolent struggle is often assumed to be
determined by structural factors and by the interaction of the
opponents' will to repress and the civilians' capacity to suffer.
But these assumptions mislead. Closely studied cases of the last
fifteen years show that civilian resistance, like any other form
of political behavior, depends on the quality of the strategic
choices made by participants, and therefore on the advice and
support they receive. The "people power" defense of Cory Aquino's
1986 election in the Philippines was successful in part because
of the years of deliberate organization and training by social
activists and in part because the U.S. government showed that it
had stopped supporting Ferdinand Marcos. Student insurrectionists
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square were not aided by their mistakes in
tactics (not dispersing when faced with overwhelming odds) and
strategy (failing to guarantee strong reaction in China to a
massacre). The U.S. government cannot create civilian resistance,
nor is it likely to directly sponsor groups to wage popular
struggles abroad. But it can make use of civilian resistance by
considering how to provide such movements with strategic support.
More skillful assistance to the Civilian Crusade in Panama in
1987 might have obviated the need for the subsequent Operation
Just Cause or rendered that operation less costly to all
concerned. In some circumstances, encouragement and material
support for civilian resistance can be an alternative to military
deployment in a peace operation, accomplishing the same goals at
lower cost and with less violence. </blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to addressing grievances, techniques that the United
States can use for countering insurgency include penetration of
the insurgent organization and aggressive patrolling, if the
insurgents are operating in small units. If the insurgents are
operating in an urban area, the emphasis should fall on
penetrating their networks. Although shanty towns may appear to
provide insurgents with the same advantage that mountains and
dense forests do in a rural setting, an urban setting allows the
government to concentrate its resources, while the insurgent must
operate in a limited area. Although some U.S. technical support
may help the government in these situations, what is most needed
in the urban setting is old-fashioned police intelligence work.
That is within the capabilities of even a poor government, as
long as it is committed to supporting such police work. If the
government is not, the United States is unlikely to have
sufficient leverage to make the government change its mind. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the promises held out by exponents of information warfare
prove correct, it may be possible in coming years for small teams
of American advisors to use enormous information resources in the
defense of an embattled ally. Enemy forces might be located and
subjected to devastating fire with few or no Americans exposed to
risk. In such cases, U.S. military technology might make the
direct involvement of U.S. forces larger than advisory teams in
small wars unnecessary--unless, of course, U.S. opponents were to
acquire similar capabilities. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead8">Waging Small Wars with U.S.
Forces</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States engaged directly in numerous small wars before
1941, but very few thereafter. After the establishment of the
Central Intelligence Agency in 1947 and the creation of a system
of peacetime alliances in the late 1940s and early 1950s,
Washington had new alternatives. When the U.S. government decided
to solve a problem with a small measure of military intervention,
covert action or the use of surrogates generally replaced the
customary landing of Marines. Furthermore, during the struggle
with the nuclear-armed Soviet Union, the direct engagement of
U.S. forces carried risks that did not exist in pre-Cold War
years. As a result, Washington tended to avoid such interventions
for fear of provoking a Soviet response, which would in turn
create the possibility of a high-stakes American-Soviet
confrontation. <hr><blockquote><b>The War Powers Resolution</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is empowered to declare war
and to raise and support armies (Article I, Section 8) whereas
the President is their Commander-in-Chief (Article II, Section
2). The framers of the Constitution understood that there would
be emergencies when the President would have to take military
actions without the consent of Congress, but they did not spell
out what these might be, or whether these should be limited in
duration. This uncertainty, and the reluctance of the courts to
adjudicate, has resulted in a continuous tug-of-war between
Congress and the President over his authority to deploy U.S.
forces abroad and send them in harm's way. This dispute
culminated in the enactment of the War Powers Resolution in
November 1973, over President Richard Nixon's veto.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the absence of a declaration of war or specific statutory
authorization for the action taken, the Resolution establishes
three basic procedures: 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Consultations. Over the 22 years since the Resolution came into
effect, the requirement that the President consult with Congress,
"in every possible instance" prior to introducing U.S. forces to
hostilities or imminent hostilities abroad, has not been a
burden. This is in part because the President is allowed
discretion to determine whether prior consultations are possible,
and in part because he has often limited consultations to
informing Congressional leaders of the action he was about to
take.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Reporting. The Resolution requires reporting to Congress within
48 hours of introducing U.S. forces to hostilities or imminent
hostilities [Section 4(a)(1)] and of other deployments of U.S.
combat forces abroad [Sections 4(a)(2) and 4(a)(3)]. A report
under Section 4(a)(1), but not under the other sections, starts a
60-day clock that will result in mandating withdrawal of the U.S.
forces upon expiration of that period, unless Congress has
declared war, or specifically authorized the action, prior to
that deadline. Out of some 40 reports submitted in 1973-1995,
only the 1975 report on the Mayaguez incident specifically cited
Section 4(a)(1).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Termination. As just mentioned, the Resolution provides for
mandatory withdrawal of U.S. forces 60 days after submission of
the report (90 days, if the President certifies it is necessary),
if Congress does not declare war or approve the engagement of the
U.S. forces within that deadline. This provision has been
criticized as encouraging a foreign power to wait out the
deadline, hoping that Congress will fail to act. It is also
alleged to be unconstitutional, because the President would be
deprived of the opportunity to veto the withdrawal. A similar
criticism is made of the provision in the War Powers Resolution
which authorizes the Congress to mandate withdrawal of the U.S.
forces at any time by Concurrent Resolution, because a Concurrent
Resolution does not require the President's approval.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Concerns with the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution
have been voiced by every President since 1973, as well as by
many members of Congress. In February 1995, the House passed a
bill repealing much of the War Powers Resolution while placing
strict limitations on U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping; a
similar bill was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-Kansas). 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Congress is well aware that by controlling appropriations, it can
preclude continuation of a military operation over a substantial
period. However, Congress has been reluctant to use the power of
the purse to stop operations such as the deployment of 20,000
troops to Bosnia in late 1995. The FY 1996 Defense Appropriations
Act did contain a provision prohibiting any transfer of funds to
finance this deployment unless expressly approved by Congress,
but the the provision was not legally binding because it was only
a "sense of Congress."</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Occasionally, the U.S. government decided that it had no choice
but to directly involve U.S. forces in a small war. This occurred
in Lebanon in 1958, the Dominican Republic in 1965, Grenada in
1983, Lebanon in 1983-84, Libya in 1986, the Iran-Iraq War in
1987-89, and Panama in 1989. Since fighting alongside even token
allied forces tended to reduce outcries at home and abroad over
"American imperialism," Washington sought and frequently obtained
the assistance of allies in these wars. But if a situation were
deemed critical enough to warrant the use of U.S. forces in
combat, Washington could and did act unilaterally. As the cases
above illustrate, this tendency increased substantially after the
Reagan administration's buildup of armed forces, and after the
decay of Soviet power became evident.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1304.gif" align="left"><b>Marines landing in
Vietnam</b><p>A number of factors--the end of containment,
heightened American isolationism, the realignment of the balance
of power between the President and Congress, and the increased
American sensitivity to suffering or inflicting
casualties--suggest that there will be a great reluctance to
engage in small wars in the immediate future. That is especially
true in regard to the commitment of U.S. ground forces. One of
the arguments in favor of engagement in a small war is the
avoidance of fighting a major war by not allowing a problem to
grow out of hand. But the U.S. withdrawals from Lebanon in 1984
and from Somalia in 1994--even if aberrations--tend to undermine
this argument. Public outcry over U.S. casualties in wars with
little popular support led to these withdrawals. And the lack of
disastrous consequences following these U.S. retreats prompted
questions about the rationale for the commitment of U.S. troops
in the first place. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These questions were raised anew by the tortured debate over U.S.
policy toward the war among the former Yugoslav republics. The
outcome of the U.S. military's involvement in peacekeeping in
Bosnia is likely to influence U.S. thinking about engagement in
small wars for some time to come.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A second influential consideration is financial cost. Naval and
air interventions in small wars have the advantage of being less
likely to result in heavy casualties than ground intervention.
This is particularly true given the superiority in both size and
capabilities that the U.S. Navy and Air Force enjoy over their
foreign counterparts. However, ships and aircraft seem
increasingly vulnerable to mines, precision-guided munitions, and
missiles. The damage suffered by the USS <I>Stark</I>, and the
casualties among its crew, during American intervention in the
Iran-Iraq war may be a portent. As the size and budgets of U.S.
sea and air forces continue to decline and the cost of naval and
air weapons rises, their use in small wars may become
increasingly problematic. The loss of a single B-2 bomber would
cost the Air Force well over $1 billion, when all costs are
considered. Furthermore, such an aircraft would literally be
irreplaceable. For the Navy to lose a single aircraft carrier
would not only mean the loss of billions of dollars and possibly
scores of high-performance aircraft; it could put at risk the
lives of thousands of embarked personnel. Nearly a decade would
pass before a functioning replacement for such a ship could be
deployed. Along with the public concern about casualties, the
services' concern about losing extremely valuable weapons
platforms and their highly trained crews is likely to influence
the involvement of the United States in future small wars. 
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead9">Conclusions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif"ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The future of limited military intervention is difficult to
predict. On the one hand, there is no longer a fear of Soviet
intervention or gain that may lead the U.S. to intervene in the
event of turmoil in far-off countries with which the U.S. has no
security alliance. On the other hand, such turmoil seems to be
more common (though now mostly for ethnic or religious reasons,
rather as an ideological battle between the Free World and
communism).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a form of diplomatic leverage, the threat (or promise) to use
U.S. ground forces becomes more credible if there is substantial
U.S. public support for the operation in question. That support
depends upon the perception that U.S. interests are at stake.
Another major factor is the number of casualties that may be
sustained; it would appear that the U.S. public is becoming less
willing to see casualties.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since state failure and internal turmoil seem likely to become
more common in the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military is
likely to be tasked more often to perform evacuation and rescue
missions. The ability to conduct such missions will be the
by-product of maintaining a worldwide sea- and airlift capability
necessary to project power.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because sanctions, embargoes, and exclusion zones will be used
more often in the post-Cold War world, the military will be
tasked to enforce these measures. More aggressive interdiction
can make sanctions more successful. Nevertheless, sanctions work
most effectively when they are accompanied by other, forceful
military initiatives.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While limited air strikes (or naval bombardments) are unlikely to
cause the target country to abandon long-held objectives or to
act against vital national interests, they can be effective at
inducing a more limited change in policy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Noncombat support for allies in small wars and especially waging
small wars with U.S. forces are likely to be instruments used
less often. Small wars during the Cold War were more likely to be
ideological confrontations in which the U.S. took one side (at
first, usually, the government side, but then late in the Cold
War, more often the side of insurgents against communist
governments). Post-Cold War, the small wars are more often ethnic
conflicts, in which the U.S., if it intervenes, promotes a
peaceful settlement; the U.S. is not likely to take the side of
one ethnic group against another.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Military intervention will continue to be an instrument of
national policy in the international system. With American
history as a guide, even a thoroughly isolationist United States
would continue to employ its armed forces abroad to defend its
national interests. But under what circumstances armed forces
will be used remains at present very unclear.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout history, the power of a nation has been cast in terms
of the size and competence of its armed forces. Although a
powerful military could not be sustained over the long haul
without a prosperous economic base, it has been unusual to
describe a country's power in terms of its economic output or its
dominance of key industrial or trade sectors. More typical is
Machiavelli's observation, "Good soldiers will always procure
gold." That is no longer the case. A number of instruments of
national power described in preceding chapters depend far more on
economic size and vitality than on brute force of arms. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nevertheless, military forces remain the most visible instrument
of national power, and the effectiveness of many other
instruments depends implicitly on their being backed by strong
military forces. Thus, a great deal of truth remains in <BR>
Frederick the Great's observation, "Diplomacy without military
force is like music without instruments."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the focus of U.S. force planning was on the
global competition with the Soviet Union and its allies. The
United States planned for high-intensity warfare against the
large and relatively modern forces of the USSR. The geographic
focus was on the defense of Central Europe, with a secondary
focus on other regions, such as the Persian Gulf and Korea, where
the United States had strong economic or diplomatic ties. The
Clinton administration is the first since 1945 to shift the
primary focus of its defense policies and budgetary decisions
away from the threat posed by a large peer competitor. In 1993,
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin's Bottom-Up Review changed the
rationale for sizing and equipping U.S. armed forces, charging
them with maintaining the capability to execute two nearly
simultaneous major regional contingencies against competent,
well-equipped regional powers.

Since it takes decades to conceive, develop, procure, and
integrate a major new weapons system into the operational forces,
the bulk of the equipment in the U.S. armed forces--and, indeed,
most of the major procurement programs in progress or under
consideration in the mid-1990s--were conceived during the Cold
War, and are therefore geared toward high-intensity warfare
against a major peer adversary. For the foreseeable future,
consequently, the U.S. military will be adapting forces
configured for high-intensity global warfare to other types of
missions that it may be called upon to undertake. Meanwhile, each
service is struggling to change its focus from warfare against a
peer superpower to preparation for a wide variety of missions.

Land Forces

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The land forces of the U.S. military are composed of the U.S.
Army and the land elements of the U.S. Marine Corps, both of
which have attack helicopters integrated into their forces to
provide mobile fire support. The Marine Corps also operates
fixed-wing aircraft to support its ground forces.<p><b>U.S.
Active Force Structure Trends</b><img src="ch1406.gif"
align="left">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cold War Land Forces. Traditionally,  land forces are the largest
component of the armed forces in terms of manpower. Throughout
the Cold War era, the massive ground forces provided by the
United States and its allies were at the heart of the strategy to
contain the expansion of the Soviet Union in Europe--and, to a
lesser extent, to contain the expansion of communism in Korea and
Southeast Asia. This defensive strategy required large
forward-stationed forces that could be augmented by U.S.-based
forces and were prepared to defend territory defined by specific
treaty commitments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The resultant force structure was configured for high-intensity
warfare against the massive, heavily armored forces of the Soviet
Union and its allies. U.S. military leaders acknowledged the
possibility of a relatively long mobilization time and believed
that massed firepower was the key to a successful defense against
Soviet aggression. As a result, the U.S. Army maintained a large
active-force structure backed by almost as many reserve forces,
which would be available within several months of the decision to
activate them. There was considerable concern that the amount of
dedicated airlift and sealift available to transport this force
to an overseas theater on a timely basis was inadequate. The
solution was to work toward pre-positioning equipment for six
divisions in Europe to augment the almost five division
equivalents already in place.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The biggest land forces procurement programs of the 1970s and
1980s strengthened the capabilities to fight a high-intensity war
against a large, heavily armored adversary. These procurements
were the Abrams main battle tank, Bradley armored fighting
vehicle, and Apache attack helicopter. Other major programs
included a high procurement rate of TOW anti-armor missiles and
armored self-propelled artillery. These programs upgraded key
weapons systems to yield better protection (more capable armor
and a smaller signature), more accurate and lethal firepower
against armored targets, and greater maneuverability on the
battlefield.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shifting Emphases. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the
requirement to fight two nearly simultaneous major regional
contingencies has become the planning standard that determines
the requirements for ground forces. The result has been a shift
to mobility and rapid response capabilities.<p><b>Defense Budget
Authority by Department</b><p>(billion FY 96 $)<img
src="ch1405.gif" align="left">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Army has responded with a number of initiatives. These are
explained in Force XXI, the Army's statement on how to shape the
context for the future. Broadly stated, the Army aims to exploit
information technologies in order to fight more efficiently and
maintain higher performance levels in both good conditions and
bad. Within this context, the Army has a number of initiatives
already well underway to respond to the new strategic
environment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The old assumption that the U.S., as part of NATO, would have <p

align="left"></b>(in billions of FY 1996 Dollars)<p><img
src="ch1407.gif" align="left">to
counter a massive land invasion of Western Europe has
disappeared. In 1995, thinking holds that U.S. armed forces are
most likely to fight a classical ground war remote from the
places where U.S. land forces are routinely deployed (Korea
remains an exception). The Army has begun to respond by
transforming itself from a largely forward-positioned force ready
to fight high-intensity armored warfare in Europe to a
power-projection force based largely in the United States. This
is most evident in the drawdown of the Army forces in Europe.<p
align="left"><hr><blockquote><b>The Army's Force XXI</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Army has produced a report, Force XXI, to serve as a concept
for full divisional operations for the Army of the early
twenty-first century. It focuses on two key issues:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Power Projection. The Army notes that in 1989 it set in motion a
withdrawal of large portions of its forces stationed overseas. It
plans to go from 200,000 troops to 65,000 in Europe, withdraw its
10,000 troops from Panama, and thin out its forces in Korea. As
an alternative, the Army is rounding out plans to be capable of
deploying forces from the United States to respond to regional
conflicts. It is closing in on a goal to project the following
forces rapidly anywhere in the world when called upon:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A light brigade in four days.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A light division in twelve days.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A heavy brigade afloat in fifteen days.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Two heavy divisions from the United States in thirty days.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A five division corps in seventy-five days.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The capability to achieve this goal depends on both sealift and
airlift. The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)
has the responsibility to ensure that its components--the Army's
Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), the Navy's Military
Sealift Command (MSC), and the Air Force's Air Mobility Command
(AMC)--can transport the required forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Advances in Technology. The battlefield is being transformed as
advances in technology are yielding new combat capabilities. The
Army notes five key areas of rapid change that provide insights
into the emerging battlefield:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* The increasing lethality of weaponry is forcing units to
disperse on the battlefield, complicating command and control of
the forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A greater volume and precision of fire from greater ranges in
all weather conditions is increasingly possible.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Integrative technologies such as digital communications and
global positioning will provide the commander the opportunity to
better organize and control his forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Smaller forces will be more capable of concentrating increased
firepower with greater accuracy on their targets.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* There will be a great advantage to the commander who can make
the battlefield more transparent to himself and more opaque to
the enemy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These insights, the change in the strategic environment, and the
influence technology is having on the battlefield are guiding the
Army's planning as it develops doctrine, modernizes its
equipment, and trains its forces.</blockquote><hr>
<blockquote><b> Reserve Components</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Reserve components consist of seven organizational elements:
the Reserves from each of the four services, the Coast Guard
Reserve, and the Army and Air National Guard.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A Reserve component "vision," developed in the mid-1990s, calls
for an integrated total force in which the Reserves are active
participants in the full spectrum of prospective operations, from
humanitarian assistance to regional conflict. In addition, the
Army and Air National Guard have a constitutionally mandated role
as an organized militia for use in missions assigned them by the
states.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the post-Cold War era, the Reserve components have become a
larger fraction of the total force. But like the active forces,
the Reserves are being reduced in size and restructured. This has
not proven to be an easy task, particularly in the case of the
Army National Guard and Army Reserve. Although the Army reached
an agreement governing personnel levels and other matters with
its two Reserve components in late 1993 (the so-called Off-Site
Agreement), key issues remain.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The central unresolved issue pertains to the types of units
operated by the Army National Guard. The Guard's eight combat
divisions, which collectively account for some 110,000 personnel,
have little applicability to the existing national security
strategy. They cannot be adequately trained in time to meet the
time-lines of the two MRC scenario DOD uses for sizing
conventional forces. At the same time, the Army overall is
considerably short of support forces (such as MPs, engineers,
transportation units, etc.) to prosecute two MRCs. Estimates of
the aggregate support deficiency range between 60,000 and 110,000
personnel. Pursuant to a recommendation of the Roles and Missions
Commission, DOD is studying ways of restructuring the National
Guard divisions to meet some or all of the support shortage.
Political considerations and the need to maintain adequate Guard
capabilities to perform the wide range of missions for the states
will also affect the outcome of this effort, perhaps
significantly.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other initiatives being pursued across all services to enhance
the effectiveness of the Reserve components include improving the
equipment and increasing the training of the Army National
Guard's fifteen enhanced readiness brigades (which do have a
potential role in the two MRC scenario); investigating new
methods of increasing Reserve availability for a wide spectrum of
peacetime uses; and improving the overall integration of the
Reserves with their active counterparts (e.g., by increasing the
size of active cadres assigned to work with Reserve
units).</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Overall, the Army's active component was 40 percent smaller in
the mid-1990s than it was a decade earlier, as the result of
budget pressures and the changing strategic environment. The
reserve component was reduced by a smaller amount. Savings from
cuts to reserve units are smaller, and there is considerable
political resistance in Congress and from state governments to
cutting National Guard forces. Consequently, the reserve
component accounts for proportionately more of the combat force
structure than was the case during the Cold War. To take better
advantage of this pool of combat potential, the Army has selected
fifteen brigades from the National Guard whose readiness and
equipment will be enhanced so that they will be ready within
ninety days of mobilization to join active-duty forces in
fighting a major regional contingency.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although the absolute size of the Marine Corps has not declined
as much as that of the Army, the Marines were a relatively small
force to begin with. They never focused primarily on the defense
of the central region of Europe against Soviet aggression. They
have retained their traditional role as an expeditionary force,
and the active structure of three divisions and three Marine
aircraft air wings is being maintained with this point in mind. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Together, the land forces alongside aerospace and naval forces
prepare to respond to two near simultaneous major regional
contingencies in four phases:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Deterring or Halting Aggression. Land forces, in conjunction
with air and maritime forces, close the area of crisis to help
allied forces establish a defensive posture to deter or halt the
invasion of friendly territory. The Marine Corps can mount a
forcible entry operation from offshore, if necessary. Light
ground forces flown in by air would normally be the first to
deploy, although heavy land forces could be part of the early
arriving force if their equipment is pre-positioned in the
theater or on ships nearby.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Force Buildup. Heavy ground forces arrive by air (personnel)
and sea (heavy equipment) as reinforcements, typically over a
period of one or two months. During that time, preparations can
begin for a counteroffensive, since by this point the aggressor
has most likely lost the initiative on the ground.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Counteroffensive. In a large-scale air and land counterattack,
heavy land-force units go on the offensive to outmaneuver,
envelop, and destroy enemy forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Ensuring Postwar Stability. Some land forces will often remain
to secure borders or occupy territory and deter another attack by
the aggressor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="ch1403.gif" align="left"><b>M-1A1

Warrior in Kuwait</b><p>
The degree of confidence the U.S. can have in winning two nearly
simultaneous major regional conflicts, should they occur, depends
heavily on the conditions under which the U.S. would fight. The
size of enemy forces and proximity to U.S. centers of power,
amount of warning time, degree of participation by U.S. allies,
and length of time separating the outbreak of the two conflicts
would have a marked effect on the U.S.'s ability to quickly bring
the conflict to a close under favorable conditions. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. land forces in the mid-1990s are capable of executing the
missions outlined above against any plausible adversary. Though
smaller than at the close of Desert Storm, they are still larger
than those of most other nations, and are far better trained and
equipped than potential adversaries. If anything, the United
States has <BR>
increased its lead in conventional-force capabilities over
potential foes such as North Korea or Iraq. While Saddam Hussein
managed to keep many of his best forces intact, the effects of
Iraq's defeat in 1991 and the subsequent economic embargo have
prevented him from modernizing and upgrading his forces. North
Korea is facing severe economic problems, and a fall-off of aid
from Moscow and Beijing has limited its ability to modernize,
maintain, and train on their equipment. In short, if faced again
with a major regional contingency, U.S. land forces can be
expected to outperform the enemy decisively. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A critical element in the U.S. ability to use land forces
overseas is airlift, and, to a somewhat lesser degree,
specialized sealift. Heavy ground forces bring considerable
offensive firepower to the field, but at a price. For the bulk
and mass of their equipment and their requirements for munitions,
fuel, and other logistical support, considerable inter-theater
lift is required to deploy them and to keep them operational. To
ease this problem, the Army has taken steps to pre-position
equipment closer to possible trouble spots. Equipment for two
heavy brigades is being pre-positioned ashore in the Persian Gulf
region, and a third heavy brigade set is positioned afloat on
ships in the Indian Ocean. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Still, this is only the rough equivalent of one Army division;
the Department of Defense estimates that four or five divisions
would be needed to fight a major regional conflict. Deployment
and support of follow-on divisions is dependent on sealift, which
it takes a minimum of several weeks under the most favorable
circumstances for a full division to be transported to the
theater. It took about two months before the first heavy
divisions were in place in the Persian Gulf in 1990. While the
United States in 1996 could bring an equivalent amount of
firepower to the battlefield with a smaller deployment, the
disadvantage of fighting an aggressor in its own backyard with
U.S. forces deployed over a long distance in unfamiliar
surroundings will continue to present a formidable challenge to
land forces.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. fixed-wing combat-aviation forces consist of three major
components: the Air Force, Navy aircraft, and Marine Corps
aircraft. The latter two typically operate from aircraft carriers
and land bases, respectively, although both can operate either at
sea or ashore if the operational situation requires it.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img src="ch1402.gif" align="left"><b>U.S. Air
Force F-16 Fighter</b><p>
Cold War Aviation Forces. During the Cold War, U.S.
aviation-force planning was largely focused on the Soviet Union,
which possessed a large, capable tactical- and nuclear-strike air
force. The Air Force and Navy responded by developing a series of
air-superiority fighters that incorporated the latest
technologies to maintain qualitative superiority over Soviet
aircraft.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Air Force tailored its force to fight in the center region of
Europe against numerically superior Warsaw Pact forces. Its
missions were:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Establishing air superiority by shooting down enemy air-to-air
combat aircraft, as well as intercepting and downing enemy
bombers and strike aircraft.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Suppressing enemy air defenses by destroying or neutralizing
land-based surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft batteries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Attacking key installations that supported the Warsaw Pact's
war effort, such as enemy airfields, bridges, ammunition depots,
and rail marshalling yards.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Attacking opposing ground forces, as well as providing close
air support and battlefield interdiction (attack on targets not
immediately engaged on the front lines).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The air-superiority mission was regarded as key. The Soviets and
their allies had a large force of fighter aircraft, both
interceptor and attack. Without allied air superiority, it would
be very difficult to defend or counterattack on the ground, and
damage suffered from Soviet air strikes on NATO's rear area could
be crippling. This situation led to a force structure that
balanced specialized air-superiority and ground-attack aircraft
with large numbers of aircraft that could be adapted to either
mission.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the 1970s and 1980s, considerable investment went into
ensuring U.S. air superiority: Large numbers of F-15 aircraft
were procured, as were the F-16 multi-mission aircraft. The
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) was developed and
deployed, and additional funding went into development of
air-to-air missiles that incorporated the latest advances in
technology.<hr><blockquote><b>U.S. Air Force's Global
Presence</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. Air Force has developed a white paper, Global Presence,
to outline its strategy for the coming years. It is summarized
here with key quotes from the document.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, the focus of U.S. Air Force planning was the
threat presented by the Soviet Union which had large, relatively
modern, and technologically advanced forces. The bulk of these
forces were concentrated opposite the center region of Europe.
Forward defense, deterring or engaging enemy forces close to
their border, was a central component of the strategy to counter
and contain the Soviet threat.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the words of Global Presence, two factors have conspired to
change that strategy:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* As the 1980s ended, America moved from the Cold War's bipolar
arrangement toward what was perceived to be a new,
less-threatening political environment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* In the face of increasing demands on U.S. military forces,
smaller forces, and shrinking defense budgets, we can no longer
afford to physically deploy forces in every region of concern.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Air Force active-force structure has dropped from twenty-five
wings in FY 1986 to thirteen in 1995. In the same period, the
number of wings forward deployed has decreased from nine to five.
At the same time, U.S. military forces are involved in more
operations of greater duration than at any time in the past
twenty years.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In light of these factors, the Air Force has expanded the concept
of presence beyond the physical stationing of aircraft in a
region. Global Presence emphasizes that several advances in key
areas of technology enhance the Air Force's ability to make its
presence felt even from a distance:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Situational Awareness: advances in information-based
technologies allow military forces to monitor and assess most
global conditions rapidly and efficiently.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Strategic Agility: improvements in transport technologies
enable rapid responses with a variety of military forces to
distant locations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Lethality: enhancements in weapons system technologies make it
possible to achieve desired effects more quickly and at less
cost.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Together, these advances make it possible, unlike during the Cold
War, to station forces in the United States while maintaining the
capability to project military power worldwide on a real-time
basis. A theater commander can call on available airpower based
in the United States or in another theater, confident that it
will arrive on a timely basis. At the same time, a would-be
aggressor would be made aware that although U.S. forces may not
be stationed in the theater, they are not far away, and any
violation of U.S. interests could be met promptly with U.S.
military power.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Naval forces faced similar concerns about establishing air
superiority in proximity to battle groups and in the skies over
an amphibious landing area. The biggest aviation investment
program in the 1970s and 1980s was the F-14 air-superiority
aircraft, armed with the long-range Phoenix air-to-air missile.
The second-largest aviation investment program was the F/A-18, a
multi-mission aircraft capable of supplementing the F-14 and A-6
bomber in the air-superiority and ground-attack roles,
respectively. This, together with ship-to-air missile defenses,
meant the Navy could maintain a relatively high degree of
survivability on the open ocean. However, as naval formations
approached shore and came within range of Soviet land-based
aircraft and cruise missiles, they would have had their hands
full coping with large waves of attack aircraft and--by the
1980s--large numbers of anti-ship cruise missiles. The ability to
operate in such a high-threat environment came at a price to
other combat capabilities. The need for a heavy emphasis on
self-protection left room on the carrier deck and in the surface
ships' missile magazines for only a modest number of
ground-attack aircraft and land attack cruise missiles.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Shifting Aviation Emphases.</i> No opposing air force
currently
possesses a capability in terms of absolute numbers or
technological sophistication in any way comparable to U.S. air
power. The need for large numbers of combat aircraft dedicated
primarily to
shooting down enemy aircraft is therefore less critical than it
was during the Cold War. As a result, U.S. aviation forces are
able to focus more of their effort on bringing firepower to bear
on the ground quickly and accurately enough to have a significant
operational effect on the advance of enemy forces. The trend in
future aircraft acquisition programs is to take advantage of
advances in smart, precision munitions and multi-mission aviation
platforms to focus more heavily on the ground-attack mission
while maintaining capability for air superiority.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Air Force is working to develop capabilities that will have a
greater impact on the ground battle in a major regional
contingency by developing, with the Navy in most cases, more
lethal air-to-ground munitions. In addition, aircraft that during
the Cold War had different primary missions are being configured
to carry these munitions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Long-range strategic bombers--including the B-1B, B-2, and
B-52H--that can fly directly from the United States are being
upgraded to carry advanced precision-guided munitions. This
capability will enable operational commanders to call in
air-delivered firepower without having to first deploy
sea-or-land-based aircraft into the theater. Moreover, it
provides a capability to strike targets deep in enemy territory.
While these long-range bombers are not intended to match the
sustained firepower of tactical aircraft operating in the
theater, the flexibility to launch a strike at any place and any
time is a meaningful military capability.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Suppression of enemy air defenses can be a slow process. The Air
Force is modifying some F-16s to perform the role of neutralizing
enemy surface-to-air missile defenses and thus clear the way for
ground-attack sorties. To complement this program, the Air Force
(together with the Navy, in most cases) is developing a new class
of air-to-ground weapons with increased stand-off range and
better accuracy. These improvements will allow tactical aircraft
to attack heavily defended targets at the outset of hostilities
while the campaign to suppress enemy air defenses is ongoing. The
new munitions will also extend the combat radius of air-based
weapons far beyond the flight radius of the delivery platform.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The largest recapitalization program pursued by the Air Force is
the F-22 fighter, which will replace the F-15 air-superiority
fighter. The F-22's stealth capability, supersonic cruise speed,
high maneuverability, and advanced avionics are intended to
ensure the continued superiority of U.S. air power against future
advances in the air-to-air capabilities of potential adversaries.
The F-22 will have a limited precision air-to-ground capability,
carrying two joint direct air munitions (JDAMs) internally
or--with some loss of stealth--extra JDAMs externally.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If a host nation is reluctant to let U.S. forces in, or if air
bases have to be secured first, the delay in deploying land-based
aircraft to a theater could be considerable. Carrier-based naval
aviation provides, in addition to long-range strategic bombers, a
way to launch air strikes without the need for on-shore
facilities or support. Another method under consideration is the
construction of a mobile offshore base--a modular assembly of
floating platforms that can be positioned to provide a staging
platform for aircraft as well as land forces. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Navy is strengthening its capability to bring effective
firepower to bear on land targets. With a greatly diminished
threat to its operations on the open ocean, the Navy has turned
its full attention to ways to affect battle in the littoral
regions. For example, it is reconfiguring the carrier air wing to
give it more offensive land-attack power. Other programs include
the introduction of Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles
throughout the surface combatant and submarine forces, and an
upgrade of the F/A-18 aircraft to give it the ground-attack
capabilities (including night operations) with precision-guided
munitions that it lacked in Desert Storm. An advanced version of
the F/A-18 that is to be procured beginning in 1997 will have an
extended combat range and carry a larger munitions load, thereby
providing a greater power-projection capacity. A portion of the
fleet of F-14 air-superiority aircraft is being modified to carry
precision-guided munitions for attacking ground targets.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Due primarily to budget constraints and the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the missions of U.S. aviation forces have to be
done with a smaller force structure. In 1995, the Air Force was
about half the size it was in the mid-1980s. Naval air forces
have been reduced less and the Marine Corps air forces hardly at
all.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. aviation forces should be able to achieve air supremacy over
any conceivable adversary for the coming decade and, with the
planned modernization programs, to maintain its advantage well
into the next century.  Once enemy air defenses are suppressed,
tactical aircraft and bombers can contribute to the ground battle
by direct attack on enemy ground forces. A key priority at DOD is
the development and procurement of more effective
precision-guided munitions that can kill several armored targets
with one launch. This capability will allow U.S. combat aircraft
to attack enemy ground forces with improved effectiveness at the
outset and enable a response to threatened aggression even before
the United States can get ground forces in place.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Still, in the mid-1990s, the amount and type of payload that
aircraft can bring to the battlefield, and therefore the number
of targets they can strike, is limited. Deployments of aviation
forces must be accompanied by land forces if an enemy force is to
be driven out of territory it occupies. Aviation forces do not
replace land forces, although the impact they can have on the
ground campaign is growing.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Space Forces.</i> U.S. space forces exist to perform three
major
missions: enhancing the capabilities of U.S. or coalition
terrestrial forces by supporting their operations from space,
ensuring U.S. ability to use space while denying it to enemies,
and, finally, providing a supporting infrastructure for U.S.
space activities. Space forces supplement and support the
terrestrial force structure--allowing more effective and
efficient application of such force as their overall numbers
decrease. In the future, space forces could evolve into an
independent means of applying force, while maintaining the
ability to support terrestrial forces--similar to airpower's
evolution.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given rapidly advancing technology, space forces will increase
their ability to operate effectively and efficiently. As air,
land, and sea force structures decrease, spacepower becomes even
more important as a force multiplier. For example, as terrestrial
assets become more limited, and more operations are conducted in
remote regions around the world, space assets provide vital
capabilities such as communication, intelligence gathering,
monitoring, surveillance, and targeting. Spacepower offers a
readily available global presence infrastructure--a consistent
and unobtrusive forward presence.<hr><blockquote><b>Joint
Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much military planning is still done by the individual services
with the challenges of forging them into an efficient, joint
fighting force still left to be solved when the forces are
fielded. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) of the
Joint Staff working with the Office of the Secretary of Defense

* Deterrance and Counterproliferation of Weapons of Mass
Destruction
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Regional Engagement and Presence
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Command and Control and Information Warfare
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Strike
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Land and Littoral Warfare
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Joint Readiness
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Sea, Air, and Space Superiority
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Strategic Mobility and its Protection
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The results of this process were reviewed by the JROC, the
Chairman and the Vice Chairman of JCS, then reported in the
Chairman's Program Assessment. During the planning process to
formulate the FY97 program and budget, this document served as a
guide to the Secretary of Defense and his staff on requirements
as seen by the senior military leaders from a joint perspective.
The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff views the JWCA
process as a key mechanism to ensure that "the capabilities of
the various key services are integrated to provide more joint,
synergistic solutions to military problems." The JWCA process
provides a means for the Chairman of the JCS to fulfill the
important resource allocation responsibilities given him under
the Goldwater-Nichols Act (recently reinforced by the Commission
on Roles and Mission).</blockquote><hr>

<b>Major Maritime Forces</b><p><img src="ch1408.gif"
align="left">The focus of space forces has changed with the
demise of the USSR, the rise of regional concerns, and the
importance of space-based support to information-based warfare.
The lack of communications and other
infrastructure in regions where U.S. military forces are expected
to deploy (as opposed to the NATO region) has increased demand
for the readily available infrastructure of space-based
communications, navigation, surveillance, and reconnaissance.
Missile warning systems are being redesigned to improve detection
of tactical ballistic missile launches, and such information is
now being provided directly to the tactical user. Full
integration of navigation aids such as the Global Positioning
System (GPS) also increases tactical use of support from space.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Military space systems offer useful capabilities to the
civil sector--navigation, weather monitoring, and communications.
Civil space capabilities, on the other hand, offer military space
consumers additional communications surge capabilities, weather
monitoring, and multi-spectral remote sensing. The military also
uses data from civilian radars for space surveillance. In
addition, military, civil, and commercial collaboration may soon
result in more effective and efficient spacelift capabilities. In
the future, the military could benefit also from civil
developments of reusable single-stage-to-orbit delivery vehicles.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. will enjoy a large advantage in the use of space forces
in the foreseeable future. However, other nations have noted the
U.S.'s, and its coalition partners', dependency on such forces.
They are also realizing the benefits of receiving integral
support from space. Maintaining the U.S.'s inherent "high ground"
advantage will be important to ensure its, and its allies',
future military superiority and ability to achieve national
objectives.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead4">Maritime Forces</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States's maritime forces are provided by the Navy in
conjunction with the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard. Maritime
forces ensure open access to the world's oceans and project
firepower ashore. The ability to operate on the high seas in
international waters gives maritime forces the advantage of being
free of diplomatic constraints, such as national sovereignty and
overflight rights. Their mobility and self-sufficiency mean they
can be introduced to or withdrawn from an area with no reliance
on host-nation support.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Cold War Maritime Forces.</i> During the Cold War, the Navy
focused
on control of the high seas to safeguard the U.S.'s ability to
reinforce NATO and Pacific allies by sea. The threat on the high
seas was defined in terms of the numbers and capabilities of
Soviet attack submarines and, in close proximity to the Soviet
Union, surface combatants and attack aircraft, including
medium-range bombers armed with anti-ship cruise missiles.
Against these forces, the United States required considerable
defensive capability to protect shipping lanes and its own
combatant fleet.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Marines and Coast Guard also contributed to maritime
operations against the Soviet Union, although they maintained a
strong planning focus on operations short of high-intensity war.
The need to keep the sea lanes open in the face of the Soviet
threat led to substantial investments in systems that could
detect and destroy submarines in the open ocean and engage
attacking aircraft at a considerable distance from the battle
group. The force structure included a network of fixed acoustic
arrays anchored on the ocean floor to listen for submarines;
attack submarines; a large fleet of maritime patrol aircraft that
could scan large areas of the ocean for submarines; surface ships
with both active and passive ASW sensors as well as point defense
against attacking aircraft and cruise missiles; and advanced
aircraft that could engage enemy aircraft well away from the
battle group, before weapons could be
launched.<hr><blockquote><b>Department of the Navy's
<i>Forward...From the Sea--Presence, Prevention, and Partnership
for the Future</i></b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The vision that guides the U.S. Naval Service--the Navy and
Marine Corps--into the twenty-first century is Forward...From the
Sea. It accounts for both the reorientation of the Department of
Defense to a regional focus and the absence of a large peer
competitor on the near horizon. Forward operations in peacetime
and crisis periods are linked with those envisioned for the
earliest phases of regional conflict. Recognition is given to the
fact that naval forces are primarily designed to fight and win
wars, while their day-to-day role is to be engaged forward for
the purpose of preventing conflict.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The strategic imperative. Geography mandates the need for naval
forces adequate to defend the lines of strategic approach that
link the United States to other nations through the free flow of
people, natural resources, manufactured goods, and services.
Operating close to or in areas of special interest, naval forces
can respond to rapidly evolving situations that portend a crisis.
If a diplomatic or military crisis occurs, such forces can
provide initial and timely means to defuse the situation or
control escalation. If fighting breaks out, they provide the
means for forcible entry and protective cover essential to the
flow of follow-on land-based forces that will be deployed,
supported, and sustained from the continental United States.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peacetime operations and crisis response. Naval forces operate
overseas in peacetime to prevent regional conflict. They are
visible and tangible proof of U.S. political commitments and
military strength. Their presence alone can serve to deter
aggressors and maintain stability. They also remind potential
belligerents that the entire military force of the United States
may be brought to bear. The inherent mobility, flexibility, and
self-sufficiency of sovereign naval forces allow unencumbered
movement and access between theaters in response to emergent
tasking across the entire spectrum of military operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conflict operations. If deterrence fails and conflict ensues,
naval forces are prepared to blunt initial attacks and prepare
for the transition to high-intensity operations ashore. Inherent
in this "enabling" mission are:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Focused intelligence collection and surveillance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Precision strikes against key targets.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Insertion and support of special operations forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Seizure of ports, airfields, and beachheads ashore.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Actions to interdict lines of communication.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Measures to disrupt command and control.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The wide spectrum of operational capabilities of naval
expeditionary forces--particularly the power-projection and
forcible-entry capabilities embodied in carrier battle groups and
amphibious-ready groups--allows seizing and holding of lodgments
ashore, and thereby permits the delivery, protection, and support
of ground forces and land-based air forces needed to prosecute
the subsequent campaign. These versatile naval forces also
provide a wide range of additional tactical and strategic options
to the joint theater commander during every phase of regional
conflict. And through securing the sea lines of communication,
naval forces ensure the sustainment necessary for all of the
forces involved to complete their mission.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Continued U.S. dominance of the seas and successful naval
expeditionary efforts will depend upon application of modern
technology and tactical innovation.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An aircraft carrier or amphibious ready group ideally would be
escorted by six to eight surface combatants and one or two attack
submarines. Surface combatants and attack submarines were also
available to protect convoys carrying reinforcements from the
United States to Europe or other overseas combat theaters. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By the late 1970s, the Navy concluded that dealing with the
Soviet threat required a strong offensive strategy. Newer classes
of Soviet submarines had extended the reach and lethality of the
USSR's undersea fleet, and the expansion of the Soviet long-range
Backfire bomber force (equipped with anti-ship cruise missiles)
expanded greatly the area of the ocean in which U.S. and allied
shipping was at risk.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since maritime forces could not be everywhere at once, the Navy
developed the Maritime Strategy to carry the battle to the source
of the Soviets' combat power. This strategy called for an
expanded offensive role for the Navy and Marine Corps. Primary
tasks included keeping the sea lanes open for U.S. and allied
shipping in wartime. But rather than wait for the Soviets to
attack, the battle would be brought to them. The strategy called
for a series of operations, including:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Holding Soviet ballistic missile submarines at risk.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Destroying the Soviet attack-submarine force with a massive,
sustained anti-submarine warfare campaign.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Sinking Soviet surface ships both at sea and in port.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Using carrier battle groups and amphibious landing forces to
seize or destroy bastions of Soviet naval power, such as
Murmansk.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Threatening the Soviet homeland by striking targets with
carrier-based aircraft and long-range cruise missiles or
conducting amphibious landings where the Soviet forces were
vulnerable in order to divert them away from the battle in the
central region of Europe, where the Soviets and their allies were
strongest.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This highly aggressive strategy led to an emphasis on offensive
systems that could strike first and seize the initiative against
Soviet forces. The strategy included attack of heavily defended
targets, so considerable attention to self-defense was required
to ensure survivability of the battle group as it closed to
within attack range.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Shifting Emphases.</i> In the mid-1990s, no nation can mount a
sizable naval threat to U.S. forces far from its own shores,
thereby easing the task of self-protection and defending merchant
shipping on the high seas. This has allowed U.S. maritime forces
to work on bringing a greater amount and more precise firepower
to bear on the battle ashore.<hr><blockquote><b>Joint
Operations*</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Future military operations will call on the capabilities of all
the Services along with support from the defense agencies, other
government agencies, and non-government organizations. Pulling
these capabilities together for complex, dangerous joint military
operations is the responsibility of the [Chairman of Joint Chiefs
of Staff] and the Commanders in Chief (CINCS). They can fulfill
this responsibility only if the Services and other supporting
organizations provide the capabilities needed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Operation Desert Storm demonstrated that the military
capabilities developed separately by each of the Services are
individually superb. But they do not work well enough together.
Each Service develops capabilities and trains its forces
according to its own vision of how its forces should contribute
to joint warfighting. Not surprisingly, the Services' ideas about
how to integrate all forces reflect their own perspectives,
typically giving the other Services a role supporting the "main
effort."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Each Service [has its own warfighting philosophy and force
structure priorities] that guide internal decisions on systems
acquisitions, doctrine, training, organization, management of
forces, and the conduct of operations. Forward...From the Sea;
Force XXI; and Global Reach, Global Power [are thoughtful
statements of how each Service views its role in national
defense]. These Service documents help form a joint vision, but
collectively they [do not represent one]. Competing elements
exist in these documents that must be reconciled [for a viable
joint vision to be realized].
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Basically, competition among the Services is a strength. The
variety of Service perspectives adds breadth, flexibility, and
synergy to military operations. Nevertheless integrating their
warfighting concepts must receive more emphasis. Otherwise, the
Services [will] only work to develop the capabilities they need
to fulfill their own particular views.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We find a pressing need for a central vision to harmonize the
Services' own views. This vision should drive joint requirements
and serve as a basis for elevating the importance of joint
operations as an essential "core competency" of all joint
commanders and agencies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to the general aim of providing an overarching guide
for developing joint warfighting requirements, a unified vision
will give the Services guidance regarding the capabilities they
should supply to unified military operations. With a common base
of understanding, the CINCs and Services can have congruent
expectations of the capabilities of forces assigned to CINCs by
the Military Departments. The unified vision will provide a
framework for the development of the common operational and
organizational concepts needed for "baseline" joint force
headquarters, and a common base for assessments of current and
future joint capabilities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Excerpts from Directions for Defense, Report of the Commission
on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, May 24, 1995, Chapter
2. Text in [  ] has been added by authors.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Navy and Marine Corps have adopted a strategic vision called
<i>Forward...From the Sea</i> in which the focus is on the
littoral, or
coastal areas, of the globe; in joint operations ashore, the
contribution of naval forces will come "from the sea." The Navy
and Marine Corps are prepared to provide the initial enabling
capability for a joint operation and to continue participation in
a sustained effort if necessary. A key element of the vision is
the Navy's plan to improve its sealift capability to deliver
heavy equipment and resupply major ground and air combat units in
the theater of battle.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Operations on the littoral present different challenges than
operations in the open ocean, and U.S. maritime forces are in the
process of adapting. As maritime forces approach the shore, they
come into range of attack from land. An increasing number of
states can deploy land-based cruise missiles, whose short flight
time poses a tough problem for defensive systems. Mines seeded in
the shallow waters of the littoral present a threat to maritime
forces operating in geographically restricted waters or
approaching the shore to execute an amphibious landing. Mine
sweeping is both difficult and time consuming. Lastly,
diesel-electric submarines are increasingly making their way into
the navies of potential adversaries. These craft are difficult to
detect and prosecute, particularly in shallow water, and
therefore would complicate maritime operations near shore and in
proximity to geographic choke points like the Straits of Hormuz.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It will take a long time to fully adjust the force structure of
maritime forces to the demands of the post-Cold War world.
Aircraft carriers have a useful life of up to fifty years; major
surface combatants and submarines, some thirty-plus years. The
Navy faces the challenge of transforming a force optimized to
defeat a peer superpower on the open ocean into one that can
support regional littoral operations typical of the post-Cold War
environment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
U.S. maritime forces are much smaller in the mid-1990s than in
1986. The biggest reduction has come in the number of attack
submarines and convoy-escort surface combatants. This reduction
reflects the diminished threat to battle groups and merchant
shipping in the open ocean.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1401.gif" align="left"><b>Guided missile
destroyer.</b><p>
The number of carriers and large-deck amphibious ships that can
bring aircraft and forces to a conflict theater has decreased
only marginally. Mine-warfare capabilities are increasing. New
U.S. surface combatants carry a larger complement of Tomahawk
cruise missiles, which can strike targets deeper in enemy
territory, than the ships taken out of commission. Overall, the
number of Tomahawk land-attack missiles carried by the fleet will
actually increase. The principal operational challenge posed by
the smaller fleet to military commanders is not so much
warfighting, but that a peacetime overseas presence must be
maintained at previous or greater levels with fewer ships.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1995, almost one-third of all U.S. maritime forces were
continuously deployed overseas, even though the U.S. was at
peace. A carrier battle group with supporting ships and a Marine
expeditionary unit, the core of the Seventh Fleet, are
permanently stationed in Japan. The newly established Fifth Fleet
is in the Persian Gulf region. The Sixth Fleet, with its home
port in Italy, provides a full time presence in the Mediterranean
Sea. Increasingly, maritime forces are used to provide a
continuous peacetime U.S. military presence in important regions
of the world. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Maritime forces have a key role in the U.S. strategy to fight two
nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts. Forward-deployed
maritime forces would be among the first to arrive in the
vicinity of a crisis. Once there, they would establish maritime
superiority, initiate mine countermeasures and would be available
to immediately strike targets on land with tactical aircraft and
cruise missiles. Ships equipped with the Aegis weapons system
would provide local air and, in the future, theater
ballistic-missile defense. Amphibious assault forces could
conduct amphibious operations to establish a secure lodgment
ashore in preparation for arriving land forces, or they could
threaten amphibious assault to divert enemy attention and tie
down enemy forces.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Conclusions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Classical military forces represent a powerful instrument of U.S.
national power. With the end of the Soviet Union came the end of
the only peer military competitor to the United States. For the
immediate future, U.S. forces are far more capable, better
equipped, and better trained than any conceivable adversary. In a
classical high-intensity military conflict (such as Desert
Storm), the nation can have high confidence in the superiority of
U.S. forces. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, in the event of two nearly simultaneous major regional
contingencies, U.S. lift capacity would be stretched to the limit
to bring heavy Army and Air Force units into the theater and
support them. Depending upon the demands of the specific
contingencies, other types of capabilities might be seriously
stressed. Forces committed to other operations could also retard
deployment of needed forces to regional contingencies. With the
overseas presence of U.S. ground and air forces reduced by
roughly 50 percent since 1986, there is less margin for error in
deciding where to deploy the remaining forces, and greater
operational demands on those forces still remaining overseas.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>Major Recapitalization Programs</b><p>(procurement funding in
billions of dollars)<p><img src="ch1404.gif" align="left">Given
that major equipment typically lasts decades (and
major procurement programs, from conception to deployment, take a
decade or more), the major equipment items in the U.S. armed
forces will continue for some time to be items conceived and
designed for use against the Soviet Union. With only modest
amounts of newly designed military equipment being procured,
there will be a relatively small turnover of major equipment
items in the forces (and U.S. forces will be operating with an
increasingly aging capital stock). Further, the major items in
the fiscal year 1996-2000 procurement program were originally
intended for high-intensity conflict against the Soviet Union and
Warsaw Pact. For example, the primary mission for which the F-22
was designed is air superiority; likewise, the DDG-51 was
designed to defend the fleet against massive manned air attacks
and cruise missiles, as well as nuclear attack submarines.
Fortunately, a weapons system that is useful against one type of
threat usually has utility against others. But U.S. military
services are inevitably finding themselves in the position of
adapting equipment designed to deal with the Soviet Union for use
in new types of warfare that were just emerging when the
specifications and characteristics of the systems were laid down.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The relatively strong position of U.S. forces in the mid-1990s is
not reason for complacency. While U.S. classical military forces
should continue to be the world's best well into the foreseeable
future, U.S. armed forces may find that they are confronted with
innovative warfare techniques and employment strategies for which
they are not well prepared or equipped. For example, a nation
could well choose to avoid challenging the United States in
classical conventional battle by using or threatening to use
weapons of mass destruction, sabotaging key automated information
networks, or resorting to terrorism and guerrilla warfare
tactics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With smaller forces, the U.S. margin for error in procurement
decisions, inefficiency, and duplication has narrowed.
Increasingly, therefore, U.S. forces are striving to operate
together in a complementary (rather than redundant) and mutually
reinforcing fashion. In addition, greater attention is being
devoted to planning that examines the capabilities U.S. forces
will need to bring to the battlefield across service lines. These
efforts are focused on the implementation of key recommendations
by the Commission on Roles and Missions with respect to
developing improved joint (all-service) visions to harmonize
existing service doctrines; strengthening the Joint Warfare
Capabilities Assessment (JWCA) process; and increasing the level
of joint training.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Looking ahead to the twenty-first century, the U.S. military is
scrutinizing the revolution in military affairs, which is
discussed in the chapter on emerging military instruments. The
willingness of the U.S. military leadership to pursue new
opportunities offered by the rapid advances in technology and to
embrace new organizational, and operation techniques will go a
long way to determining success on the battlefield of the future.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With its victory in the Gulf War, the United States demonstrated
an unprecedented mastery of conventional warfare--especially in
the area of information technologies. Yet, the resources
available to maintain such excellence are increasingly limited. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Department of Defense is thus at a crossroads. On the one
hand, it can incorporate the information revolution into its
existing structures and doctrine, replicating present platforms
in ever more sophisticated forms and creating a force designed to
master today's challenges, notably the deterrence and suppression
of major regional conflicts. On the other hand, the Defense
Department may recognize that opponents in the mid-1990s pale in
comparison with their potential successors and that sometime
beyond the next decade, more sophisticated competitors will
present far greater challenges. A strategy to prepare for the
latter eventuality would emphasize technology, education, and
doctrine rather than replicating today's platforms, albeit in
more capable versions. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An important factor in deciding which approach to pursue is the
extent to which current and future technologies can enable new
instruments of national power--instruments whose utility would
greatly transcend the goal of winning simultaneous major regional
conflicts. This chapter explores three such new instruments. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first, dubbed the "system of systems" by Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs Admiral William Owens, creates operational synergies
by combining three systems normally considered separately--those
that provide battlespace awareness, those that enhance command
and control, and those that create precision force. Successful
integration of such capabilities may permit entirely new
instruments of military force that are far more precise and can
be wielded from far greater distances than could anything in the
arsenal of the mid-1990s. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second instrument, extended information dominance, takes U.S.
capabilities to acquire information dominance on the battlefield,
and gives the results not only to U.S. forces but to allies.
Providing bitstreams helps the United States influence the
outcome of distant conflicts while avoiding many of the risks and
costs of conducting warfare overseas. Such an instrument is
particularly valuable when the United States's freedom of action
is curtailed or when leaving fingerprints is undesirable. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The third instrument, hacker warfare, would permit the United
States to corrupt or override information systems of potential
foes and even put the latter's information infrastructures at
risk without the direct application of force.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead2">Instruments</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
The System of Systems
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Major improvements in U.S. military capabilities should arise
from simultaneous developments in battlespace awareness; advanced
command, control, communications, computing, and intelligence
(C4I); and precision force. Some of the developments in these
areas are the harvest of investments made in the 1980s; others
were spurred by the Gulf War. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Individually, these new systems portend sharply increased
effectiveness. Collectively, they promise to widen the lead of
the U.S. military over its competitors, even in the face of
declining defense budgets. Their integration would permit U.S.
armed forces to see and respond to every militarily relevant
object within a notional theater of operations--a cube of 200
nautical miles on a side. By contrast, systems of the mid-1990s
can see fixed objects and groups of moving objects within a
notional battlefield but not individual moving targets, and
rarely in real time or with requisite precision for a direct
unaided hit. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the sytem of systems, the U.S. military will be able to
engage in parallel warfare, that is, simultaneous strikes carried
out with high precision against targets in widely separated
locations.<hr><blockquote><b>Where Should the Systems of Systems
Put Its Smarts?</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tomorrow's system of systems can distribute its smarts in one of
two ways. One method is to use intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) and C4I systems to find and locate targets
with such precision that <I>externally guided</I> PGMs need
little further smarts to land on a particular point (they need
only know where they are and where the target is in real time).
The alternative is to use ISR and C4I systems to locate targets
roughly and put enough intelligence in each <I>internally
guided</I> PGM to hit the target on its own (examples include
sensor-fused weapons and brilliant antitank munitions).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Internally guided PGMs have the advantage of working despite
disrupted communications or degraded targeting systems. Yet,
internal guidance requires more complex sensors; higher costs
lead to smaller inventories (and higher costs in turn). Each
sensor package must also be specifically tailored to a given
target. Externally guided PGMs (such as glide bombs with GPS
kits) are more sensitive to system disruptions but can use
cheaper guidance and control units; they may be used in larger
numbers, getting through on the basis of swarming.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the trend in the U.S. military is toward internally guided
PGMs, budgetary logic will discourage the development of very
sophisticated ISR and C4I systems; conversely, dependence on
externally guided PGMs requires the acceleration of sophisticated
ISR and C4I systems. In the former case, the bitstreams that
Washington can offer allies will have scant usefulness unless the
United States supplies expensive internally guided PGMs to go
with them. Yet, as the U.S. experience with Stingers for Afghan
rebels suggests, such PGMs may end up in the wrong hands.
Conversely, supplying externally guided PGMs and bitstreams may
permit the United States to control the usefulness and thus
effective proliferation of the latter under adverse
conditions.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>See It.</I> The first element of the system of systems,
advanced battlespace awareness, couples digital sensor
technologies with enough computer power to extract useful
information from digital signals in near-real time. In the
mid-1990s, battlespace awareness depends, in large part, on
space-based systems for collection and distribution. Over the
next decade, these systems will be supplemented by sensors on
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and by cellular grids for robust
multipoint to multipoint wide-area communications.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Advanced technologies will shift the role of battlespace
intelligence. Traditionally, intelligence informed command
decisions by providing information on such matters as whether a
tank unit lay over the hill and what its strength might be. By
contrast, tomorrow's intelligence will inform operational
decisions by sending back the latitude and longitude of each
individual tank in real time to precision-guided munitions
(PGMs). In the same shift, platforms will move from the primary
foci of engagement to units that service targets determined and
located externally.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the system of systems evolves, it may be increasingly
understood as an autonomous entity that ladles information to a
variety of users. But a robust entity capable of generating such
streams of data bits to whomever needs them would take further
work. Information from space satellites already comes in
bitstreams. Similar capabilities from other long-range sensors
(such as AWACS, and JSTARS, aircraft and Aegis cruisers) may have
to migrate to networked swarms of less individually powerful
forms to ensure survivability in an increasingly hostile
environment where other nations perceive the United States's
system of systems as the U.S. center of gravity. New families of
in-close sensors being developed for counterproliferation, as
well as other types of sensors, would have to be adapted for
tactical roles, such as listening for sounds that characterize
weapons' discharges or sniffing the air for evidence of fuel
expenditures. As human operators are taken away from sensor nets,
new communications structures would become necessary to link
sensor and shooter, and data links would have to become more
cellular. Meanwhile, the fusion of data from various sensors,
which is required to make a target determination, and the
defenses against attacks on the dense communications required
among disparate sensors all would have to be
enhanced.<p><b>Potential Coverage by Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles</b><img src="ch1507.gif" align="middle">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>State It.</I> The second element, C4I communications and data
links, is growing apace with the advances in battlespace
awareness. These enhanced capabilities allow the U.S. military to
send information where it is most needed, whether to the front
lines or the top of the chain of command. Key efforts include the
Global Command and Control System (which can link the various
command centers of the U.S. military in real time and near-real
time) and C4I for the Warrior (whose goal is to deploy
interoperable data terminals to give each echelon access in a
convenient format to the data streams it needs). Improvements in
interoperability should lead to increased efficiency in the
conduct of multiservice, that is, joint, operations. For
instance, in 1995, Patriot missiles are typically slaved to a
Patriot radar, a bulky and hard-to-deploy unit. If Patriot
missiles could be guided by Aegis radars, then the United States
could deploy more rapidly under some conditions. Only the
missiles would have to be moved; the Aegis radar ship could get
there on its own, if not there already.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If tomorrow's defense is to be conducted by multinational, that
is, combined, forces, then the systems for U.S. information
generation would need to be capable of being integrated with
foreign command and fire-control systems. External systems
integration would have to occur at several levels simultaneously:
between U.S. data systems and those of allies; between the data
flows that matter in U.S. doctrine and those required by the
doctrines of allies; and between U.S. sensors and allied weapons
platforms. Good standards can help here, but many problems still
would have to be worked out on a country-by-country
basis.<hr><blockquote><b>Vigilant Warrior</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Vigilant Warrior illustrates the promise--and limitations--of
stand-off warfare. In October 1994, the number of Iraqi tanks
facing Kuwait rose sharply. To forestall a repeat of the August
1990 invasion, the United States dispatched aircraft, naval
assets, and ground forces to Kuwait. This operation, ostensibly a
joint military exercise, served as a reminder that the United
States could and would intervene rapidly and decisively in the
region. Iraqi forces pulled back, ending the crisis. A
disengagement zone in southern Iraq was subsequently established.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Geostrategically, the operation worked; operationally, there was
room for improvement. Although 165 aircraft were deployed, more
than half of these were needed simply to achieve air superiority,
leaving far fewer for ground attack. The 36,000 ground troops
still took two weeks to deploy, and there was not enough weaponry
to wage precision stand-off warfare. The total cost of the
exercise exceeded half a billion dollars. </blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Stop It.</I> The third and final element of the system
of systems is precision force, made up for the most part of PGMs.
Such weapons can put any locatable target at a high risk of
destruction. Most targets can be dispatched with one shot; few
can withstand a volley. Even though most of the PGM revolution
has already occurred, PGMs continue to advance along three lines:
human-guided weapons (such as fiber-optic-guided missiles and
laser-guided bombs); signature-guided weapons (such as those
guided by infrared, radar reflection, or acoustic homing); and
location-directed weapons (those that aim for a given point by
knowing where the target is and where it, itself, is). The U.S.
military is developing new generations of fire-and-forget cluster
munitions (such as sensor-fused weapons and brilliant antitank
munitions), but the larger trend here and especially overseas is
to develop weapons that can be guided to exact locations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Long-range strike capability lets U.S. military forces target and
destroy enemy platforms while operating beyond the reach of enemy
weapons and sensors. This capability arises not only from
accurate, long-range missiles but also from platforms that can
operate far from their bases (such as refueled aircraft) or
remain on extended station (such as nuclear submarines). Because
technologies of range--jet and rocket engines, cruise-missile
motors, nuclear reactors--tend to be expensive and improve rather
slowly, the U.S. advantage in this area is relatively secure (in
contrast to much of the U.S. lead in high-tech weaponry, which is
based on information technologies' advancing everywhere at the
same rate).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another aspect of precision force is the tactical use of
nonlethal technologies. (For a discussion of these technologies,
see the chapter on Unconventional Instruments.) Carbon-fiber
warheads on cruise missiles, for instance, were used in the Gulf
War to short out Baghdad's power grid without causing permanent
damage. Future warheads may include microwave bursts, which harm
electronics more than they do people.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, information technologies, notably distributed
interactive simulation, also permit precision training.
Simulation promises increasingly accurate emulations of friendly
and opposing forces (both hardware and tactics) without the
otherwise expensive cost of live exercises. It also permits
tomorrow's forces to what-if a wide variety of future
capabilities in an equally wide variety of potential but hitherto
unseen environments. A software tool which combines topographic
data and imagery has been used to create fly-through terrains to
train U.S. pilots (e.g., going into Port-au-Prince, and
Sarajevo). The same system was also used to help determine
cease-fire lines in the Bosnian negotiations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

greater assurance
of prevailing
in major regional contingencies, a system of systems presents two
other major advantages: the U.S. military can, under more
circumstances, conduct stand-off warfare (that is, operate beyond
the reach of most hostile weapons); and force can be used in a
far more discriminating manner. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stand-off warfare allows forces to engage an enemy with minimal
exposure and without the need for constant sentinels, which in
turn permits faster engagement and wider latitude in evaluating
intervention. Consider the following scenario. With little
warning, a hostile state launches a full-scale attack on a
neighbor. It seeks to capture a target that will provide a hard
position for subsequent thrusts, claims, negotiations, or
defenses. The United States intervenes to thwart the capture of
this target. Space-based assets deliver detailed imagery of the
enemy order of battle; this imagery is supplemented by data from
naval sensors in international waters. Baseline intelligence data
on the attacking country are quickly converted into an inventory
of strategic targets. Within hours, UAVs are dispatched from
local air bases and surface ships to collect more data; some drop
ground-based sensors along potential attack corridors. As the
data arrive from space, sea, and air, they are fused at a command
center, converted into target assignments, and apportioned to
various attackers: cruise missiles in offshore ships and
submarines, nearby aircraft, strategic bombers from North America
and regional bases, and offshore ground-strike forces readied for
deployment. The resulting counterattack by U.S. and local forces
destroys enough of the attacking force that the aggressor
retreats.<hr><blockquote><b>
New Military Information Technologies and Deterrence</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The destructive power of a battleship or a nuclear bomb is
apparent to all. The power of information warfare is far less
obvious. Thus, replacing tanks and warships with buried missiles
that are linked to information systems may increase warfighting
power, and yet prove too inconspicuous to deter.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, if potential aggressors know that anything visible can be
hit, then proving that their assets can be seen in sufficient
detail may suffice to deter aggressive acts. Consider, first, a
plausible U.S. strategy for conflict characterized by heightened
sensitivity to casualties on either side. The United States
locates a first set of targets, broadcasts their locations, hits
them, and broadcasts their destruction. After this demonstration,
each finding of a new target is broadcast, and U.S. forces allow
enough time for its occupants to disable their platform and
escape.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For peacetime deterrence, the United States might demonstrate to
potential foes that their platforms are under continual,
reliable, and precise surveillance. Such a policy carries risks;
an opponent with such information may use it to gauge its own
hiding techniques. Thus, the United States would need to hint
that it knows more than it tells--clearly, some fine tradeoffs
need be made. Nevertheless, a certain degree of openness could
add deterrence value to efficient but subtle warfighting
technologies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is also possible, at least in theory, that the deterrence
aspect of some intelligence-based warfare technologies can be
further demonstrated by putting together a simulation and making
it available to potential aggressors. Doing so credibly is
unfortunately problematic.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1501.gif" align="left"><b>Air traffic control cneter
on USS Abraham Lincoln.</b><p>Many features of this scenario are
attractive: a large share of
the attacking force is quickly located and defeated; the enemy's
near-term objectives are frustrated; and U.S. forces present few
targets, thus suffering few casualties. This last feature could
be of growing importance if more and more adversaries acquire the
means and will to use weapons of mass destruction. Under such
conditions, it may be inadvisable to mass U.S. forces within the
range of such weapons--and range is what differentiates the
possession of such warheads (which is relatively easy) from the
ability to deliver them and threaten U.S. forces (which is
harder). Thus, stand-off capabilities permit U.S. operations to
proceed with less risk, making such warfare an important
component of U.S. power-projection capabilities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benefits also accrue in peacetime from the potential to carry out
such an operation. The ability to project power at a distance,
responding quickly to aggression, gives the United States
considerable influence even where political or economic
considerations inhibit the stationing of troops. The faster the
United States can respond, the more easily U.S. forces can wait
until the other side makes unambiguous moves to attack. U.S.
forces do not have to rush to the ramparts with every twitch, and
opponents cannot weary them with endless feints. Accidents that
occur when two nervous forces face each other in close proximity
can be avoided.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Logistics benefits from precision-warfare techniques in two ways:
from the transition from dumb to smart rounds and from the use of
information technologies. Without major requirements to move dumb
rounds and the attending ground-support infrastructure, forces
can be deployed more quickly and at less cost; the need for lift
capacity can be minimized. That, in turn, eases scheduling
pressures (for example, ships can be moved when opposing forces
are least prepared) and enables logistics dumps, because they are
smaller (if not necessarily less valuable), to be more easily
hidden and protected. With just-in-time delivery technologies,
the amount of material that has to be stored in theater can be
further reduced. During the Gulf War, thousands of containers
were never opened and their contents remained unknown. Since
then, the DoD has used information technology to develop
logistics systems which have containers, in effect, identify
their contents and location in response to remote electronic
polling. Supplies need only a theater of operations only when
they are needed and not before. Both permit local bases to be
replaced by offshore supply, either afloat or at mobile offshore
bases constructed for that purpose. This reduces the logistics
footprint and removes valuable targets from the battlespace.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some applications of a system of systems also promise to limit
unnecessary destruction. For instance, improvements in
intelligence may permit U.S. forces to locate the command tank
within a battalion; destroying it first could reduce the
effectiveness of the remaining vehicles. Similarly, disruption of
an enemy's command system or the networks that connect it to the
field might cripple that enemy's ability to fight. The plight of
Iraq's army in the Gulf War was a powerful reminder that forces
cut off from their leadership typically become grossly
ineffective. Indeed, one of the attractions of information
warfare is that nonviolent means--for example, electronically
disrupting C4I systems--can precede or even replace violent
conflict. The loss of much of its command system might well deter
an enemy before it has embarked on an irreversible course.
Nevertheless, casualty-free command-and-control warfare is not
yet a realistic prospect.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Minimizing civilian casualties and collateral damage makes it
easier for the United States to take the moral high ground,
reduces domestic opposition to military operations, eases
rebuilding efforts (which could save the United States money in
postwar aid), and lends credibility to U.S. claims that it is
targeting a state's political and military leadership rather than
its people.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Limitations.</I> Systems integration will remain both the
biggest opportunity and greatest liability of tomorrow's system
of systems. The information revolution is driven by commercial
technology that becomes available to everyone simultaneously. The
U.S. military's advantage in applying information technology to
warfare does not derive from special access to this technology
but from competence at systems integration. This reflects
superiority in software, experience at solving
military-integration problems, and the adaptability and high
level of training of the U.S. armed forces. Yet, future systems
integration cannot be taken for granted. Despite the lip service
paid to the ideal of a joint interoperable information system,
interoperability is often considered a cost add-on in
service-acquisition decisions. Similarly, whereas the instruments
of the system of systems are being inserted into the budget, an
agreed-upon structure for such an integrated system is only
starting to be developed--even as the need to connect computers
and not just people makes it all the more necessary.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tying precision-strike warfare to intelligence-based warfare has
a long way to go. In certain environments, U.S. forces might not
be able to acquire dominant battlespace knowledge. Dense or
thickly foliated terrain is harder to read than desert. Cloud
cover inhibits collection of optical imagery. The farther from
open ocean or U.S. bases that a battlespace lies, the harder it
is to observe or target. Although known, fixed targets (as well
as ships and some aircraft) can be engaged from a distance,
attacking mobile ground targets is more
difficult.<hr><blockquote><b>What is a Bitsream?</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the glories of the digital era is that, in time, any piece
of information, regardless of its original format, can be reduced
to a series of bits, that is, 1's and 0's. Thus, facsimiles,
maps, photographs, audio and video tapes, sheet music, radar
reflections, game software, training manuals, and personnel
records can all be expressed in the same way. Furthermore, they
can all be conveyed in any media capable of transmitting a stream
of bits, that is, a bitstream.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ultimately, the only useful distinction between bitstreams would
be between those that represent events as they happen (e.g., live
video feed) and those that convey everything else. To be truly
useful, for instance, UAV imagery of a battlefield ought to be in
real time so that all information on various movements is
current. By contrast, an instruction manual that contains video
sequences need not be delivered as it happens.</blockquote><hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stand-off warfare can be frustrated by foes who disperse
their forces (making them easier to camouflage, conceal, and
decoy) and limit their dependence on fixed sites and easily
identifiable platforms. By so doing, they might ride out a U.S.
stand-off attack and emerge with most of their punch left.
Dispersed, inexpensive targets are cheaper to make than to
destroy using stand-off weapons. A cruise missile, for instance,
costs $1-2 million. The few stealth aircraft operations (which
are equivalent to stand-off in terms of putting air crews at
risk) in the U.S. inventory are expensive to replace, difficult
to maintain, and carry light bomb loads. Using nonstealth
aircraft against robust air-defense systems greatly increases the
risk of losses and prisoners. Standing-off from not so far away
may permit cheaper short-range weapons to be used but increases
the exposure of U.S. forces accordingly. Because other countries
are also honing their own battlespace acuity, U.S. assets, over
time, will themselves become more visible at all ranges,
particularly close ones. Most nations understand that Iraq
blundered in letting the United States take six months to deploy;
tomorrow's foes are unlikely to repeat this error and will be
inclined to attack U.S. deployment from the outset.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Funding will limit the growth of the PGM stockpile. As long as
other conventional munitions persist, units designed to use (or
at least manage) them will also be limited. Pressure for their
deployment and thus use will remain. Further, adverse
environments, both meteorological and electromagnetic, reduce the
accuracy of precision weapons. An enemy playing upon the
sensitivity of the American public to collateral damage might try
to frustrate the casualty-reducing potential of precision weapons
by locating strategic targets in or near sensitive sites, such as
schools or hospitals--a technique reportedly used in both Bosnia
and Iraq.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Disabling enemy systems by targeting key nodes or by using less
destructive soft-kill techniques might also be frustrated by the
difficulty of knowing exactly what is connected to what. There is
considerable difference between taking down an individual target
and taking down a target system. Suppressing Iraqi air defenses
was easier because they were based on the well-studied Soviet
model; key nodes were therefore understood by the U.S. military.
As the Soviet influence wanes, so wanes U.S. understanding of
opposing defenses.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The success of precision attacks is heavily dependent on good
intelligence (for example, identifying military command centers
and leaders). Although the U.S. capacity for collecting
electronic intelligence is keeping pace with the
information-technology revolution, advances in encryption may
reduce the U.S. ability to read the content of intercepted
messages (although deriving intelligence based on message traffic
patterns may remain valid). Gauging the intention of forces often
requires human intelligence, and there is no reason to expect
dramatic improvements in the efficiency of collection. Techniques
to divine the structure of hostile information systems are not as
yet well validated.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lastly, even in the best of conditions, targets cannot always
easily be found. With U.S. forces in control of Panama, General
Manuel Noriega was hard to find. Despite overwhelming U.S.
technological superiority in Iraq and Somalia, Saddam Hussein and
Mohamed Farah Aideed could not be found at
all.<hr><blockquote><b>Providing Bitstreams Versus Providing
Arms</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In some ways, providing bitstreams to an ally is similar to
providing arms. Both help the ally with minimal risk to U.S.
forces and are only as effective as an ally's ability to use
them. Sometimes the two forms of aid are inseparable. A system to
supply targeting data for use by PGMs has little value to a
nation lacking such munitions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, these forms of assistance differ in several important ways:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Multiplication.</I> Arms add force; information multiplies
it. Information can often have more leverage than can more
arms--particularly as military contests take on a hide-and-seek,
rather than force-on-force, character.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Delivery.</I> Once war starts, arms transfers become
hazardous. Lines of communication, ports and transfer facilities,
and warehouses become targets. Even smuggling small arms to
insurgent groups (Afghan rebels, Nicaraguan <I>contras</I>) can
be difficult, and larger transfers are more problematic still.
Wartime delivery of bitstreams may also be interfered with, but
there are more ways around the various obstacles, and their
protection is generally less risky and labor-intensive.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Control.</I> Arms shipments can precede war. Yet, once the
United States hands weapons over, it starts losing control over
their use. Sometimes the ally has other plans for the weapons. At
other times, an ally ceases to be: an enemy of our enemy (e.g.,
Iraq in its war against Iran) may later become an enemy of our
friend; regimes tumble (e.g., the Shah's Iran); and nations fall
(South Vietnam). Sophisticated arms that fall into the hands of
enemies may deteriorate if U.S. maintenance is withdrawn, but
they are still useful for a while. A bitstream can be turned off
instantly if conditions warrant it--even if valuable archived
data, as well as information on sources, methods, and
capabilities, are left behind. Both arms and bitstreams can fall
into enemy hands in the chaos of war; security regimes that can
minimize the cost and likelihood of bitstream diversion appear
more feasible.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Cost.</I> Tanks for allies are tanks that the United States
no longer has. With bitstreams, once the data has been collected,
software developed, and distribution established, the marginal
cost of providing services to allies is generally cheap. How
cheap depends on what adapting bitstreams for particular clients
and exigencies, who pays for training, how much new
infrastructure is needed, and how many new local sensors are
required.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Fingerprints.</I> Arms are hard to supply in secret.
Physical movements leave tracks, and captured material often can
be traced back to the supplier. Bitstreams leave fewer tracks,
are easier to disguise, and are harder to intercept. A captured
M-1 tank makes a great visual on CNN; a captured bitstream, less
of one.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Perspective.</I> The careful choice of what information to
provide and how to provide it reflects and conveys the U.S.
perspective on the meaning and purpose of conflict (in other
words, what is important and what is worth doing). Our donated
imagery, so to speak, is our vision. The ability to provide a
similar perspective by selective weaponry supplies is more
limited.</blockquote><hr>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Extended Information
Dominance</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Warfare in the information age is becoming a high-technology game
of hide-and-seek, with the seeking done by U.S.
intelligence-based warfare systems--normally coupled with U.S.
precision-strike forces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, there is no inherent reason that the United States cannot
take these same capabilities, create a bitstream of information
from the results, and feed this bitstream to other forces. By so
doing, the United States can enhance its allies' effectiveness by
making available to them the output from cutting-edge U.S.
information systems--a vertical coalition, as it were.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Already, U.S. preeminence in long-range mobility and information
systems is being recognized through the assignment of roles and
missions within alliances and coalitions in which the U.S.
military participates. Tomorrow's model is likely to be a mix of
the United States using its own information dominance for its own
forces and sharing some of it with allies. At one end, however,
it is conceivable that U.S. military involvement in a conflict
may be limited to whatever liaison is necessary to ensure the
correct and efficient transfer of information to allies.
Coalitions may arise in which the United States provides sensor
data, analysis, and command data as bitstreams, while local
allies supply human observation, command, and weapons delivery.
While stand-off warfare promises to reduce U.S. casualties,
limiting U.S. involvement in a campaign to the provision of
information might reduce U.S. casualties to nearly zero and, in
many cases, leave few fingerprints. Extended information
dominance, as such, is an ideal type, but, as such, is an
instrument of national power worthy of its own examination.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Precedents exist for helping allies by providing bitstreams. The
United States shared intelligence with the Afghan rebels fighting
the Soviets, who, themselves, shared information with the
Argentines fighting British forces. In a sense, such an operation
resembles arms sales.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Applications.</I> The ability of U.S. forces to influence
distant conflicts without being there may become a powerful new
instrument of national power, filling in the current void between
engagement and nonengagement. Six examples may be illustrative:
fulfilling alliance obligations, substituting for stand-off
warfare, exercising covert leverage, protecting borders,
encouraging regional stability, and contributing to peace
operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Bitstreams may let the United States fulfill its alliance
commitments with far fewer deployments, and could ease the
integration of new countries into its alliances. Indeed, the
United States is already emphasizing the provision of C4I systems
to Partnership for Peace countries as a step toward full
integration. Unlike alliance membership, such assistance can be
finely graded and thus doled out in degrees to specific
countries.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Bitstream supply may reduce pressure on U.S. forces to
undertake stand-off warfare. For example, a country such as
Kuwait could defend itself by installing a system of medium-range
PGMs that are guided to specific locations using a combination of
inertial navigation and global positioning; the locations are in
turn, fed from U.S. bitstreams. Each missile could then be
assigned to a moving armored vehicle with fairly high precision.
The cost of such munitions may compare favorably with the
one-time cost of the exercise Vigilant Warrior.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* If the United States chose to support one side in a murky
conflict--say, Muslims in Bosnia--without risking U.S. troops or
compelling other great powers to intervene, surreptitiously
providing that party access to U.S. bitstreams could be an
effective option. Though major powers friendly to the other side
of the conflict may suspect the United States is providing such
assistance, its covert nature would elicit less of a reaction
than would overt assistance.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>Emerging Concepts for Using Systems</b><p><img
src="ch1505.gif" align="left">Source: Joint Staff<p>* Bitstreams
may help allies protect their borders against
hostile infiltration without the need for cross-border
incursions, such as Turkey's 1995 pursuit of Kurdish rebels into
Iraq. Data collected remotely can substitute for costly and risky
border patrols--and, unlike manned patrols, the
cost-effectiveness of such surveillance rises sharply every year
parallel with similar improvements in digital systems.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bitstreams may bolster regional security. Nations
distrustful of their neighbors often turn to stocking armaments;
this feeds arms races. If each nation could see the effect of its
existing stockpiles multiplied as a result of access to
U.S.-supplied bitstreams--and if nations understood that such
access depended on defensive orientations and good behavior--the
incentive for arms races might be reduced. For example, in Asia,
where countries formally aligned with the United States
nonetheless suspect each other, extending information dominance
(in part to substitute for arms acquisition) might assuage old
fears without generating new ones.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Peacekeeping may be the most promising application of extended
information dominance. The Sinai agreement between Israel and
Egypt, for example, was reinforced by U.S. sensor systems that
let each side monitor potential precursors of attack. Information
systems that may be deployed in the Golan Heights can generate
not only indications of impending attack but targeting
information as well, thereby putting hostile encroachers at
immediate risk.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It might be worthwhile to open certain information sources to
all. Open access would ease operations with unexpected allies and
promote confidence-building, but capabilities so opened may be
unavailable as discretionary instruments of U.S. national power.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>Information Warfare Chart</b><p><img src="ch1504.gif"
align="left">Source: INSS<p><I>Limitations.</I> The amount of
information needed to support
stand-off warfare (to locate structures and major platforms) is
large, but the data needed to support close-range warfare (to
discover troops and their machines, and localize reports of
activity) is much larger. Space and airborne sensors may suffice
for the former, but the latter calls for far more intrusive
sensors, as well as closer integration with friendly troops,
platforms, and data. The placement and management of such sensors
require either U.S. manpower or highly trained allies. Bitstreams
may be subject to electronic attack; their receivers may be
subject to broader information-warfare attacks. Sensors must come
in much cheaper packages before they can be considered a
cost-effective supplement to what ground forces (for example,
reconnaissance units) can supply. Favoring the development of
signature-guided PGMs might also reduce the richness of potential
bitstreams the United States has to offer. If not worked through
in advance, systems integration between U.S. bitstreams and
allied systems may not function smoothly. Further, if an ally is
small, weak, or technologically incapable of assimilating digital
information, U.S. assistance will be of limited help. Just
providing information and nothing else would not work where there
are no or very small local allied forces, as would be the case,
for example, in the Caribbean.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Relying on information rather than more committed efforts may
also deprive the United States of sufficient influence over the
ends and means of conflict. For the most part, nations under
attack may have little choice but to take what help they can get.
At other times, a nation may have the choice between standing up
to a bully or deflecting its wrath to a neighbor; U.S. commitment
may make the difference in collective regional security.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, in a horizontal coalition, each side is responsible for
what happens in its sector. In a vertical coalition, there is no
such neat division of responsibility. U.S. data flows might
enable recipients to engage in activities of which the United
States does not approve, such as attacking nonmilitary targets.
Short of pulling the plug, Washington's options for controlling
such an ally may be limited.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lastly, if bitstreams are easy and effective, the United States
might tend to intervene too readily. Secret assistance provided
through intelligence agencies can escalate into a deeper
entanglement, and the United States could find itself involved in
a conflict that, upon further reflection, it would have preferred
to avoid.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When farming was the essence of national economies, taking land
was the essence of war. As agriculture yielded to industry, war
too was industrialized; nations defeated foes by destroying their
productive capacity. If this pattern holds for the information
age, might war follow commerce into cyberspace, pitting foes for
control of this undefinable but critical ground?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Information warfare can cover a great deal of ground, some of
which is discussed in other chapters. The first two instruments
covered in this chapter concerned the application of intelligence
capabilities to war. This third instrument covers attacks on
critical national information systems themselves.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<img src="ch1502.gif" align="left"><b>B-2 Stealth
Bomber<p></b><I>Applications.</I> Motives for attacking the
networks of an
enemy include theft of services or data, corruption of
information, denial of the network's service to its users, and
control of the systems to which networks are attached. Networks
can be attacked via inside paths or outside paths. The former
mode of attack includes inserting bad hardware or software
components at the source and also gaining the cooperation of
insiders. Both of these methods, like intelligence recruitment,
run a high risk of detection, and success is often fortuitous.
Outside paths refer to unauthorized access over external routes,
such as phone or Internet lines, and may yield two levels of
access. User access--the ability to see and manipulate an
individual's files and tap into common resources--is of some
value to saboteurs. Even more valuable is super-user access--the
ability to see and manipulate the files that make a system run.
Outside paths are less risky and easier to repeat, but they are
also easier to defend against.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the United States could override an enemy's military
computers, it might achieve an advantage comparable to
neutralizing the enemy's command apparatus. Such attacks can be
expected in future conflicts. However, since potential foes of
the United States range from network-illiterate to
network-dependent, the value of targeting military information
systems will vary greatly in different situations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Military systems designed for field use tend to be
difficult to penetrate. Not meant for public access, they are
often entirely independent systems. Instead, the hot-button issue
of information warfare is an attack on a nation's commercial
computer systems--telecommunications, power, banking, and safety
systems. Making potential aggressors know that the United States
could abjure brute force but still wreak havoc on their societies
would be a powerful new instrument of power. Such influence could
be exercised in a gradual way; a tap here and there (in other
words, evidence that the United States can affect a nation's
systems at will) might suffice to remind a nation's leaders of
their vulnerability. If provocations persist, a harder stroke
(such as corrupting the integrity of highly visible services but
not necessarily damaging them) may cause the populace to feel
that their leaders cannot protect them. If such deterrence
failed, wholesale attacks on opponents' computers could undermine
the advanced sections of these opponents' economies, hinder the
mobilization of military power, and put heavy pressure upon
hostile leadership.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Information technology can also permit the United States to push
information past barriers and directly address citizens of other
countries. The Internet is one such tool for disseminating
information. Proposed satellite systems, such as Motorola's
Iridium, promise relatively low-cost global access to anyone past
the reach of national censors. Perhaps the most ubiquitous means
of reaching others may be direct broadcast satellite. In the
mid-1990s, technology lets a system operator cover most of Asia
offering up to one hundred separate channels for less than a
billion dollars. For most foreign-policy purposes, simply letting
others access global news streams (e.g., CNN, BBC) is good
enough. However, it is not inconceivable that the technologies
that created the dinosaurs of <I>Jurassic Park</I> or the morphed
Presidents of <I>Forrest Gump</I> could be employed in creating
entirely synthetic imagery as well.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Defensive information warfare, employed as a tool to preserve the
integrity of U.S. and other friendly nations' information
systems, may be understood to be an instrument of national power
in the same way as home guard forces have been. It is clear that
the vulnerability of the U.S. information infrastructure is
growing more acute. Not only are more activities becoming
dependent on information systems, but these information systems
are becoming more open to outsiders and, in the process, adopting
technologies that make them less secure (for example, open
operating systems, Web browsers, and distributed objects).
Security technologies are themselves advancing, but hacker tools
are becoming more sophisticated and easier to get and use.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Doctrine on how to defend the nation's information infrastructure
is in flux. Some would designate a central government guardian;
others hold that the responsibility for protecting various
systems must rest with their owners. Protection is likely to be a
matter of operator and user diligence coupled with third-party
software tools and expertise. With minor exceptions (e.g.,
intelligence data on likely threats), everything one needs is
likely to be commercially (and internationally) available.
Whatever additional help the U.S. government can offer its
friends (above and beyond what they can buy on their own) is
likely to be modest.<hr><blockquote><b>An Open Global Defense
Information Network</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Access to a potential stream of bits is akin to an electrical
outlet. Friendly nations plug their command systems, operators,
and sensors into it and vitalize their defenses. The United
States can cut off the power as it wishes. That said, there may
be some advantages in making some information flows (with
appropriate limits on coverage, acuity, and revelation) generally
and globally accessible even during periods of tension.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What advantages may accrue from providing open connections?
First, open (that is, widely known and frequently used)
connection standards make vertical coalitions easier to establish
by reducing obstacles to interoperability. Secondly, because a
system's architecture reflects the interests and priorities of
its owners, an open network based on U.S. capabilities will be
geared toward looking for what concerns the United States most
(such as armaments of a major regional contingency) rather than
objects of little military concern (such as internal dissidents)
or assets that only the United States has in abundance
(satellites, long-range mobility assets, or blue-water
submarines). Buying into the network would mean buying into these
priorities. Thirdly, the United States would profit from other
nations' contributions of their own bitstreams and software. Some
offerings would be voluntary; others would be a quid pro quo for
access to the system. Fourthly, letting nations benefit from a
global network may make them more amenable to intrusive sensors
in their spaces.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even great powers might be willing to buy into the network for
the purposes of confidence-building, easing interoperation in
peace operations and ad hoc coalitions, and gaining tools that
facilitate national management in such areas as the environment,
disaster relief, national resources, transportation, and law
enforcement. If the United States does not allow minor
disagreements to prejudice open access, the system will be
increasingly trusted as a global utility. The provision of more
information about the United States and its allies might assure
others. Nations that know they are being scrutinized by everyone
may shy away from provocative measures. Despite most nations'
desire to avoid dependence on systems that they do not own,
access to the network, if reliable, might prove seductive. Then,
if some nation should buck the system, it would find itself
denied access precisely when it is most threatening--and for that
reason, threatened. A gap in coverage may not last forever, but
the time required for another nation to duplicate formerly
available bitstreams may suffice to buy the time required to turn
potential adversaries around.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, openness has its costs: loss of discretion, technological
leakage, exposure to malevolent intelligence. If access is always
available, Washington cannot manipulate its provision to affect
lesser conflicts or exercise influence over potential allies.
Systems integration is a key U.S. core capability, but system
standards (which make systems integration work) and other
software capabilities, once viewed in their open form, may be
copied by other nations. Open systems are also, for that reason,
more vulnerable: sensitive data must be tightly secured, useful
data must be authenticated and protected, valuable software must
be controlled, and information should be culled so that its
presence does not reveal too much about U.S. doctrine or
intelligence methods.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a good illustration of the
pros and cons of openness. Originally, GPS was supposed to be
more accurate for U.S. forces than for others; but technology
(notably, differential GPS--being installed all over Europe and
East Asia) has levelled the playing field. The United States has
gone far to assure nervous users elsewhere that it will not
degrade the system for trivial cause (although local jamming in
conflict zones is not so hard); even so, Russia's Glonass is used
as a back-up and European systems are being
contemplated.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>Increasing Percision/Effectiveness of Weapons<p></b><img
src="ch1506.gif" align="left">Source: CIA<p>Note: CEP is circular
error probability,that is, the circle within which there is a 50%
probability the bomb will land.<p><I>Limitations.</I> The issue
of information warfare as an
instrument of U.S. national power raises two fundamental
questions: Are the technological means available? And, if so,
would Washington use them?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even if the United States has programs to wage information war,
as has been frequently hinted, these are and will likely remain
highly classified. Herein lies a drawback: unannounced weapons
make poor deterrents. Yet, the tools of information war, once
announced, may depreciate quickly. Networks are vulnerable
because they are poorly secured; poor security persists because
the probability and cost of intrusions are judged to be low. Once
the U.S. information-warfare threat is unsheathed, there is
likely to be an increased emphasis on security. By then, some
systems may already have been compromised, but countermeasures
are available to restore service and files while limiting further
intrusions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, the special vulnerability of the United States's own
networks has been widely trumpeted, thus raising the question of
whether residents of glass houses should threaten to throw
stones. More generally, attacks on civilian targets are always
difficult for the U.S. national command authority to authorize.
Not only would the victims of information war include
noncombatants but the risk of collateral damage may be
unknowable; the networks we trash may be our own.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At present, most computer systems are vulnerable to information
attacks even if most intrusions are more annoying than dangerous.
Yet, the frequency intrusions is rising, and the possibility of a
digital Pearl Harbor cannot be dismissed out of hand. That being
so, a nation's critical systems can be engineered to limit access
sharply. Although neither quick nor free, the cost of such
security measures would be small in comparison with a nation's
overall defense costs. Indeed, defense of the nation's
information infrastructure is more likely to become an instrument
of U.S. national power than offensive information war. Such
defensive measures would permit other avenues of U.S. power to be
exercised with less fear of counterattack against its information
infrastructure.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Conclusions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is considerable debate over whether the injection of
information technologies into defense systems can provide a basis
for undertaking a revolution in military affairs (RMA). One good
test is whether a new instrument of power is indeed
revolutionary--whether it can alter relationships among states.
Ancient innovations, for instance, shifted the balance of power
back and forth between dismounted and mounted forces, and,
consequently, between civilized and barbaric cultures. The advent
of gunpowder doomed the isolated city-state. Napoleon's
<I>lev&eacute;e en masse</I> redrew the map of Europe, setting
off nationalistic reverberations that echoed for the next
century. The Third Reich's blitzkrieg ushered in new forms of
international coercion. And nuclear weapons, originally conceived
as a force multiplier for conventional operations may have had
the reverse effect; they made conventional conflict among nuclear
powers a potential first step to mutual suicide and hence of
sharply decreased utility. Whether or not the new military
applications of information technologies constitute a true RMA
will therefore depend on the new uses to which a military so
equipped can be put.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The emerging military instruments of this section are in various
stages of development. The United States is on the verge of
having a system of systems that is capable of conducting
stand-off and precision warfare, at least in favorable
situations. A 1993 study argued that a fleet of stealth bombers
armed with brilliant antitank munitions could stop an armored
attack all by itself. The optimism may be premature, but clearly,
the U.S. armed forces are moving in that direction.
<hr><blockquote><b>Defining the Revolution</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Military Technological Revolution</I> (MTR): the incorporation
of radically advanced capabilities into existing military forces
as equipment turns over--a passive revolution.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Revolution in Military Affairs</I> (RMA): the adoption of
radically more effective operational procedures and organizations
in response to the opportunities offered by the MTR--an active
revolution.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Revolution in Security Affairs</I> (RSA)--the RMA plus other
interesting changes in the security environment, many brought
about by technology (e.g., the CNN-ization of war)--a passive
revolution.
</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The U.S. ability to extend information dominance is far
less developed. The potential of such capabilities can be
glimpsed, however, in the emerging role-sharing debates within
NATO and in the United States's ability to supply certain
intelligence data to selected allies under crisis conditions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many of the means for hacker warfare were becoming
available in 1995. However, the well-wired United States remains
more vulnerable to such attacks than most potential opponents.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With luck, these instruments will allow the United States
to exercise a high degree of control over the emerging global
security structure through its unique ability to intervene all
over the world quickly, effectively, and at little cost. Even
more impressive would be the ability to make a large difference
in potential conflicts just through the supply of information and
related software without leaving fingerprints, much less
footprints. As with any new military instrument, particular
attention may be necessary to turn new means of conducting war
into effective means of deterring it.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the U.S. military stands at a crossroads in deciding
what it wants to be, it is by no means certain which way it will
choose. Institutions, particularly triumphant ones--such as the
U.S. military in the wake of its victories in the Cold War and
Desert Storm--tend to avoid fundamental change. Technology will
be sought and absorbed, but largely in the context of
pre-existing assumptions about the organization of military
force. The instinct of the U.S. military services will remain to
confront aggression by projecting forces into harm's way and
engaging the enemy until victory is secured. Stand-off warfare
permitted by the system of systems deviates from that model; the
provision of bitstreams alone is even further removed. If these
instincts prevail, then the resulting choice may be made by
default--the United States will have the preeminent military of
the twentieth century just as this century is coming to a close.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yet, the U.S. military may not have much choice but to change if
it wishes to have a role in shaping the international security
structure. With the Cold War over, the American public is finding
it increasingly difficult to identify interests that merit the
expenditure of U.S. blood. Even as the military enjoys high
public esteem, the will to use military power to support the
United States's ability to lead the world seems to be fading.
Rather, the U.S. public would maintain its military power
primarily to ensure that other nations do not directly challenge
the United States with impunity.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If a peer military competitor emerges in a decade or two,
however, the situation will be quite different. <I>Strategic
Assessment 1995</I> rates hedging against this possibility as the
most important long-term U.S. national-security challenge. Such a
competitor might not openly challenge the United States but could
seek undue influence in its region, perhaps supporting
belligerent proxies or otherwise attempting to bend neighbors to
its will. U.S. policymakers may wish to use instruments of U.S.
military power to deter or defer the emergence of such a peer
competitor without asking the American public to bear great risk
or suffer casualties for such an end. Therefore, Washington will
have to find ways of exerting military influence that will
minimize such costs. The emerging instruments discussed above,
particularly the extension of information dominance, may be the
best methods available for achieving this end.

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) has, in
the mid-1990s, posed a dramatically increasing threat to the
United States. This threat is multidimensional, for WMD include
nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons. Moreover, the
threat has been compounded by the proliferation of ballistic and
cruise missiles, which make longer-range delivery systems
available to nations possessing WMD. (For a fuller treatment, see
<I>Strategic Assessment 1995.</I>) The United States is
responding to this threat by pursuing policies and initiatives
designed both to prevent proliferation or limit it, and to
minimize the strategic and tactical consequences should
prevention fail. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Nuclear weapons.</I> In the mid-1990s, the number of countries
that have nuclear weapons, have the capability to produce nuclear
weapons, or are seeking the capacity to produce and deliver
nuclear weapons is approaching two dozen. In addition to the five
declared nuclear powers, some states are judged to have either
fully developed nuclear weapons (e.g., Israel) or the ability to
assemble and deliver such weapons rapidly (e.g., India and
Pakistan). A number of states are attempting to obtain, or have
the facilities to produce, weapons-grade fissile material (e.g.,
Iraq, Iran, and North Korea). A growing number of states possess
the requisite scientific and industrial infrastructure to
initiate a weapons program, while others appear to be in the
early stages of acquiring the expertise and infrastructure needed
for a nuclear-weapons program, often through the acquisition of
nuclear reactors for ostensibly peaceful purposes (e.g., Algeria
and Syria). Lastly, there is growing concern that terrorist
groups and organized-crime syndicates could come into the
possession of nuclear weapons--including crude radiological
devices. These fears are fueled in part by concerns about a
possible loss of control over stocks of weapons-grade nuclear
material in the former Soviet Union. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Chemical and Biological Weapons.</I> The number of countries
with chemical and biological weapons is rising, and experience
has shown that once states have made the decision to acquire a
WMD capability, biological weapons (BW) and chemical weapons (CW)
are generally pursued simultaneously.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many experts believe that Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Cuba, China,
and North Korea, among others, have active biological-weapons
programs. In the early 1990s, Russia admitted it had a BW program
in the past, and concerns linger that this program still exists
in some form and that Russia may be maintaining illegal
capability to produce biological warfare agents. Other countries
that may be pursuing BW include Argentina, Brazil, South Africa,
India, Pakistan, and Laos. Thus, the problem, though global, is
concentrated in regions of instability--some of which, such as
the Middle East and Northeast Asia, are of key importance to the
West.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The cost of acquiring a stockpile of chemical or biological
weapons is small when compared with the cost of achieving nuclear
capability. Biological and chemical weapons are relatively easy
to acquire because almost all the technologies associated with
them are widely available and used for legitimate commercial
activities. In addition, defensive biological and chemical
programs can provide cover for covert offensive BW and CW
programs. For all these reasons, the production of BW and CW
weapons is difficult to detect, and offenders can often plausibly
deny that they are producing such weapons. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Alarmingly, states are acquiring BW capability and CW not just
for deterrence but because they are perceived as operationally
useful. Iraq used CW effectively against Iran throughout their
nearly decade-long war, and Iraq also used chemical weapons
against its own people. In addition, CW and/or BW are believed to
have been used in conflicts in Afghanistan, Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia. And the 1995 sarin gas attacks in Tokyo's subway
demonstrated the feasibility of terrorist attacks using CW. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>North Korea Theater Missile Threats</b><p><img
src="ch1605.gif" align="left">Source: BMDO<p><I>Missiles.</I>
Many NBC proliferators see missiles, and especially ballistic
missiles, as the delivery system of choice. As of 1995, more than
a dozen countries have operational ballistic missiles, and many
more have missile-development programs or agreements to obtain
ballistic-missile technology from others. Although most systems
available to states seeking WMD capability (sometimes referred to
as "proliferant states") are limited to a range of about 600 km,
these ranges are increasing steadily. North Korea has
flight-tested the 1,000-plus km-range No-Dong 1 and has under
development a missile with a range of 3,500-plus km, the
Taepo-Dong 2 (TD-2). A number of states are pursuing space-launch
capabilities, which can also provide long-range military
capability. Cruise missiles are also of growing importance to
emerging powers. They are inexpensive compared with ballistic
missiles and have increasing capabilities in terms of range,
accuracy, and payload.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Nonproliferation (Prevention) 
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The global proliferation of NBC weapons, their concentration in
unstable regions vital to U.S. interests, the perception of their
increasing military and political utility, and the greater
likelihood of their use--in war, as a tool for political
blackmail, or by terrorists--all serve to increase the threat to
U.S. and allied forces. Instruments that aim at preventing or
limiting the spread of such weapons are known as instruments of
nonproliferation. <hr><blockquote><b>A Distinction in Terms: WMD
and NBC</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The term "weapons of mass destruction" (WMD) refers to nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons employed for the purpose of
inflicting massive damage, including the killing of large numbers
of civilians. The term consolidates nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons into one category because, despite differences
in their effects and use, they share enormous lethality and
symbolism. Thus, the concept of WMD is significant in a political
rather than a military sense. By using the term "WMD,"
policymakers convey the message that the proliferation of these
types of weapons is unacceptable and that their use would be
considered an extremely grave matter. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, for military operational purposes, a distinction must be
made when considering the threats posed by nuclear, biological,
and chemical weapons. The acronym NBC recognizes these
differences. Also, "WMD" is an open-ended concept, potentially
allowing for the development of other technologies of mass
destruction. "NBC" is necessarily confined to the three named
technologies. Nuclear weapons are the most lethal and the least
easily defended against of these weapons of mass destruction. The
use of biological weapons carries with it a potential for loss of
life that approaches that of nuclear weapons; however, biological
arsenals can be combatted to some degree with vaccines, masks,
and proper warning. Chemical weapons are the least lethal of the
weapons of mass destruction but can still have a profound effect
on the battlefield or on civilian populations if used in
sufficient quantities. Troops can defend themselves against
chemical weapons with chemical detectors and protective clothing,
but such equipment undermines operational
effectiveness.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The proliferation process begins when a state first considers
acquiring WMD and seeks to develop or obtain the technical and
manufacturing expertise to do so. Prevention measures are most
effective at these early stages and fall within a number of
categories.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Dissuasion:</I> convincing non-WMD states that their
security interests are best served by not acquiring WMD.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Denial:</I> attempting to limit a state's ability to obtain
WMD technologies or devices.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>Arms control:</I> seeking to set limits on or eliminate WMD
through bilateral or multilateral agreements and the creation of
international norms against proliferation, as discussed in the
chapter on arms control.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* <I>International pressure:</I> punishing states who pursue
acquisition of WMD with trade or economic sanctions, publicizing
companies and countries that assist in the acquisition of WMD,
and sharing intelligence. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While prevention efforts often are largely diplomatic in nature,
defense-related agencies play an important supporting role. Their
involvement may include providing inspection, verification, and
enforcement support for nonproliferation treaties and control
regimes; helping to identify states that might acquire, or are
acquiring, NBC capabilities; and conducting interdiction
missions. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The central tool of prevention traditionally has been arms
control, which continues to be the focus of the world community's
efforts to create norms against proliferation and to limit the
spread of WMD. The primary international mechanism for
controlling nuclear proliferation is the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its associated
monitoring arm, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) , not yet in force as of
late 1995, bans the production, use, possession, and
transportation of chemical weapons. The Biological Weapons
Convention (BWC), which has been in force since 1972, bans the
development, production, stockpiling, or acquisition of
biological or toxin agents and weapons. In addition to formal
treaties, a number of multilateral regimes exist to prevent
potential proliferators from gaining access to critical
technologies and materials. For more information on these
treaties and regimes, see the chapter on arms control.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Arms control and other prevention tools have had some important
successes. In 1989-1990, South Africa reversed its policy on
nuclear weapons, and Argentina abandoned the Condor missile
program. But despite arms-control efforts, the diffusion of WMD
technologies has proven exceptionally difficult to control. In
this regard, the Iraqi experience is revealing. While export
controls did succeed in delaying and increasing the cost of
Iraq's nuclear program, post-Gulf War discoveries revealed it to
be much more advanced than most analysts had suspected. Thus,
while arms-control and export-control regimes can be helpful in
retarding and raising the cost of obtaining NBC weapons, states
that are sufficiently motivated and possess adequate resources
will probably succeed if they persist. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If increasing numbers of states do acquire WMD, other tools to
enhance security must be employed, in particular, tools that
afford some protection against these weapons. The remaining four
instruments examined here are military instruments used to
counter the threat of NBC weapons after an enemy has acquired
them. Such instruments are generally known as instruments of
counterproliferation. Deterrence remains the first line of
defense, and counterproliferation instruments can strengthen
deterrence. Should deterrence fail, however, the instruments of
counterproliferation provide a measure of protection.<p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, when strategic nuclear war was the central
threat to U.S. national security, nuclear deterrence was the
chief instrument of response. However, the last years of the Cold
War saw a dramatic drawdown--partly negotiated, partly by
unilateral choice--in the size and variety of the United States's
theater nuclear arsenal. And the Cold War's end has brought a
change in the entire nuclear environment, as well as questions
about the utility of both strategic and theater nuclear weapons.
Two issues stand out: (1) what role nuclear weapons have in the
post-Cold War age; and (2) how effective nuclear deterrence will
prove in regional conflicts where an adversary has NBC weapons.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In its 1994 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and subsequent
affirmations, the Clinton administration reaffirmed the United
States's need for a nuclear deterrent. Concretely, the
administration identified a requirement to, among other things:
maintain 3,500 strategic warheads; keep ICBMs and modernize the
Minuteman III; complete the D-5 Trident missile purchase and
maintain fourteen Trident boats armed with D-5s; adopt a
stockpile stewardship program to assure a reliable, safe, and
secure stockpile without nuclear testing; and commit the
resources needed to verify START compliance and monitor Russia's
strategic offensive modernization program. Strategically, the
document seeks to hedge against the possibility of a reversal of
democratization in Russia; to allow for the possibility of armed
confrontation with a regional power that has acquired WMD; to
continue to extend the U.S. nuclear deterrent to major allies;
and to discourage or even reverse nuclear proliferation. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A key element in the rejection of nuclear disarmament is the
realization that nuclear weapons cannot be disinvented; that is,
the knowledge of how to make them is widespread and the most
demanding part of the process (acquiring fissile material) is
extraordinarily difficult to prevent. Even if the world's
political processes sustain arms-control efforts and achieve
related measures, such as a comprehensive nuclear test ban and
cessation of the production of plutonium for weapons purposes,
the problem of so-called virtual nuclear arsenals--the technical
and industrial capability to create a nuclear arsenal
quickly--remains. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, despite whatever arms pacts may be signed, reliable and
effective verification measures do not yet exist. Thus, without
the ability to verify universal nuclear disarmament, the United
States would run a tremendous risk in eliminating its own nuclear
deterrent. Many wary policymakers emphasize that, though
diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow have thawed
considerably since 1989, Russia has continued to produce nuclear
weapons while the United States has ceased its production. Other
great powers, too, may someday construct large nuclear arsenals.
Furthermore, many policymakers argue that the elimination of the
U.S. arsenal would inspire other nuclear states to build up their
arsenals in order to challenge U.S. power and deter U.S.
conventional military forces. Further, some observers have
pointed out that if the United States were to do away with its
nuclear capability, many non-nuclear states that rely upon U.S.
security assurances for their protection would have an incentive
to seek their own nuclear deterrent capabilities. Thus, the
supposition one must take into account when developing a
long-term vision of nuclear forces is that future challenges may
again require a response of significant proportions. Whether the
laws, rules, and institutions of the international system will be
adequate to contain those challenges without the backing of
proportionate force is doubtful. Whether nuclear weapons might be
needed to provide such force is at least an open
question.<hr><bloockquote><b>Chemical Weapons in the Gulf War:
Did Nuclear Deterrence Work?</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prior to the Gulf War, military assessments credited Iraq with a
formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard gas,
tabun, and sarin. Over the course of Iraq's nearly decade-long
war with Iran, the Iraqi military gained extensive combat
experience with chemical weapons, and CW use was by the end of
the war an integral part of Iraqi warfighting doctrine. However,
in spite of threats to turn the Gulf War into "the mother of all
wars" and to "burn half of Israel to the ground," Iraq did not
use chemical weapons when it faced the United States and its
coalition. This came as a surprise to allied commanders, who
anticipated that Iraq would attack with WMD early in the fighting
in an effort to undermine U.S. public support for the war.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the aftermath of the Gulf War, many factors were cited to
explain why Iraq restrained itself from employing CW. Some
analysts asserted that the Iraqi leadership feared the use of CW
would cause the coalition to change the military objectives of
Desert Storm to include the elimination of Saddam Hussein's
regime. Others posited that Baghdad believed the use of CW would
not have a significant impact on coalition forces due to their
use of protective suits and chemical detectors. Still others
claimed that atmospheric conditions unfavorable to effective CW
use persisted throughout the ground campaign.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps the most prevalent argument attributed the decision to
Iraqi fears of a U.S. or Israeli response with nuclear weapons.
After the onset of hostilities in the Gulf War, it became
apparent that the United States held an overwhelming
conventional-force advantage over Iraq. However, in the months
leading up to the Gulf War, U.S. political and military leaders,
unsure whether the conventional superiority of their forces would
deter WMD use by Iraq, indicated privately and publicly that the
United States might retaliate with nuclear weapons if Iraq were
to use chemical weapons. According to an Iraqi transcript of a
meeting between U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq `Aziz, Baker told `Aziz, "God
forbid...chemical weapons are used against our forces--the
American people would demand revenge, and we have the means to
implement this."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In late 1995 the Iraqi leadership told U.N. officials that they
had interpreted Baker's warning to mean that the United States
would use nuclear weapons against Iraq if Iraq used NBC against
coalition forces. The Iraqis claim they took this warning
seriously, and that while they had armed nearly two hundred SCUD
warheads and bombs with chemical and biological agents for use
against coalition forces and Israeli and Saudi cities, they did
not use them because they feared U.S. nuclear
retaliation.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>Strategic Nuclear Launchers</b><p><img src="ch1604.gif"

Studies.  The Military Balance 1995/96 and Secretary of Defnese,
Annual Report to the President and Congress 1995.<p>
Below the level of great-power challenges lies the question of
nuclear deterrence against a regional power possessing NBC
weapons. The concern is that U.S. conventional capabilities may
not serve as an effective deterrent against BW and CW use in
limited or regional military engagements. Should Washington
relinquish the option of retaliating in kind to CW (as it already
has done with BW), nuclear weapons will then provide the only
nonconventional military deterrent to the use of WMD against U.S.
or allied forces. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In late 1995, Iraqi officials gave U.N. envoys the first
authoritative, if perhaps incomplete, account of why they did not
use biological and chemical arms against coalition forces. Even
though Iraq had embarked on a much accelerated nuclear-weapons
program after the invasion of Kuwait, and had reportedly loaded
roughly two hundred bombs and missile warheads with biological
agents, Iraqi officials claim that they did not use them because
they interpreted a strong warning delivered by Secretary of State
James Baker as implying that the United States would use nuclear
weapons if Iraq used CW or BW against the coalition.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such revelations bolster the need for continued credible nuclear
capabilities as well as the need to resist attempts to
delegitimize U.S. possession of nuclear weapons. Nonetheless,
while apparently successful in deterring NBC use against U.S. and
allied forces in the Gulf, the effectiveness of nuclear
deterrence cannot be relied on exclusively. A number of factors
might lessen the credibility of a U.S. nuclear response in
certain situations that are not difficult to imagine. First,
asymmetrical interests are present in many, if not all, regional
conflicts. A regional regime might be convinced that its survival
is at stake, while the U.S. interest in the conflict might well
fall far short of that. A regime making such an assumption might
gamble that Washington's stakes in the conflict would not be high
enough to warrant a U.S. nuclear response to the regime's NBC use
(especially if limited), with all the inevitable international
political repercussions. Secondly, a desperate regime might
reason that a limited U.S. nuclear response would cause no more
damage to its military capabilities than a continued, unrelenting
conventional attack. Thirdly, an enemy's use of NBC--perhaps even
at the outset of hostilities, and not as an act of
desperation--might be carefully measured to cause enough
casualties to make the U.S. leadership reconsider the price of
its intervention, yet not be of sufficient magnitude that it
would be likely to provoke a nuclear response. Scenarios such as
these--and others can easily be envisioned--suggest that while
the United States must maintain a credible nuclear deterrent
against NBC use, the efficacy of that deterrent cannot be relied
on absolutely.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That said, deterring NBC armed regional aggressors will remain
the United States's preferred and first line of defense. An
essential element of such deterrence will be maintaining a
credible capability across the spectrum of forces, from
conventional superiority--including the ability to operate in an
NBC environment supported by active and passive defenses and
adequate counterforce capabilities--to a reliable and effective
nuclear deterrent. However, it is also necessary to go beyond
capabilities and reexamine how to think about and plan for
deterrence in a regional conflict. For example, some of the
assumptions on which U.S.-Soviet deterrence was founded (such as
a basic and shared rationality) may not hold in regional
conflicts. Articulating a regional deterrence and defense
strategy (or strategies) will be a difficult but important
challenge. Understanding deterrence and defense in a regional
context will require a better appreciation of the
military/cultural/political dynamics, as will a better
understanding of possible employment doctrines of regional states
with NBC weapons. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another issue is the continued role for so-called tactical
nuclear weapons, that is, weapons to be used on or near the
battlefield against enemy military forces as contrasted with
weapons that hold at risk deeper, "strategic" targets. By the end
of the Cold War, the technical distinctions between tactical and
strategic systems had become blurred. Continuing the trend in the
last years of the Cold War of reducing dramatically the U.S.
tactical nuclear arsenal, the Nuclear Posture Review endorsed a
nonstrategic nuclear force structure consisting solely of Air
Force dual-capable aircraft and Navy Tomahawk missiles, which
could in an emergency be deployed on submarines.<p>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead4">Counterforce Capabilities
</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Counterforce--the ability to strike an enemy's forces before they
can be used--has always been a central objective of military
operations. In a WMD scenario, counterforce capabilities include
the ability to target, deny, interdict, or destroy hostile NBC
forces and supporting infrastructure. Counterforce principles
operate at all levels of military conflict and engagement. At the
tactical level, for example, destruction of an enemy's artillery
and supply capabilities is a prime method of suppressing that
enemy's ability to deliver chemical or nuclear weapons in the
field.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even under the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, the
ability to destroy an enemy's residual nuclear forces after an
initial strike was seen as the most effective way of limiting
damage should deterrence fail. In the post-Cold War world, strong
counterforce capabilities serve not only to mitigate or eliminate
existing NBC threats but to deter their creation in the first
place.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The acquisition of offensive counterforce capabilities was partly
a consequence of improved technological capabilities.
Nonetheless, despite the push from technology, the progress of
strategic counterforce capabilities was moderated during the Cold
War, largely because counterforce capabilities sufficient to
achieve a first-strike capability were considered destabilizing.

In a regional setting there would be a number of special
political and operational aspects associated with attempting to
destroy NBC-associated weapons and facilities. Such missions
would impose unique considerations on all involved in the
planning, decision, and execution, from the National Command
authorities to the local commander. The character and symbolism
of weapons of mass destruction would make striking NBC-related
targets as much a political act as a military one. Political
authorities would undoubtedly scrutinize closely any
recommendation to destroy NBC-related targets. The requirements
for success would also tend to be more stringent than for non-NBC
counterforce strikes. Because collateral damage from the
destroyed weapons can be so great, the effects of such damage
would have to be known in advance and held to a minimum. These
requirements would have to be taken into account during planning
and might require unique technical capabilities. Taken together,
these considerations would impose special burdens on the
intelligence units and military forces if they were to undertake
counterforce missions against NBC targets.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One lesson that potential adversaries learned from the Gulf War
is that in order to survive in the face of U.S. conventional
superiority, an enemy must go underground. In 1994, a Senate
Armed Services Committee report acknowledged, "While Operation
Desert Storm revealed the accuracy of U.S. precision guided
missiles, it also revealed serious shortcomings in their
lethality against buried, deep underground, or otherwise hardened
facilities." Increasingly, regional powers are taking this lesson
to heart, hiding their WMD facilities and stockpiles in
underground bunkers in an effort to reduce the possibility of
detection and the effectiveness of conventional weapons directed
against them if they are detected. Such action places greater
demands on both intelligence and counterforce resources, as
capabilities must be improved to identify underground NBC targets
and develop technologies to destroy them. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">Active Defense</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Active defenses--the ability to prevent weapons from reaching
their intended targets--can enhance deterrence by denying an
enemy the ability effectively to employ NBC-armed missiles and
aircraft. Such defenses may become essential to ensure that the
United States or its allies are not deterred by an NBC threat, or
do not have to suffer massive casualties unnecessarily. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The pursuit of active defenses against the greatest Cold War WMD
threat--nuclear-armed Soviet ballistic missiles--was carefully
circumscribed and formally limited by the Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty. In 1972, at a time when the number of offensive
missiles and nuclear warheads numbered in the tens of thousands,
the ABM Treaty was adopted on the assumption that in light of
these great numbers, active defenses were simply not capable of
defending against the full magnitude of the threat; mutual
assured destruction was believed to be the most stable policy.
Further, policymakers hoped that a limit on active defenses would
encourage greater restraint in the production of offensive
weapons and, conversely, feared that the pursuit of active
defenses would spur even greater offensive efforts. They also
hoped that the ABM Treaty might provide a political basis for
reductions in the offensive nuclear stockpiles of the United
States and Soviet Union.<p><b>Chemical protection
mask.</b><p><img src="ch1602.gif" align="left">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the end of the Cold War was accompanied by a diminished
perception of the Russian threat, it also resulted in an
increased perception of the threat posed by regional powers.
Indeed, as ballistic and cruise missiles become more available to
emerging powers, the need for active defenses to protect U.S.
forces in regions where NBC proliferation is taking place becomes
clearer. Additionally, the evolution of missiles that are both
longer range and mobile decreases the likelihood that
counterforce options will be totally successful. The difficulties
in locating and destroying mobile missiles were vividly
demonstrated during the Gulf War. While not designed primarily to
intercept SCUD-type missiles, the Patriot missile deployed to the
Gulf did provide important psychological and political benefits
in the prosecution of the war. From that experience, it became
more apparent that effective active defenses against nuclear,
biological, or chemical weapons would be an important
consideration in future regional conflicts, for both military and
political reasons.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Longer-range active-defense missiles, such as the Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), will enable warheads to be
intercepted at ever greater ranges. This is particularly
important for defense against NBC warheads, because destroying
them close to the intended target may not significantly reduce
exposure to the agents they carry. The farther from the target
that active missile defense systems can intercept an incoming
warhead, the less the chance that the agent will affect friendly
troops or territory. A near-miss with an NBC warhead might still
do considerable damage to U.S. or coalition forces, or to
civilian populations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As proliferant states acquire longer-range missiles and NBC
weapons, they could also acquire the ability to threaten U.S.
territory. If the United States is seen to lack the means to
defend its territory against proliferant states, it could
undermine Washington's freedom to act in future crises. A debate
continues in the United States about how much and what kind of
active defenses to pursue. The Gulf War experience convinced the
U.S. defense community of the military and political utility of
having an effective theater ballistic-missile defense (TMD); a
consensus to develop TMD clearly exists. However, no such
consensus exists with regard to the merits of a national missile
defense (NMD) system to protect the United States itself. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The NMD debate centers on two key points: first, the character
and timing of the threat (that is, how long it will be before any
NBC-armed adversary has the ability to launch such weapons by
ballistic missile against the United States); and, secondly, the
effect an NMD would have on the ABM Treaty and, in turn, U.S.
relations with Russia. As of late 1995, the Clinton
administration continued to affirm U.S. support for the ABM
Treaty and maintain that technological development programs
provided a sufficient hedge against future long-range missile
threats to U.S. territory. However, Republican congressional
leaders were increasingly questioning the ABM Treaty's continued
relevance in a post-Cold War environment of widespread
proliferation, and many urged the development for deployment of a
national missile defense. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">Passive Defense</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Passive defense seeks to provide protection for U.S. and allied
forces against an NBC attack. It can take many forms, from
protective uniforms and masks to equipment incorporated into
larger systems (such as entire naval vessels or air-base command
centers) that enable them to operate in chemical, biological,
and, in limited aspects, some nuclear environments. Passive
defense includes detection and identification of NBC agents,
medical response to NBC effects, and decontamination of equipment
and facilities. Many analysts believe that a strong
passive-defense capability serves as a deterrent, discouraging
use of WMD by an adversary who knows that U.S. forces are able to
operate in chemical and biological environments.<hr>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the Cold War, passive-defense measures against chemical
attack were taken seriously, especially by NATO forces in Europe.
The massive Soviet threat to Europe included a threat of
biological and chemical attack, and NATO forces were required to
train to operate in such an environment. NATO's strategy included
the option of a response in kind--that is, the use of chemical
weapons against an attacker who had already employed them. A
credible response in kind was contingent upon the ability of
NATO's own forces to operate in a chemical environment. As with
many Cold War situations, preparing for a massive Soviet attack
against Europe provided the necessary training and equipment to
fight in lesser contingencies where passive defense against
chemical attack might be required. However, the U.S. Army prefers
to avoid undertaking prolonged operations in protective chemical
gear, owing to the severe limits such equipment places on
effectiveness. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Following the Cold War, a number of circumstances have arisen
that underscore the need for effective passive-defense equipment,
including protective masks and suits. First, the spread of
biological and chemical capabilities means that U.S. forces must
be prepared to operate in a WMD environment worldwide. Secondly,
since the threat is no longer localized in the relatively benign
operating climate of Europe, the possibility of having to operate
in chemical gear under harsher climatological conditions has
increased. Thirdly, the CWC's requirement that all chemical
stockpiles be destroyed within ten years of the treaty's
ratification will, if ratified by the United States, preclude any
possibility of Washington's threatening an in-kind response to
the use of chemical weapons against U.S. forces. In the face of a
proliferator armed with chemical or biological weapons, this
inability to threaten response in kind may weaken deterrence and,
in so doing, increase the chances that an adversary will use
chemical weapons.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Robust passive-defense capabilities are key to operating without
a significant loss in effectiveness in a BW or CW environment.
Actions by the Department of Defense to improve chemical- and
biological-defense capabilities include the integration of
separate service programs into a consolidated DOD
Chemical/Biological Defense Program. The goal of this program is
to enhance the ability of U.S. forces to defend against BW and CW
agents by developing and procuring the capabilities to avoid
contamination (through adequate detection and
warning/reconnaissance), protect forces (through individual and
collective protective gear and adequate medical support), and
improve decontamination measures.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the future, U.S. forces must be prepared to operate in the
presence of chemical and biological agents in an ever widening
variety of contingencies. The ease with which chemical and
biological agents can be manufactured and delivered means that
these threats may be present even in peacekeeping operations.
Despite advances, operating in chemical gear continues to place
great physical and psychological stress on individual soldiers
and units. The possibility that U.S. forces will be called upon
to operate in the presence of an NBC threat means that continued
improvements in individual protection equipment are necessary.

operate as part of a

military impact of NBC weapons on coalition cohesion. In the

alone to have adequate protective equipment. An adversary might
exploit gaps in the passive-defense capabilities of coalition
partners, thereby undermining coalition cohesion and posing acute
problems for political leaders and military commanders alike.
Furthermore, in some situations, the issue of protection for
civilians could become important--not just politically but also
operationally. In many instances, for example, a largely civilian
work force will be needed to maintain capabilities at ports and
airfields. The absence of adequate personal protection for
civilian workers will result in a degradation of operational
capabilities, and may lead to deterioration in the political
climate.
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead7">Conclusions</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An ideal tool for national-security strategy combines two
attributes. First, it should contribute to the deterrence of war.
Deterrence remains the first line of defense against the use of
nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Secondly, should
deterrence fail, a useful military instrument must contribute to
the successful prosecution of war by denying the enemy the
ability to achieve its objectives--even if that enemy does resort
to the use of NBC weapons.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The counterproliferation tools described above hold the promise
of fulfilling these two requirements. To the extent that an enemy
realizes the United States maintains the abilities to neutralize
(or at least minimize the damage inflicted by) NBC weapons and to
respond effectively to their use, counterproliferation tools may
deter an enemy from aggression. This is termed "deterrence by
denial." If an adversary knows that possession or even use of NBC
weapons will not intimidate or defeat U.S. forces, the chances of
that adversary's employing NBC weapons--or, indeed, engaging U.S.
forces in the first place--will be reduced. However, if
deterrence fails, the ability of U.S. forces to operate in an NBC
environment and respond decisively to NBC use will be crucial to
success. Thus, maintaining adequate capabilities across the full
range of counterproliferation tools--passive defense,
counterforce capabilities, active defense, and nuclear
deterrence--is simultaneously the best deterrent and the best way
to minimize damage should deterrence fail.

limited power to dissuade or deny those intent on achieving WMD
capability. Chemical and biological weapons are relatively cheap
and easy to acquire. A state determined to acquire them--or even
nuclear weapons--can do so, given sufficient resources, time, and
effort. Barriers to NBC possession and use are eroding. A number
of nations seem intent on acquiring NBC weapons, despite efforts
to codify international norms against possession of such weapons.
The reasons are complex, but a growing number of states evidently
see concrete warfighting utility in such weapons. For example,
even though chemical weapons were used in the Iran-Iraq War, 
international condemnation was subdued.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The United States must strive to make deterrence as credible as
possible. Achieving credible deterrence of NBC use in regional
conflicts is a complex and uncertain task; nuclear weapons are
necessary but not sufficient. Establishing and maintaining a
credible deterrent against NBC use in regional conflicts will
also require the ability to operate and prevail with conventional
forces in an NBC environment. Achieving deterrence by denial will
require continued attention to gaps in operational capabilities.
The armed services will increasingly need to pay close attention
to the consequences of WMD use against U.S. and coalition forces
in regional conflicts, and to the imperatives of operating in an
NBC environment. The use, or threat of use, of such weapons will
have far-reaching consequences on both the tactical and strategic
character of the conflict.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Coalition warfare may be particularly affected by the use or
threatened use of NBC weapons. A coalition will not be
politically sustainable if some members are significantly more
vulnerable to NBC attack than others. In addition, a coalition
might not be sustainable if it cannot protect the citizens of a
coalition country from NBC attack.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Proliferation will place additional strains on intelligence
requirements. The potentially severe effects of NBC use against
U.S. forces will require that increased intelligence resources be
devoted to identifying and analyzing the NBC capabilities of
potential adversaries on a real-time basis. The consequences of
failing to completely identify NBC targets could impose a heavy
penalty on U.S. forces operating in the region. The demand for
timely and accurate intelligence on enemy NBC capabilities and
readiness will only increase in the years ahead.

<HR>
</h2></center>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the post-Cold War world, there has been a considerable
alteration of the instruments of U.S. power, that is, the means
available to the U.S. government to influence the behavior of
other governments. In part because of stricter resource
constraints and in part because the threats have changed, some of
the mainstays of the policy of containment during the Cold
War--such as the strategic nuclear forces and foreign aid--are
becoming less central. At the same time, the U.S. government is
developing a more diverse set of tools, taking advantage of
profound changes in the world setting.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We begin our analysis of the post-Cold War instruments of U.S.
power by analyzing how the world is changing from the perspective
of U.S. security interests. Then we discuss the instruments of
U.S. power, starting with those that use persuasion rather than
force and proceeding to those that require progressively greater
use of force. Using this principle, we arrange the instruments of
U.S. power into three groups: non-military instruments,
political-military instruments, and warfighting instruments. This
arrangement emphasizes the traditional national security issues,
not because we wish to slight environmental security or economic
security but because, as analysts of the National Defense
University, we have decided to concentrate on the areas we know
best. 
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead1">The Post-Cold War
World</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The present world situation is characterized by its rapid pace of
change. The world is undergoing three changes so sweeping that
they may deserve to be called revolutions. A common
characteristic of all three revolutions is that they make the
world a more diverse place. Although this expanding diversity
requires a more eclectic foreign policy approach, it also makes
possible a wider variety of ways for the United States to work
its will.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Geostrategic Revolution.</i> Most apparent to analysts of
international affairs are the geostrategic changes, which have
several dimensions. With regard to relations among the major
powers--which have historically been the main element in world
politics--the long superpower confrontation during the Cold War
is being replaced by a world of asymmetrical poles in which one
(the U.S.) is much the strongest. The others powers,
nevertheless, are important actors: the world has not become
unipolar, as some imagined in the first moments after the Cold
War. In the first blush of enthusiasm at the end of the Cold War,
the great powers were all cooperating. Now, relations among some
are cooler, and differences of perspective have become more
pronounced. The hopes for a new strategic relationship between
the U.S. and Russia are fading; Russia is feeling isolated and
bitter about what is sees as others taking advantage of its
temporary difficulties. China is feeling more powerful because of
its spectacular economic growth; sometimes it acts like a normal
player in international affairs, and sometimes it acts like the
stereotype of the Middle Kingdom--not well informed about other
states and assuming that it has a natural right to what it wants.
<p><b>International Affairs Budget Authority</b><p>

Concurrent Resolution for Fiscal Year 1996.  All data refer to
fiscal years.<p>Note: The FY-93 spike in international affairs
funding was due to an IMF quota increase.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another aspect of the global geostrategic scene has been the
triumph of the idea of market democracy. While not always
practiced, it is nearly universally regarded as the best way to
run society. From this perspective, the world can be divided into
three categories of states: those successful at implementing the
goal of market democracy, those in transition from
authoritarianism towards that goal (but at risk of becoming
frozen with politicized economies and partially free political
systems), and those troubled states that are falling further
behind the rest of the world while in many cases struggling with
ethnic and religious extremism. Some rogue states from among the
troubled or transitional nations may be tempted to divert
attention from domestic problems with external aggression aimed
at establishing regional hegemony. The proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, could make
particularly dangerous a major regional conflict with such a
rogue state. At the same time, conflicts within troubled states
are likely to be as frequent, and in some cases, those states
will fail--their governments will cease to function effectively,
and civil society will degenerate into near chaos. The U.S. will
have neither the means nor the will to intervene in every such
case, but it will conduct humanitarian and peace operations in
areas of its historic and strategic interest as well as in
situations of horrendous suffering that offend U.S.
sensibilities. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps the most novel feature of the geostrategic scene has been
the explosion of transnational problems, that is, problems that
cross borders but do not stem from the action of governments.
International crime, terrorism, sudden mass migrations, and
environmental threats are not susceptible to the traditional
tools of statecraft designed for relations among sovereign
governments. <hr><blockquote><b>Reductions in Defense and
International Affairs Funding From 1985 through 1996</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In FY 1985-95, there was a sharp decline in national defense
funding, that is, in the 050 account in the federal budget, which
includes nearly all the DOD budget as well as defense-related
expenditures by other agencies, mostly the Department of Energy.
In FY 1996 dollars, the 050 account budget authority declined
from $412 billion in 1985 to $271 billion in 1995, a 34 percent
reduction. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The largest reduction ($90 billion out of the total reduction of
$141 billion) was in procurement, which fell by 64 percent. In FY
1995, the Army bought no new tanks and the Navy bought four
ships; the services are operating with the large equipment stock
bought during the 1980s buildup. Obviously, this is not a
sustainable long-term procurement level, and so five-year plans
include an eventual upturn in procurement, which will place
further pressure on the budget.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the widespread impression that the FY 1996 national
defense budget grew, in fact, despite the $7 billion added by
Congress to the Clinton administration budget request, budget
authority in real terms shrank by 2 percent between FY 1995 and
FY 1996.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The international affairs budget also dropped sharply in 1985-95.
In constant 1996 dollars, the international affairs budget (the
150 account) fell 46 percent, from $37 billion to $20 billion,
over that time. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, the reduction was heavily concentrated in international
security assistance (account 151), which went from $19 billion to
$5 billion at 1996 prices, a 74 percent reduction. Between 1985
and 1995, the budget for all other international affairs items
went from $18 billion to $15 billion (at 1996 prices). The budget
for the conduct of foreign affairs and for foreign information
and exchange programs actually increased in real terms. But the
increase was modest, and the burden of work grew as the number of
countries rose and as the world became a more complex
place.</blockquote><hr>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Information Revolution.</i> Information technology has been
improving
roughly tenfold every five years, an unprecedented rate of
change. Computers, faxes, fiber optic cables, and satellites
speed the flow of information across frontiers, reinforcing the
political trend towards increasingly open societies. No one can
foretell all the ways in which information technologies will
change traditional venues of national power, but certain useful
themes are beginning to emerge. One is that access to information
technology has become a prerequisite for economic growth, at
least in developed countries. Another is that the ubiquity of
global communication is creating new avenues for the interests,
cultures, and values of the United States to radiate overseas,
and vice versa. Yet another is that the extension of rapid
communication and computer technological advances to the
battlefield may make information-based warfare possible within a
decade or two.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Revolution in Government. After decades of increasing state
involvement in many areas of society in most countries, central
governments have been on the retreat recently. Power is
devolving: whether in Russia, the United States, the European
Union or China, central governments are ceding more authority to
regional and local governments. Central governments are also
shedding functions, partly to reduce expenditures and contain
budget deficits. Governments are also privatizing state
enterprises, in line with the general mood that reliance on free
markets is the way to boost growth. The power of international
business has increased relative to that of governments. However,
this shift may not diminish the ability of governments to
mobilize resources to support perceived vital national interests,
for instance, during wartime. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A phenomenon related to the decline of central governments has
been less concern about the projection of national power abroad
and more concern about domestic issues, especially the economy.
In many countries, the argument is heard that only a strong
economic base can provide the foundation for an active
international role.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the United States, the new focus on domestic issues has caused
a decline in the resources available for foreign policy
instruments. Between fiscal years 1985 and 1995, in real terms,
funding for national defense fell 34 percent, and funding for
international affairs fell 46 percent (referring respectively to
the 050 and 150 accounts in the federal budget). The drop in
international affairs funding was primarily in military aid;
other international affairs funding fell 17 percent in real terms
over the decade.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both the Clinton and Congressional projections for defense and
international affairs spending show continued reductions in real
terms between 1996 and 2000. For national defense, the two agree
on a 7 percent reduction. For international affairs, the Clinton
budget projects a 23 percent reduction, while the Congressional
concurrent resolution projects a 43 percent cut. Furthermore, the
pressure for balancing the budget while protecting many domestic
programs may push reductions for national security above the
levels projected by either the administration or Congress. The
lower resource levels will pose a serious challenge for exerting
U.S. influence at the level of leadership, and over the full
range of issues, that U.S. interests require and that the
American public has come to expect.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Implications for the U.S.</i> If the essential characteristics
of the
present strategic environment are uncertainty and change,
historical experience suggests that the new world system may be
more malleable now than it will be in a few years. International
systems typically have had a life cycle in which the relations
among the major powers start out flexible then become more rigid.
The way in which the system is shaped tends to determine whether
the major powers remain at peace. If past experience is
replicated, then there is some urgency to focusing on
international affairs now--to resolving the domestic debates
about what the U.S. wants from the new world order and to
maximizing the instruments of national power available to U.S.
policymakers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Three implications can be drawn from the new world situation for
the instruments of U.S. power:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* A broader array of tools is needed to respond to the more
diverse problems in the new geostrategic setting. The tools
needed to strengthen market democracy are not necessarily the
same as those required to deter rogues. Other tools are needed to
deal with failed states, and yet others again to respond to
transnational problems.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* Washington needs to stay on top of the information revolution
as it changes established institutions and procedures. For
instance, the world communications web brings an instant and
increasing flow of news. Should Washington react passively, its
agenda will be set by what is on the television screen, but if
Washington changes with the times, it can use its direct access
to world publics to influence events more quickly and surely than
ever. Similarly, if the revolution in military technology from
the information explosion is integrated into a new way of
conducting warfare--a revolution in military affairs--then the
U.S. can increase its domination of the battlefield. If the U.S.
remains passive, however, then it could become vulnerable to a
mid-sized power that uses information warfare to disrupt the
information networks on which the U.S. depends.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* There are greater opportunities and more necessity for
Washington to leverage its power. In the past, such leverage came
primarily through allied governments. Now, other institutions are
increasingly important. Private voluntary organizations (PVOs)
provide humanitarian relief more effectively than do governments.
Sometimes an eminent private individual can explore what a rogue
government is prepared to do to cut a deal, without Washington
having to provide the rogue the legitimacy that would come from
direct contact. Private business, acting for its own interests
without direction from Washington, can often be used to advance
U.S. goals, as when investors stimulate economic growth that
reinforces market democracy or that cements a fragile peace. 
<hr><blockquote><b>The Prospects for National Defense and
International Affairs Funding in FY 1997-2000</b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The congressional concurrent resolution on the FY 1966 budget and
the FY 1996 Clinton administration budget both present forecast
for spending through at least FY 2000 plan, showing the overall
government total and the amounts for each budget category,
including nationla defense (account 050) and international
affairs (account 150). 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both plans call for national defense budget authority to be
reduced by 7 percent in real terms by FY 2000 from the FY 1996
level. The Clinton administration budget provided detailed
breakdown of its spending plans by category. Under those plans,
further reductions in personnel are programmed in order to pay
for increased procurement. Despite the increase, procurement will
remain significantly below the steady-state replacement rate,
that is, the average age of major systems will continue to
increase. In other words, it may be difficult to sustain the
planned force levels with the resources programmed for defense. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For international affairs, the FY 1996 Clinton administration
budget plan programmed a five-year reduction of 23 percent in
real terms, while the congressional concurrent resolution on the
FY 1996 budget called for a cut of 43 percent at constant prices.
That would bring the international affairs budget (at 1996
prices) in 2000 to either 58 percent or 69 percent below that of
1985, depending on whether the administration or congressional
plan is adapted. In late 1995, a compromise funding level between
the two plans was agreed to by the administration and Senator
Helms (R-North Carolina).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Any of these plans for reduction will be a great challenge to
absorb. It will be difficult to maintain much of a foreign aid
program, especially if contributions to multilateral institutions
and aid to Israel and Egypt are sustained at anything like
current levels. At the same time, the reduced international
affairs spending will not have much effect on the overall
deficit. All spending on international affairs is less than 2
percent of the overall government budget. The reduction--the
allocation in 2000 would be $4.6 billion less than in 1995 under
the Clinton plan and $8.7 billion less under the Congressional
plan--will be small relative to the size of the $190 billion FY
1996 federal deficit. While much of the reduction may come from
the foreign aid budget, there is also strong congressional
pressure to cut the budgets of State, USAID, ACDA, and USIA as
well as to combine some or all of those agencies. Under both
congressional and administration budget plans, the U.S. will
remain in arrears to the U.N. throughout the rest of the decade.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both the Clinton and congressional plans would mean tight
resource constraints for national security. And the situation
could get worse, because of the pressure for balancing the
budget. Both political parties want the budget balanced. The
Republicans want a large tax cut. The Democrats want to protect
spending on programs like health, education, and the environment.
It will be difficult to achieve that combination of goals, unless
the economic situation is particularly favorable, with low
interest rates to cut the cost of servicing the national debt and
rapid economic growth to raise revenue and keep down the cost of
programs like unemployment insurance and welfare.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the budget is to be balanced while taxes are cut and spending
on health, education, and the environment is protected, and if
the economy performs at the historic average rather than
exceptionally well, then it will be necessary to make further
cuts in other spending categories. The great unknown is what will
happen to health care costs and to other entitlement programs.
Perhaps savings will be made, through more efficient programs and
changes in the way benefits are increased as the consumer price
index rises. Besides those programs, defense spending is one of
the few large items available to cut. Therefore, it could well be
reduced below the current agreed level. A prudent national
security planner will include in his scenarios one in which
budgets are reduced appreciably more than presently planned. The
fact that the President and Congress agreed in the FY 1996 budget
on a forecast level of defense spending for 2000 does not by any
means assure that those resources will actually be made available
when 2000 arrives.</blockquote><hr>
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead2">Adapting the Instruments of
U.S. Power to the New Situation</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the changes in the instruments in U.S. power have generally
been motivated by the evolution of the world setting--the
revolutions in geostrategy, information technology, and the
character of government--much has occurred because of conscious
decisions by the U.S. government to reinvent the ways it does
business. As the goals of U.S. foreign policy have become more
varied since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. government has
relied on a wider array of non-military instruments, including
more vigorous use of some instruments that had been at most of
secondary utility during the Cold War. At the same time,
Washington has implemented innovations designed to reduce costs,
taking advantage of changing circumstances to shed functions or
institutions no longer needed while making more use of new
opportunities. 
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead3">Non-military instruments
</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Diplomacy.</i> In the more fluid situation of the mid-and-late
1990s,
the emphasis in diplomatic techniques is shifting from formal
procedures, such as large semi-permanent negotiating delegations,
to more ad hoc arrangements, such as contact groups, special
envoys, shuttle diplomacy and liaison offices. The U.S. is also
learning how to use to its advantage private and quasi-private
diplomacy, such as former President Carter's 1994 missions to
North Korea and Haiti. Instruments like recognition policy are
being redefined, as in the case of using recognition as an
inducement to encourage progress by Vietnam and North Korea (on
POW/MIAs and nuclear non-proliferation, respectively). At the
same time, much is being done to stretch dollars further. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is new stress in the State Department: resources are
declining; ambassadorial appointees sit idle for months owing to
disputes between the administration and Congress; and the work
load is growing as the number of countries and international
crises increases. In this context, consideration is being given
to organizational changes to a diplomatic structure that was
created to serve the needs of a different time. One example of a
change under way is the greater presence abroad of a wide array
of U.S. government agencies: embassies have become less
exclusively State Department preserves and more the locations for
interagency functions under the looser leadership of the
ambassador.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b> A U.S. Marine CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter prepares to insert
troops at Hat Yao, Thailand during Exercise Cobra Gold
'95</b><p><img src="ch1703.gif" align="left"><i>Public
Diplomacy.</i> The ideology upheld by the U.S. during the Cold
War--that of freedom, democracy, and the market--has triumphed
worldwide in the realm of ideas, though it has not fully
translated into practice in many transitional or troubled states.
The role of public diplomacy is therefore evolving from the
battle to win minds for the Free World to persuading foreign
governments and publics to support more specific U.S. policies.
In this task, the principal U.S. organization is the U.S.
Information Agency (USIA), although there is increasing foreign
attention to statements designed primarily for domestic audiences
issued by spokesmen throughout the government. In a world
saturated with information, the challenge for public diplomacy is
how to communicate more effectively by enhancing and
supplementing the increasing commercial information flow. USIA is
becoming less a direct supplier of information and more of an
organizer of the information. While the information revolution
has made American television shows, movies, music, and brand
names more pervasive, that does not necessarily translate into
support for U.S. government policies. The direct government
programs so important in the past, from radio broadcasts to
cultural exchanges, are being refocused on those areas that
private sector activity does not reach adequately. Meanwhile,
Washington has stepped up its efforts to promote democracy, both
through existing institutions like USAID and by relatively new
quasi-governmental organizations like the National Endowment for
Democracy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>International Organizations.</i> Despite new concerns about
multilateralism, the U.S. government is using international
organizations and private voluntary organizations more often and
in more varied ways to accomplish tasks that during the Cold War
it might have done directly itself. The U.S. military has been
working more directly with these organizations in places like
Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, and Bosnia. That has required both sides
to adapt, given the considerable differences in organizational
culture and approach (e.g., a command structure compared to a web
of independent actors reliant on consensus-building). Contrast
the close coordination between the U.S. military and PVOs in
Bosnia with the distant and at times hostile relations in Vietnam
a generation earlier. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Washington not only uses international organizations to address
humanitarian concerns in disasters and genocidal ethnic strife,
but also to mitigate the military threat to vital U.S. national
interests from rogue states. In both of the most likely
candidates for a major regional contingency, North Korea and
Iraq, U.N. agencies were indispensable for verifying agreements
about weapons of mass destruction, whereas during the Cold War,
arms control agreements were generally verified by the U.S.
directly. International Atomic Energy Agency on-the-ground
inspections and, in Iraq, U.N. Special Commision-supervised
destruction of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) facilities
show how important multilateral organizations can be for U.S.
national security. At the same time, U.S. support for
international organizations has been weakened since the immediate
post-Cold War enthusiasm by continuing problems of bureaucratic
inertia, wasteful spending, limited capabilities, and unmet
(albeit exaggerated) expectations. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Economics.</i> As in other fields, the trend is away from use
of U.S.
budget resources. So foreign aid is moving from direct bilateral
budget assistance to new ways to mobilize resources for vital
national purposes: consortia of concerned states, as for North
Korea; international financial institutions, as for Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union; and tapping largely dormant
U.S. government resources, as with the use of the Exchange
Stabilization Fund to lend $20 billion to Mexico. But the larger
story is that as security threats have declined, Washington has
used existing economic instruments (like trade retaliation) more
vigorously against allies, which may endanger alliances in the
long term. All too often, however, economic instruments have
little effect, in part because the U.S. is not committing
sufficient resources to make an instrument like foreign aid more
effective. In other cases, economic instruments have too much
effect collaterally, that is, they have such broad effects that
they inflict unacceptable political damage, as when the prospect
of withdrawing most-favored nation status from China over human
rights problems resulted in deterioration of relations across the
board. When the U.S. is prepared to inflict heavy collateral
damage, then a coercive economic instrument like sanctions can
have noticeable effects over time. Witness how sanctions have
weakened Iraq's ability to threaten its neighbors and encouraged
Serbia to reduce support for ethnic Serb forces in Croatia and
Bosnia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Intelligence.</i> With the end of the pressing need to focus
on the
activities of the former Soviet Union, the targets of
intelligence activities have become more diffuse. Debate
continues about what intelligence is most needed and which
activities are most appropriate for secret government analysis.
For instance, a host of ethical and methodological questions have
arisen over the possibility of the intelligence community sharing
information with U.S. business. To collect data on issues like
regional conflicts and transnational problems, intelligence
satellites are being given a broader range of capabilities and
are being used publicly, for example to demonstrate war crimes in
Bosnia. In many areas where policymakers want information, the
information explosion has brought forth a vast amount of
open-source data. By some estimates, 80 percent of the
information used by the intelligence community comes from open
sources. Policymakers are likely to get their first news on
fast-breaking developments from CNN. The intelligence community
is therefore devoting more attention to what its consumers want
and how best to package and deliver it. Higher priority is given
to analysis of the vast flow of information available, and less
to the collection of data. Also, more attention is being given to
meeting the needs of military commanders for timely intelligence
attuned to the battlefield situations facing operational
commanders.

instruments</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Productive and Technological Base.</i> Little attention is
being
devoted to the Cold War concerns about industrial mobilization
and maintaining an engineering lead (e.g., in aircraft engines or
tank armor). Partly that is because of the changed political
environment, but perhaps more important is the swelling "third
wave" that is making information technology the center of
economic growth. Contrary to concerns that U.S. productive and
technological power is on the decline, the U.S. is in fact the
world leader in information technology, especially in the
increasingly important software area. U.S. technological and
productive might is as powerful an instrument for Washington as
it has ever been. To be sure, the way that power will be applied
to defense production is changing. More of the research at the
cutting edge of technology is being done by the private sector
and less by the government. Defense will increasingly piggyback
on commercial developments rather than drive technology forward.
As more funds go into electronics and as the production of major
battle platforms (planes, ships, tanks) shrinks, more
collaboration among firms, including with foreign firms, will be
necessary to ensure the survival of the core capabilities, such
as the ability to build aircraft carriers or nuclear submarines. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Arms control. </i>Despite the end of the Cold War, Russia
remains
indispensable to successful arms control. The issues on which
Russia's support is vital include working out new arrangements
for European security to supplement the Treaty on Conventional
Armed Forces in Europe (CFE); solidifying the still-forming
system for control of dangerous arms and dual-use technologies;
and dismantling the Cold War nuclear weapons legacy, including
the cooperative threat reduction program for greater security of
nuclear material so as to forestall proliferation dangers. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the same time, the focus of arms control has shifted from the
Cold War concentration on Soviet missiles. The new priority is on
nonproliferation of NBC weapons and missiles, building on the
1995 success in securing the indefinite extension of the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Mutually
reinforcing arms control measures such as nuclear-weapons-free
zones, a comprehensive test ban treaty, and a fissile-material
production-cutoff treaty hold promise for strengthening the
international non-proliferation regime. Meanwhile, the model of
conventional arms control and confidence-building measures
implemented with the former Warsaw Pact in the last years of the
Cold War hold promise for application in other strife-torn areas
of the world, such as Bosnia, Northeast Asia or the Levant.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>U.S. Forces take control of Haiti's International airport,
1994</b><p><img src="ch1704.gif" align="left"><i>Defense
Engagement in Peacetime.</i> Cold War interaction with
foreign militaries, other than alliance partners, often meant
providing developing countries with equipment at favorable
prices, so as to shore up their ability to meet potential
Soviet-inspired subversion or outright aggression. By contrast,
the 1990s have seen a drop in arms deliveries, especially those
with an aid component but also sales on commercial terms; even
the large post-Desert Storm agreements with Gulf Arab states have
not translated into larger deliveries. The focus of defense
engagement has changed to foreign military interaction, such as
professional education and combined military exercises, and
high-level defense diplomacy, such as quasi-diplomatic trips by
the regional commanders-in-chief. Engagement by the Defense
Department has broadened to cover nearly all armed forces in the
world, including military-military contacts with governments
leery of U.S. security policy objectives. At the same time that
more efforts are being made and countries involved, there has
been a drawdown in the number of soldiers with foreign-area
expertise, as well as a reduction in the number of units most
likely to participate in foreign military interaction programs
(e.g., engineers, military police, and medical units). The
challenge is to find ways to use the declining resource more
effectively and innovatively than ever before.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Security Relationships and Overseas Presence.</i> The core of
U.S.
security policy during the Cold War was its alliances, especially
NATO, for collective defense against the pressing common external
threat from the Soviet Union. Post-Cold War, the role of the
alliances is shifting to becoming the cornerstone (politically
and militarily) around which ad hoc coalitions can be formed.
Such coalitions are, for the foreseeable future, the likely way
in which the U.S. will fight in major conflicts. NATO's combined
joint task force (CJTF) concept is the most telling example of
the new role of alliances; the delays in implementing the CJTF
illustrate the difficulty in re-directing Cold War institutions
toward future requirements, even where there is a clear military
utility (in this case, for crisis response beyond NATO's
borders). While alliances like NATO provide the military nucleus
for an ad hoc coalition, there may well be political utility in
including a large number of states, even if many bring little
value added to the military force. The coalitions may include
uncertain partners, which can require a delicate balancing of the
issues on which Washington agrees with that partner compared to
differences on other matters, e.g., ensuring the Pakistani forces
in Somalia are well equipped to replace U.S. forces there, but at
the same time not weakening the military aid restrictions that
pressure Pakistan to roll back its nuclear weapons program. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile, as force structure declines and support (at home and
in the host countries) for large overseas bases becomes more open
to question, the importance of the growing dependence on
pre-positioned equipment ashore and afloat will continue to rise.
[and there may be a place for new approaches such as mobile
offshore bases.] A major issue for sustaining the U.S. existing
structure of alliances will be finding ways to strengthen their
security components irrespective of differences on trade issues,
which are likely to be an area of vigorous disagreement.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Peace Operations and Humanitarian Support. </i>The typical
Cold War
peace operation was patrolling a ceasefire line. With the end of
the superpower rivalry, peacekeeping operations have generally
focused on resolving internal conflicts within states rather than
cross-border aggression. The missions are thus more complicated
and more controversial, since there is less control over armed
elements and, in some cases, virtually no organized government
with which to work. The most critical elements to the success of
complex peace operations can be getting right the mix of
responsibilities between the U.S. military and civilian agencies
and PVOs, as well as coordinating actions in the field. In the
more complicated settings, U.S. military involvement can make the
difference between success and failure, because of the special
skills the U.S. military brings, from C3I to special operations
(including civil affairs and psychological operations), and
because of its overall leadership and managerial capabilities.
While recognizing its vital role, Washington resists the
assumption that it will automatically assume a dominant role in
every such situation, preferring instead to concentrate on how to
enhance prospects for success with limited U.S. participation.
The record of success is mixed at best in operations in the
absence of a peace accord where the peace force is seen as either
ambivalent or an antagonist, that is, in expanded peacekeeping
and peace enforcement. The problem is to contain or end the
fighting without becoming a party to the conflict and without
assuming responsibility for nation-building afterwards. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prognosis for expanded peacekeeping and peace enforcement is
uncertain. By its own account, the United Nations lacks the
capacity to manage these ambitious missions, which means that
they are only likely to occur where Washington opts to lead a
coalition to undertake the action.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead5">War-fighting instruments
</a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Unconventional Military Instruments.</i> Unconventional
threats to
national security challenge U.S. interests through indirect means
such as terrorism, subversion, narcotics trafficking, and massive
sudden refugee flows. Some of these threats are a useful way for
the weak to attack the strong. Lately, they have become more
salient, both because of the demise of the Soviet Union and the
trend towards a more open world economy and freer movement of
people. Ultimately, regional powers intent on systematically
challenging U.S. interests may sponsor or organize the most
serious unconventional threats. The responses to meet these
threats will include an enhanced role abroad for U.S. law
enforcement agencies, e.g., the FBI in counterterrorism, the DEA
in counternarcotics, and the INS in enforcing restrictions on
massive immigration flows. In some cases, the military may be
called upon to assist with these law enforcement functions
abroad, e.g., in drug interdiction. Unconventional military
responses, such as Special Operations Forces (SOF) can broaden
the range of options open to decision makers reluctant to resort
to higher cost military measures, and they can minimize the
collateral damage associated with more destructive measures.
Nevertheless, the unconventional instruments are politically
sensitive and hard to manage. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Limited Military Interventions. </i>In some ways, the new
environment
is seeing a return to the pre-Cold War experience. For instance,
the use of limited air strikes to force a government to change
its behavior, such as the 1995 strikes against Serbian forces in
Bosnia, is the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy, and the
enforcement of sanctions bears considerable similarity to the old
practice of laying siege. During the Cold War, insurgencies were
generally ideological, and the U.S. usually openly supported one
side. Now, insurgencies and civil wars are more often between
ethnic groups, and the U.S. goal is peace between the two sides,
one of which controls the internationally recognized government.
While interethnic conflicts are becoming more frequent, the U.S.
public may not support involvement in many such cases, since
those conflicts often occur in areas where narrowly conceived
U.S. geostrategic interests are slight, though the challenge to
U.S. values (such as revulsion against genocide) may be high.
Where the U.S. does become involved, its goals will usually be
limited, e.g., to stopping genocide. In light of the experiences
with the U.N., especially in Somalia and Bosnia, a decision to
intervene will depend crucially upon clear military objectives,
acceptable arrangements for command and control, the willingness
of like-minded nations to contribute, and judgments about the
necessary duration and costs of the operation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>F-22 Fighter</b><p><img src="ch1702.gif"
align="left"><i>Classical Military Instruments.</i> While U.S.
forces are far more
capable than any conceivable adversary, parts of the U.S.
military (specifically, U.S. lift capacity) would be strained in
the event of two nearly simultaneous major regional
contingencies. Also, with the overseas presence of U.S. ground
and air forces reduced by about 50 percent between 1986 and 1995,
there is less margin for error in deciding where to deploy the
remaining forces. And given that major equipment typically lasts
decades and that relatively little is being procured, the U.S.
equipment will for the foreseeable future be items designed for
use against the Soviet Union, which will have to be adapted for
use in new types of warfare for which they may or may not be most
appropriate. But perhaps more important than new equipment is new
doctrine, that is, knowing how best to fight. Substantial
progress has been made in refining doctrine since the end of the
Cold War. The service departments have published their analyses
of how best to reorient their activities for the new strategic
environment, in their respective reports: the Army's Force XXI,
the Navy's Forward...From the Sea, and the Air Force's Global
Presence. The military as a whole is placing more emphasis on
multi-service (joint) operations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A challenge for the U.S. armed forces--one that requires
particular consideration--is that they may be confronted with
innovative warfare techniques and employment strategies
specifically tailored to exploit U.S. weaknesses and geographic
constraints. A nation, for example, could choose to avoid
challenging the U.S. in classical conventional battle by using or
threatening to use weapons of mass destruction, sabotaging key
automated information networks, or resorting to terrorism and
guerrilla warfare tactics.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Emerging Military Instruments.</i> Information technology
provides
the best opportunity for the U.S. armed forces to develop new
instruments of military power over the medium term. But to take
full advantage of the incorporation of advanced capabilities in
new equipment (a military technological revolution), new
operational procedures and organizations are needed (a revolution
in military affairs). The U.S. is on the verge of integrating the
various systems--forming what has been called a "system of
systems". This super-system would be capable of seeing all
relevant enemy assets on the battlefield ("dominant battlefied
knowledge," in the jargon of the trade), communicating this
information almost instantly to combat units, and striking at
these targets with unprecedented accuracy. With insightful
leadership and hard work, these instruments will allow the U.S.
to exercise a high degree of control over the emerging global
security structure through a unique ability to intervene anywhere
in the world quickly, effectively, and at relatively low cost, as
well as to strike simultaneously at targets far distant from one
another. In some cases, that intervention will be done directly
by U.S. forces, whereas in other cases, the U.S. may be able to
achieve the same results by providing its allies with real-time
intelligence, systems expertise, and other software.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One caution is that the ability to use effectively the emerging
military instruments will require serious attention to the
protection of military information systems and critical civilian
systems, to avoid retaliation in cyberspace. There is
considerable interest in how the U.S. might conduct information
war, for instance, against an opponents' communication system.
But it is not apparent how vulnerable to such war are prospective
U.S. opponents; a country like North Korea seems unlikely to be
heavily dependent on modern computer technology.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction.</i> The end of the
Cold War
was accompanied not only by a diminished perception of the
Russian threat but also by an increased perception of the threat
posed by regional powers. Regional rogues in possession of NBC
weapons is a danger that has to be considered despite the
vigorous U.S. program to prevent proliferation. Therefore, more
attention is being devoted to how to counter weapons of mass
destruction. The first choice is deterrence, but achieving
deterrence in a regional context is more difficult than the Cold
War task. A rogue with a few NBC weapons may decide to use them
as weapons of choice, whereas during the Cold War, the Soviets
may well have considered NBC weapons to be a last resort.
Furthermore, with the biological warfare and chemcial warfare
conventions and the de-emphasis of tactical nuclear weapons, it
may be difficult to threaten response in kind against a rogue
with a few NBC weapons. Because of the problems for deterring
regional rogues, more emphasis is being given to defensive
measures. Some of these defenses are passive, including
intelligence to identify the NBC capability of potential
adversaries. The need for active defenses, like the Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), to protect U.S. forces
becomes clearer as ballistic and cruise missiles become more
available to emerging powers.
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><a name="subhead6">General Conclusions about the
Instruments of U.S. Power Post-Cold War </a><p>
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="return15.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The end of the Cold War produced within the United States an
understandable tendency to place greater emphasis on domestic
concerns, resulting in calls for cuts in the budgets for most of
the instruments of U.S. power, as well as for reorganization or
fundamental reform of many foreign policy institutions. Five
general conclusions can be drawn about applying U.S. power in the
new environment:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>New Ways of Applying U.S. Power.</i> Enhancing the capability
of the
U.S. government to exercise influence abroad does not need to
mean buying more of the same old product. The present
foreign-policy and national-security establishment was created
largely during the Cold War and reflects the priorities of that
era. Different ways of doing business are being developed to draw
upon the untapped strengths of the present organizations even
while shifting resources away from areas that are no longer so
relevant or practical. An important example is the reorientation
of NATO away from defending against an imminent Soviet attack
towards being a vehicle for enhancing stability and security
beyond NATO's present borders. In pursuit of this new purpose,
the Partnership for Peace (PFP) program provides a means to draw
upon NATO's unparalleled expertise at security and military
cooperation. PFP also can improve the prospects for NATO
expansion by building confidence among NATO's existing members in
the capabilities of the new members and confidence in Russia
about NATO's intentions.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<b>Tomohawk Cruise Missile Launch</b><p><img src="ch1701.gif"
align="left">In the changed strategic environment, vastly
expanded use will be
made of some instruments applied more sparingly in the past. One
example is the use of international consortia to mobilize the
resources and the political will needed to respond to regional
threats. While the U.S. was the only country able and willing to
take the lead in resolving the dispute about North Korea's
nuclear intentions, the issue was of vital concern to Japan and
South Korea, so it was only natural that the U.S. should ask them
to play the major role in the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) set up to provide North Korea with a less
threatening means of meeting its energy needs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The new ways of applying U.S. power are particularly important
for issues such as transnational threats, which are becoming more
important relative to the long-standing concerns about aggressive
and destabilizing states. One development has been greater use in
international relations of certain U.S. agencies which in the
past had a lower profile, e.g., the FBI helping prevent nuclear
smuggling, the DEA active in drug source and drug trafficking
countries, the INS involved in sensitive decisions about refugee
status. Issues like global warming and ozone depletion would
similarly bring the EPA into negotiations over international
treaties.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As part of the diversification from the traditional Cold War
pattern of conducting national security affairs, the Department
of Defense and the military services are being assigned a much
wider array of tasks and are developing new ways of doing
business. Some of these tasks, like foreign military interaction
and humanitarian operations, were secondary functions during the
Cold War that have now become more important and for which new
techniques are being developed. Other tasks are new, like
promoting respect abroad for democratic civilian control over the
military. As for new ways of doing business, many come primarily
from the ongoing information revolution. The technological base
for the change is driven primarily by commercial capital rather
than by governments. Militaries will not control the direction
and pace of the advancing computer and telecommunication
industries. The payoff for the military will come in adapting for
its purposes what is developed in the commercial world. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Phasing Down Use of Some Instruments. </i>At the same time
that the
U.S. is diversifying by more often bringing into play a wide
range of instruments (some new, some used only sparingly in the
past), the U.S. is reducing its reliance on some instruments that
were central during the Cold War period. In particular, the U.S.
is placing less importance on its weapons of mass destruction.
The U.S. is giving up its ability to retaliate in kind against
those who use chemical or biological weapons; it has dramatically
reduced reliance on tactical nuclear weapons; and it is
dismantling much of its Cold War inventory of strategic nuclear
weapons. In addition, the U.S. has effectively ended military aid
except to Israel and Egypt, other than minuscule amounts for
military education and training.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the past, the U.S. government carried out directly many
functions that it no longer has the resources to do, or at least
to do on a scale that can make as substantial an impact on a
broad front. Examples include radio broadcasting and financing
economic development. While Washington continues to fund radio
broadcasting (especially Voice of America) and some foreign aid
expenditures, the U.S. government plays a much smaller role in
these areas than it did in past decades.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Working With the Private Sector.</i> As the private sector
grows in
previously state-dominated societies and as U.S. firms operate
more on a world scale, the U.S. government has increasing
opportunities to make its influence felt through the private
sector. The challenge for the U.S. government is reinventing
institutions designed for the old way of doing business, so that
the government can take advantage of new opportunities rather
than staying stuck in the old rut. So, for instance, Washington's
role will be making sure that the CNN reporters who provide the
first news about a crisis have ready access to in-depth
background briefings. Similarly, the Defense Department will be
increasingly incorporating into military uses the information
technologies developed by business.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The power of the private sector is an important element in
accomplishing U.S. goals abroad. But the private sector cannot be
expected to carry the burden of defending U.S. interests. The
pervasiveness of American popular culture (such as music, movies,
and brand names) and the strength of American high-technology
industries (such as computer software and aerospace) add to U.S.
power, but they cannot be the basis for U.S. global leadership on
many vital security issues. Sports figures and rock musicians
cannot stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. No matter how
much the economy and popular culture become globalized, there
remains an important role for the traditional government
activities in foreign affairs and national security.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Applying Instruments for Limited Ends.</i> During the Cold
War, the
ever-present competition with the Soviet Union meant that on each
issue of international affairs, the most vital interests of the
U.S. might come into play, as that issue became part of the
global chess game. In a multipolar world of uncertainty and
ambiguity, the U.S. government will often engage to promote
limited U.S. interests. Given the limited character of what is at
stake, it may not be credible for the U.S. to threaten to use, if
need be, the full panoply of instruments it commands. For
instance, nuclear deterrence against the Soviet Union was
relatively straightforward compared with the problem of deterring
a rogue actor like Mohammed Farah Adeed from disrupting a
peacekeeping operation like that in Somalia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There will be more situations in which Washington makes a small
commitment but is not prepared to commit more. An obvious example
is economic aid; compare the billions that followed the Camp
David treaty between Israel and Egypt with the modest sums
committed after Israel's accords with Jordan and the PLO. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Peace and humanitarian operations represent particularly
difficult challenges for the military. As in Somalia, the
commitment may start out as strictly limited but, through mission
creep, evolve into a broad mandate that requires more forces and
resources than the U.S. or the international community had
expected. If the alternative to mission creep is
withdrawal--which may be tempting if the initial effort results
in an appreciable number of casualties--the perception of
weakness can have a high cost for U.S. influence in other
situations. The image of failure in Somalia has not been fully
offset by success in Haiti. Even sticking with the original
limited mission may cause problems, since the U.S. public may be
dissatisfied if the U.S., once engaged, withdraws without
addressing the underlying structural problems that caused the
crisis. Despite such problems with large expanded peacekeeping
missions, the U.S. is certain to continue to play an active role
in humanitarian and peace operations: the relatively small
resources required will often justify the potentially high
benefits.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<i>Coordinating Among Instruments.</i> While coordinating the
agencies
of the U.S. government has always been a problem, the challenge
is growing for several reasons. During the Cold War, coordination
among U.S. agencies and policy instruments was simplified by the
overwhelming priority given to containing Soviet communism. In
the post-Cold War era, there is less clarity about which goals
are central and which are peripheral. For instance, considerable
effort has been needed to develop and implement a government-wide
approach towards strengthening security cooperation with Japan at
the same time the U.S. was vigorously pushing Japan to be
forthcoming on trade issues. And because a wider array of policy
instruments is being used, there are more agencies among which
policy has to be coordinated.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As foreign policy goals become more complex and a greater variety
of instruments are brought to bear on any one problem,
interagency coordination and clear policy direction become all
the more important. Close coordination among agencies and
consultation between the administration and Congress are potent
force multipliers. To this end, attention is being given to
drawing lessons from earlier complex crisis management efforts. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In complex contingency operations which combine military and
relief missions, coordination among agencies is complicated by
the different time horizons on which each works. For instance,
the military is often well positioned to respond quickly in a
crisis, while USAID specializes in building indigenous capacities
over the longer term in the partner country. The two time
horizons do not necessarily meet easily, which can place
unexpected additional strains upon military resources or
jeopardize the success of the mission. For example, the military
was able to quickly restore electricity for Haiti's capital city
of Port-au-Prince but was not in a position to keep providing the
electricity until USAID could help the local utility become
strong enough to run all the aspects of a modern electrical
supply system, from power generation to customer billing.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In sum, despite growing resource constraints, the U.S. government
still has an impressive array of instruments to use to influence
other governments. It is actively adapting those instruments to
changing circumstances. While there are certainly shortcomings in
the ways in which post-Cold War Washington applies the
instruments at its disposal, Washington has had good success at
achieving its goals, and the efficiency with which resources are
used is improving steadily.

MEMORANDUM FOR: SEE DISTRIBUTION<br><br>

SUBJECT: Identification and Processing fo Sensitive Operational Records<br><br>

<p>
1. The DEPSECDEF and the ASD/HA have expressed concern about potential sensitive reports or documents on GulfLINK. They have directed that the declassifiers identify such documents and forward them to the Investigation Team prior to release on GulfLINK. The purpose of this procedure is not to stop any declassified or unclassified documents from goin on GulfLINK, but to allow the investigation Team time to begin preparation of a response onparticular "bombshell" reports. These responses could be provided to Dr. White and Dr. Joseph, or used in response to White House queries.</p>

<p>
2. Realizing that a fair amount of judgment must be exercised by your reviewers in this process, request you task your teams to use the following criteia in selecting sensitive documents.

<ul>
<li>a. Documents that could generate unusual public/media attention.</li>

<li>b. All documents which seem to confirm the use or detection of nuclear, chemical, or biological agents.</li>

<li>c. Documents which make gross/startling assertions, i.e., pilot's report that he saw a "giant cloud of anthrax gas."</li>

<li>d. Documents contaning releasable information which could embarass the Government or DoD. Statements such as "we are not to bring this up to the press" fit this category.</li>

<li>e. Documents which shed light on issues which have high levels of media interest, such as the November 1995, <font underline>Life</font> article on birth defects among Gulf War Veterans' children.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
All such reports should be flagged for the Investigation Team and sent directly to them by the fastest avail means, e.g. E-mail, fax, mail, or/courier.</p>

<p>3. The Investigation Team will make two determinations on each flagged record. One will be whether or not the subject requires further research, and the other will be who, if anyone, would receive the results of the research. As soon as these steps are expedited, the Investigation Team will notify the operational declassifier that they have completed their part of the process and that the document can be forwarded to DTIC for placement on GulfLINK. The Investigation Team will also notify the declassifiers when particular incidents or units are no longer considered potentially sensitive. In those cases, the declassifiers should stop flagging or highlighting reports on that incident or unit. The results of the Investigation Teams' investigations ultimately will be put on GulfLINK.</p>

<p>
4. You are requested to ensure that your declassifiers follow the FOIA standards in the review, redaction, and release of health-related operational records. This will ensure that there is some consistency in operational records of the services and commands that are being made available to the public on GulfLINK. It also facilitates the use of FOIA and privacy exemption codes in the redaction of documents.</p>

        <p><font face="Dutch Roman 12pt">Confronted by dramatic
        advances in computer technology and an historic shift in
        the Global Marketplace, security faces dynamic
        challenges. NDI services have grown to match the dynamic
        thresholds in technology and the new and changing World
        Order. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Dutch Roman 12pt">NDI has been a leader in
        system security services, training, risk assessment,
        security design and consulting since 1985. We have been a
        strategic business partner to government, law
        enforcement, financial institutions and corporations. We
        have worked with the public sector, regulatory agencies
        and telecommunications providers to ensure safe and sound
        security practices. We can help develop policy, assess
        risks and prescribe remedies.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Dutch Roman 12pt">NDI introduced the 1987
        Public Law Computer Security training working with
        Congress and a federal curriculum group. We introduced
        security engineering for the space and defense industry,
        DoD and NASA and work with government and corporate
        professionals. NDI's lists of clients, students and
        successful initiatives are impressive and of technical
        edge caliber.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Dutch Roman 12pt">Security must enhance
        not inhibit project productivity and data processing. As
        the complexity of technology and threats have grown, NDI
        has added expert resources and new initiatives. NDI's
        strength lies in the ability to work with several
        entities collaboratively to ensure that unique client
        needs are met. From our pool of resources, we assess risk
        and design protections to prevent, detect and correct
        system weaknesses. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Dutch Roman 12pt">We encourage leading
        edge approaches working with top-flight managers,
        technicians and bright practitioners. Facing the 'Perils
        of the Internet,' we enjoy working with visionaries like
        Winn Schwartau, the security industry, the 'hacker'
        community and international experts. We employ some of
        the VERY best talent in the fields. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Dutch Roman 12pt">&quot;To achieve
        progress, there can be no status quo.&quot; Professionals
        and leading organizations must continue to more forward
        and seek new dimensions. Exponential technology and its
        security challenges characterize our work. NDI's project
        experience and consultant practitioners emphasize
        state-of-the-art and practical security designs,
        cost-effective protection and project management
        approaches to advance professional development by
        training and practical applications. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Dutch Roman 12pt">We would be delighted to

Countering Non-lethal Information Warfare:</H2>
<h4>Lessons learned on foiling the Information Superhighwayman of  the North American public switched telephone network.</h4>
<i>Hank Kluepfel CPP<BR>
Science Applications International Corporation.</I></Center>
<BR>



The United States relies for its very existence--economically, socially, and politically--on an extraordinary sophisticated and intricate set of long-distance networks for energy distribution, communication, and transportation.  Because these networks also rely upon each other, a truly serious disruption in any one will cascade quickly through the others, rending the vital fabric of our nation at its most crucial points.  Under these circumstances, the ability to respond to national security crises will at least be severely constrained and may be completely interrupted for some crucial interval.  Thus, in addition to their serious vulnerabilities to accidents and nature, these networks present a tempting target to terrorists and to any antagonist contemplating an international move contrary to U.S. interests.1  <P>

<h4>	    America's Hidden Vulnerabilities, CSIS, 19842</h4>

While warnings such as the one cited above predicted potentially catastrophic consequences, the fragility of  today's global networks of computer based systems, used to business process re-engineer America's industrial and military infrastructure into lanes on the Information Superhighway,  together with  concerns over information warfare, are  taking  front burner attention on the agenda's of military and civilian agencies within the United States.  A September 1993  Department of Defense report said it best:  "if hired by terrorists,  hackers could cripple the Nation's telephone system, create significant public health and safety problems, and cause serious economic shocks." 3<P>

This paper will, hopefully describe and help to further set the stage for the establishment and realization of a defensive information warfare security baseline architecture for the NII Information  Superhighway and its global partners and components throughout their lifecycle, from research and development to deployment and beyond. <P>


<h4>The best offense is often a  good defense</h4>


Pogo said it best, "we have met the enemy and it's us." Following a rash of intrusion incidents into Unclassified but sensitive  Department of Defense computers systems, the DOD is now taking positive Defensive Information Warfare 4 steps to assess and correct its potential information warfare vulnerabilities.  For the past year hired hackers within various agencies of  the Department of Defense have  been conducting "sweeps" and vulnerability assessments  of agency sites and network systems connected to MILNET/Internet.  According to <P>
new reports posted to the SPACE Warfare Website, http:\\ infosec.nosc.mil/infosec.html-ssil, the testing consisted of  making use of the same types of tools that hackers use when they penetrate into systems connected to the Internet.  Although the specific results of such testing are restricted to the affected sites and the infowarriors conducting the tests, general findings present a dour state of readiness and response to information warfare on the information superhighway.<P>

While much has been learned over the last ten years in securing the information superhighway's public switched network infrastructure, even greater emphasis must be placed on addressing security in cyberspace. <P>

Security  and Information Assurance  as it applies to telecommunications in Defensive Information Warfare may be viewed as  classical quality problem.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Lack of constancy of purpose: There must be a clear goal related to security, privacy,  and assurance beyond the immediate and often short term, reactive efforts. <BR>

<LI>Emphasis on short term results:  Security is seem as a destination rather than a journey.<BR>

<LI>Audits and Self Assessment Deficiencies: Auditors find  and report on troubling exploitable vulnerabilities and  inadequacy of controls only to have the reports collect dust waiting for the second and third follow-on report to find exacerbated vulnerabilities.  Self Assessments are often inadequate in scope and depth, often tending to tell management  want they want to  hear.  On the contrary, when people in the organization clearly understand corporate objectives, they measure themselves against those objectives.6  Unfortunately, security objectives for industry or government are not well defined and understood with respect to the robustness issues in a heterogeneous, multi-vendor, multi-carrier/service provider environment of the NII.<BR>

<LI>Mobility of Management: Does not  imbue trust in employees, contractors and vendors; or offer long term assurances that the problem is being adequately addressed in emerging technologies.<BR>

<LI>Measurements are Meaningless:  Since less than five percent of intrusions are ever detected by systems administrators, and only five percent of those detected ever get reported to management,  law enforcement or other incident tracking system, striving for "Zero incidents" may realize the narrow focused objective only to leave the infrastructure even more vulnerable to compromise.<BR>

<LI>Recovery costs far outweigh prevention:  Numerous studies of software quality and physical design have shown that designing it right the first time is far more cost effective than piecemeal reinforcements and recovery efforts.<BR>

<LI>Excessive potential liabilities:  The potential for product liability and negligence often keeps security on the hush for fear of potential consequences if the vulnerabilities be known or inadequate corrective actions applied. <BR>

</UL>

As the information  superhighway e.g., national, defense and global information infrastructures, becomes the metaphor of choice, for the potential virtual infrastructure of electronic commerce, many believe that privacy and security will become the linchpin of this 21st Century vision for a National Information Infrastructure, NII. <P>

A new report issued by the Clinton Administration, summed it up this way: <P>

If the NII is to succeed, a structure or a collection of structures -- a security architecture -- must exist to ensure security. The NRC report states: <I>"This security architecture must include technical facilities, recommended operational procedures, and means for recourse within the legal system."  </I> This architecture will be based on a variety of public and  private institutions and policies.  Although an architecture will define how institutions, policies, and technologies interconnect, a sound security architecture will consist not of rigidly prescribed technologies or solutions, but must be able to flexibly adapt to change.  The report also notes that such an  architecture will require research and development over time.  <P>

     As the United States as a whole becomes increasingly reliant on the NII for communications and information, other key components of the U.S. infrastructure will become dependent on it.  For example, the power grid, transportation systems, financial institutions, and economic transaction data will all be dependent on the NII.  Security weaknesses in the NII can place  those infrastructure elements at risk.  Hence a significant attack on the NII would be a threat to our national security in addition to the significant personal and economic harm it would cause.8<P>

In an international economy and social infrastructure that is growing more dependent everyday on its communications networks, more attention must be placed on the security and integrity of the components and interfaces of those critical structures by all interconnected service providers, vendors and users.  The old adage that the chain is only as strong as the weakest link has never been as true as it is today when applied to the issue of network security and integrity. It is with that tone that this paper is written to help identify the potential information warfare threat and address the  cascading  vulnerable infrastructure  on which the information superhighway is being built. <P>

<h4>Information Superhighway Field of Dreams</h4>

Over the last twenty years the number of compromised systems, routers, networks and development systems supporting   the developing information superhighway have escalated and may very well approach nearly  a quarter of a million nodes.<P>

<h4>Dialing for data in  the Public Switched Network</h4>

While there is no definite intruder threat profile for the PSN, many are adults with previous criminal records for computer related crimes committed when they were juveniles.  In 1987, Herbert Zinn, a 17 year old  hacker who called himself Shadowhawk electronically broke into logistic support systems of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO,  AT&T #5ESS installation systems for the AUTOVON systems at Robins Airforce Base  and several  AT&T Operations Support Systems R&D  data bases and support systems, stealing source code to 55 programs ranging from development code for installing switching systems to Artificial Intelligence, AI, language.  He was detected by AT&T's investigations into allegations of  threatening messages  left by Shadowhawk on a hacker bulletin board in Texas.<P>

  Shadow Hawk was later found guilty of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 in Federal District Court in Chicago and sentenced to nine months in prison.  In addition to a prison term, he was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine, and serve two and a half years of federal probation when released from prison.  That case was a foretelling of the more serious  LOD and MOD incidents to follow.9  While no classified material was obtained, the government viewed the $21,000 in software programs stolen from the computer used by NATO as "sensitive". <P>

Kevin Lee Poulsen, AKA Dark Dante, a 31 year old individual, with a long history of computer hacking going back to age fourteen, currently under indictment in California for espionage is charged with breaking into computer systems of  Pacific Bell and wiretapping the contents of sensitive communications including US  Air Force Classified Information on planned targets in the event of a war.<P>

Intruders often align themselves into groups of individuals with similar interests and skills, e.g., the Master of Deception or MOD who were convicted in Federal Court in New York City  for  breaking into some of the nation's most sophisticated computer systems  to gain illegal access to the computers of  Bank of America, Southwestern Bell, Martin Marietta, TRW Information Services and New York University, among others.  The five were also accused of selling information, such as people's credit reports, that they obtained illegally from the systems.  The hackers, an ethnically mixed group from working-class neighborhoods around New York City, defied the stereotype of young computer aficionados as affluent suburbanites.  They met through computer bulletin boards, and knew one another by nicknames like ``Outlaw,'' ``Corrupt'' and ``Acid Phreak.'' <P>

In a written statement submitted to the federal district court, Corrupt admitted to illegal activities as a member of MOD: <P>

<Cite>1)  I agreed to possess in excess of fifteen passwords which permitted me to gain access to various computer systems including all systems mentioned in the indictment and others. I did not have authorization to access these systems.  I knew  at the time that what I did was wrong.<P>

2)  I used these access devices and in doing so obtained the value of time I spent within these systems as well as the value of the passwords themselves which I acknowledge was more than $1000.<P>

3)  I intentionally gained access to what I acknowledge are Federal interest   computers and I acknowledge that work had to be done to improve the  security of these systems which was necessitated by my unauthorized access.<P>

4)  I was able to monitor data exchange between computer systems and by doing so intentionally obtained more passwords,  identifications and other data transmitted over ...net and other networks.<P>

5)  I acknowledge that I and others planned to share passwords and  transmitted information across state boundaries by modem or telephone   lines and by doing so obtained the monetary value of the use of the    systems I would otherwise have had to pay for.
<P>

Among the ways I and others agreed to carry out these acts are the following:<P>

  1.  I was part of a group called MOD.<P>

  2.  The members of the group exchanged information including passwords  so that we could gain access to computer systems which we were not authorized to access.<P>

  3.  I got passwords by monitoring ...net, calling phone company employees and pretending to be computer technicians, and using computer programs to steal passwords. I participated in installing programs in computer systems that would give the highest level of access to members of MOD who possessed the secret password. I participated in altering telephone computer systems to obtain free calling services such as conference calling and free billing among others.<P>

Finally, I obtained credit reports, telephone numbers and addresses as well as other information about individual people by gaining access to information and credit reporting services.  I acknowledge that on November 5, 1991, I obtained passwords by monitoring ...net.<P>

</Cite>
Corrupt and his MOD colleagues  had apparently gained access to a vendor supported  Operations, Administration, Maintenance and Provisioning,  OAM&P,  "debug" port to telephone companies backbone networks.  By exploiting the group based or default password for the diagnostic tool, the intruders then executed the packet monitoring program to read the data traffic at various points in the telco's PPSN, e.g., X.25 multiplexers.<P>

By reading the data on the X.25 nodes and gateways the intruders were able to capture logins and passwords transiting over or used within the packet network.  With the help of the compromised logins and associated passwords, the intruders then attacked the downstream systems and networks.<P>

All five of the defendants subsequently plead guilty and were sentenced to varying degrees of punishment ranging from probation to 14 months in a Federal Penitentiary followed by three months of home incarceration, followed by two years of probation and up to 600 hours of community service.<P>

In another case, three adults and one juvenile, all members of the hacker group known as the Legion of Doom,  were convicted and sentenced to prison in the Fall of 1990 in Federal court in Atlanta for their part in compromising the computer systems of BellSouth.<P>

The defendants, who used the handles Leftist, Urvile, Prophet and Fry Guy admitted accessing the carrier's internal backbone X.25 packet network to penetrate the carriers OAM&P centers, systems and databases  to  affect fraudulent service creation and modification, add call forwarding to customer lines and monitor customer communications. <P>

In yet another case, a hacker based in Europe claimed to have the ability to shut-down a major computer based financial network located in the United States by affecting environmental support systems such as power, cooling/heating and ventilation systems.  Telco and financial community investigations  found a related security risk involving  building environmental systems, which allowed potentially vulnerable remote access to heating, air conditioning, humidity, power and elevators alarms and control settings.  Since many of the network nodes supporting the PSN and its customers are designed to operate in controlled environmental conditions, a potential vulnerability existed which if exploited by an intruder could cause catastrophic troubles to the network.<P>


Intruders believe that the three  easiest ways to penetrate a system are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>impersonate an authorized employee or vendor agent to affect the disclosure of sensitive access information or allow physical access to a facility housing critical systems<BR>

<LI>take advantage of the defaults shipped with the system and its software<BR>

<LI>fraudulently influence system hot line support personnel to give out information and or affect system changes e.g. the reset of a users password.<BR>

</UL>
	
Many of the U S based hackers who have been apprehended and prosecuted for their crimes were found to have had indirect electronic association with hackers in Germany,Australia and Great Britain.  The individuals located in<P>
Germany are the same espionage operative hackers described by Clifford Stoll in his best selling book entitled "The Cuckoo's Egg." Known objectives for the attacks include financial gain, malicious destruction, and invasion of privacy.<P>

It has become increasingly apparent that, without adequate attention to security, systems and networks are vulnerable to service quality impacting intrusions by unauthorized individuals (e.g., hackers) and groups (e.g., the hacker groups known as the Legion of Doom, 8LGM and Master of Deception).  Such computer crimes always involve unauthorized persons, or persons who exceed their authorization, with adequate SKAM (Skills, Knowledge, Access and Motive) acting on exploitable vulnerabilities .Knowledge and access are often afforded the would-be intruder through the compromise of system security bulletins often found in public sources and redistributed by the hackers on their own cites in cyberspace such as <a href="http://www.8lgm.org/advisories.html-ssi">http://www.8lgm.org/advisories.html-ssi</A>  <P>

In the past, since it was very often not economically feasible to prevent intrusions, most service providers often focused their efforts on controlling losses through reactive deterrent and control measures.<P>

Accordingly, and in recognition of the significant damage which might occur from such intrusions, a number of telecommunications carriers around the nation12  have begun to assess the effectiveness of security mechanisms in-place to protect the critical common environments supporting the interconnection of the global public  network.<P>

If we assess the current wave of Internet attacks and fraud on the growing volume of electronic commerce transactions  we find surprising similar root causes. <P>


It is easy to project that chaos is certain if we as a nation, industry and government do not clearly define, support and affect a holistic approach to network and information security focusing on root causes to intrusion to the NII/DII/GII. Technologies such as Asyvhronous Transfer Mode, ATM, are seen as the platforms of choice for the fastlane of the Information Superhighway.  Yet effective solutions and standards have not been developed to address the authentication of the source of OA&M cells which could affect the integrity of  network management controls  and features such as switched virtual circuits, SVC. <P>

Saying it another way, absent effective security policies, requirements, standards, working agreements for vulnerability closure information sharing, and penalties for non-conformance, chaos is certain and secure recovery readiness a necessity. <P>

2 For 1995, the CSIS has revisited the topic area with its announcement of its Global Organized Crime Study, chaired by the Honorable Judge William Webster, former head of  the Federal Bureau of  Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency.  The emphasis on the new study is to assess the vulnerability of the information infrastructure as a forensic root cause for criminal exploitation on a global basis. <P>

8 The telecommunications outages of 1990 and 1991 caused considerable concern and attention to be directed at the problem of network integrity, security and assurance.  So great was the potential societal impact of such widescale outages that the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States revamped its Telecommunications Strategic Plan to significantly reinforce its reliability and security requirements. Realizing that the security threat to air traffic control has changed in character, as computer and telecommunications technologies have grown more powerful, the FAA  created a multipoint plan document to address security throughout the lifecycle of its future telecommunications environment.<P>

<p><B>WASHINGTON, June 25 (UPI) </B>-- Traditional methods by the nation's intelligence agencies are not enough to stave off attacks by terrorists or hackers on vital U.S. computer systems, CIA Director John Deutch said Tuesday. Deutch, testifying before a Senate panel on actions taken by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to combat so-called "cyber attacks," called for the government to establish "deep cooperation" with the high-tech industry to protect the nation's information infrastructure.</p>
<p>Deutch said a growing dependence worldwide on telecommunications and computer networks has fostered with it a vulnerability to attacks that could in essence cripple the backbone of the nation's communications infrastructure. "Both nations and terrorist organizations can, with relative ease, acquire the techniques to penetrate information systems," Deutch said. "That is what is different about this category of threat to our infrastructure from other kinds of threats; the conventional explosives or nuclear, biological and chemical" weapons.</p>
<p>Deutch told members of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs Tuesday that U.S. defenses have not caught up to the rapid growth of computer technology that has presented the CIA and the Pentagon with a new range of security concerns to counter.</p>
<p>"We are not well organized as a government to address these issues," Deutch said. "Traditional government methods are not enough. What is required here is a very intense and deep cooperation with industry, those who own, build and operate the civilian infrastructure and those who are closer to the very rapid technological change which is occurring."</p>
<p>Through such weapons as computer viruses transmitted through the Internet, such attacks could shut down international commerce and funds transfers, knock out systems guiding commercial air or rail traffic, cut power supplies, or even prevent the Pentagon from giving orders to its forces. "The electron, in my judgment, is the ultimate precision-guided munition,"Deutch said. "International terrorist groups clearly have the capability to attack the information infrastructure of the United States, even if they use relatively simple means," Deutch said.</p>
<p>Information warfare methods used by terrorists could include vehicle-delivered bombs directed at major telephone switching centers, Deutch said. Successful attacks against communications systems through the Internet, however, require more than basic computer literacy. "It requires sophisticated computer programming technique, it requires detailed information about the character of the target, the computer network or telecommunications system that you are addressing, and it does in some sense require access to the target, whether by physical or electronic means," Deutch said.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups are increasingly using the Internet for communications, Deutch said, and paid computer hackers could provide them with the skills needed to launch a cyber assault. "Hackers, with or without their full knowledge, may be supplying advice and expertise to rogue states such as Iran and Libya," he said. Deutch said he believes "foreign organized crime" is behind some of the many intrusions committed by hackers on U.S. banks and telecommunications companies.</p>
<p>Last year, a 16-year-old London resident gained access to a sophisticated U.S. defense computer system causing U.S. intelligence agencies to scramble. The youth was charged with carrying out a series of attacks on a highly classified Defense Department computer facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A 21-year-old resident of Wales was arrested last weekend, accused of tutoring the youth how to conduct the attacks. Adding to the intrigue of the case, the 16-year-old has been accused of acting with others in a conspiracy to carry out the attacks, however, no others have been tied publicly to the incident.</p>
<p>"Could they have been foreign intelligence operatives or agents of a hostile foreign government, or were they just youthful hackers?," said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., committee chairman. "In the cyber world, it could be possible that the two arrested may not even know the identity of their fellow co-conspirators." Nunn said the case "highlights the need for sound policy, for intelligence, and for response planning." The CIA chief said the intelligence community has taken measures to estimate both the intent and capabilities of foreign entities to attack U.S. communications targets.</p>
<p>Deutch said an inter-agency Critical Infrastructure Security Group, made up of the CIA, the Pentagon and the FBI, has been established to identify vulnerability in the domestic infrastructure. The group is scheduled to release a security threat assessment by Dec. 1. The National Security Agency is presently reorganizing specifically to address information warfare, Deutch said, and is creating an Information Warfare Technology Center in Fort Meade, Md.</p>
<p>Deutch said details for the center must still be worked out, but it is being designed as "more of a place to build a toolbox to threat assessment, do analysis, rather than a place to get involved in actual law enforcement or operational decisions."

Federal Civil Rights Action Seeks Injunction Against State Department And National Security Agency<BR>

<a href="http://samsara.law.cwru.edu">For More Information On This Law Suit</a> <BR>

<p>A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict his ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a twenty-five year veteran of the law school faculty, will file a federal civil rights action this afternoon in the United States District Court in Cleveland.  The suit names the Department of State and the secretive National Security Agency, which administer federal regulations limiting Professor Junger's ability to teach.</p>
<p>The case involves the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, federal regulations which restrict the export of military technology.  Under the ITAR, cryptographic computer software, which encodes text to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet, is considered a "munition" and subject to strict export control. The regulations raise significant First Amendment questions by defining "export" to include discussing technical information about non-classified software with foreign nationals, such as students registered for Professor Junger's course.</p>
<p>In recent months, the State Department has sent a series of letters threatening possible criminal action to a Florida man who posted a simple cryptographic algorithm to the "sci.crypt" Usenet Newsgroup, an Internet site popular with cryptography enthusiasts.  These and similar incidents have caused Professor Junger to limit his discussions of cryptographic material with foreign colleagues, for fear of violating the ITAR.  Penalties for unlicenced disclosure of cryptographic information are severe: federal law provides ten year prison terms and One Million Dollar fines for those convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act, the legislation under which the ITAR was promulgated.</p>
<p>Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses on the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans to turn away any foreign students who register for the course this fall, largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach, and to whom.</p>
<p>The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of State, in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security Agency, the organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign governments.   Under the ITAR, Junger may not teach foreign students about even simple software capable of encoding messages. Such software is vital to maintaining the privacy of communications and financial transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes that lawyers need to understand how it works in order to prepare to practice in an increasingly technological world.</p>


<P>The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available on the Internet and elsewhere. "It's
not as though we are talking about classified information," explained Gino Scarselli, one of three
lawyers representing Junger in the case. "The material at issue in this case can be found in any
university library, but the regulations make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"
Scarselli noted. The lawsuit does not challenge the government's right to restrict access to classified
information. 

<P>Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis O'Neill, two Cleveland
attorneys with considerable experience in First Amendment issues. As Vasvari explained, the suit
presents important First Amendment questions about the government's ability to regulate academic
life. "These regulations allow the government to dictate what a professor may and may not teach,
even though the material involved poses no threat to national security," Vasvari explained. 

<P>The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal license to discuss cryptography with
foreigners, the government is violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits the
government from imposing prior restraints on expression without clear, narrowly drawn standards
distinguishing prohibited expression from permissible speech. The United States Supreme Court has
consistently held that such prior restraints face a heavy burden in court, and that standardless
licencing schemes allowing officials broad discretion in restriction speech are unconstitutional. 

<P>Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role in the economic development
of the Internet, the case is being closely watched. Scarselli has worked closely with attorneys
affiliated with the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier Foundation in preparing the suit, and
Junger and his lawyers have been in frequent contact with John Gilmore, formerly of Sun
Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a technical advisor in the case. 

<P>At issue is not only Junger's right to discuss cryptography with foreigners, but also his and other's
right to publish and distribute such information both in traditional forms and on the internet. 

<P>Professor Junger's suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, prohibiting the government from
interfering with his, or any other person's, discussing non-classified cryptographic information with
foreign persons or from publishing that information. Lawyers for Junger have moved the court for a
preliminary injunction. Junger's course begins in the fall semester, later this month.

Blueprint for Disaster: Speculations on Future Low Intensity Conflict

Ill luck, you know, seldom comes alone.
-- Cervantes, _Don Quixote_

Michael Wilson [5514706@mcimail.com]
Managing Director, The Nemesis Group

Copyright 1996 by author. All rights reserved.

Worries about potential future conflicts and the effects of mechanisms such as
the Internet on such are running rampant through the law enforcement agencies
(LEAs) and intelligence community (IC). A particular concern is that of internal
domestic conflict arising in the United States, where the safety valves built
into the democratic process don't seem to be bleeding off the pressure fast
enough.

The defining down of the capacity for force and violence, including terror on a
mass scale or the 'new' problems of information warfare, may very well mean that
potential future attacks are beyond the capacity of law enforcement or
intelligence agencies to predict or counteract.

The 'problem space' or 'game' is best explored through the postulation of a
'group' and its activities. The adversarial group will be referred to as 'OpFor'
for the remainder of the document.


Assumptions
For the purposes of an interesting, realistic game, certain assumptions must be
made; the OpFor must not be assumed to have any deliberate advantage, with
'variables' set to allow the group to function and not necessarily greater. If
the group is still viable with the deck stacked against it, the argument for its
capabilities is that much more compelling.

OpFor Intent/Mission Orders
What motivates the creation and operation of OpFor? Their agenda could be many
things, but their tactics have commonalities:

- Damaging the basic trust of the citizens in the operating social contract;
this may also include attempts to modify or replace the social contract with new
elements or in total (for example, communism, political Islam's sharia,
Palestine, Ireland) but OpFor may not be so advanced;

- Damaging the economy of scale in the social dependency infrastructure. All
advanced societies have complex mechanisms that provide common support to
significant portions of the citizens (Maslow's Hierarchy--food, water, power,
sewage, trade, etc.). Removal of this economy of scale, or dramatic impairment
of its function, restricts the usage or benefit to the intended parties, and may
trigger further collapse;

- Overburden and/or damage the law enforcement agencies and intelligence
community elements responsible for protecting and maintaining the social fabric;

- Impair C4I (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence) with
C4D (chaos, catastrophe, confusion, computers, deception--note that computers
are a constant force multiplier in either domain).

Operational Rules and Arbitrary Restrictions
A 'fair game' (not reality), while it will follow realistic assumptions for
OpFor player behavior, will level the playing field somewhat (against OpFor) as
such:

Occam's Choice (rule)
In the spirit of keeping operations simple, OpFor favors the use of the lowest
technological means to achieve the elements or sub-goals of their mission; high
technology proficiency is not ruled out, and a certain level must be assumed
(discussed further below).

No Contact Profile (rule)
Attacks that may involve people are to be restricted to 'no contact' target
profiles (which excludes operations such as kidnapping, hostage taking,
extortion, etc.) in the interest of security; such operations ('no retreat' or
'contact' profiles) dramatically increase the risks of exposure.

No HUMINT (rule)
Human intelligence can be useful, but the risks outweigh the return; just as
with other 'contact' profiles, minimized risks should be taken of exposure,
betrayal, or compromise. For this reason, OpFor players operate inside their own
competencies, not consulting outside sources for intelligence or expertise
purposes.

No Sponsor (assumption)
OpFor has no need of a sponsor, in the sense of 'state sponsored terrorism.'
While a 'contract hit' on a social structure is an interesting concept (and one
that the author would find entertaining to negotiate, particularly the
compensation clause), it is not required as a precondition. The sorts of mayhem
to be contemplated for OpFor needs no sponsor for support or motivation, and the
benefits of sponsorship solve certain problems best left as limiting constraints
in the game (see the remaining assumptions, which sponsorship would mitigate to
a great degree).

Suicide on a Shoestring (assumption)
Financial resources for operating OpFor must come from operational, independent,
or legal means; currency must not substitute for creativity, planning, or
bootstrapping. Paper trails left by sponsorship would leave footprints for
detection, and would also tend to centralize control of the team (the exact
opposite of this game, see 'organization' below).

No Formal Training (assumption)
While the numbers of ex-military or intelligence available for recruitment is
staggering (primarily because of the aftermarket for their skillset and domain
expertise), an arbitrary constraint for this game is that such specialized
knowledge is not a precondition, but may be acquired by other means. Training
can be acquired on the free market; technical training can be see as university
level (lab skills) with reasonable mechanical skills and the ability to follow
instructions. Note that in the area of 'weapons of mass destruction' (WMD) such
as nuclear, chemical, biological, or information weapons (NCBI), only nuclear
becomes a non-viable option.

Information Environment (assumption)
OpFor players have access to the same information environment that most adults
do--including any observations they might make, access to schedules and other
public information, net access, and a university library. This provides
background research equivalent to open source intelligence on as varied topics
as the technical specifications on the telephone network (Bell Systems Technical
Journals) to explosives and other weaponry. The net isn't the source of so much
'dangerous' material--books and people come first.

Free Market/Black Market Access (assumption)
Depending on geographic location, many essential elements for the OpFor may be
legally or readily available (armament, explosives, chemicals); controlled items
are available on the street, which always finds its own uses. Access to the
black market is not unusual or extraordinary; the greater the regulation of the
'open market,' the great the access to applicable equipment, and the more
uncontrolled/uncontrollable the underground market becomes. This is what drives
the continuing alliance between operational groups such as OpFor and the black
market on a global basis, the mutual reliance on underground networks to
move/supply personnel, equipment, and substances, launder money, etc.

Footsteps (assumption)
There are numerous mechanisms to protect the identities of OpFor players,
including cover legends, fake identification (counterfeit, supplied thanks to
increasing requirements of such id for employment or even travel; or obtained by
'paper tripping' to adopt entirely valid but false identification), and
operational tradecraft (see 'organization' below).


Organization
The mechanism of organization for OpFor is what I have chosen to use to set it
apart from the 'standard' terrorist or guerrilla group. My choice was to design
an organization which can act as a voluntarist heterarchy.

In voluntarist groups every member of the group agrees on the definitions and
intent/mission of the group unanimously; in a heterarchy, authority is
determined by knowledge or function, not position. Group of this sort function
well, as they are small, tightly directed, hard to detect, hard to stop,
camouflage well, and the infosphere/information environment can accommodate any
number 'inside' the same virtual territory.

Tools
Certain tools need to be used according to a certain tradecraft to recruit for
OpFor and communicate between member nodes. These tools can be accessed from any
standard electronic account--anonymous remailer chains, newsgroups and search
tools of them, world wide web pages and search tools of them, ftp points,
Internet Relay Chat and other chat mechanisms, multi-user domains, and mailing
lists. In fact, operation can work entirely from electronic mail and Usenet news
access, the simplest of mechanisms.

Chained Remailers
Remailer nesting with cryptographic wrapping of messages is getting quite
advanced, able to accommodate operational requirements with only a few
additional operational requirements of tradecraft; in particular, the Mixmaster
systems are very robust (see http://www.obscura.com/~loki/ for Lance Cottrell's
excellent work). The threat specification that went into design parameters is
solid:

-All traffic in and out of all remailers is tracked (from, to, filesize, time
in/out);
-Traffic is backtrailed and forward traced to all known senders and receivers;
-An attacker has the same access to any arbitrary remailer as anyone else, and
can attempt to flood any remailer with designed traffic, multisend captured
traffic, or deny traffic (in part or whole);
-Some but not all remailers are compromised, and design specifications are
known.

The Mixmaster design addresses most of the issues of threats technically, and
tradecraft negates the balance if adhered to as follows:

-Key sizes for public key messages (final 'receiver' wrapper) is >= 1024 bits;
-At least six remailers are used in a chain to another e-mail account, at least
three to Usenet news groups;
-Geographic dispersion should be selected so that one or two (in the middle of
the chain) remailers are outside U.S. jurisdiction, preferably in more than one
location;
-Latency and combined traffic levels are sufficient to provide decoy traffic, or
decoy traffic must be generated by the remailer;
-Headers must be stripped, only the receiver knowing (or not, at option) whom
the sender is pseudonymed as;
-Message ids on messages with logging to prevent multisend attacks;
-Messages are split to uniform sizes to prevent filesize tracking.

OpFor Communication: Nodes and Links
A 'paranoid' communication process between member nodes would be to only send
through remailers for OpFor links, with the destination being a newsgroup used
as a dead-drop. Messages can be obtained with no risk; traffic with a
prearranged subject header would be encrypted with a group key, contain the
message to the group or another embedded encrypted message to an individual node
nym. This asymmetry of usage on the remailers would be picked up by a traffic
analysis mapping across the remailers, which may necessitate the adoption of
cover behavior (posting to certain newsgroups) or symmetric usage.

Links could be established (recruiting) through the same forums with messages or
offers intended to attract potential members. As such, operational rules of the
group are again along 'paranoid' lines:

-Assume nodes in the net are compromised by LEA or IC;
-Nodes have entirely local management, control, information, planning,
resources, capabilities, competencies;
-Net is to share knowledge, act as a 'community memory,' not share operational
plans or details.

If the net is compromised by a node, what would the compromised node know? That
the remailers are being used by a 'group.' The private key for the group's
public key messages. The node's message traffic and stored data (assuming the
private key is provided--and maybe not then, if a 'flying dutchman' arrangement
is made to keep incriminating files always on the move through the net). No
operational details. No specifics on other nodes (unless they violated
tradecraft, at which point they get what they asked for), who can drop from the
net at any time tracelessly. Entrapment isn't possible, as there are no
coordinated operations; turning the node or establishing a traitor node offers
no benefit other than participation in the 'community memory' of the group.

This system of organization provides a stable network of dynamic links between
nodes, shelters the internals of the nodes (including substructures, potentially
along other organizing principles, making this a sort of 'intranet for
terrorists'), yet acts to provide a sharing mechanism for knowledge. As new
systems such as 'electronic money' come into usage, the network also gains the
ability to work finances and likely equipment between nodes.


Attacks
Nodes of OpFor will obviously have independent preferences of targets, and
varied capabilities to draw upon, but attacks fall into a small number of basic
categories:

- 'Hard' actions, for OpFor nodes willing to inflict massive destruction and
casualties--truck/car bombs, airplane bombings, weapons of mass destruction,
etc.;

- 'Soft' actions, for OpFor nodes preferring targeted attacks or attacks where
casualties come as collateral damage--assassinations, infrastructural attacks,
etc.;

- 'Wet' actions, for OpFor nodes with the skills necessary to launch information
warfare attacks, propaganda efforts, etc.

Attack profiles are generated and selected by an array of parameters in addition
to the OpFor intent or mission, such as:

Leverage
How much 'bang for your buck' do you get for your invested effort of capability
development, research, planning, resource dedication, execution model,
risk/return? Direct effects, collateral damage, and unintended consequence need
to be 'gamed' out by the OpFor node to optimize operations.

Inverse Relationship Between Casualties and Recognition Strategy
The greater the OpFor node effort toward inflicting casualties, the lower the
likelihood of desire for recognition for the operation; conversely, the greater
the desire for recognition, the lower the effort to inflict casualties (or
direct effort to minimize such). Casualties are counterproductive to a strategy
of recognition for the OpFor objective (the internal disagreements in
organizations such as the Irish Republican Army (RA) over this very point
demonstrate the relationship; note RA actions to warn authorities of actions
past the no-go point, but while time remains to clear the area). Pure terror
efforts are at odds with taking recognition--why put a face or name to the
terrorist? It only provides an external enemy for the target; better to leave
the action unclaimed.

Wirkung im Ziel (Effect in Target)
Depending on the intent of the OpFor node, a careful effort is required to
monitor the effects of operations, not only for feedback on the operational
process, but to meter the force/violence, manage propaganda efforts, and to know
cut-off points when actions must taper back or cease.

Political Opportunism
OpFor groups looking to redefine the social contract usually receive help from
an unexpected quarter--politicians. He who guards the throne is but one step
from it, and faced with an opportunity to reinforce their own position,
politicians' fascist tendencies emerge. 'Anti-terror' measures put into effect
have little functionality or impact on operational groups, instead only enacting
greater societal control; response/retribution actions taken are merely
political posturing for publicity sake (numerous U.S. actions), or used to
disguise other agendas (a continual multi-decade strategy on the part of
Israel).


Targets
OpFor has a multitude of potential targets to choose from, and various methods
to employ operationally (action or credible threat of action):

Communications/Media
Attacks on communications systems (if not narrowly targeted, such as specific
switching points or towers) and the media are counterproductive; they are
necessary for smooth functioning of OpFor organization, and communication of the
messages and actions of OpFor operations. Reliable relationships should be built
with the media, possibly necessitating a secondary communications network to
obscure OpFor identity, but provide media contact. Media outlets are an OpFor
force multiplier when used correctly and to advantage, and the media will
provide their own sizzle. OpFor understanding of the media process/techniques
(media 'hot' and 'cold') and media markets are essential. For example,
operations may be deliberately launched in geographic locations 'in the middle
of nowhere' because there is no media middle-of-nowhere thanks to modern
technology, yet middle-of-nowhere locations will have little to no other
competing news events.

Power Infrastructure
Generating plants and delivery systems for the power grid are not exceedingly
robust, and trigger their own scale-back or shut-down once outside of stringent
tolerances. Denial of service attacks are indirect, but have the virtue of being
simple to effect.

Water
Given the scares of drugs in the water supply in the 60s and 70s, processing
plants are relatively secure; yet nature has found the weakness with extremely
resistant microbial organisms which are not difficult to obtain/culture, and
once introduced into the system, have considerable direct and collateral effect.

Fuel
Numerous, reasonably accessible targets are available--tankers, pipelines,
storage, gas stations, propane storage, tanker trucks, etc. Not difficult to
ignite, such sources provide considerable fire and explosive hazard; planned
effort to attack numerous sites could have frightening effect.

Banks
An essential part of the currency cycle, banks are harder targets from security
and surveillance standpoints. Subtle attacks of information warfare (infowar) or
propaganda (bank runs) may be possible, but creative actions may also be (for
example, a 'malfunctioning' automated teller 'giving away' money would attract
quite a crowd, then susceptible to violence).

Markets/Exchanges
Also potentially susceptible to infowar attacks, these are among the hardest
targets. Historical evidence suggests that operations employing considerable
force or weapons of mass destruction may actually have potential for success.

Air Travel
Circumvention of air/airport security continues on a regular basis; only the
non-functioning airport can be considered secure. X-ray/metal detectors rely on
personnel, and can be fooled by devices with little or no metal; bomb detection
devices look for chemical trails which only changes the selection of the weapon,
from nitrogen-based explosives to chemical weapons for instance; cargo
containers to withstand explosions can be obviated by binary packages, combining
thermite to burn through the container with a device to explode after a delay.
Security procedures securing airports have little effect; too much traffic, ease
of obtaining false id, etc. make airport security procedures an exercise in
wishful thinking.

Rail
Highly attractive targets, rail travel is poorly controlled, easily accessible
across the railsystem, and regularly carries harmful or dangerous substances in,
through, or near populated areas.

Ground
Free access with minimal effective control makes the delivery of car and trucks
bombs relatively simple; tunnels and bridges are particularly vulnerable.
Bussing and commuter rail/subways are similar targets for explosive devices or
weapons of mass destruction.

Schools/Religious Institutions/Administrative Facilities
Ease of public access and the trust of those using the facilities makes them
targets for disguised bombs, booby traps, and weapons of mass destruction--toys
or lunch pails with explosives on a playground, or an attack on a regularly
scheduled religious service, etc.

Emergency Management Systems (Police, Fire, Ambulance)
These groups are particularly susceptible to attack, and provide high-profile
media coverage; anti-personnel booby-traps or firestorm mechanisms could
overwhelm EMS personnel, and provide reluctance of other EMS personnel for
continuing their operations. Ecological warfare (for instance, a plane dropping
chemical-timed thermite pencils while flying over a region, or targeting
refineries and chemical plants) is also possible.

Business (Food, Medical, Misc.)
The dependence on such providers makes the impact of product tampering,
explosive devices, or weapons of mass destruction particularly leveraged.
Shopping malls have near perfect target profiles for weapons of mass destruction
or explosive packages.

Public Events
Concerts, conventions, sporting events, etc. are venues with existing media
coverage, large crowds, and easy access for explosive devices, weapons of mass
destruction, or other attacks.

Government
Little benefit is to be gained by targeting political figures or
organizations--the myths and romanticism surrounding the political domain make
martyrs out of any attack. OpFor nodes wishing to have real effects on society
or organizations need to recognize that political figures have very little
'value add' to society, and are best left in place to add to the confusion. Law
enforcement agency and the intelligence community personnel are open to serious
and subtle attacks, ranging from identity hacking (use or damage to personal
data) to using such data to select and target true 'value added' personnel.


Conclusions--Is this a Credible Scenario?
What competencies are demanded to undertake these sorts of operations by OpFor?
Nothing unrealistically extraordinary--tools for research and planning;
tutorials on explosives, boobytraps, chemical weapons, forensic procedures;
information about societal weaknesses, operational concepts; communication
tools. All these things are available. Where are the personnel for OpFor, the
users of these things?

This is as good a place as any to discuss motivation (briefly mentioned earlier)
and will. Will is a moral determination, a desire, a dedication to purpose. That
purpose may be 'good' or 'bad' (highly subjective terms), but with the will,
there will be a way. Neither law of society or word of God will hamper men of
will. It does no good to make tools like guns illegal--you would have to reach
into every man and wrench out the will to use guns, the very idea of guns, and
then still hope and pray they don't get reinvented. The real need is for when
something triggers that moral determination that the moral compass guiding the
will is one that does not favor chaos or destruction.

Of course, nothing is produced more readily in places like the United States
than disaffected youth. The collapse of a stable, socially prevalent moral
structure is the most critical factor in understanding this sort of potential
future conflict. These people don't need to be recruited--they recruit
themselves. Particularly evident on the Internet (but one could just as easily
point to Los Angeles, Detroit, Washington D.C.) is a desire for the very same
knowledge needed for OpFor--tools, tutorials, weaknesses, operational concepts,
communication tools. Experimentation is occurring on a regular basis (usually
among legal minors, unprosecutable for all practical purposes if caught),
details are exchanged, laws and social graces are broken and flaunted,
reputations and contacts are made (including links to criminal and other
organizations).

What's missing so far are only a few things--either leaders who would create a
purpose inside the subcultures, or triggers that activate groups or make
leaders, men of will. Certainly as time goes on, leaders will emerge to take up
the sword, or members of the subcultures will be triggered by events in their
lives--and then all hell will break loose.

The technology is available. The elements of society are vulnerable. The
personnel are being bred. All that remains is a threshold of will, the boundary
condition, to be crossed.

So I gave up my boyhood,
To drill and to train,
To play my own part in
The Patriot Game.

First Steps Toward a Defense

Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't.
-- Shakespeare, _Hamlet_

I've written a great deal about information warfare and the application of
technology to areas of pursuit such as guerrilla warfare and terrorism. What
about the other side of the coin? Can a defense be mounted? Certainly.

First, a few constraints:

No Reduction of Civil Liberties
Why must security seemingly be purchased at the cost of the liberties that make
life worth living? What have prior purchases of 'security' bought us? Are we
truly safer, more secure? Have crime, terror, and war gone the way of the
dinosaur? Of course not. Therefore I will not posit nor endorse any further
reduction of civil liberties; I will even endeavor to strengthen a few.

No Empty Gestures
The only interpretation one can give to anti- or counter-terror measures, other
than the cynical portrayal of politicians as hidden fascists, is where
politicians are being political--fond of empty gestures. Like chrome on a car,
they serve no purpose; not being a politician, I will pass on the option of
doing something to 'look good' or, Soviet-like, justifying my existence by
taking action, any action, regardless of applicability or utility, not to
mention consequence.

My approach is to propose the initiation of a number of measures and projects to
establish a defense-in-depth approach. Strategic elements fall in the domains of
technology; social policy and initiatives; and military, intelligence, and law
enforcement work. As the name of this article states, these are the first steps;
the threat is developing, and so must the defense. This is like the recognition
of the tank or helicopter on the battlefield; speculation and experimentation at
first, evolving into important, potent tools later--and always playing with
measures/countermeasures along the way.


Technological Steps

Engineering Rigor
Engineering is about trying and failing--then learning from mistakes and trying
again. And again, and so on. Sometimes, in the process of those mistakes, people
die--bridges and buildings collapse, airplanes fall out of the sky, ships sink.
Sometimes the fear of people dying complicates the engineering process to the
point where the process becomes almost unworkable--such as in pharmaceutical
development. Sometimes the conditions engineered for change, or we learn things
that change how we view the problem--like with chemicals, or radiation.

In some fields of technology, there isn't a whole lot of engineering rigor going
around these days. Look at the trouble expected from the switch of the calendar
year to 2000 and you'll see a simple example. You don't know what you don't
know, you don't know and can't adequately plan for the future, and nothing gets
used as it was intended. Technology is hard enough to get working as it is--it
doesn't happen on its own, and if it isn't explicitly built in the hardware or
software, it can't do it. But this should be understood before the
responsibility for large, critical portions of the political economy is passed
over to the machines. This means changes in education of engineers to change the
engineering process--research, development, testing, evaluation, utilization,
consequences.

Safe Fail Designs
From the design phase on out, failure of systems (or subsystems, or remote
systems, or users) should be expected. Not if, when. While not every particular
real world failure can be predicted in advance (nice to know that some element
of human behavior is forever beyond prediction), certainly more effort can be
undertaken. Outside labs such as 'Underwriter Labs' test products, but by then
it is already too late, and they don't test much of what society depends upon
daily. Safe fail designs need to be devolved down into every development
project. This means computer, software, networks; it means all those complex
systems they are part of, and all the systems those systems interact with. And
that's just the start.

Forcing Factors
Forcing factors are design elements that require proper, defined usage for a
system to work. You can't successfully drive a vehicle unless you are in the
right seat for it--this is a physical forcing factor. Security systems use
forcing factors--they require a confrontation before access is allowed (usually
authentication--keys, passwords, token). Forcing factors can be cheap and
effective when built in rather than added later (automotive alarm systems, for
instance). Much of what passes for security has no forcing factors--sleepy
security guards, or locked doors and open windows. Some forcing factors
mis-assess the threat, like protecting a nuclear power reactor from protesters
or takeovers, but leaving critical systems (like cooling circulation systems)
exposed to destruction without having to confront any security measures.

Forcing factors are essential to good secure system design; defense in depth
strategies layer forcing factors to cover each layer's weaknesses and maintain
overall system integrity. Social systems at risk rarely have forcing factors;
there is a trade-off of freedom versus restrictions, but again, such factors are
designed to meet threats, which free, responsible behavior is not.

Hardware/Software Designed for Threat
This is obviously easier said than done. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)
has had long running projects to design and implement secure computing
technology with minimal success--the technology keeps advancing in front of
them. Even as a branch of the government, NSA hasn't had the resources to keep
pace; I personally believe this is why every so often they try to hit the breaks
and slow the juggernaut (see NSA and civilian cryptographic usage policy for an
example). Obviously silly, the approach hasn't a prayer of succeeding, which is
just as well--since it is exactly the wrong strategy.

Some parts of the NSA's approach to security are sound; for instance, the
Rainbow Series advocates going back to the design phase when security flaws are
found. Don't patch the hole, cure the logical design concept that led to it.
Integrity is like a balloon, no matter how good the rubber, the air still leaks
out the hole. This doesn't mean throwing out the unsecured systems we have
now--in fact, a lot of good could be accomplished with a major effort to close
the existing holes in design and implementation (yes, patches). Society needs to
keep functioning while improvements are made, and computers are now essential.
But it means an effort must be started at every major hardware and software
developer, no more pitiful efforts by amateurs. So follows the next point.

Strong Cryptography
Put good, strong, fast cryptography where it is needed--in every computer, on
the motherboard. No key escrow--that just leaves the key management body as
judge, jury, and executioner, not to mention a sitting target; no weakened keys,
that makes cryptography value subtracted--it takes time, but provides no
protection. Crypto such as DES or RSA should be readily available to everyone
with a computer; while we're at it, who knows that there isn't something even
better at the NSA? Open the technology up--get out the strong crypto, security,
authentication, etc. Ship the scientists out from Fort Meade to computer
hardware and software developers, or ship the engineers to Fort Meade, or at
least publish what the market needs to know. Think of it as investing the Cold
War peace dividend to help strengthen the society to weather the next wars.
Moving the national network to a point-to-point session-to-session capability
would be, as they say, a startling development.

Hardened Computers
I don't believe in computer security--I've had too much luck playing the other
side of the field. I don't believe in secure systems, that NSA Orange Book
Platonic Ideal. Go ahead and isolate the computer behind a locked door with no
network connection; you still use an operating system and applications, and
those (and the tools they are built with) aren't built on isolated systems.

I believe in cryptography and communications, and oddly enough, those can be
solutions that work better than obscure technological attempts to prevent data
from doing what it does best--move. That's why crypto is great--let the data
move, but reader makes right. If you haven't got the key in a strong crypto
world, you better get used to the noise.

The impact of crypto on security can be profound--call it cryptosecurity as an
approach:

Data Security
If data is stored or on the move, only you or the intended party/parties can
make sense out of it; whether your recipe for soup or your credit information,
your privacy is yours.

Anti-viral
Software systems can catch the signature of the known virus, but not the
unknown--the first sign of trouble can already be too late. Cryptosecurity stops
viruses by stopping infection or execution. On boot, the operating system can be
confirmed with cryptographic checksums (for instance, DES's Message
Authentication Codes, or MACs for short) prior to execution, as can all
applications; if the MACs don't match those of a 'clean' MAC'ed application, you
don't execute the application. If all stored applications and data is encrypted,
and extra layer of protection is present--decrypting the application or datafile
actually turns the virus into unexecutable noise (since it appended itself into
an encrypted file). The system is necessarily more complex than this (for
instance, maintaining memory maps and referencing against MAC'ed file loads
prior to privileged functions to prevent datafile virus execution, etc.), but
prototyping has shown the process to work effectively.

Anti-malice (virus, hacker)
The hardware needs to trap calls to specified functions (delete, formatting,
etc.) and require a token (a password provided to the hard subsystem, or a
physical key turned) prior to approval.

Miscellaneous Safety Functions
Saves aren't overwrites, but are layered for transaction rollback and
checkpointing--copious storage makes this cost effective in most cases; dense
sites should use WORM drives; backing storage up and frequent checkpointing are
necessary actions; redundant systems are essential in critical systems.

Heterogeneous Systems/Networks
Biodiversity makes for resilient ecosystems, and technodiversity makes for a
resilient infosphere; wide-spread standards make standard attacks that much more
leveraged, and dangerous.

[The specifics on cryptosecurity require significant ongoing research and
development by skilled scientists and engineers, but are encouraging areas to
explore.]


Social Steps

Community Education
Threats and countermeasures need to be explained to all levels--engineers,
students, politicians, business leaders, etc. Disclosures (read 'evangelism') on
cryptography, security, information warfare, terrorism, etc. need to be made.
Such action would reduce the value of moral and material surprise that any
harmful operations against their domain may have. It also enlists the general
community in the cause, rather than leaving them as helpless casualties.

Root Causes
Opposition forces using tactics to effect social change--whether bombs or
bytes--are doing so for a reason. While there are certainly criminal or mentally
ill perpetrators, there are also those who are where they are for a reason. Odd
as it may seem, sometimes the only rational reaction to an irrational situation
is irrational action--or so it seems. Blanket criminalization (including the
truly moronic (and hypocritical) statements such as "We don't deal with
terrorists and criminal elements.") remove options for these players, and give
them no other recourse than to act as criminals (the Nostromo dilemma, see
Joseph Conrad's _Nostromo_: if you are labeled to your detriment, you may as
well act the way they expect you to). The triggers or causes for behavior should
be sought out and dealt with; who knows what possibilities it might create?

Lock Personal Data
You own your data--too much harm can occur to you if your data (credit, medical,
legal, etc.) end up in the wrong hands. Nobody should be able to view your data
without your permission; this process will become much easier when strong crypto
and authentication are more prevalent, but even then, it shouldn't be easy.

Honest Media Relationships
The voice to the people needs to be put to good use; first though, trust needs
to be reestablished. All the players in this game--government, free market,
media--need to stop scare tactics, spin control, hidden agendas, mythmaking, and
personal aggrandizement. The issues are confused enough without making fuel for
every 'Oliver Stone'-esque conspiracy theorist's fire.


Military, Intelligence, Law Enforcement

Jurisdiction
The jurisdictional muddle needs to be cleaned up; how to resolve it will be a
troublesome issue, however. Law enforcement like the FBI see the actors as
criminals, which colors their perceptions and actions more than a little.
Intelligence has a more balanced view of the world, but has a "water's edge"
difficulty, as well as the difficulty of giving clearances to people they may
rather not wish to. The military mindset led to troubles such as we have now
with the NSA, where the priorities are antithetical to solving the problems. The
free market doesn't have the powers, budget, or access to tackle the problem on
its own. The solution is likely some sort of new agency composed of all the
mentioned elements, although the anarchist in me screams against the creation of
yet another body.

Recruit Inside the Community
The paradigm mismatch between how government bodies and the free market (not to
mention the opposition forces) view the issues is crippling. These organizations
need to get 'local guides' who know the language, customs, and terrain. Such
domain expertise would help them to stop making fools of themselves, not to
mention starting to address the problems. It also provides a necessary positive
element of value to the community, one of the reasons why individuals are drawn
in the first place, a need to belong and be valued.

HUMINT
The days of SIGINT strength are already fading; computing power and knowledge
have given the tools to secure themselves to opposition forces that want/need
them. HUMINT sources need to be developed--you learn intent, capabilities,
plans, etc. in advance and possibly on an interactive basis. Of course it's hard
to develop HUMINT sources, but that doesn't mean you don't do it anyway.

Tradecraft
Opposition forces have their tradecraft, but so does intelligence and law
enforcement--shoeleather research, manpower, resources. Certain elements of the
opposition forces' tradecraft are susceptible; for instance, all
senders/receivers of remailer traffic can be studied and mapped, as well as all
traffic flow in the remailer net. It doesn't violate any civil liberties; in
fact, it is almost an expectation (read the remailer threat assessment some
time). Strengths need to be challenged, and weaknesses need to be forced to
failure. This means following the traffic, following the money, etc.

Rapid Response Team
Since the timing is a matter of when, not if, a response should be prepared.
Threats should be modeled, games played, tools built, measures planned--try to
prevent fires, but still have a fire department. Team members should be domain
experts in related fields, but cross-disciplinary enough to handle a widely
divergent set of crises.

Propaganda Countering Team
PsyOps is a critical component of potential future conflicts, and measures need
to be taken to cope with attacks and the aftermath. Nothing cuts through like
the truth, but the team needs to establish trust and earn the reputation capital
in advance to be able to spend it when the crisis hits.


Conclusions
This is, I hope, a living list; measures will be thought up and initiated, and
the feedback loop between opponents will become faster, denser, and more intense
as the years go by.

But--you have to start somewhere, you have to start something, and you have to
start sometime. Why not here, now, and with these?

From:    Ralph McGehee <rmcgehee@IGC.APC.ORG>
Subject: Worldwide Covert Operations

                 WORLDWIDE COVERT OPERATIONS

  A recent diplomatic battle between Cuba and the United States
highlights the worldwide use of U.S.-sponsored human rights groups
by (presumably) the CIA:

     Cuba is expelling Robin Meyer a U.S. diplomat in the
  Political-Economic section whose primary duty was human rights issues.
  The State Department said "during her two years in Cuba, Ms. Meyer has
  openly met with representatives of human rights and independent professional
  groups throughout the island, providing moral support and distributing
  published information...newspapers, magazines and college textbooks on
  government, democracy, international relations and journalism."
  Washington Post 8/20/96 A7

     The United States is determined to maintain contact with dissidents,
  with a declared goal of inciting dissent. Cuba recently refused to renew
  the visa of Robin Meyer, Second Secretary of the U.S. Interests Section
  in Havana, for she supported, organized and united small
  counterrevolutionary groups.  Washington Post 8/22/96 A2

  Robert Gates, a former Director of the CIA, said the CIA uses
human rights issues to subvert other governments. The National
Endowment for Democracy (NED) is the overt implement for creating and
funding these human rights organizations. In 1983, the CIA passed, or
so we were told, many its political action functions to NED
-- supposedly an independent entity but one that is funded by
Congress.

   Events in Cuba prove U.S. organization and management of these groups
for subversion, whether by the State Department or more likely, the CIA.
This leads to the probability that CIA uses NED for cover and that NED's
hundreds of so-called of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) -- many
of them human rights groups, are little more than fronts for the
operations of the CIA.  Since NED sponsors human rights groups
and other NGOs in about 80 countries this creates a massive worldwide
mechanism for subversion.

   A number of countries, other than Cuba, have protested the activities
of NED-CIA's NGOs -- China and Vietnam are good examples. Earlier Vietnam
arrested activists during the visits of two human rights representatives
from the U.S. -- General William Westmoreland and former CIA Director,
William Colby. China this year said the United States was using
human rights as an excuse for subversion and protested the activities of
various U.S.-sponsored groups and individuals -- citing especially
NED-financed Harry WU and his espionage operations.

   In some countries -- such as Burma -- we may agree with the goals
of NED-CIA. But when the Agency uses human rights as a universal cover
for subversion -- no matter what the target, we all will suffer.
(It is important to recall that the Vietnam war was a direct result
of a failed CIA operation.)

   One thing is certain, the people in countries being brought
NED-CIA's gift of democracy will suffer. The record is clear and
unequivocal: CIA operations sustain or empower military or political
elite (the rich and powerful) who frequently decimate poorer societal
elements who are struggling for equality -- labor unionists, students,
liberal politicians, and others. A few of the countries where people
have been murdered as a consequence of CIA operations are: Guatemala,
Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Chile, Vietnam, Laos,
Indonesia, Iran, Afghanistan, Cuba and many others.

   In the case of CUBA, I have extracted a few citations from CIABASE
re the activities of NED-CIA human rights and other groups in that
country.

  Cuba, 84-91 Despite its overt character, the National Endowment for
  Democracy (NED) also engages in extensive covert operations. Dozens
  of U.S. organizations have acted as conduits for NED funds. NED is made
  up of core groups - the National Democratic Institute for International
  Affairs (NDI); National Republican Institute for International
  Affairs (NRI aka IRI); Center for Private Enterprise (CIPE), a branch
  of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and the Free Trade Union Institute,
  an international branch of the AFL-CIO. A host of "private" organizations

Topics of the day:

  1. CIA Director Had Promised to Topple Hussein

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date:    Sun, 8 Sep 1996 20:15:12 GMT
From:    Wayne McGuire <wmcguire@CYBERCOM.NET>
Subject: CIA Director Had Promised to Topple Hussein

Does anyone have any ideas about how accountability
issues play out in a failed project of this kind? Are
there any accountability issues?

Is the President accountable? The CIA director? The
persons conducting the operation directly on the
ground?

Colin Powell, in direct contradiction to John Deutch's
strategic reasoning and assumptions, suggested the
other day that eliminating Hussein would quite probably
not improve matters in the least in Iraq.

From Reuters:

--- BEGIN ---

Sunday September 8 3:04 PM EDT

CIA Director Had Promised to Topple Hussein

LOS ANGELES (Reuter) - Before Saddam Hussein's attack
on the Kurds in northern Iraq, CIA Director John Deutch
had promised that the Iraqi dictator would be toppled
within a year, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.

But Hussein discovered and foiled a $20-million covert
operation to unseat him, the paper reported.

``This is one of the greatest setbacks U.S.
intelligence has ever suffered,'' an anonymous senior
U.S. official told the Times.

The paper offered no details about the personal pledge
by Deutch to dislodge Hussein, but sources described
the six-year intelligence operation as the largest
authorized by Clinton. The plot's failure, those
sources said, put the United States back to square one
in dealing with Hussein.

According to those sources who spoke to the Times,
American intelligence officials had considered a cadre
of Iraqi agents operating inside the country key to the
mission, but those agents have now been exposed, and
many of them executed.

The paper reported that a CIA plot to overthrow Hussein
from within the ranks of his Republican Guard was
uncovered in late June and early July, with hundreds of
military officers arrested and dozens of agents
executed.

``It was an ambitious effort, but it was uncovered long
before it got anywhere,'' a source told the Times. ``It
was basically wiped out in June and July. A lot of
(Iraqi) U.S. agents were killed.''

U.S. intelligence sources now believe Hussein's spies
had penetrated the plot virtually from it's inception,
the paper said.

--- END ---

And here is some interesting opinion on the recent
American military exercise in Iraq from this week's
Forward:

--- BEGIN ---

President Clinton did the right thing in throwing
Tomahawks at Iraq, and there is a logic to making an
enemy's air defenses one's first target. It'll clear
the skies so that we can move in with more devastating
attacks against other targets later, and we'd certainly
like to think that is what Mr. Clinton has in mind.
It's encouraging, too, to see the unilateral nature of
Mr. Clinton's action, particularly because it had--as
The Wall Street Journal pointed out in a devastating
editorial--almost no support from our putative allies,
excepting Britain and Israel. It seems these days that
the less support we have on the European continent, the
better we feel.

--- END --

One wonders who precisely the "we" is in the last
sentence just above. I would imagine that quite a few
Americans, contrary to the editorial viewpoint of the
Forward, are interested in maintaining good relations
with and the support of Europe.

Another recent unilateral action the U.S. has taken
recently is the economic sanctions policy with regard
to trade with Iran--a policy apparently supported
strongly by the current CIA director.

Both policies--one in Iraq and the other Iran--have
been notable failures, based on faulty assumptions and
reasoning, and apparently driven by a narrow
ideological agenda.

I doubt that the attack on Iraq will "spoil" our relations with our
European allies.  Indeed, the French are the most notable critics, and it
has nothing to do with the correctness of our actions; rather, France is
France and has its own particular interests in the region that are served
by remaining somewhat aloof from the attacks.  What I found most
surprising was Japan's support; they have virtually nothing to gain by
voicing support for our attack (although I doubt it will cost them much
either).

The Iran question is truly a dilemma.  On the one hand, Iran does support
groups inimical to our interests in the region, and is becoming
particularly more active in the Gulf.  In addition, I don't think one can
underestimate the bad taste left in the U.S. body politic's mouth
regarding the hostage crisis in 1979-80.  Iran does not appear to make any
conciliatory moves toward the United States, and vice versa.  In the long
run, it would probably be in our interest to once again have a diplomatic
presence in Iran.  How that can be facilitated given the current climate,
however, is the big question.  Interesting, actually, that one could
consider our recent attck on Iraq as "supporting" the Iranian-backed
group.  Could that be the basis for an "understanding"?

Subject: Didion Knows

In her book _The Last Thing He wanted_, Joan Didion cites 1984, as a
pivotalbe year in US history. She says on page 9:

"You know the context, you remember the names. _Theodore Shackley
Clair George Dewey Clarridge Richard Secord Alan Fiers Felix
Rodriquez aka 'Max Gomez' John Hull Southern Air Lake Resources
Stanford Technology Donald Gregg Aquacate Elliot Abrams Robert
Owens aka 'T.C.' llopango aka Cincinnati_ all swimming together
in the glare off the C123 that fell from the sky into Nicaragua"

On page 211 she has a knowledgable insider/politican character
saying:

"In the first place any reference to the so-called contra forces
would be totally inaccurate."..."In the second place any
reference to the so-called resupply would be totally inaccurate"


So Didion knows where the bodies were buried. Anyone out there
willing to fill in the details? Or is one's oath of secracy more
important than the law of of land or even basic morality?

Subject: Re: Didion Knows

        In the first place, the assumption is that Joan's information it
     accurate.  I was in El Salvador during the time she covers in her book
     "Salvador" and have personal knowledge of some of the things she
     covered.  In some cases she repeated outright fabrications, and in
     others she just selectively ommited information to support her view.
       In some cases she was right on.
       But the problem becomes is that she was wrong enough times, and so
     biased in her views that you wind up doubting even those things she
     had correct.  Ever since then I do not use her as a source unless I
     can confirm it elsewhere.

In her book _The Last Thing He wanted_, Joan Didion cites 1984, as a
pivotalbe year in US history. She says on page 9:

"You know the context, you remember the names. _Theodore Shackley
Clair George Dewey Clarridge Richard Secord Alan Fiers Felix
Rodriquez aka 'Max Gomez' John Hull Southern Air Lake Resources
Stanford Technology Donald Gregg Aquacate Elliot Abrams Robert
Owens aka 'T.C.' llopango aka Cincinnati_ all swimming together
in the glare off the C123 that fell from the sky into Nicaragua"

On page 211 she has a knowledgable insider/politican character
saying:

"In the first place any reference to the so-called contra forces
would be totally inaccurate."..."In the second place any
reference to the so-called resupply would be totally inaccurate"


So Didion knows where the bodies were buried. Anyone out there
willing to fill in the details? Or is one's oath of secracy more
important than the law of of land or even basic morality?

I'm glad that you noticed the irony that our recent
military exercise at the bottom line could easily be
read as pro-Iranian in nature.

What this illustrates to me is that our Mideast policy
is being driven by a good deal of emotion and little
thought or strategic consistency. I doubt that the
Clinton Administration or our current CIA leadership is
thinking very deeply about the important issues you
raise.

There is a "big picture" problem here: important
elements within the American national security
community and the American big media have made a very
bad and, in my estimation, a very stupid decision: they
are trying to replace Nazism and Communism with Islam
as the primary target for a Western holy war against
the forces of darkness.

Few people in leadership positions in the American
government seem to have the guts to point out that the
emperor has no clothes and that this policy is poorly
thought out and is in fact--crazy. It is not in the
American interest to make enemies of the world's one
billion Muslims, and it is not likely that a major
world religion like Islam is going to disappear from
the face of the earth as easily as Nazism or Communism,
neither ideology of which survived for more than a few
decades.

We may well be asking in the future: Who lost Iran? Who
lost Turkey? Who lost Saudi Arabia? Who lost Egypt? Who
lost the Mideast? Who lost Europe? I wouldn't want to
be in the shoes of the parties who were responsible for
the losses.

In the meantime we have the problem of accountability
for the botched effort to topple Hussein.

We are not back to square one, as the Reuters article
suggests. It is much worse than that--we are now in a
very deep hole. The whole region has been put on alert
that the U.S. is playing the same covert action games
which helped lose us Iran in the first place. Every
American and every American connection in the region is
now going to be triply scrutinized by the forces the
CIA has been caught running operations against.

Was this failed operation dreamed up by John Deutch?
The American people have a right to know. They also
have a right to know much more about his political
history, his political connections and his political
agenda.

   A summary review of information on CIA and the Kurds
from CIABASE files.

Ralph McGehee
9/9/96

  Iraq,  96  DCI Deutch promised to topple Hussein before Saddam's attack on
  Kurds in northern Iraq. Deutch had promised that the Iraqi dictator would
  be toppled within a year. but Hussein discovered and foiled a $20-million
  covert op to unseat him. this is one of the greatest setbacks U.S.
  intel has ever suffered, an anonymous senior U.S. official told the
  los angeles times. paper said the six-year op was one the largest
  authorized by Clinton. U.S. intel officials had considered a cadre of
  Iraqi agents operating inside Iraq key  to the mission, but those agents
  have now been exposed, and many executed. A CIA plot to overthrow
  Hussein from within ranks of his republican guard
  was uncovered in late June and early July, with hundreds of military
  officers arrested and dozens of agents executed. ``it was an ambitious
  effort, but it was uncovered long before it got anywhere...'' ``it was
  basically wiped out in june and july. a lot of (Iraqi) U.S. agents were
  killed.'' U.S. intel sources now believe Hussein's spies had penetrated
  plot virtually from it's inception. reuters 9/8/96

  Iraq,  95-96  Saddam foils military coup. 50 officers arrested in plot.
  Iraqi dissidents and arab sources said Saddam Hussein has foiled a coup
  attempt by disgruntled military officers. dissidents reached in jordan,
  said all suspects are sunni muslims. washington times 7/13/96 a5

  Iraq to overthrow IraqI president Saddam Hussein left Iraq last week as
  Iraqi forces moved into irbil. new york times 9/7/96; enn daily report

  defected to the U.S.-financed umbrella opposition group. washington post

  accord is working feverishly to implement the latest CIA-backed plan to
  topple Saddam. they have a radio station, al-mustaqbal or "the future."

  6/23/96 a1,27

  Iraq, Kurdistan,  96  a bloody CIA covert op with its cover blown sky high.
  Iraqi democrats promised significant help in toppling Saddam five years ago
  are now in despair. Kurdistan is facing a general collapse. the Kurdish
  regional gvt that was supposed to have displaced baghdad's rule over an
  area of 3.5 million people has disintegrated. Kurdish leaders massoud
  barzani and jalal talabani have been fighting each other rather than
  cooperating to topple Saddam. most embarrassing U.S. failure in Kurdistan
  is that of CIA, which backed the wrong horse. the CIA centered its covert
  program styled as the Iraqi national accord, or wafaq in arabic. accords
  leaders were once Saddam's cronies. the leaders promised they could mount a
  quick coup. they failed. one of the key bomb-makers disclosed publicly that
  bombs financed by CIA have killed scores of Iraqi civilians in baghdad and
  destroyed hqs of rival national congress in salahedin. this represents an
  all too familiar failure by CIA. CIA defends its covert programs by saying
  it has to deal with people who are not angels. what it does not explain is
  why it consistently deals with corrupt incompetents. op-ed by jim hoagland
  washington post 3/31/96 c7

  Iraq,  91-96  a british newspaper accused the U.S. of helping to fund an
  Iraqi opposition group's bombing campaign that has killed at least 100
  people since the persian gulf war. the daily independent said it received a
  videotape in which the chief bomb-maker of Iraqi national accord, abu amneh
  al-khadami, talks about the bombing campaign and his fears of betrayal.
  Iraqi national accord, or ina, is ``heavily sponsored by the United States
  and under the influence of the CIA.'' newspaper said it received videotape
  from an Iraqi dissident. al-khadami had apparently sent copies of the tape
  to various opposition members to help drum up support for his claim that
  his superiors had betrayed him. the group also has offices in northern Iraq
  and -- since february -- in the jordanian capital amman. but other Iraqi
  opposition sources in london said the ina was set up immediately after the
  1991 war, mainly by defectors from the arab baath socialist party of
  president Saddam Hussein. ina is loosely affiliated with the biggest
  opposition umbrella group, the Iraqi national congress, or inc. in the
  video, al-khadami accuses his superior, adnan mohammed al-nuri, a former
  Iraqi army general, of working for Iraqi intel. al-khadami also complains
  of being underpaid for bombings and accuses al-nuri of stealing money. ``we
  blew up a car and we were supposed to get $2,000, but adnan gave us
  $1,000.'' ``we caused several explosions in baghdad,'' he adds. last year
  the CIA asked the U.S. congress for $15 million for covert ops against Iraq
  and named the inc as the main beneficiary. aziz alyan, another spokesman
  for the inc, told upi last year that although his group does not receive
  any money from the CIA, he could not vouch for individual members and
  organizations affiliated to the congress. another Iraqi opposition figure
  said tuesday, ``it is common knowledge among Iraqi dissidents that the
  accord is directly financed by the CIA.'' in a related development tuesday,
  an Iraqi opposition group said it detonated a bomb that extensively damaged
  the regional governorate offices in the southern province of nassiriyah.

  turkey,  95  a quiet visit by CIA chief. on 22 july, after two days of
  official but unpublicized talks with prime minister tansu ciller and
  foreign minister erdal inonu, CIA director john Deutch left turkey. the
  topic of discussion was turkey's Kurdish problem and the fighting between
  rival Iraqi Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. this clearly means Deutch and
  the CIA were organizing the secret Kurd meeting which took place recently
  in ireland. intelligence - a computerized intelligence newsletter published

Raymond,

I guess you are right on. My problem is that of the outsider
looking at a deliberate wilderness of mirrors.

I guess insiders may not know either, as they may not have had
the need. Those that did, can't say.

Nevertheless, the dollars involved far exceed any amount the
Contra or the Salvador death squad outfits could have used, as
the c's seemed to have never fought any battles of note and
bullets used are not that dear. Likewise the resupply effort was
not great as they may have never exhausted the original supplies.

Take the amount the hard numbers: a 30 billion annual cocaine
business and you exceed the c funding by what the science boys
call an order of magnitude, perhaps two.

All of which makes me wonder how many patriots got rich as a result of
Cincinnati?

Subject: Jan Nowak

Greetings from Munich.

Yesterday, 9 September, Jan Nowak received the Medal of Freedom
from President Clinton. Clinton said this about Jan Nowak,

In World War II, he risked everything to carry vital information to the
allies.  After the Nazis' defeat, he saw his native Poland once again in
the grip of oppression and he vowed to break it.  For 25 years he was a
dominant voice in Radio Free Europe, the great beacon of hope that
brought so many people through the dark hours of communism.  He
continued to fight until the day he saw freedom triumph over tyranny.
In America, his commitment to the ideal of democracy continues to
inspire us all, and I can tell you that his inspiration is still felt in
his native Poland where the people will never forget what he did and
what he stood for.  (Applause.)



Here is a little Cold War Story about Jan Nowak:


From "Broadcasting and Detente" by Gerhard Wettig, London, 1977:

The Secret Service takes a hand

The Polish resolution of 1968-to work for the closing down of Radio Free
Europe, which in practice meant the closing of Radio Liberty as well-gave rise
to plans of action conceived on a long-term scale. Along with the use of
diplomatic means of bringing pressure to bear, particular emphasis was laid on
subversive methods. The principal theatre for these operations was to be the
United States. A secret detachment under the direction of Ryszard Frelek, one
of the PVAP secretaries, was founded and provided with considerable financial
resources. The plan of action covered several years.

The operations undertaken were mostly of the "D" type-i.e. they aimed at
supplying the political opponent with misleading information
(desinformatsiia).

In all the Warsaw Pact states, special D-sections had long been active within
the ranks of the secret service organisations. Up to 1968, a key role had been
allotted to the Czechoslovak "Disinformation" apparatus, the activities of
which were carried on under rigorous Soviet control.

In the wake of the 1968 events, however, the Czechoslovak secret service lost
its inner unity and was thereafter no longer regarded in Moscow as reliable,
in spite of far-reaching purges. The Soviet Union was unwilling to be directly
involved in these operations which, in spite of every precaution, always ran
the risk of being discovered; so the job was allotted to the Polish secret
service.

The first step was to expand the D-section in Warsaw. In 1970, the Dzierzynski
Military-Political Academy and, in 1972, the Civil Service Academy instituted
special faculties of "misinformation" entrusted with the training of
specialised cadres. Extensive facilities were laid on for the fabrication of
false information designed to mislead individuals, groups or public opinion in
Western countries in general. Soviet advisers kept an eye on all the
D-section's activities.


"D"-Action by Poland

Towards the end of 1972, the Polish secret service started to bend its efforts
towards persuading the American Congress once and for all to close down Radio
Liberty and Radio Free Europe.

A commando unit broke into the Chicago home of Anton Leszczynski,
Editor-in-Chief of the biggest Polish language newspaper in the United States,
and stole two letters which he had received fromJan Nowak, the head of the
Polish Service in Radio Free Europe. A few weeks later, the Polish press
published facsimiles of the first letter and the beginning of the second, to
which was added the facsimile of another, forged letter, which the reader
would not, of course, be able to distinguish from the real ones.

It was so arranged that copies of the two stolen letters and of the forgery,
part of which had been published in Warsaw, found their way into Senator
Fulbright's hands.

The two genuine letters contained remarks about the "ambivalent policies"
pursued by Senator Case and the negative attitude of Senator Fulbright, and
doubts as to the expediency of the discussions concerning the participation of
other countries in the financing of the Munich radio stations; the hope was
also expressed that both American political parties would take the side of
Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe....

Bob,

Did you intend to send the following message to the
entire list? It is an excellent message, and I think
you should share your thoughts.

Quick reply: I don't think that Deutch and Clinton
necessarily did anything illegal, but I do think they
did something stupid. Government leaders need to be
held accountable for doing stupid as well as illegal
things.

I agree entirely with you that we need Iraq as a buffer
against Iran, and that the less we meddle crudely in
the politics of the region without understanding
clearly the outcomes, the better.

before the snip, I'd say you might be on to something.  The second part,
though, I'd argue with.  The biggest critics of "Islamic Fundamentalism"
recently have been Algiers and Cairo (witness the uproar over a certain
conference in London).  The "Big Media" as you put it does not drive the
issues.  We are a long way from a Hearstian "You supply the pictures, I'll
supply the war."  I think they since a story that hits a nerve, and simply
follow it.

This would be fine except it really gives short schrift to elements in
Islam that are truly anti-Western.  And they were that way even when some
of them were being supported by the U.S. (in Afghanistan, for instance).

I disagree. Moderate Arab governments are indeed
concerned (to say the least) about "Islamic
fundamentalism," but important elements in the American
big media are waging a crude campaign to expand the
hysteria about Islamic fundamentalism into hysteria
about Islam and Arabs in general. The fashionable word
these days is "Islamism." How the propaganda campaign
is working is through a clever semantic shift gradually
to ease the discussion from Islamic fundamentalism to
"Islamism" to Islam, period, where Islam is demonized
as the new Nazism or Communism.

Hollywood has been particularly crude in recent years
in pushing images of demonic Muslims and Arabs that
make no distinctions between fundamentalists and
non-fundamentalists. A number of research centers have
been tracking this campaign.

Ted Koppel's Nightline, which is closely associated
with the neoconservative political forces that I
suspect are feeding John Deutch many of his ideas, has
been pushing the anti-Islam line for many years now.

Is there an important Israeli factor and interest
behind the campaign? The question hardly needs to be
asked. Israel presently views Islam as its most
dangerous enemy, and desperately requires the economic,
political and military support of the U.S. to prop it
up against this threat. Hence, in large part, the
campaign by neoconservatives to replace the Soviet
Union with Islam as the primary enemy of the United
States.

For reasons mentioned in my previous message, I think
that this is a campaign that is going to backfire badly
on American interests. Islam is not an ideology which
is going to be dismantled and crushed like Nazism or
Communism. America is going to have to learn to get
along with the world's one billion Muslims.

My credentials in criticizing Islam are solid, by the
way. I was outraged by the death sentence handed down
by Iran on Salman Rushdie, and was prepared to see the
U.S. go to war if Muslim zealots followed through on
any of their threats to terrorize American publishers
and bookstores regarding the Rushdie affair.

But we have to distinguish carefully between defending
American values on American soil from the terrorism of
Islamic fundamentalists on the one hand, and America
aggressively trying to dictate to other states around
the world about how to organize their cultures and run
their affairs on the other.

If America becomes too heavy-handed in trying to
manipulate foreign governments, our efforts will merely
play into the hands of the fundamentalists. This is how
we lost Iran in the first place, and how we are quite
likely to lose Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

Our best policy in regard to Islamic fundamentalism in
the Middle East is to do as little as possible to
inflame it and to accord mainstream Islam the same
respect we give Christianity and Judaism. Rather than
taking the messianic attitude that modern democracy is
something that we need shove down the throats of
traditional Muslim cultures, we should quietly try to
share the best features of American culture with these
cultures, while admitting our own shortcomings.

From:    Richard Cummings <100662.3357@COMPUSERVE.COM>
Subject: In Commeration of Georgi Markov

Greetings from Munich.

        18 years ago today, 11 September 1978, after days of delirium, pain,
and suffering, Georgi Markov died at age 49.  The preliminary diagnosis
indicated that Markov died of "septicemia, a form of blood poisoning caused by
bacterial toxins, possibly a result of kidney failure."

For those who forgot, here is a summary of what happened:

        Thursday, 7 September 1978, was Zhivkov's 67th birthday, Georgi Markov
worked a double shift at the BBC.  After working the early morning shift, he
went home for rest and lunch.  He drove from home to a parking lot on the
south side of Waterloo Bridge.  It was his habit to then take a bus across the
half-mile bridge to the BBC headquarters in the large building known as Bush
House.
        After parking his green Citroen in a parking lot near the Bridge, he
climbed the stairs to the bus stop.  As he neared the queue of people waiting
for the bus, he experienced a sudden stinging pain in the back of his right
thigh.  He turned quickly and saw a man bending to pick up a dropped umbrella.
He was facing away from Markov and simply said to Markov, "I'm sorry," in a
foreign accent, according to Markov.  This unknown man then hailed a taxi
parked nearby.  Markov later described the man as heavy set and about forty
years old.
        Though in pain, Georgi Markov continued to work.  The pain continued
and Markov noticed a small blood spot on his jeans. Markov told some
colleagues at BBC what had happened to him and showed one friend a pimple-like
red swelling on his thigh.  He finished his shift, went home that night and
developed a high fever.
        His wife called a colleague at BBC, who took Markov to a London
hospital, where he was treated for an undetermined form of blood poisoning.
His condition worsened and did not respond to doctors' efforts.  The next day
he went into shock, and for three days his body fought the poison.  The
medical teams were unable to diagnose the cause of his illness.
        Various newspapers in London carried the story of Markov's death as
front page news, with embellished headlines: "Poison Brolly (umbrella) Murder
Riddle" and "Defector Riddle or Death by Dart." Markov's colleagues at BBC
notified Scotland Yard that they suspected murder.  Scotland Yard began an
investigation into Markov's death.
        Doctors performed an autopsy Tuesday morning, at Wandsworth Public
Mortuary.  One doctor removed large blocks of tissue from both of Markov's
thighs for comparison, including the area from the right thigh that had an
unexplained two millimeter puncture wound.  As two other doctors were
examining the tissue on a porcelain autopsy table, they found a tiny metal
pinhead in the puncture, which they assumed had been placed there to mark the
location of the wound.  When they attempted to extract the "pin," a tiny
pellet moved across the tissue and fell onto the table.   They examined the
pellet closely under a microscope and saw holes. One doctor then called
Scotland Yard and gave their findings.
        A police team went to the mortuary, retrieved the pieces of Markov's
thigh and the tiny pellet, and took them to the  Chemical and Micro biological
Warfare Establishment at Porton Down, commonly called the "germ warfare
center." There, a team of the England's foremost specialists in forensic
medicine, and, reportedly, Dr. Christopher Green of the Central Intelligence
Agency, examined the tissue and the pellet.
        They found that two 0.34 mm holes had been drilled, possibly using a
high-technology  laser at right angles to each other, producing an X-shaped
cavity in the pellet.  When the pellet was examined, the holes were empty.
Thus the medical specialists had no evidence as to what type of poison was
used.  The medical team estimated that only 0.2 milligrams of an unknown
poison was used.  A police  spokesman announced that Markov had "not died of
natural  causes." British Anti-Terrorist Squad (BATS), detectives then joined
the Scotland Yard investigating team.
        After weeks of research and experimentation, in January 1979, a
Coroner's Inquest in London ruled that Georgi Markov had been murdered by use
of the poison ricin. Onr medical researcher said that "ricin is twice as
deadly as cobra venom and has no antidote." Ricin was injected into a pig that
developed the same symptoms as Markov and died 24 hours later, according to
another witness.  A Scotland Yard detective said that the investigation team
had traveled to France, Italy, Germany, and the U.S.  Yet, there were no
suspects.  The Coroner, Gavin Thurston, ruled that Markov had "been unlawfully
killed."
        His killer has never been identified and no one has ever been brought
to trial for the killing of Georgi Markov.  The epitaph on his grave in
England reads:

In Memory of Georgi Ivanov Markov
Novelist & Playwright

Subject: More on Georgi Markov's Death

Greetings from Munich.

I was asked to add more details about Georgi Markov and the reason
why he was killed 18 years ago in London. Here is a longer summary from
my article entitled "Code Name Piccadilly," which was published in
Intelligence N. 28, 8 January 1996 in Paris.  The more detailed and
lengthy article can probably be obtained from the publisher Olivier
Schmidt via oschmidt@dialup.francenet.fr, and who is member of our List.

...

The assassin used ricin, perhaps the deadliest of biotoxins, in broad
daylight on a heavily-used bridge in Central London.  Bulgarian emigre
Georgi Markov was killed in a unique case of political murder during the
Cold War: a joint-venture between the Bulgarian and Soviet Union
political and intelligence leaders.

Two former KGB officers, Kalugin and Gordievsky, publicly declared
Soviet complicity in the murder.  Purportedly, the highly secret KGB
laboratory known as the  "Chambe," developed both the weapon, concealed
in US-manufactured umbrellas, and biotoxin ricin impregnated in a
wax-coated pellet the size of a pin head.

Ricin reportedly is one hundred times more lethal than cobra venom. One
ounce of this lethal toxin will kill 90,000 persons.  One medical
opinion is that less than one millionth of a gram absorbed through the
mucous membranes of the eye could kill a person.  British scientists
estimate that only 450 micrograms were used to kill Markov.  Bulgarian
agents had tested the weapon by injecting ricin into a horse and a
prisoner. The horse died; the prisoner luckily survived, for yet unknown
reasons.

Markov was an acclaimed novelist and playwright in Bulgaria prior to his
defection to the West in 1969. He settled in England and became a
broadcast journalist for Radio Free Europe, the British Broadcasting
Company (BBC), and the German international broadcast service Deutsche
Welle.

Georgi Markov had a large listening audience, estimated to be 66 percent
of the adult population, who listened to his prime-time Sunday night
broadcasts over Radio Free Europe.  He dared to tell his audience that
Bulgarian President and Communist Party chief Zhivkov wore no clothes.
He was destroying the Cult of Personality, week-to-week. He, also, was
an inspiration to the nascent dissident movement in Bulgaria.

According to one Bulgarian investigator, in June 1977, Communist Party
Chairman Todor Zhivkov chaired a Politburo meeting, and stated he wanted
the anti-Bulgarian activities of Markov stopped.  The Interior Minister,
Stoyanov, reacted and requested KGB assistance in the killing of Markov.
 Though he wanted Markov killed, he wanted no trace to Bulgaria.  The
Chairman of the KGB Yuri Andropov agreed to the assassination, though
there was to be no trace back to the Soviets.  Thus, the Bulgarians and
Soviets were operating under a double case of plausible denial.

Until his death, Markov persisted and peeled away the artichoke leaves
of lies and corruption in Bulgaria. Markov received various warnings and
anonymous threats to stop broadcasting his inside knowledge of Zhivkov
and the obsequious circles of Bulgarian intellectuals and government
officials.

A grotesque black comedy followed with three attempts to kill Markov in
1978.  The first attempt was in Munich in the Spring, when Markov
visited friends and colleagues at Radio Free Europe.  An agent failed in
an attempt to put a toxin in Markov's drink at a dinner party held in
his honor.  The second failed attempt was on the Italian island Sardinia
while Markov enjoyed a summer vacation with his family.  The final and
successful attempt was in London on President Zhivkov's birthday
September 7, 1978.

.
The case lay dormant until after the fall of the Communist regime in
Bulgaria in 1989.  President Zhelev, Bulgaria's first democratically
chosen president, made a state visit to England in 1991.  He attended a
memorial service and placed flowers on Markov's grave. He faced the
small gathering, including Markov's wife and daughter, and said, "I hope
Bulgarian authorities will soon reach some conclusions on who was
responsible.  The killing has shamed Bulgaria and mars it's reputation
abroad."

Bulgarian and Scotland Yard officials afterward enthusiastically
investigated the case.  A former Bulgarian Internal Ministry General was
arreast, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to jail for destroying
seventeen volumes of material.  He said the 3,500 pages were
unimportant.  Another general committed suicide rather than face trial
also for destroying the documents.  Bulgarian officials boldly,
over-optimistically, and prematurely said more arrests were imminent,
including the assassin.

The Bulgarians reportedly used a low-level Italian criminal with the
code name PICCADILLY.  In 1993, he was located and questioned in Denmark
by both Scotland Yard and Bulgarian investigators about his involvement
in the Markov murder. But he fled Denmark after being interrogated and
lived temporarily in Hungary and the Czech Republic; his present
whereabouts are unknown.

Over a year ago, British Parliament asked Russia to produce information
about 15 KGB agents who might have been involved in or had knowledge of
the murder.  To the best of my knowledge, the request remains
unanswered.

Last year, the Bulgarian Communist Party, reborn as the Socialist Party,
regained power in the Parliament.  The Socialist government issued a
White Paper on the State of Bulgaria's Foreign Relations.  In part, the
Socialists blamed the previous government of the now minority Democratic
Party for "the self-denigrating confession to crimes . . . and to the
concurrent link of the name of Bulgaria with the tragic death of Georgi
Markov, without a final and unequivocal explanation of the incident."

The Markov murder case remains officially unsolved.  No one has been
brought to justice for the murder of Georgi Markov, though prima facie
evidence points to Bulgarian and Soviet agents.

Subject: Re: CIA and FOIA

Dear David K:

   Your experience is not at all unique. The CIA is one
of the least responsive of all government agencies re FOIA
requests. In a related sphere, a professor of history at Rutgers
University, chairman of the State Department's Historical Advisory
Committee, Warren F. Kimball, wrote a letter to the editor of the
New York Times (8/23/96) protesting CIA lack of promised cooperation
in declassifying and releasing documents.

   I would advise that you seek help in preparing your appeal --
the ACLU in D.C. might assist.  Also ACLU publishes guides to
filing and appealing FOIA requests. (Phone Number 202 994 7060).
In any case you should anticipate a long, drawn-out battle, that may
produce little. (I also filed FOIA requests with little result.)

Regards,

Ralph McGehee

Just my 2 cents, and I hate to have to suggest this, but is it
possible that the new kids who run the CIA just quite simply do not
have any idea about what you two are talking about? The name Colby is
a certainly known in today's CIA, but Nhu? Who the hell is that? I
don't like having to suggest this angle, but have a feeling that there
is something in it.

Another angle is simply that there are no CIA records of conversations
between Colby and Nhu. It is possible, isn't it?

   Congress some time ago exempted CIA operational files from the
provisions of FOIA unless such involved illegal activities.  Catch-22
is how can you prove illegal activity without some sort of access to
those files.

   As Chief of Station in Saigon, Colby's activities would be
well-documented in operational files.  His conversations with Nhu
would have been reported both operationally and to a lesser degree via
intelligence reports -- with the latter the sourcing would be
obfuscated.  The Agency's operational files are maintained under
variety of names and would take a dedicated search to find the proper
files -- once found they would be a goldmine.  But since they are
operational, they are automatically exempt from FOIA.

   Incidentally another historian involved in preparing the official
history of U.S. foreign relations also resigned and said:  I cannot
protect the integrity of [foreign relations of US] series. Warren
Cohen, professor history at Michigan State, said re his resignation as
chairman of Department of State advisory committee of outside
scholars, in protest of the intelligence community's deletion of
historical documents on "security grounds." duke u. historian bruce
kuniholm said withholding "constitutes a gross misrepresentation of
historical record, sufficient to deserve label of fraud."  Washington

Topics of the day:

  1. Saddam: Master of Reality (apologies to O.O. and T.I.) (2)
  2. Dealing With Iraq

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date:    Fri, 13 Sep 1996 09:08:24 +0500
From:    "David M. Birdsey" <davidm@PAKNET1.PTC.PK>
Subject: Saddam: Master of Reality (apologies to O.O. and T.I.)

Saddam's excursion into the north has been a masterful stroke of political
maneuvering.  By taking a fairly low-risk step by supporting one Kurdish
faction over another, he has set in concrete a split within an unruly
minority that was troubling him even before the Gulf War (classic "divide
and conquer") and tested the mettle of the coalition that defeated him in
1991.  His actions show an uncanny knack for international politics.

Saddam's brinksmanship has shown that small, incremental steps can be
successful in the face of a coalition where one member has elected to do
the "lion's share" of the work because of the obvious potential threat to
its interests.  This "Free Rider" phenomenon allows those countries with
their interests also at stake to claim "the moral high ground," either
remaining silent or even actively condemning U.S. actions, all the while
breathing a sigh of relief that someone else is taking action.

In my opinion, Saddam's intervention in the north and his declaration of
the "No Fly Zones" as null and void are the first steps on the way back to
a long-term strategy of getting Kuwait to knuckle under to its neighbor to
the north.  He is counting on continued world public opinion remaining
against U.S. attacks.  He is wagering that what coalition support there is
for maintaining the "No Fly Zones" will disappear.

For example, if he succeeds in downing a French plane (still patrolling
the old "No Fly Zones"), he may offer some "concession" (if the pilot is
captured alive, for instance, immediately release him, and blame the U.S.
for France's being "caught up" in a trap of "U.S. Aggression").  Public
support for U.S. actions in France has been lukewarm at best, and Saddam
probably sees Paris as the weak link in the coalition.  If he downs a U.S.
plane, support for any "disproportionate response" is not likely to be
forthcoming from any quarter, further splitting the coalition.  Cost to
Saddam: some tactical assets lost (air defenses, maybe some C3I facilities
in Baghdad) but nothing he really values.  In other words, the U.S.
continues to "win" the battles while the strategic situation deteriorates
further.

At the same time, he has already had a tactical victory in dismembering a
source of opposition to the north, and rightly sees that there is nothing
that the U.S. will be able to do to reverse it.  Airstrikes are unlikely
to resolve the split between the Kurdish factions, and bad press (and
possibly, bad ops) regarding covert operations in the north to shore up
resistence there will make it highly unlikely that new covert initiatives
(the only obvious means of reversing his gains in the short run IMHO) will
be launched.  My own opinion is that covert operations there are exactly
what the doctor ordered.  That they failed should be a condemnation of
poor planning, not covert operations as a concept.

In sum, Saddam is demonstrating that he is well aware of the intricacies
of international relations and how to exploit them.  A U.S. hamstrung by
its democratic values and basic (and demonstrated) concern to avoid both
friendly and Iraqi casualties (and I am NOT suggesting it should be
otherwise) is going to have a tough row to hoe in dealing with this master
of realpolitik.

Opinions, as usual, my own.

Perhaps you are giving too much credit to Saddam's
brilliance and too little credit to the Clinton
Administration's lack thereof.

I have seen no coherent explanation of what precisely
it is America wants to accomplish in Iraq and the
Mideast in general.

I have seen no coherent explanation of what primary
strategic objective John Deutch had in mind when he
invested $20 million in a failed campaign to overthrow
Saddam. That CIA covert operation, by the way--which
apparently was as laughably overt as Israel's
disastrous Lavon operation in Egypt a few decades
ago--no doubt was a key factor in precipitating the
current crisis.

I have been looking for the explanations, but I can't
seem to find them. Have you? It looks to me like
Clinton and Deutch are floundering and foundering. You
can't get somewhere unless you know where you are
going.

We are moving ever closer to a situation in which the
big question in the U.S. is going to be, who lost the
Mideast? Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia, as well as
France and many other nations, are highly skeptical of
whatever policy we think we have. America in recent
years has been pushed farther and farther outside the
orbit of the global consensus on Mideast politics.
Eventually the bill is going to come due for being so
out of step with the rest of the world.

Subject: Dealing With Iraq

Livingstone is an author, lecturer and media
commentator on national-security issues.

Wednesday, September 4, 01:25 PM
By Neil C. Livingstone Special to Newsday


Since 1991, the United States has hit Iraq militarily three
times. The first time was the Persian Gulf war, the second
following an Iraqi plot to assassinate President Bush
during a visit to Kuwait and now comes missile
attacks in retaliation for Iraqi strongman Saddam
Hussein's military thrust into the internationally protected
Kurdish zone in northern Iraq.

Among Mideast and military experts, there is growing
apprehension over the wisdom of actions such as those
taken by President Clinton this week. American ships and
warplanes fired missiles at more than a dozen targets
in Iraq. In addition, the United States expanded the no-fly
zone in the southern part of the country and the United
Nations has put a hold on a forthcoming one-time sale of
Iraqi oil for ``humanitarian'' reasons. According to the
Pentagon, the targets that were struck were chosen to
make it easier to enforce the expanded no-fly zone and
deny Hussein two key air bases that lie within the zone.

Hussein, however, is nothing if not unpredictable. If
pushed hard enough and long enough, there is no telling
how he might lash out against either the United States or
his immediate neighbors. With the strongest military
machine in the region, despite the losses he suffered
during the gulf war, he is entirely capable of invading
Kuwait again, and most observers doubt whether the
United States would be willing to fight a second war to
liberate the oil-rich gulf sheikhdom. Nor is there much
likelihood that the broad-based coalition that prosecuted
the first war against Hussein can be reassembled.

Hussein might also unleash widespread terrorist attacks
against U.S. targets in this country and abroad in
retaliation for the American strikes. Baghdad remains a
terrorist center, and suspicion continues that the
alleged mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing,
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, may have been an Iraqi agent who
engaged a group of duplicitous Islamic fundamentalists
to carry out his murderous designs.

There is also reason to believe that Hussein has
managed to hide some of his stocks of chemical and
biological agents. If so, terrorists could be used
as proxies to strike civilian populations outside Iraq with
these doomsday weapons. And, if recent terrorist
incidents are any gauge, affixing blame for individual
terrorist attacks is often very difficult.

The current American policy reminds one of running up
to a large bear and jabbing it with a sharp stick. It isn't
going to stop the bear but it certainly will make the bear
very angry. With this in mind, U.S. allies in the Arab
world have greeted the American military action with
dismay and, in some cases, thinly disguised hostility.
Either get rid of Hussein or learn to live with him,
they repeatedly have told American officials in private.
Do anything, but don't consistently antagonize him.

A policy of graduated response to Hussein's outrages,
they maintain, only raises tensions and increases
instability within the region. This is in direct
contradiction to U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry,
who asserted yesterday that the American military action
would actually promote regional stability.

Our allies, especially in the Mideast, respect strength
above all else. The United States is not showing strength
in the way it is dealing with Hussein, but rather weakness
and vacillation.

It should also be noted that this week's punitive attacks
do nothing to address the situation in northern Iraq that
lies at the root of the crisis. Iraqi troops remain near Irbil
and several other key cities, and the pro-Iraqi
Kurdish faction that initially requested Baghdad's support
has scored significant political and military gains thanks
to Hussein tipping the scales in its favor.

As long as the United States wavers between taking
decisive action against Hussein or working some kind of
reasonable modus vivendi with him, he can be expected
to play a carefully calculated game of cat and mouse
with the West, slowly escalating his provocations until
the United States and its allies tire of responding to them.
A ruthless tyrant who brooks no opposition of any kind,
he is not accountable to the Iraqi people and can
demand of them any level of sacrifice he desires.

So what if a few Iraqi soldiers are killed and he loses a
few radar installations? As long as he remains in power,
he comes out the winner. Not only has he once again
tested western resolve and found it wanting,
but the incursion into northern Iraq shores up his
leadership, buttresses his Kurdish allies and undermines
his pro-Iranian Kurdish opponents.

I would characterize our interests in the Gulf area as follows:

1.  Ensure the free flow of oil form the Gulf.  That is our primary
national interest in the region, under which I would opine all the rest is
ancillary.  I would look at it in terms of a "Maslow's Pyramid" if you
will: no use looking for "love" if you can't get food.

2.  Prevent either Iraq or Iran from becoming a hegemon in the region.
Hence, our tacit "support" for Iraq during the eighties, despite the
repugnance of his regime.  I would not say we wanted to see continued
fighting between them (as that would in terfere with 1 above, as well as
conflict with our basic values as a nation).  Despite Dr. Kies' well
thought-out critque, I stand by my original assertion that Saddam is
indeed quite adept at grand political manipulation; hence, the need for
our recent actions.

3.  Limit the influence of Iranian-style Islamic fundamentalism.  It is
vital to underscore that there IS a definite anti-western slant to the
Islamic political thought coming out of Iran.  It should also be noted
that those who clamoured about the "  inhuman" nature of the Shah's regime
would do well to look at the domestic polity there now.  No one can say
the Shah's rule was bloodless, but I would venture to say that the
Ayatollah's certainly isn't, nor is it any "freer."

Given these factors above, I cannot imagine how the U.S. could NOT have
reacted to Iraqi incursions in the north.  Indeed, Saddam, a true
brinksman, is now turning down the rhetoric, proclaiming he will no longer
fire on aircraft in the "null and voi d" No-Fly Zones.  Personally, I
would not ease up political pressure now until it is reaffirmed crystal
clear that the No-Fly Zones do exist, and will continue until WE say so.

To say that recent the problems are the ultimate "fault" of the United
States comes perilously close to blaming the victim.  Saddam has been
biding his time, and I don't see any cause-effect between any putative
"covert operations" in the north and Saddam's recent attacks.  Any covert
actions (which some have stated were more "overt") are hardly the problem,
though I am not sure that such actions should extend beeyond strengthing
the unity of the Kurds.  Toppling Saddam with such efforts presents tw o
problems: 1) the likelihood of success via a covert operation, and 2) the
"devil you know" problem.  We should hardly take actions to secure
Saddam's place in power, but it is not necessarily antithetical to our
interests if he should go.

Apparently I have missed a key piece of information
during the recent controversies over Iraq.

What precisely did Iraq do to threaten our oil
supplies? Other nations in the Western alliance who are
much more dependent on Gulf oil than the U.S.
apparently also missed this key piece of information,
since they are not very enthusiastic about recent
American military actions against Iraq.

This seems reasonable.

One does not limit the influence of Islamic
fundamentalism by bullying and crowding the region; one
inflames it.

We need to give the region enough breathing space to be
skeptical and even, to a degree, hostile to modern
Western culture. We can't try to ram Western culture
down their throats without greatly exacerbating Muslim
fundamentalism.

It's their territory. They should have the freedom to
organize their cultures any way they want. In peaceful
and quiet competition, I am confident that modern
Western culture will prevail in the long run.

If our policy towards pre-fundamentalist Iran was so
brilliant, then why was it such an abject failure? And
is that failure a taste of what's coming in the rest of
the region? Are the current regimes in Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and other nations in the area on as shaky grounds
as was the Shah's? On purely intuitive grounds, I would
say yes.

It has been reported in the major media during the last
week that John Deutch has been managing a major CIA
campaign to overthrow the current Iraqi government and
assassinate Saddam Hussein. The operational center of
this campaign, as I understand matters, was located in
the very area that Saddam attacked.

Let's set aside for the moment that Deutch's project
has apparently been a monumental failure, perhaps one
of the biggest CIA screwups of the last few decades.
Let's also set aside the fact that Deutch may well have
been violating U.S. law when he hatched an
assassination plot against a foreign leader.

Doesn't it seem likely that this CIA campaign was a
major cause, if not the chief cause, of Iraq's recent
actions in the north? News reports have stated that
Saddam was on to the CIA's "covert" operation almost
from its inception.

If a foreign government launched a major conspiratorial
campaign to overthrow the American government and
assassinate the President of the U.S., don't you think
we would be within our rights to respond with military
force?

Deutch's botched project has seriously muddied the
waters in regard to Western policy towards Iraq. The
scheme backfired.

Subject: Secret Agent Bob

From U.S. News at

     http://www.usnews.com:80/usnews/issue/23iraq.htm

--- BEGIN ---

Rolling up in Iraq

Hussein backs down for the moment, but a CIA operation
is destroyed

When Iraqi security officers came to his father's
house asking questions about an alleged coup plot,
Adnan decided it was time to disappear. The
33-year-old squadron commander in Saddam Hussein's Air
Force bribed a truck driver to smuggle him out of
Baghdad. Then he walked 25 miles across Iraqi Army
lines to the Kurdish "safe haven" in northern Iraq.
Like scores of other Iraqi defectors, some supported
by the CIA, Adnan believed that he was beyond
Hussein's reach as long as he stayed in the Kurdish
zone.

Not anymore. As Iraqi-backed fighters of Massoud
Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) completed
their sweep of northern Iraq last week, several
hundred suspected spies in the towns of Irbil and
Qashtapa were reported to have been summarily
executed, and CIA-supplied computers, broadcasting
gear and printing presses were smashed or confiscated
by Saddam Hussein's advancing forces. The largest
American-funded covert operation since the Afghanistan
war against the Soviet Union had been "rolled up."
That euphemistic intelligence-officer's phrase was
scarcely adequate to disguise the brutality and
ignominy of the ending.

Shooting blind. Even as an American show of force last
week intimidated Hussein to back down from his
boisterous threat to shoot down American and British
jets patrolling the newly extended no-fly zone over
Iraq, American officials were privately worrying over
just who had come out ahead in the rapidly changing
situation triggered by the Iraq-backed offensive in
the north.

The handful of surface-to-air missiles Iraq did manage
to shoot off were aimed more at domestic consumption
than U.S. fighters; nervous Iraqi crews switched off
guidance radars seconds after launching the missiles,
abandoning them to fly blind. No chance of hitting a
U.S. plane; also no chance that American air crews
could unleash a radar-seeking missile to home in with
deadly accuracy on the source of trouble. After the
U.S. Air Force, Navy and Army spent several days loudly
revealing plans to send eight F-117 Stealth attack
jets plus 5,000 troops to Kuwait, transfer B-52
bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and
dispatch the aircraft carrier Enterprise from Bosnia
to the Red Sea, Hussein's "Revolutionary Command
Council" announced that it had decided to "suspend our
military reaction" against allied air patrols.

Nor to be discounted as a significant U.S. advance is
the pressure now being exerted by the expanded no-fly
zone in the south, and the damage that was done to
Iraqi air defenses by the American cruise-missile
attack. According to U.S. defense officials, two of
Hussein's elite Republican Guard units based in the
expanded no-fly-zone area are now "uncovered" by Iraqi
air defense. "They have lost the element of surprise.
The job of Iraqi military planners is made more
difficult. We've materially reduced [Hussein's]
ability to mount a threat," claims a senior U.S.
official.

None of this alters several troubling facts. By
backing the KDP's advance in northern Iraq against its
Iranian-backed rival, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK), Hussein has eliminated the safe haven that had
mocked his sovereignty and provided a refuge for
opposition groups. The flexing of military muscle by
the Iraqi Army has strengthened his hold internally.
In the lexicon of "signals," Hussein has sent an
unmistakable message regarding what happens to people
who plot his overthrow--or count on CIA assurances. And
the unusually public hints from Saudi Arabia and
Turkey that U.S. strike aircraft were not welcome on
their territory have revealed fissures in the
anti-Hussein alliance; Pentagon officials were forced
to send the F-117s to less secure bases in Kuwait.

Secret Agent Bob. The safe haven was set up by the
United States, Britain and France in 1991 to protect
Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds from reprisals after they
rebelled against Baghdad at the end of the gulf war.
But the 14,000-square-mile Kurdish area, roughly the
size of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island,
quickly became a refuge not just for Kurds but Iraqi
dissidents of all stripes.

According to sources in the region, the CIA had four
or five American agents working in Kurdistan until
last month. The station chief, known locally only as
"Bob," encouraged Kurdish rebels to attack Iraqi
troops in March 1995 by promising U.S. air support and
simultaneous insurrection across the rest of Iraq.
Neither the air support nor the insurrections
materialized, leaving the Kurds to suffer an
embarrassing defeat and their civilians exposed to
Iraqi shelling in retaliation.

Despite that fiasco, sources say the CIA continued
this year to support and direct a small army of
defectors in Kurdistan. The covert operation also
helped the Iraqi National Congress, a London-based
opposition group, to broadcast radio and TV propaganda
from northern Iraqi towns. Some of the funds were
channeled through a Washington, D.C., area
public-relations company that received several million
dollars a year to set up INC offices in northern Iraq
and to help the INC produce videos and radio
broadcasts that depicted Hussein's evil ways and the
need to overthrow him. Training programs consisted
mostly of lessons in how to shoot video footage and
use communications and computer gear.

U.S. intelligence funneled technical help also to the
Iraqi National Accord, an opposition group based in
Amman, Jordan, to make contact with Iraqi military
insiders who, it was hoped, might someday revolt.

Bugging out. All those operations are now a shambles.
The CIA agents have pulled out, and people who
allegedly worked with them say they have been
abandoned. "We ask the whole international community,
especially America, to evacuate us as quickly as
possible," says Abu Kadhum, a 38-year-old colonel in
the opposition army who commands about 200 defectors
left in the dingy Al Khadra Hotel in Salahuddin, which
had served as the defectors' headquarters.

Although no Iraqi troops are visible in the region
now, Hussein almost certainly left behind agents of
his mukhabarat (secret police). The key question is
what price Hussein will exact for his help to Barzani,
who told reporters last week that Hussein is no longer
his enemy. But he also insisted that Iraqi troops had
fully withdrawn from the Kurdistan region and that the
Iraqi assistance was a one-time affair, no strings
attached.

"Maybe Barzani only invited Saddam for a waltz, but
suddenly they'll end up dancing a quick-step," says
Poul Dahl, the Danish chief of security for U.N. relief
efforts in Kurdistan.

Seeking to consolidate his hold, Hussein announced a
"general amnesty" for all Kurds last week. But he
specifically said it would not apply to people who had
worked for "foreign organizations." That has terrified
not just those who worked for the INC but also
thousands of workers, even truck drivers and
translators, employed by humanitarian relief groups in
the region.

Just how serious the U.S.-backed intelligence efforts
ever were is disputed. "My estimation is that our
operation against Saddam Hussein has never amounted to
a hill of beans," says Harvey Sicherman, president of
the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia,
who was a member of the State Department's policy
planning staff during the gulf war.

Limited as the operation may have been, it won't be
easy to reconstitute American influence in the region
now that one Kurdish faction has staked its future with
Saddam Hussein. "We lost a foothold in northern Iraq,"
says Micheal Dunn, editor of Estimate, a
Washington-based newsletter on the Middle East. "The
side now mopping up with Saddam is the one we were
closest to. Are we going to go in and attack the very
Kurds we have been protecting for five years?"

The prevailing assumption in the administration is
that Hussein also has strengthened himself internally
over the last few months in a way that makes his
assassination less likely. In addition to routing the
covert opposition effort in the north, he apparently
conducted a thorough purge after the July bombing
attempt, executing several hundred military officers
he felt were plotting against him.

From a look around the decaying Al Khadra Hotel, it is
hard to believe that the CIA operation in Kurdistan
ever had much chance of success. Many of these
self-proclaimed fighters, who say they fear to walk
out the door into streets now patrolled by KDP
soldiers, are middle-aged and overweight. They
cultivate a "spook" aura but decline to give any
information that would corroborate their claims to
have plotted and fought against Hussein. "I can't tell
you anything about my previous life. It's top-secret,"
says the colonel, Abu Kadhum.

Still, it was the Iraqi National Accord that is
reported to have been responsible for the bomb placed
last July in one of Hussein's palaces. The covert
operation in the north was also one of the very few
sources of intelligence on Hussein's regime. "They
were not getting a lot of information on what Saddam
had for dinner," says Iraqi expert Amatzia Baram, a
visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy, "but they were getting a constant stream
of information."

Adnan, the former fighter pilot, is not among the
fighters in the hotel. He says he is free to move
around Kurdistan even though he is wanted in Baghdad.
And his story may be more representative of what has
happened to coup plotters in Iraq. One of his friends,
a fellow officer, was arrested in June and confessed
under torture to a plot that Adnan doubts ever existed.
Within days, 19 other officers were arrested and Adnan
was on the run. He does not know how he was implicated
or why. "I don't believe in coups against Saddam," he
says. "They're impossible."

Subject: Your "Cloaks" mail.

Dear List Member:

This might be a good time to point out an important aspect of reading
"list mail", and that is, listserv's handling of what listserv perceives
as a problem address. Listserv is not perfect!

But if you find that you are not getting mail from the list as you think
you should, then perhaps listserv set your subscription to "nomail", or
"digest", or "index"....

Send a message to listserv: listserv@sjuvm.stjohns.edu
in the body of the message: Query Cloaks

If you send this message from the same computer (address) that you used to
subscribe, then listserv will send you your subscription options. Or you
can simply let me know and I can do it for you. Obviously, if you yourself
set your cloaks options to "nomail" because you're reading list mail through
our gateway <bit.listserv.cloaks-daggers>, then any of this does not apply!


With best wishes,

I am a bit disappointed with that response, as you have shown a good bit
of insight in your previous posts.  Of course, you have not missed
anything; however, you seem to be willing to accede to the same
short-sightedness that afflicts many of our policy makers.  In other
words, Saddam's long-term goals are the marginalization of Kuwait.  If we
do nothing now, he will gladly raise the ante.  Kuwait is well aware of
its position; hence, they are even stronger in sugggesting the ouster of
Saddam, as opposed to his containment.

The ramming of Western culture in the region consists now of "Baywatch"
rereuns on Star TV (I am NOT joking).  I would characterize this conflict
less as a cultural one and more as a clash of ideologies.  I don't want to
suggest that what we have now in the Middle East and South Asia is a new
improved substitute for Communism, but their is definitely a MAJOR
emphasis within the "fundamentalism" I've described that won't care what
we do, it will remain antithetical to the West and any western influence
that weakens or threatens their political bailwick.

Agreed.  But the problem is there are those on "that" side that don't
think taht way.  Leadership in Iran is a priome example.  Saddam probably
would be more open to the Wet, ironically, but his particular attempts to
build a Cult of Personality are getting in the way of a rapproachment.

I don't see a Domino Effect at work in the Middle East.  The Iranian
"revolution" was stolen by the far right.  Witness that Bani Sader
is no PNG and even under threat of execution while living in
Germany.  There are many disaffected folks who were against the
Shah, but not for the Ayatollah.  He was a rallying point, but the
rest of the opposition to the Shah did not see how well-organized
her was and underestimated him badly.

Let's assume it was.  Does that lessen Saddam's threat?  I don't think so.
In fact, if Saddam is that easily "baited," it's another note that should
be added to his file for future reference.

Sure, but let's do jsutice to the analogy and go all teh way.  We'd hjave
to assume we we launching military actions against "irredentist" groups
living in, say, Windsor Ontario or some otehr border town with Canada.
Your example makes perfect sense in the abstract, but fails if we follow
it through to its logical conclusion.

Could you please name the specific threatening gestures
that Iraq made towards Kuwait during the last few
weeks? My impression is that Iraq has been more
concerned about the $100 million American effort
centered in the north to overthrow the Iraqi government
and assassinate Saddam than about Kuwait.

Apparently our Western and Gulf allies for the most
part have also failed to see the threatening gestures
that are obvious to you, since they have been cold
about our bombing of Iraq.

I suspect that some people are wondering whether the
U.S. is currently acting from rational foreign policy
objectives as much as lashing out in frustration and
anger at the embarrassing failure of the CIA's projects
in northern Iraq. If a tantrum is driving the policy,
we are going to end up in ever deeper holes regarding
our strategic position in the Mideast.

During the last few weeks in this list I have tried to
raise the issue that the question "Who lost the
Mideast?" could loom large in future American foreign
policy discussions if the U.S. continues on its current
isolated course.

I was pleased to see in The Chicago Tribune today that
I am not the only one who has noticed the growing
problem. Note well also the linkage between the
disaffection of usually friendly Arab states towards
the U.S. and Benjamin Netanyahu's torpedoing of the
peace process:

                      Staff Writer. Tribune staff
                      writer Terry Atlas contributed to

                      Dateline: JERUSALEM

                      Much of the Arab world is on a
                      collision course with the U.S.
                      over Washington's escalating
                      military showdown with Iraqi
                      President Saddam Hussein.

                      In a dramatic turn of events for
                      U.S. policy and influence in the
                      region, even moderate Arab allies
                      are starting to interpret
                      continued U.S. strikes against
                      Iraq as attacks on Arab
                      sovereignty, unity and dignity.

                      The U.S. stands accused of
                      bullying Arab states, selling out
                      the Kurds in northern Iraq, using
                      the United Nations as cover for
                      unilateral aims and failing in
                      its stated goals of containing
                      Hussein and keeping the peace.

                      "I think the United States has
                      been very high-handed with the
                      Arab world and patronizing,
                      taking the liberty of taking the
                      Arabs for granted," said Hanan
                      Ashrawi, Palestinian Authority
                      minister of education and a
                      member of the elected legislative
                      council in self-rule territories.

                      "The U.S. makes decisions and
                      tries to browbeat (Arabs) into
                      agreeing. They don't read the
                      Arab world right. They don't
                      understand the Arab world."

                      Only a year ago, Israel and the
                      Palestinians were clinching a
                      U.S.-sponsored deal to expand
                      Arab self-rule in the West Bank.
                      Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
                      Rabin was still alive and moving
                      toward peace talks with Syria.
                      Israel's accords with the
                      Palestine Liberation
                      Organization, Jordan and Egypt
                      fueled hopes of a new Middle
                      East.

                      Even the coalition of Arab states
                      that had joined the U.S. in the
                      1991 Persian Gulf war to drive
                      Iraq's army from Kuwait seemed
                      strong, or at least largely
                      intact.

                      No more. Throughout the Arab
                      world last week, there was
                      widespread condemnation of
                      President Clinton's perceived
                      aggression against Iraq and a
                      growing sentiment that the
                      world's last superpower had gone
                      far enough.

                      At least part of the sea change
                      in Arab attitudes appears to stem
                      from the slow pace of regional
                      peace negotiations between Arabs
                      and Israel's new hard-line
                      government, which is widely seen
                      as dragging its feet on the
                      U.S.-driven Mideast peace
                      process.

                      Arab League foreign ministers
                      were meeting this weekend in
                      Cairo to discuss the faltering
                      peace process.

                      While it was not officially on
                      their agenda, the ministers also
                      were expected to discuss the
                      threat of new U.S. strikes
                      against Iraq. But the meeting was
                      called to assess an Arab response
                      to the lack of progress toward
                      peace by the government of
                      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
                      Netanyahu.

                      "Maybe the peace process is one
                      factor," Ashrawi acknowledged
                      last week, "but Arab-American
                      relations need to be redefined as
                      well.

                      "With Iraq, it's (U.S.
                      airstrikes) like beating someone
                      who has already fallen, and the
                      humiliation of Iraq is beginning
                      to be extended to the humiliation
                      of the Arab world. The U.S. is
                      making the mistake of misjudging
                      how far it can go."

                      For their part, Clinton
                      administration officials say Arab
                      leaders aren't as critical as
                      they seem.

                      "I think we have a great deal of
                      support in the Arab world that
                      perhaps you don't hear publicly
                      for a variety of reasons," said
                      State Department spokesman
                      Nicholas Burns.

                      In the Persian Gulf, only Kuwait
                      has come out strongly in favor of
                      renewed attacks, even allowing
                      the Pentagon to base its F-117A
                      stealth fighters there. Britain
                      is allowing U.S. B-52 bombers to
                      fly out of its Diego Garcia
                      island base in the Indian Ocean.

                      Other Arab allies in the gulf
                      region, members of the Gulf
                      Cooperation Council who are not
                      forgetting Hussein's brutal
                      invasion of Kuwait in 1990, fear
                      that toppling the Iraqi dictator,
                      or allowing Iraq's
                      disintegration, could invite new
                      dominance of the region by a
                      power they fear even more: Iran.

                      America's most important gulf
                      ally, Saudi Arabia, has distanced
                      itself from the U.S. attacks.
                      Both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain
                      have faced recent violence from
                      internal groups of Islamic
                      fundamentalist extremists
                      influenced by Iran.

                      There have been two bombings
                      against U.S. forces based in the
                      Saudi kingdom in the last year,
                      reflecting a growing antipathy
                      there for the use of Arab lands
                      to project American military
                      power in the region.

                      Saudi Arabia, Jordan and even
                      Turkey, with its new Islamic-led
                      government, all made it clear
                      they wanted no part of their
                      territories used for launching
                      strikes against Iraq.

                      Part of what outraged Arab states
                      was that the United States stood
                      by when Turkey and Iran sent
                      their armies into the northern
                      autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq
                      to hit Kurdish forces using that
                      area as a launchpad for attacks
                      against them.

                      The U.S. acted only when Iraq
                      sent its forces into the same
                      region, which analysts argue
                      remains sovereign Iraqi soil and
                      an internal Iraqi matter.

                      al-Arabi wrote last week that the
                      controversy shows not only that
                      the U.S.-led coalition that
                      fought the gulf war "is finished,
                      but that the countries of the
                      region are beginning to stand up
                      to other U.S. policies in the
                      region that have been geared to
                      weakening the Arab countries and
                      strengthening Israel."

                      The paper also criticized the
                      U.S. effort to secure peace
                      breakthroughs for Israel, calling
                      it "a phony sense of regional
                      peace."

From:    Joe Canepa <canepa@MERCURY.INTERPATH.COM>
Subject: Facher's Pit

A lawyer named Facher said in Jonathan Harr's _A Civil Action_,
"The truth is at the bottom of a bottomless pit." From my
reading, Facher, a great trial lawyer, made a profound statement
about our society and the difficult path which a truthseeker must
travel.

Armed with only a word processor, I still must attempt the
journey and take a leap into Facher's pit.

Today, 9/15/96, both the Washington Post and the New York Times
give prominent coverage to a non-story. Both media outlets
covered the obvious in that the CIA has been trying since 1991 to
topple Saddam Hussein covertly.

Despite this diversion, the real CIA story surfaces in the back
pages within the same newspapers. The Post in its Outlook section
carried a story by one Ishmael Reed. Reed comments Gary Webb's
recent San Jose Mercury articles about the CIA going into
business with the Crips and the Bloods in LA. Reed said:

".....Webbs, an investigative reporter, wrote, 'For the better
part of a decade a San Francisco Bay area drug ring sold tons of
cocaine to the Crips and the Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles
and funneled millions in drug profits to a Latin America
guerrilla army run by the Central Intelligence Agency.'

  The story was backed by sworn court statements from
government's agents and informants and memos from government
files. When defense attorneys for one of the lower-level African
American drug dealers indicated that they wanted to explore the
CIA's role in court, the prosecutors filed a motion to block any
inquiry into CIA involvement in drug trafficking."

How I would love to be judge for a day and rule on that motion. I
might point out that the government position is in reverse with
the truth. Our national security is in no way enhanced by
covering up government and street gang drug deals. A demand for
truth would be a demand for all information about the allegation
that importing tons of cocaine to the streets of LA, which does
in fact threaten our national security. Motion denied.

Webb and Reed have the right idea but could use some mathematical
help. Tons of cocaine means 10's of millions of dollars and
multiply the tens by the 12 year period and you are up to
billions in the trade. Approaching the problem from another
direction if LA has on the average of 100,000 people in the past
12 years or so spending $50.00 a day on cocaine, this adds up to
about 5 million dollars a day or about 1.8 billion per year or
over 200 billion in a twelve year period. The Contras never had
funding of that scale, not close. Where then did the profits go?

One clue was almost buried in the Book Review section of the New
York Times. There one, Michael J. Gorman, an attorney and a NYC
police officer, wrote a letter ot the editor. He said:

"....There is rarely any acknowledgement of the power of billion
dollars drug empires to corrupt and fool members of Congress,
judges, police officers and whoever stands between drug dealers
and drug profits. The major drug dealers have their own
'lobbyists' who are rarely identified as such. If highly
respected members of Congress could be bought by phony sheiks for
as little as a few thousand dollars, big drug money can (and
does) do much more corrupting."


Apply Gorman's assertion to Webb's investigation and maybe we can see the
light at the end of Facher's pit.

First, let me address my previous comments to ensure there is no
misunderstanding, as it has been raised with me privately.  I meant no
disrespect when I mentioned my "disappointment" in my last post.  You had
said basically that perhaps  you "missed" something when in fact you know
you did not, I know you did not, and (not to sound like a page out of
"Crime and Punishment") you know I know you did not.  My "disappointmen"
was not with you as a poster, and was in no way maligning you integrity,
honesty, or value as a poster.  Believe me, I am the last one who wants to
start a flame war, and I hope that anyone who may have been "disappointed"
with my post at least accepts MY honesty and sincerity when I say no harm
was intended to Mr. McGuire or anyone else.  Now, if I may, I'd like to
return to substance.

Regarding "threatening gestures to Kuwait," I still think you are missing
my point.  Saddam's thinking is far more complex. in my view, and far
longer-term that wht you may be giving him credit for.  Splitting the
Kurdish opposition, which I would venture to say predated even the Gulf
War, is but a small step toward reversing Allied gains since 1991.

By calling into question coalition ability to respond to a threat in an
area designated by the coalition as a "safe haven," Saddam is threatening
(indeed quite successfully) the political will of the coalition to
maintain its position vis-a-vis Iraq.  Look at how long it took Saddam to
"agree" to "oil for food" sales.  THis was classic.  There was many a
breast being beaten in the West regaring the "cruelty" of U.S. policy,
all the while seeming to ignore the fact that it was Saddam, NOT the U.S.,
that was preventing food and medicine from reaching his people. In terms
of "psychological operations," it was a master stroke, as here we have a
country that attacked without provocation its neighbor, indeed, annexed
it, and successfully portrayed ITSELF as the victim.  Granted, there is
fertile ground in the U.S. and elsewhere for those itching to find
"something" to blame on the U.S. (witness the attempt to portray April
Glaspie's demarche telling Saddam we did not believe the use of force in
the area was warranted to somehow giving Saddam the "green light to
invade; this was supposed to be some sort of "masterplan" on teh part of
the U.S. to "get" him to invade so Bush could attack and win reelection).

At any rate, my point is this.  What is at stake is far more than simply
Saddam's exploitation of divisions within the Kurdish community.  It is
part of his incremental strategy to weaken the coalition, remove the
no-fly zones, leave him with his military intact, and allow him to tacitly
threaten Kuwait.  Kuwait will have seen teh success of his breaking up
the coalition, and perhaps not get invade, but probably cede contested oil
rights to Saddam.

Again, one final note:  I do apologize Mr. McGuire if my previous post in
any way seemed like a personal attack.  Clearly, some felt it was, and I
in no way eschew debate, evn heated disagreement, but do believe it should
be done sans innuendo or insult.  If I have violated my own rule, I
sincerely ask your pardon.

Is Saddam's "splitting of the Kurdish opposition"
sufficient grounds to justify allied bombing of Iraq? I
don't know for sure, but I have my doubts.

Was the Kurdish opposition ready to split apart without
much prodding from Saddam? Do we really understand the
internal dynamics of the Kurdish movement and its
internecine factional conflicts? Again, I have my
doubts.

Does the fact that the CIA was running a $100 million
"covert" operation to overthrow the Iraqi government
and assassinate Saddam, using Kurds in sovereign Iraqi
territory, weaken America's moral authority in the eyes
of the world and our allies in pursuing a policy of
military strikes? Without a doubt: simply review the
world press on the issue for the last few days.

It looks to me like we have blundered into a very big
mess in Iraq, by failing to think through all the
consequences of conducting the bungled covert operation
that has recently come to light.

I am all for covert operations, by the way, when they
are absolutely required, as a means of *absolute* last
resort. But one had damned well better know what one is
doing when running them. The potential for covert
operations blowing up in one's face is always a matter
of the gravest concern. Whatever you can do straight,
don't do crooked.

How could the CIA be certain that even if the operation
had been successful that Saddam wouldn't have been
replaced by an even more dangerous leader? How did it
intend to control the situation after Saddam was
removed?

I still believe you are giving too much credit to
Saddam's cunning and too little credit to American
blundering.

That is indeed a plausible scenario, and I have no
doubt that Saddam is capable of playing chess on that
level. Unfortunately, we made some questionable moves
that probably help advance the fulfillment of this
scenario.

In the larger scheme of things, I continue to worry
that we may be on the verge of losing the entire Middle
East by being too heavy-handed in trying to push around
the region. We may be provoking a revolt among the
masses against our proxy leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt
and elsewhere. My sense of things is that the
leadership of America's allies in the Mideast is
resting on an increasingly shaky reed, and that we
could see a replay of the Iranian revolution in one or
more of these nations.

You are one of the coolest and most substantive
debaters I've encountered in cyberspace. I look forward
to reading more of your thoughts and analysis. I'm

This I think is true (lest I be sounding like I endorse as a first option
covert action).  The problem is, when actions blow, we don't always get
the real story.  In other words, the Agency almost never "defends" itself,
even when the charges are about UFOs and aliens in the WH and microchips
in the brains of U.S. citizens and other less than credible possibilities.
However . . .

If true, then this is the msot damning argument.  Saddam may actually be
the best perrson to "have" in control there.  And you are completely right
that we probably have no idea who would take his place.   Indeed, removing
Saddam may embolden Iran (still itching for a fight, I think).  That could
raise some horrible -- and embarrassing -- scenarios.

I can't say your fears are unfounded.  But I would want to emphasize this:
be careful not to equate political opposition in those countries
(especially the kind of opposition that throws bombs) with the "will of
the masses."  I think the term proxy in this sense is a bit weighted as
well.  The organizational skills of those who wish to undermine U.S>
influence in the region and replace it with Iranian should not be
undersestimated.  In any event, I'm going to cry "Uncle" at this point,
since I can't seem to sway you on our recent actions.

Subject: How We Lost the Kurdish Game

Check out "How We Lost the Kurdish Game" by Katherine
A. Wilkens in the September 15 Washington Post at:


http://washingtonpost.com:80/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-09/15/074L-091596-idx.html

To say that Saddam Hussein "split" the Kurds is
somewhat an oversimplification. Wilkens explains what
really happened, and how American and Turkish policies
contributed to the inflaming of Kurdish factionalism.

The essay is a model of how to do first-class
intelligence analysis.

A brief excerpt:

--- BEGIN ---

The Kurdish parties themselves deserve ultimate blame
for their factional fighting and the misfortune it has
once again brought to the Kurdish people. If the Kurds
had been able to maintain a united front, the recent
crisis might have been avoided. But this does not
absolve the United States of its role in this crisis.
The United States put its credibility behind a pledge
to protect the Iraqi Kurdish people and then helped
perpetuate a situation in which economic and political
stability was impossible.

U.S. involvement in northern Iraq was intended to be a
short-term, stop-gap policy largely to help Turkey and
embarrass Saddam. When it became clear that Saddam
would be around for some time -- and so would the need
for Operation Provide Comfort -- the U.S. government
failed to address the serious shortcomings and
contradictions of its policy. Instead, the United
States permitted its involvement in northern Iraq to be
guided by Turkey, a country that believes the division
of the Kurdish factions is in its interests. The
Clinton administration never fully appreciated the
threat presented by the growing power vacuum in
northern Iraq and the danger that the region might once
again become an area of conflict for the Kurds'
neighbors -- Iran, Syria and Turkey. Over the last six
months, they ignored repeated warnings from Kurdish
leaders of increased Iranian involvement. As a result,
KDP leader Barzani concluded that the future of
northern Iraq lay with Saddam, not with the United
States, and he moved to establish the alliance with
Baghdad that sparked the present crisis.

It should be fairly amusing for list members, particularly in light
of comments a few weeks back about Grabbe.  I still put him in the
category of psyops (let me point out the excellent _Illuminatus_ chronicals
and the exploits of Hagbard Celine as his probable inspiration).

A Web of Intrigue

Flight 800 crash theories running wild on Internet

By Jessica Kowal
Staff Writer
On the Internet, the mystery of TWA Flight 800 has long since been solved.

J. Orlin Grabbe knows a missile downed the jet. On his World Wide Web site,
Grabbe writes that Syrian-trained terrorists warned the FBI and then shot down
the TWA jet with a surface-to-air missile from a boat in the water off Long
Island.

John Barry Smith is just as sure the plane was done in by a defective cargo
door. According to Smith's Web site, a forward cargo door fell off both the TWA
plane and off Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, causing both planes to
break apart and explode. Boeing and the U.S. government, Smith writes, aren't
telling the truth because they don't want to damage the American economy.

Richard Ruiz of Farmingdale fervently subscribes to the "friendly fire" theory,
posting his views on a computer bulletin board along with hundreds of others who
believe they can pinpoint when and how the American military shot down the
airplane.

Within minutes after the jet went down July 17 and killed all 230 people aboard,
the Internet became the 24-hour worldwide talk show for theories about what
caused the fireball. While the reality of this public detective story has been
disappointing to armchair investigators - for almost two months, the
professionals have repeated that a bomb, missile or mechanical failure could
have downed the plane - virtual reality has stepped in to fill the narrative
gap.

"However damaging it may be, we're entitled to the truth," said Ruiz, a
62-year-old chemist who has been heartened by winning converts to his view.
"Let's say I'm suspicious, and until I'm proven different than my thoughts are,
I have to be suspicious."

Using the key words "TWA Flight 800" and "missile," "bomb," or "conspiracy"
yields thousands of messages posted on bulletin boards from visitors digging
through hypotheses. The crash has already earned a spot alongside the Kennedy
assassination and Vince Foster's death on a Web site entitled "50 Greatest
Conspiracies of All Time."

Such speculation may be fueled by the far-fetched nature of even some officially
sanctioned theories, including that a missile pierced the plane, passing through
without a trace. Longtime investigators also say the lack of new developments
feeds the frenzy.

Then there is investigators' refusal to rule out anything. Even while generally
discounting theories about "friendly fire," chief FBI investigator James
Kallstrom would not dismiss them outright last week. He would only call them
"highly, highly, highly unlikely."

So without waiting for the agents of the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms; and National Transportation Safety Board to figure it out, computer
users sift through available details, drawing their own conclusions.

"When there's an absence of concrete information, the conspiracy theorists
really thrive," said Vincent Cannistraro, the CIA's former counterterrorism
chief of operations. "They know one fact and a fourth fact, but they don't know
what's in between, so they start filling in their information."

Perhaps the FBI opened the floodgates by giving out the agency's e-mail address
and asking for help in solving the mystery. Now faced with a deluge of messages
in reply, the FBI wades through explanations of aliens, meteorites, bombs or
missiles to find tidbits of useful information coming from pilots, engineers or
other experts.

"There's thousands of them. There's millions of them," Kallstrom said of the
messages the bureau has received. "A lot of them are very well reasoned and
thought out and we appreciate getting them . . . We read them, and any of them
we think are worth a second look, we take a second look."

But there is a difference between the expert and the crackpot, said Oliver
(Buck) Revell, who was in charge of the FBI's investigative and intelligence
operations for 12 years.

"Some of these people are fairly serious and knowledgeable about investigative
processes and are using intellectual analysis," said Revell, who headed the Pan
Am Flight 103 investigation. "And others are living through vicarious thrills of
`X-Files' nonsense that doesn't hold any water."

On the Internet, those differences can be hard to spot. And because of speedy
transmission over telephone lines, Internet theorizing moves faster than other
media, said John Whalen, author of the "50 Greatest Conspiracies" Web site.
Whalen warns that believing in a government cover-up is "as responsible as
saying that ET shot the plane down."

"Anyone can get up on the Internet and propose a theory, float it out there, and
then it begins to spread like an informational virus, for better or worse,"
Whalen said.

The workings of the Internet certainly allow people to directly send detailed
suggestions about how the investigation should proceed.

Last Friday, one man sent a five-page e-mail message to the FBI to advise the
bureau not to overlook the possibility that the TWA plane was hit by a meteor.
Asking the bureau to find out "how long would the transit of a meteoroid
traveling at 8 [kilometers per second] take to pass through a 747?" the author
concluded that the lack of explosive evidence and reports of a "streak of light
in the sky" before the plane exploded point to Flight 800's having been struck
by "a falling object, a meteorite, comet or spacecraft debris."

Also in the mix are the UFO theorists, including one Web site reporting that
four days before the crash, a woman living in northern New Jersey "reported"
seeing a UFO flying just south of Long Island.

Other Web sites offer very specific information their authors say leads to one
conclusion: their conclusion.

On his Web site, Grabbe offers essays criticizing President Bill Clinton and the
FBI and explaining his own views on international financial markets.

In an interview, Grabbe, a Harvard-educated economist who lives in Reno, Nevada,
said "high level intelligence people" who read his Web site contacted him to say
the U.S. government knew within a week after Flight 800's demise that a modified
surface-to-air Stinger missile hit the plane.

He rejects the notion he's a "conspiracy theorist."

"I think it was a terrorist group that took down that plane using a
surface-to-air missile," Grabbe said. "I just call that the facts, but other
people who don't like the facts would call that a conspiracy."

Spectral data from satellite photos, Grabbe said, showed authorities that the
missile's usual heat-seeking head was replaced with a white-glowing
"phosphorous" tip, which could be aimed at the belly of the plane.

Grabbe believes the FBI has offered falsified radar data showing the airplane
flying at 13,700 feet when it exploded, while "the best information I can get"
was that the plane was flying at 7,600 feet when hit by a missile.

Moreover, Grabbe links both the TWA explosion and the July 2 energy blackout of
15 Western states to Syrian-trained terrorists. Grabbe said he believes the FBI
is "deliberately falsifying evidence," with the complicity of the White House,
because the United States does not want trouble with Syria but might try to use
the TWA Flight 800 explosion to "justify a war in the Middle East" against Libya
or Iraq.


"People behind the scenes are laughing, and there are bets going on about how
long the FBI can maintain the charade," Grabbe said.

Grabbe's and others' views that the government is covering up what it knows are
"crazy," Cannistraro said.

"Anyone who claims to have knowledge is generally lying, paranoid or [doing it]
for publicity or self aggrandizement," Cannistraro said.

John Barry Smith of Carmel Valley, Calif., said he's putting his theory on the
Internet to save lives. After viewing pictures of a United Airlines 747 severely
damaged when a forward cargo door opened during a 1989 flight, killing nine
people, Smith decided cargo doors, not bombs, were the cause of explosions
aboard Pan Am Flight 103, the 1985 Air India Flight, and now TWA Flight 800.

On his Web site, Smith uses photographs and documents to compare the United
Airlines plane to the Pan Am and Air India planes and to conclude that
malfunctioning cargo doors opened and ripped away the skin of the fuselages and
then tore the noses off the planes. In an interview, Smith said he believes a
door also fell off TWA Flight 800, and that the "streak of light" some say is a
missile is actually the plane's falling cargo door reflecting light.

"This door is a prime suspect. This door has killed before," Smith said. "I
didn't invent the cause of these crashes. The door popped open. It's not weird.
It's a no-brainer. So that's when you get to the coverup."

The coverup, he said, is that Boeing and the federal government don't want to
admit there's a major defect in the 747, potentially costing the company
millions of dollars to fix and severely damaging the American economy.

Smith, who said he has been "sensitive" to doors since his finger was slammed in
a car door when he was 5-years old, has contacted the White House, FBI, FAA, Air
Force, NTSB, and airline insurance companies to alert them to his view of the
problem.

"It's a case of human nature seeing what they want to see. They see a bomb, and
they ignore what's in front of them," Smith said.

Several aviation officials dispute Smith's theory.

Boeing spokesman Doug Webb said the company knew of problems with 747 cargo
doors a year before the United Airlines accident, and that the airlines have
subsequently retrofitted them with steel-reinforced locks.

NTSB spokeswoman Shelly Hazle said the agency examined TWA Flight 800's wreckage
for a broken cargo door and discounted it as a cause of the crash.

If the cargo door had opened in flight, a cockpit light would have gone on and
the crew would have focused all their attention on the problem, Hazle said. Yet
there is no discussion of the problem on the cockpit voice-recorder tapes, so
the NTSB has ruled it out, she said.

And, investigators said, Pan Am 103 and the Air India planes were both downed by
bombs, not cargo doors.

Even as some online theorists, such as Smith, use their own research, others
draw conclusions using whatever information comes their way.

Richard Ruiz said a conversation with a French Army officer while both men were
waiting to catch flights at a South American airport convinced him friendly fire
was responsible for the TWA explosion.

Ruiz admitted he has no facts that haven't appeared in the mainstream news
media, but he still said the Frenchman's comments about other friendly-fire
shoot-downs, including the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iranian Airbus in 1988,
made an impact. "I began to think about it and the fact that nothing conclusive
was reached about [the TWA plane]," he said. "And I began to put two and two
together."

Subject: Markus Wolf

I have an e-mail version of an article, "Lord of the Spies" by Leslie Colitt
which appeared in the Independent-on-Sunday on 15 September. This concerns
the East German spymaster, Markus Wolf. In effect, it is a summary of
Colitt's book, "Spymaster", due to be published by Robson Books on 26
September. If anybody would like a copy of the article, please let me know.
Allow a day or two for me to collect names before sending.

Subject: Re Markus Wolf

Greetings from Munich.

I would like to read the Independent Article about Markus Wolf, the former
East German Spy Master.

More out of the LeCarre world of which Wolf was once part. I don't have the
details readily available, but the German Federal Prosecutors office recently
brought new charges against him: suspicion of bodily injury and false
imprisonment. These charges will be added to those for which he is already
being tried in Duesseldorf.

Seems that in 1962 a former East German Inteligence Officer and his
girlfriend, both of whom had previously defected to the West, were kidnapped
in Vienna.  They were transported to East Germany, put on trial, and sentenced
to lenghty prison terms.

Subject: Re: Discussion of Iraq & Covert Operations

Three comments about the recent discussions in this forum with regard to
U.S. covert operations against Iraq:

1.  It is bureaucratically disturbing that most of the discussion has
proceeded as though decisions about covert operations are made at CIA
Headquarters and not at the White House with the full knowledge and consent
of Congress.  The actions undertaken were in pursuit of U.S. national
security goals in that area of the globe, and were not some capricious
activity of the CIA acting on its own.  Disagreeing with policy goals is
one thing; ascribing those goals solely to the CIA is misleading.

2.  It is philosophically disturbing that the fact that the operation did
not succeed in overthrowing Sadaam Hussein is equated with "bungling."  I
have no idea whether the operation was bungled; there has not been
sufficient detail in the open sources for me to arrive at such a
conclusion.  Nevertheless, an unsuccessful operation and a bungled one are
two different things.

3.  It is factually disturbing to see the existence of the covert operation
given as justification for Sadaam Hussein's invasion of the Kurdish "safe
haven."  Even he did not make that argument, although it would have been a
good one if it had been on his mind.  References in the Iraqi media to the
covert action did not come until after it had been exposed in the Western
media; the opposite could have been expected.

It would be interesting to know if John Deutch warned
Bill Clinton and his administration in the strongest
possible terms about the dangers and potential downside
of attempting to overthrow the Iraqi government and
assassinate a world leader.

Clinton does not give me the impression of being very
involved with or even interested in foreign affairs. He
is hardly aggressive in pursuing foreign policy
objectives. Someone else in the administration was
pushing the Iraqi scheme. We need to know much more
about how the policy was hatched, and the "rationale"
(assuming there was any) behind it.

Were our Western and Mideast allies informed of the
scheme? Did they support it?

The bungling lies in thrusting American power into the
middle of a highly volatile and unpredictable political
situation involving Iraq, Turkey, Iran and the Kurds,
in which it is easy to get burned--almost inevitable
and guaranteed. I don't think the CIA and the IC in
general exercised good judgement when they supported or
got involved in this project.

It would be interesting to know if *anyone* in the IC
was clear-headed enough to lay out convincingly the
counter-arguments for spending $100 million to try to
use the Kurds in northern Iraq to overthrow the Iraqi
government.

Not necessarily. Apparently Saddam allowed the
operation to be lulled into a false sense of security,
to make it easier to crush. Perhaps he didn't want to
tip his hand. News reports I have read suggest he was
on to the plot at an early stage.

Is there any leader in the world who wouldn't react
with overwhelming military violence to thwart a plot to
overthrow his government and assassinate him or her?
It is simple common sense to expect such a response.
What the CIA failed to comprehend was that its "covert"
operation was blown.

In general I am a fan of the CIA, but it looks to me
that this Iraqi project is going to be tremendously
damaging to the agency, especially following the
Aldrich Ames scandal. I am quite surprised that John
Deutch hasn't handed in his resignation.

The American people have a right to know exactly who
was behind this project, and how their decision-making
processes operated.

Have you stopped to assess all the ways in which
American interests have been damaged by this operation?
In general, America seems to be getting more and more
isolated from the entire world concerning our Mideast
policies.

Benjamin Netanyahu has just declared his defiance of
American wishes and interests in the region, with the
apparent expectation that he possesses enough political
clout in America to push the American government into
line behind his expansionist and segregationist
policies. America's position in the Mideast is probably
going to grow much worse before it gets better. We are
increasingly out of touch with all the Arab and Muslim
governments in the region and even with all our key
Western allies. We are on a slippery path towards a
truly major foreign policy disaster, perhaps one of the
biggest in American history.

That previous sentence is a formal prediction, by the
way, not loose talk or vague speculation. I am happy to
put it on the public record. Common sense is a
wonderful tool.

     Thought you all might be interested in this version of the "accident".


______________________________ Forward Header __________________________________



 This is interesting.  For those of you who think the government
 is totally incompetent at everything except large conspiracies
 (much like the LAPD and OJ), think again.  I just received the
 following information via the wire.  Apparently, the source is
 a 747 Captain, but I don't know much more.  His sources are
 reportedly reliable with inside information.  He has transmitted
 the information already to ABC News.  If this story is true
 (and the pieces do seem to fit), there is obviously a very
 tight cover-up in progress which would include our Commander in
 Chief.  Here is the story as it came across:


 "TWA flight 800 was SHOT DOWN by a US NAVY AEGIS MISSILE fired
 from a guided missile ship which was in area W-105 about 30 miles
 from where TWA flight 800 exploded.  W-105 is a Warning Area off
 the southeast cost of Long Island and is used by the military for
 military operations including missile firing.  It is believed that,
 while W-105 is a rather large area, budget constraints have
 dictated that missile firings be done closer to land so that the
 flight time for the P-3 monitor and tracking aircraft can be reduced.

 Guided missile ships conduct practice firings on a regular basis
 and Navy P-3 radar planes track and evaluate the missile shots
 with their onboard instrumentation.  A P-3 aircraft was on a
 southwest heading about over the top of TWA 800.

 There was a USAir flight coming from the Southeast descending
 towards Providence, RI that had been cleared to 21,000 feet and
 Air Traffic Control (ATC) had determined that there would be a
 conflict.  As a result of the traffic conflict, the TWA flight
 was restricted to 13,000 feet.  ATC then requested the USAir
 flight to turn on his landing lights.  If TWA could see his
 lights and identify him visually, the controller could safely
 clear the TWA flight to continue his climb.

 The P-3 was SKIN PAINT, or a non-beacon target.  (This means that
 his transponder was turned OFF.  Transponders reply to ATC radar
 and show a well defined radar target on the controller's scope,
 complete with ID and altitude.  All civilian aircraft and
 airliners are required to fly with them when in controlled
 airspace.  A skin paint target probably would not even be visible
 to the controller.)  The P-3 made NO calls to ATC.  After the
 explosion, he continued his flight to the west and then called
 ATC and asked if they would like him to turn around and assist
 with the "accident".

 You will remember that the first announcement about this accident
 came from the Pentagon.  The spokesman mentioned that they were
 sending the Navy to the crash site.  They immediately sent a Navy
 Captain, who was replaced the very next day by a one-star Admiral
 from Norfolk.  That admiral is still on the scene as of 8-23-96.
 At least 5 Aegis destroyers are based in Norfolk.

 The FBI has conducted about 3,000 eyewitness interviews and the
 NTSB has not been able to be a part of these interviews nor have
 they any access to the contents of them.  Some of those eyewitnesses
 reported seeing lights.  Those were probably the landing lights
 of the USAir plane.

 The NTSB is there in name ONLY.  All announcement made by Mr. Bob
 Francis say absolutely nothing and notice that the FBI is always
 standing beside or behind Mr Francis and it would appear that his
 job is to make sure that nothing is said that would give away
 "THE BIG SECRET!"

 Here is a list of the Aegis Destroyers based at Norfolk.....could
 one of them be the one which fired the fatal shot?....USS Ramage,
 USS Arligh Burke (DDG 51), USS Barry (DDG 52), USS Stout (DDG 55),
 USS Mitscher (DDG 57) and USS Laboon (DDG 58).  USS Ramage has a
 crew of 22 officers and 315 enlisted personnel."


 That is the gist of the story......again he and his source wish
 to remain anonymous, but questions arise......how could they keep
 it quiet this long?  Certainly people in the P-3 and the Destroyer
 would talk?  Why keep it quiet when it is bound to come out, and
 can't be covered for ever?

 But remember that this is an election year.  The Navy has had
 a very tough time in recent years and is very sensitive to its
 reputation.  The administration has dealt very harshly with it.
 Generals and Admirals have been fired with little notice.

 Sources which are very, very familiar with the 747 report that a
 mechanical cause is almost impossible, especially since the data
 and voice recorders give no information.  A mechanical or structural
 failure would have given some warning to the pilots if only a few
 seconds.  The primary cause had to be a large explosion.

 The chemical traces found which are consistant with a bomb are also
 consistant with the explosive compounds used in military missiles.

 Aegis missiles, unlike Stinger missiles and those likely to be used
 by a terrorist, are not heat seekers.  Thus, the recovery of intact
 engines could explain an Aegis missile hit.

 The airplane would not be pressurized (at least not very much) at
 that low altitude.  Therefore, a small bomb in the cabin would
 likely not have such immediate catastrophic effect.  Large cargo
 hold bombs have all but been ruled out.

 The pieces fit..... all except the reasons for the cover up.

I believe that the following message which was passed onto me to be of
upmost importance to the C4I pro group. The message is self-explantory.


Your name, social security number, current address, previous addresses,
mother's
maiden name, birth date, and other personal information are now available
to
anyone with a credit card through a new Lexis database called
P-Trax.  As I am sure you are aware, this information could be used to
commit
credit card fraud or otherwise allow someone else to use your identity.

You can have your name and information removed from this list by making a
telephone request.  Call (800) 543-6862, select option 4 and then option
3 ("all
other questions") and tell the representative answering that you wish to
remove
your name from this P-trax database.  You may also send a fax to (513)
865-7360,
or physical mail to LEXIS-NEXIS / P.O. Box 933 / Dayton, Ohio 45401-0933.

Sending physical mail to confirm your name has been removed is always a
good
idea.

As word of the existence of this database has spread on the net,
Lexis-Nexis has
been inundated with calls, and has set up a special set of operators to
handle
the volume.  In addition, Andrew Bleh (rhymes with "Play") is a manager
responsible for this product, and is the person to whom complaints
about the service could be directed.  He can be reached at the above 800
number.
Ask for extension 3385.  According to Lexis, the manager responsible is
Bill
Fister at extension 1364.

I called this morning and had my name removed.  The representative will
need
your name and social security number to remove you from the list.  I
suggest
that we inundate these people with requests to remove our info from the
list and
FORWARD THIS E-MAIL TO EVERYONE WE KNOW!!!!

No, but when you sent me that I did a quickie net search and
got the rest of the scoop.  It seems that that message was slightly
misleading, although this database does exist in some form (but it
doesn't contain SS#'s).  I'm forwarding Lexis-Nexis'
overly-defensive disclaimer response to that message.  I'm sure
there are some very unhappy people working on the phones there lately.
Regardless, from what I read you have to send a written request if you
want your name removed.  Myself, I'm not too concerned.  If someone
really wanted this rather-useless info about me, they'd find it some
way.  May as well be on a commercial service.  That way I feel like I

 -------------FORWARDED MESSAGE----------------

Statement on the P-TRAK file from LEXIS-NEXIS


LEXIS-NEXIS markets the P-TRAK file to the legal community for use by
general legal practitioners, litigators and public attorneys, as well as
law enforcement agencies and police departments. These professionals use
the P-TRAK file  to assist in locating litigants, witnesses,
shareholders, debtors, heirs and beneficiaries.

It's important to note that LEXIS-NEXIS is a business-to-business
service and is not a consumer online service. The LEXIS-NEXIS service is
targeted to and used by attorneys, businesses and government agencies.

LEXIS-NEXIS is aware of the sensitivities regarding the potential misuse
of information. While business competitors of LEXIS-NEXIS have for some
time made Social Security numbers available to users of their services, and
continue to do so, LEXIS-NEXIS discontinued the display of Social
Security numbers in the P-TRAK file as of June 11, 1996, eleven days
after the product was introduced.

There has been much erroneous information distributed on the Internet
regarding the data displayed in the P-TRAK file. The displayed record
may, but not always, include the name of the individual, the individual's
maiden and assumed names, current as well as up to two previous
addresses, month and year of birth and telephone number. That is the
only information displayed in the P-TRAK file.

Contrary to some messages that have been posted to some Internet
discussion and news groups, the P-TRAK file does not contain any credit
histories, bank account information or other personal financial data, or
medical histories.

The information displayed in the P-TRAK file is an aggregation readily
available from public information sources such as telephone directories
(in print and CD-ROM format) and public records maintained by government
agencies.

Through its actions, LEXIS-NEXIS is balancing the privacy concerns of the
public with the legitimate needs of legal, business and government
professionals for access to accurate sources of publicly available
information. By discontinuing the display of Social Security numbers in
P-TRAK and only providing information that is already available to the
public from other sources, LEXIS-NEXIS believes it has responsibly met
the expressed concerns of the public.

Subject: A First-Class CIA?

Did John Deutch and the CIA warn Bill Clinton that the
anti-Saddam coalition would be severely stressed and
weakened by America's recent actions against Iraq?

If not, why not?

Why does Defense Secretary William Perry continue to
insist that the coalition is "alive and well" when it
is obvious to any casual observer that this is not the
truth?

The larger question: is the CIA and the American IC
continuing to go downhill?

--- BEGIN ---

WASHINGTON (Sep 18, 1996 02:35 a.m. EDT) -- Without an
urgent military threat from Saddam Hussein, the Persian
Gulf coalition is at best a shaky international
marriage, the partners pursuing new and conflicting
interests.

Even though Defense Secretary William Perry insisted
the coalition was "alive and well" following a weekend
trip to the Persian Gulf, signs of stress were visible:
Turkey refused to allow U.S. planes to fly offensive
missions against Iraq from a Turkish air base, and
there were hints that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were
nervous about the aggressive U.S. stance.

France, Italy, Spain and most Arab countries also were
uneasy with the use of force against Iraq....

Hi all.

I've been pretty quiet on this very intersting list.

Earlier this week, e-mail was sent to this alias regarding P-TRACK,
an information service provided by Lexis-Nexis. The following

Lexis-Nexis, contains the official statement about P-TRACK,
as well as instructions for removal from the database.

Sabra,

Here's the information you requested on P-TRACK.  There will be a new
800 number created next week to handle inquiries about P-TRACK.  Until
then, follow the instructions in the statement from LEXIS-NEXIS below.

Later,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATEMENT FROM LEXIS-NEXIS   9/18/96

Incorrect information is being distributed on Internet newsgroups
regarding the data displayed in LEXIS-NEXIS' P-TRAK file.  P-TRAK is like
an electronic "white pages."  The only information displayed is the name
of the individual, current address and up to two previous addresses and
telephone number.  In some cases, the individual's maiden name may appear
and as well as the month and year of birth.  That is the ONLY information
displayed in the P-TRAK file.

Contrary to some messages that have been posted to some Internet
discussion and news groups, the P-TRAK file DOES NOT contain any credit
histories, bank account information, personal financial data, mother's
maiden name or medical histories.  This misinformation has been posted
over and over again to various news groups.

An example of a record appears below:

Name:  DOE, JOHN E
Current Address:  1066 Anywhere Drive, Dayton, OH  95454
Previous Address:  106 Somewhere Drive, Dayton, OH  92454
Birthdate:  9/1965
Telephone Number:  555-1212
On File Since:  6/1/1994

The information displayed in the P-TRAK file is the type of information
readily available from public information sources such as telephone
directories (in print and CD-ROM format) and public records maintained
by government agencies.

LEXIS-NEXIS markets the P-TRAK file to the legal community for use by
general legal practitioners, litigators and public attorneys, as well as
law enforcement agencies and police departments.  These professionals use
the P-TRAK file to assist in locating litigants, witnesses, shareholders,
debtors, heirs and beneficiaries.

LEXIS-NEXIS is aware of the sensitivities regarding the potential misuse
of information.  Business competitors of LEXIS-NEXIS have for some time
made Social Security numbers available to users of their services.  In
addition, Social Security Numbers and other information are available on
the Internet from a number of sources.  Despite this wide availability of
Social Security numbers in the market place, LEXIS-NEXIS discontinued the
display of Social Security numbers in the P-TRAK file as of June 11,
1996, eleven days after the product was introduced.

Through its actions, LEXIS-NEXIS is balancing the privacy concerns of the
public with the legitimate needs of legal, business and government
professionals for access to accurate sources of publicly available
information.  By discontinuing the display of Social Security numbers in
P-TRAK and only providing information that is already available to the
public from other sources, LEXIS-NEXIS believes it has responsibly met
the expressed concerns of the public.

Individuals interested in having their names removed from the P-TRAK file
can e-mail their full name and complete address to:
p-trak@prod.lexis-nexis.com or mail this information to ATTN: P-TRAK,
P. O. Box 933, Dayton, OH 45401.

 Legitimate needs of business and legal professionals? HUH?

There is no business that has a legitimate need for this information,
without ASKING ME for it. Government professionals and law enforcement
can already access this information, from the IRS and other sources.
  This is for business use, and this statement is advertising babbel.

 It doesn't terrify me, but I avoid being added to data bases as
possible, and enjoy a certain amount of privacy from annoying junk mail
and phone irritation as a result. It disturbs me that they feel it a
legitimate business need to supply my unlisted phone number for the

For the Internet-oriented among us, here is the URL:

http://pathfinder.com/time/magazine/domestic/1996/960923/iraq.html

A few key excerpts, on the central theme--"the kiss of death":

--- BEGIN ---

... For five years, the CIA has been running a modest
mission to bind diverse factions of Kurdish and Iraqi
dissidents into an opposition against Saddam Hussein.
With Baghdad's re-entry into northern Iraq, that
mission was obliterated. "Saddam has knocked out many
of America's eyes and ears, and your good name was
tarnished," says Professor Amatzia Baram of Israel's
Haifa University, a leading Iraq expert. "U.S.
credibility and reputation for protecting its friends
has suffered a terrible blow."...

When Saddam's army rolled north, CIA officials claim,
they were able to extract everyone with whom the agency
had a close association, meaning about two dozen
security guards and their families, plus several paid
informants. Even so, the CIA is viewed as having
abandoned several hundred congress members. As for
their mission, it no longer exists. "Our entire covert
action program has gone to hell," says a U.S. official.

The impression that working for the CIA can amount to a
kiss of death is unlikely to be mitigated by the news
that the Clinton Administration will evacuate some
2,500 aid workers, clerks, drivers and translators
employed with U.S. military and relief operations who
fled to the Turkish border in northern Iraq. As for Abu
Khadim and his men, they are still waiting in
Salahuddin. "We are in great danger," he said. "The CIA
couldn't help us; we are soldiers and had to fight. But
now we are asking them to do something for us as soon
as possible: evacuation."

After the Kurdish debacle, the CIA will probably find
it increasingly difficult to persuade the U.S. Congress
to fund similar operations in Iraq and all but
impossible to recruit new operatives. "The CIA has fled
and abandoned a large number of people," says Rend
Rahim Francke, director of the anti-Saddam Iraq
Foundation in Washington. "All Iraqis--all those in the
opposition--feel extremely let down by the U.S." The
damage may also spill into the CIA's semicovert
operation, aimed at moderating the regime in Iran.
"It's going to give pause to anyone wanting to work
with us on Iran," says a knowledgeable official.

Because covert operations are usually kept secret, it
is unlikely that any public hearing will ever be held
to determine how many CIA associates were killed in
Iraq. But this much is clear: the agency's reputation
has been demolished. "It may be that the CIA actually
made tremendous efforts to protect its people," says
Baram. "But the perception among Iraqis is that having
anything to do with Americans is dangerous to your
health." The rout will make the CIA's future tasks in
the Middle East--and perhaps the rest of the
world--harder still to achieve.

--- END ---

We are not back to square one, as the Reuters article had it. It
is much worse than that.

Nothing is more costly than a poorly conceived covert operation.
That's the intelligence lesson here.

The question still remains: who is accountable? Primarily John
Deutch and Bill Clinton, one would reasonably presume.

-------------------------------------------------

   I disagree with Mr. McGuire's statements that CIA
will find it increasingly difficult to persuade the Congress to
fund similar operations in Iraq and all but impossible to
recruit new operatives.

   We recently experienced the terrible consequences of CIA operations
in Guatemala, the Aldrich Ames debacle, details of the CIA disseminating
intelligence from known KGB double agents, plus a number of other
problems.  Those situations created a spate of "investigations" of the
CIA -- the more prominent by the Council on Foreign Relations,
by the House Intelligence Committee and by the President's
Intelligence Oversight Board.  All investigations generally avoided
discussing the damaging evidence and all came down on the side of
increasing the CIA's role.

   In addition you have the popular new Director Deutch
calling for more covert operations. He appointed the Gung Ho David
Cohen to be his Director of Operations -- this Gung Ho attitude is
apparently reflected in the chain of command via the Chief of Division
for the Near East Operations and CIA's Iraqi Chief of Station "Bob."

   In the specific case of Iraq we have the two earlier examples.
One was the arming the Kurds at the request of the Shah -- to unseat Saddam,
but when Iran and Iraq made up, CIA support was withdrawn and the
Kurds decimated. Another similar type operation apparently occurred
in 1988-1991.

   In my own experience - the failure of a CIA covert operation
in Vietnam led directly to sending in the troops along with
greatly expanding the CIA's role in Vietnam - and the Vietnam
War. We now see more U.S. troops and weaponry being sent to the
area.

Below are a few citations re earlier events in Iraq.

If the excerpts are a reasonable indicator, the Time article does harm to
the concept of "informing the public."  One example to make the point:

The article states:  "After the Kurdish debacle, the CIA will probably find
it increasingly difficult to persuade the U.S. Congress to fund similar
operations in Iraq...."  The writer is making two dubious propositions in
this statement:

First, that Congress acts as a brake on covert operations.  The House
Speaker's activities vis-a-vis Iran clearly indicate otherwise, as does
Congressional actions with regard to assistance to Afghanistan during the
1980s.

Second, that the CIA "makes up" a covert action and, then, "sells" it to
Congress.  The coming into existence of a covert operation is not so
simple, as I have argued in previous posts.  The perceived need for such
action usually arises from more than one point and usually has some degree
of support from diverse players in national security policymaking circles.

A final point.  Even in this essentially hostile article (judging by the
excerpts), I can discern no substantive indications that the operation
itself (separating the operation from the policy it was serving) deserves
all the negatives being thrown at it.  The activity was at most a "modest
mission," to use the Time article's words, directed toward creating
something (an opposition to Saddam Hussein) out of nothing.  The commitment
of U.S. human resources to the endeavor was small (the number I have seen
most frequently is "four or five" Americans involved).  That this mission
ultimately failed does not surprise me at all.  That the President felt it
necessary "to do something" about Iraq seems perfectly normal when you
consider the alternative of being labeled "soft on Saddam Hussein" by his
political opposition.

Hummmmm, just how did they get on Guam and does this mean they're

Regarding the "modest mission": in the real world, when
you spend $100 million dollars on a project and not
only don't make a penny but do substantial damage to
the company, you pay a price. What is most likely is
that you lose your job.

The question now is what sort of accountability Bill
Clinton, John Deutch and David Cohen are going to
assume for this operation. If they were were the heads
of IBM or any other first-class company, they would be
out of there.

The central point of this article is that many people
will be reluctant to work with the CIA in the future on
dangerous projects. The CIA is giving the impression to
the world that it is inept and incapable of protecting
its assets.

I think it is quite likely that this incident will be
compared with the Bay of Pigs in future histories of
the American IC--it would appear at first blush to rank
among that order of magnitude--perhaps greater.

The U.S. is now quite severely alienated from nearly
all its allies on Mideast policy. The CIA damaged
American interests, instead of protecting and advancing
them.

David A. Andelman writing in the July/August 1994_Foregin
Affairs_ said that the American cocaine business had an annual
volume of 29 billion (150 tons). My guess is that marijuana has a
similar volume. Guessing again, I put heroin's annual sales in
the neighbor of 10 billion per year.

This give a total of about 73 billion per year, all tax free. To
run an organization of this size, I would guess that it would
take about 25,000 thousand people with about 10,000 devoted to
the marketing and distribution.

There is a kindred business. Illegal arms sales around the world
also generate vast amounts of illegal cash. Ari Ben Menashe wrote
in his _Profits of War_ that Israel accumulated $700,000,000 in a
relatively short time working as a US partner in arms deals.

I ask again, who got rich as a result of Cincinnati, aka Llopango?

The situation in Iraq must be looked at from its economic effect.
The game plan may have always been to keep Iraqi oil off the
world market. The usual supply and demand equations apply to oil.
With 10-15 percent of the supply of oil off the market, there is
a quantifiable price increase. If this is to say, ten cents per
gallon at the pump, it amounts to the same as small non-
progressive tax that anyone who drives pays, which adds up to
billions.

Who benefits? The oil producers and oil distributors.

The Iraq situation will never be solved by covert action as those
plans may be designed to fail.

If our policy is to make Iraq a democracy, why don't we cut a
deal in which Irag install democratic institutuions, including a
mecanism for elections in retrun for cancellation of the
embargos? Doesn't this make more sense than a policy which
apparently calls for Hussiens to kill himself in return for
dropping the embargo?

  1. FOIA/Files/Suggestions/VN

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date:    Tue, 24 Sep 1996 07:58:43 -0700
From:    Ralph McGehee <rmcgehee@IGC.APC.ORG>
Subject: FOIA/Files/Suggestions/VN

   The below contains earlier information plus new details based
on follow-up comments:

Dear David K:

   Your experience is not at all unique. (In seeking information
under the FOIA act on conversations between Chief of Station Colby and
Ngo Dinh Nhu - but receiving virtually nothing of significance after
a six-year wait). The CIA is one of the least responsive of all government
agencies re FOIA requests. In a related sphere, a professor of history
at Rutgers University, chairman of the State Department's Historical Advisory
Committee, Warren F. Kimball, wrote a letter to the editor of the
New York Times (8/23/96) protesting CIA lack of promised cooperation
in declassifying and releasing documents.

   I would advise that you seek help in preparing your appeal --
the ACLU in D.C. might assist.  Also ACLU publishes guides to
filing and appealing FOIA requests. (Phone Number 202 994 7060).
In any case you should anticipate a long, drawn-out battle, that may
produce little. (I also filed FOIA requests with little result.)

Regards,

Ralph McGehee
CIABASE

-----------------------------------------------------------

   Congress some time ago exempted CIA operational files
from the provisions of FOIA unless such involved illegal
activities.  Catch-22 is how can you prove illegal activity
without some sort of access to those files.

   As Chief of Station in Saigon, Colby's activities would
be well-documented in operational files.  His conversations
with Nhu would have been reported both operationally and
to a lesser degree via intelligence reports -- with the
latter the sourcing would be obfuscated.  The Agency's
operational files are maintained under variety of names
and would take a dedicated search to find the proper files --
once found they would be a goldmine.  But since they are
operational, they are automatically exempt from FOIA.

   Incidentally another historian involved in preparing the
official history of U.S. foreign relations also resigned and said:
I cannot protect the integrity of [Foreign Relations of the United States]
series. Warren Cohen, professor history at Michigan state, said re
his resignation as Chairman of Department of State advisory committee
of outside scholars, in protest of the intelligence community's deletion
of historical documents on "security grounds."  Duke u. historian
Bruce Kuniholm said withholding "constitutes a gross misrepresentation
of historical record, sufficient to deserve label of fraud."
Washington Post  4/16/90

Ralph McGehee

-------------------------------------------------------

   (One poster noted that FOIA requests may be handled by New-Hires
unfamiliar with Ngo Dinh Nhu). Comment: I think the CIA hires back
retired officers under contract status to handle FOIA requests - I
do not know the proportion of new hires to veterans but probably
there are old-timers doing much of the work. As David K. notes the
FOIA office is small and severely underfunded and understaffed.

   But in any case conducting an FOIA search one does not need
to know anything about the named subjects of the request. Many
requests I am positive deal with obscure individuals that
no one has heard of. With a name, subject matter, time frame and
geographic location -- searches can be run. It has been a long time
since I have had anything to do with the file systems but I suspect
that search procedures have been refined to some degree; but, also
there were many deficiencies in those file systems that may never have
been corrected.

   In both the directorate of Intelligence and directorate of
Operations many of the names in correspondence have been
recorded electronically in data bases that have not been purged
- so a search for NHU would produce much information since he
was both an operational contact (I do not know if he was a recruited
asset) and a source of much intelligence information.

   One very important aspect of the file-keeping process is
the 201 or personality file.  NHU very early one would have an
Agency 201 file that stored large amounts of information on
a personality of such importance.  This file is recorded in the
central registry and reference to it would be accessed through a
simple instantaneous electronic name search.

   Following are a couple of citations in CIABASE to 201 files.

  the 201 file - is a basic personnel folder in central registry on anyone,
  friend or foe, of interest to CIA. martin, d. (1980). wilderness
  of mirrors 123

  files are divided into different levels security. 201 file opened when
  enough information exists to warrant filing in one place all data or
  when individual of interest to another gvt org that looked to CIA for
  info. sensitive file might be maintained on same individual. sensitive
  file encompassed matters potentially embarrassing to CIA or from sources
  and methods CIA sought to protect. rockefeller commission report.
  (1975). report on CIA activities within the u.s. 143

   In addition the Directorate of Intelligence would have recorded
a great deal of information on NHU and undoubtedly would
have set up a file on him.  Reference to this file should be
accessible electronically.

   Maybe an interesting side note -- my career (unfortunately) had me
spending a great deal of time on files and file procedures -- I made
a number of recommendations re improving the file procedures.  I
believed and believe that there are great gaps in the capabilities of the
various file systems and these gaps were, and probably are, unrecognized by
Agency authorities. I felt that at any time I could take a file check
response by elements of the CIA and augment it significantly.

   To satisfy myself on this point, when in a dead end assignment, I
would occasionally run follow-up traces that almost always produced
important and significantly more information than the original check
-- sometimes the original check produced no record at all where my
follow-up produced much information. My recommendations re file
procedures noted these problems but they were for the most part ignored.

   One of my suggestions re file procedures through the Suggestions
Awards System produced a "no interest" response. A short while later,
ignoring my contribution, the suggestion which I felt went to the heart
of file-checking deficiencies, was mandated but amazingly ignored
in practice.

   I also found it a suicidal career move to go around the established
bureaucracy and actually use the Suggestions Awards System --  my
efforts here re Vietnam resulted in a warning that I jeopardized
my career by my "end-run."

   Another officer found a quick and easy way around the combination
locks on Agency safes. His efforts to bring this to the attention of
his superiors over a period of several years were ignored so he used the
Suggestions Awards System -- he proved his point many times in a
demonstration -- he was locked overnight in an office with
about forty to fifty safes, he unlocked them all in a short
period of time and sat and waited until morning. This effectively
ended his career and he left the Agency.

Hello

Here in Sweden many people believe that some kind of US intelligence agency
runs a project which they call "Big Ear", (the name of course has
connotations to Orwells 1984). This project is believed to record all radio
and tv transmissions in the nortern hemisphere. Is this just a paranoic
rumor or ....

Could it be the DEW line?  There are (were?) a number of facilities in
Canada and the north of England (Farthingdale, I think, which is NSA but
might have similar uses) dedicated to detecting launches of Soviet ICBMs.
That would be my guess judging from your location, though I've never heard
of "Big Ear."  And since you're from Sweden, whatever happened to all
those mysterious underwater soundings in your waters?  Any (former) Soviet
subs ever come up?

In principle, NSA does attempt to monitor just about all communications
traffic that it can get access to.

Fylingdales is BMEWS [Ballistic Missile Early Warning System] which is used
to detect missile launches, and is not NSA [it is RAF].

Would the RAF, then, also house the GCHQ there?  My understanding is that
NSA-GCHQ are pretty chummy, and share some facilities in the UK.  Menwith
Hill (you may need to correct me on spelling again) I thought was one.

While one cannot exclude the possibility of there being one or two folks
onsite who cash GCHQ paychecks, there doesn't seem to be an NSA presence at
the two US BMEWS sites [Thule and Clear], so there would be little reason to
expect GCHQ at Fylingdales.

Yes, Menwith is such a facility

Tom:

       The Big Ear may just be a nickname for the National Security
Agency, which monitors all sorts of communications.
       There is no question all radio and TV stuff is recorded--in fact
there is a Museum which archives all of the network TV broadcasts for
research. Does this mean every local station is catalogued, or every rock
N roll d.j. program is analyzed--I doubt it.

  declined an interview on subject. numerous officials said North never
  mentioned shipments. plane and crew continued be used as official carriers.
  North relied on robert owen, who traveled to Central America. nhao hired
  owen who secretly worked for North. North wrote in diary on 8/9/85:
  "honduran dc-6 which is being used for runs out of new orleans is probably
  being used for drug runs into U.S." next day he wrote "meeting with a.c. -
  name of DEA person in new orleans re bust on mario dc-6." a.c. could be

  crew had criminal records." "nice group of guys the boys choose. the
  company is also one that mario has been involved with using in the past,
  only that had a quick name change. incompetence reigns." in owen's
  testimony, he identified foley as pat foley of summit aviation, which still
  operates in delaware and identified the boys as CIA. North's notebooks show

  nicaragua,  81-96  news story has made danilo blandon the star. "a
  full-service drug dealer, is the star of a recent series of explosive
  articles on how fbi ignored and CIA encouraged california cocaine and crack
  consumption to finance Contra rebels in nicaragua during mid-1980s. in
  addition to tons of inexpensive cocaine, blandon also sold assault weapons
  and sophisticated commo gear, including hidden microphone detectors.
  blandon first appeared in DEA files in 1981 and was arrested during police
  raids in 1986, but no charges were filed. again in 1991, he was arrested,
  this time for money laundering in los angeles, but case was dropped at
  federal request. blandon, 45, is youngest son of wealthy nicaraguan
  landowners and worked for somoza in the late 1970s before raising money for
  Contras during 80s. he was a full-time DEA informant and, as a businessman,
  ran car rentals in miami, tampa, fort lauderdale and orlando, all in
  florida, plus restaurants in miami and san diego, a car lot in los angeles
  and import-export businesses on the east and west coasts. his right-hand
  men in the Contra drug business were nicaraguan norwin meneses, 48, and
  American "freeway" rick ross, 36, who, by 1987, had one of the largest
  crack cocaine distribution networks in the country. blandon is "the johnny
  appleseed of crack in california -- the crips' and bloods' [los angeles
  gangs] first direct-connect to cocaine cartels of colombia". according to
  scientific reports, crack was invented in san francisco, in 1974 and, with
  help of blandon and others, the world epidemic spread from there in the
  late 1970s and early 1980s. intelligence - a computerized intelligence

  nicaragua,  84-85  drug trafficker jorge morales claimed CIA approached him
  in 1984 offering him legal protection if he agreed to fly weapons to
  Contras while returning with drugs. weapons were loaded at opa-locka
  airport near miami or executive airport in fort lauderdale and flown to
  honduras, costa rica or el salvador. $4.5 million in drug profits went to

  nicaragua, colombia,  83-96  during much of 1980s, the san jose mercury
  news has reported, a drug-dealing op sold tons of cocaine to street gangs
  in los angeles and funneled millions in drug profits to a latin American
  guerrilla Contra army run by CIA. an extensive three-part series, published
  aug. 18-20 by the mercury news, maps a CIA drug network that "opened the
  first pipeline between colombia's cocaine cartels and the black
  neighborhoods of los angeles. reporter gary webb concluded: cocaine that
  flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America -- and provided
  the cash and connections needed for l.a.'s gangs to buy automatic weapons.
  CIA arranged an alliance between a U.S.-backed army attempting to overthrow
  a revolutionary socialist government" in nicaragua and drug-dealers
  wielding machine guns in ghetto areas of southern california. on capitol
  hill that summer, iran-Contra hearings avoided CIA and Contra links to
  large-scale cocaine smuggling. yet, congressional panels had access to
  handwritten notes by reagan administration official Oliver North, whose
  notebooks contained 543 pages with references to the drug trade. in one
  notation about Contra arms supplies, North wrote: "$14 million came from
  drugs." even after such excerpts from North's notes were made public, most
  news media bypassed the Contra-CIA-cocaine connection. the detour around
  the story became more extreme in 1988: the Senate's subcommittee on
  terrorism and narcotics, chaired by john kerry, released an in-depth report
  that nailed the CIA for cocaine trafficking with the Contras. but media
  coverage was muddled and fleeting. mediabeat igc.apc.org 8/23/96

  50-75  early 1950s, CIA engaged in an extensive program of human
  experimentation, using drugs, psychological and other means in search of
  techniques to control human behavior CIA has so far found no evidence that
  radiation experiments on humans were part of this program. CIA documents
  and a 1963 inspector general (ig) report. however state quite clearly that
  mkultra was a program concerned with research and development of chemical.
  biological. and radiological materials capable of employment in clandestine
  operations to control human behavior. ig report states that "additional
  avenues to the control of human behavior had been designated . . as
  appropriate to investigation under the mkultra charter, including
  radiation, electroshock. various fields of psychology, sociology, and
  anthropology, graphology, harassment substances, and paramilitary devices
  and materials." program included unwitting experimentation on humans with
  lsd (lysergic acid diethylamide), brainwashing, and other interrogation
  methods. CIA's human behavior program originated in 1950 and was motivated
  by soviet, chinese, and North korean use of mind control techniques. it
  began under the code name bluebird (and was later known as artichoke) and
  was operated by the office of security and osi with support from other
  offices. mkultra formally began in 4/53 as a special, clandestine funding
  mechanism for dod human behavior research. program was subject of
  investigations by  75  rockefeller commission, Senate church committee in
  1976, and hearings by senator kennedy in 1975 and 1977, however, these
  committees did not focus on radiation experiments, and no such information
  was found by them. CIA said that mkultra involved human experimentation
  using every research "avenue" except for radiation. CIA also noted that
  most of the mkultra records were deliberately destroyed in 73 by the order
  of then dci r. helms. in early 9/91, CIA found a document that summarized
  work done for artichoke which states that in addition to hypnosis, chemical
  and psychiatric research [it explored] other physical manifestations.
  including heat and cold, atmospheric pressure, radiation. there is no
  indication from this document that radiation was explored on humans
  directly. it makes clear that CIA did "explore" radiation as a possibility
  for the defensive and offensive use of brainwashing and other interrogating
  techniques. advisory committee on human radiation experiments, interim

  1. Questions Which Somebody Should Answer

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date:    Sun, 29 Sep 1996 20:54:58 -0400
From:    Joe Canepa <canepa@MERCURY.INTERPATH.COM>
Subject: Questions Which Somebody Should Answer

I suspect that American institutions favor America's teams, like
the Cowboys and the Braves. But isn't IC support of the Crips and
the Bloods a little extreme?

If an institution is to investigate itself, is it discreet for
the head of the institution to publically claim that the future
investigation will not reveal anything wrong?

If the Contras fielded a 5,000 man army, which ambushed
civilians, as opposed to fighting the other side's soldiers, would not 25
million per year be adequate financing for the Contras?

If Rep. Waters was right and the crack racket grossed 2 million
per day in LA alone, would there not be some surplus profits
beyond the Contra funding?

If the Israelis, as per Ari Ben-Menashe, accumulated $700 million
in arms deals, how much did the first team make in the arms and
dope deals?

If, as per Bob Tyrrell in his _Boy Clinton_, Don Gregg and Felix
Rodriguez set up the Mena operation, where was George Bush?

If, as per Terry Reed in his _Compromised_, Oliver North,
William Barr, and Felix Rodriguez set the Mena operation, where
was George Bush?

Is it credible that an ex-head of the CIA, running for president would
permit a key staffer to be literally sleeping with an "enemy" key staffer.
Or did enemy really mean freind back then?

If, as per Anonymous in _Primary Colors_, Clinton's 1992 campaign
plane was supplied by "Southern Airways", could the author have
been talking about Southern Air Transport? And the money for the
nomination campaign: was the IC the donor?

Post JFK, did anyone ever notice that the credo of _Duty
Honor and Country_ may have been downsized by one word?

  1. Radio Free Asia

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date:    Mon, 30 Sep 1996 14:29:19 EDT
From:    Richard Cummings <100662.3357@COMPUSERVE.COM>
Subject: Radio Free Asia

For those interested in Public Diplomacy issues:

Another chapter in United States Public Diplomacy began today as Radio Free Asia
(RFA) started broadcasting To China.

Radio Free Asia, which eventually intends to also broadcast to Tibet, Burma,
Cambodia, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam, is the result of the U.S. International
Broadcasting Act of 1994 (PL 103-236, Title III), which declared that:

"The continuation of existing United States international  broadcasting, and the
creation of a new broadcasting service to  the people of the People's Republic
of China and other countries  of Asia, which lack adequate sources of free
information and  ideas, would enhance the promotion of information and ideas,
while advancing the goals of United States foreign policy."
(Sec. 302(4).


Richard Richter, President of Radio Free Asia, is quoted as saying that the new
service will "will have hard news broadcasts, some features and culture
programming." Richter also said that the station is "an objective news
organization that does not engage in propaganda."

Subject: BIG EAR

     To the folks interested in BIG EAR.

     I was watching "The Learning Channel" last night and there was a program on
     Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).  BIG EAR is in OHIO and it
     is looking for intelligent extraterrestrial radio signals.  That was as of
     1992.  The program did not state whether it is still being funded.  By the
     was the largest radio telescope in the world (1000 ft across) is in Puerto
     Rico.

Subject: The Reawakening of the Teddy Bears

-- [ From: David R. Huff * EMC.Ver #3.0 ] --

Serg Thion writes:
>For the Americans, one should think about Slavery, Native
Land stealing, mass killing in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, invasions of
several countries in Southern America, support of the Terrorist state of
Israel and Arab ferocious dictatorships, like Saoudi Arabia, Jordan, etc. ,<


Speaking as one American to the rest of the Planet & the Membership,
If propagandistic cyber-baiting is your goal, do grace the Euro-scandal
sheets, they love half baked out of context stuff. However, if history and a
full reporting of events are of interest let's set a few things straight.

1. America was and still is deeply concerned about slavery. So much so we
risked our entire State to end it in the 1860s. It cost  one of our greatest
leaders his life, Abraham Lincoln. In the Twentieth Century the greatest
campaign for Civil Rights ever known was begun. It cost dearly to accomplish
. Still working on it.

2. The Native American has a very real grievance and it is being addressed
by due process of law as fast as the courts will hear the cases. This is
resolved by rule of Law, not AK-47s, and molotov cocktails. Justice by Law
is slow, but it always happens.

3. Mass killings in Korea. Get one thing very straight, history records it
was the Communist North Korean Forces who crossed the 38th Parallel and
INVADED. The United Nations was called upon to assist a fellow peace loving
country. Many countries responded. The USA was in 1950, as is now, a member
of the UN and promptly responded to the call for help.  Yes, there were many
casualties.  Asian Land Wars are very bloody events.

4. For the record, Southern America is the 13 states of the Southeastern
United States.  The last invasion there was in 1860. Unless you wish to
include the tourists and gripe-masters of the Olympics.   We overlook those
things.

5. Terrorist Israel?? Really now. Don't you mean the mad terror bombers that
killed innocent citizens at Lockerbee,Scotland?  Possibly, the murders who
came to Munich, Germany who killed Olympic Athletes.  The Iraqis who gassed
innocent civilians with Nerve Gas.  The Serb Genocide Masters of Sebrenica.
How about your glorious Chinese PLA heroes attacking unarmed citizens at
Tianamenn Square.  Remember: All the rabble wanted was democracy. Scary
isn't it?

6. Ferocious Arab Dictatorships: Syria, Libya, Iraq, & Iran.
Gutsy Peacemakers: King of Jordan, & Chairman Arafat of the        PLO.
They build countries, not destroy them. Where are they tonight? In America,
talking and trying.  Wonder why they didn't go to France?


Clinging to tired old Cold War era Third World propaganda about the bad old
West and the glorious Communists Paradise is a symptom of an out of date
uninformed mind.  Wake-up.  The Berlin Wall fell 8 years ago.   The Soviet
Empire is DEAD, historic fact.

When a country is invaded and calls for help, it can either go to the UN and
whine its sorry head off or call on America and get the best chance of
having a country to go back to live in.   Win, lose, or draw, it is the best
deal around.

I am very sure the Iraqis couldn't get elected to the office of camel dung
shoveler in Kwait today.  Wonder why?  Life in Province 19 just wasn't so
nice once upon a time.

Want to do some world class criticizing? Go find out what the Chinese did to
Tibet.  Seems Asian People like to forget those little things in the Third
World.

Bottomline: Don't arouse the Teddy Bears.

Subject: Re: The Reawakening of the Teddy Bears

>From Martin Shackelford: Some comments on David Huf response:

1. Slavery: it was around for a much longer period than it's been gone so
far; versions of it have continued well into the 20th
century--sharecropping, peonage, and even actual slavery--there was a
case here  in Michigan a few years ago. As for civil rights, the struggle
indeed still has a long way to go, as Martin Luther King recognized in
the months before his death--little of the Poor People's Campaign goals
have been achieved.

2. I'm not sure many Native Americans would agree that justice "always
happens." Much of their history belies that assertion. In fact, many
groups in this country would find that assertion absurd: victims' rights
groups, blacks, hispanics, women. I'm not sure justice for Native
Americans is even possible at this point, they have lost so much. The
record presented in the recent mini-series "The West" is a sorry one.

3. History records many things, but that doesn't mean they are all true.
Contemporary New York Times reports brought together by I.F. Stone in his
book. The Hidden History of the Korean War, suggest the genesis of the
war was not quite that simple. The West took advantage of a Soviet
boycott of the U.N. Security Council to get a resolution through to send
troops. The U.N.'s independence has been compromised from the start by
the larger powers, and mostly the U.S.

4. Here, Thion is clearly referring to South America, where we have
traditionally behaved very badly, as documented by now in numerous books.
As a matter of fact, our childish approach to Cuba continues to the
present day.

5. By Terrorist Israel, I believe the reference is to the part of
Israel's history which began with terror bombings in the 1940s by the
Irgun against the British to found the State of Israel; efforts to drive
Palestinians out of the country; severe mistreatment of Palestinians
within Israel; bombings of neighboring Lebanon; blowing up of Palestinian
homes; Israeli settlements in Palestinian areas; political repression of
Palestinians; detentions without trials; and numerous others. Many of
these issues are explored in depth in articles in Z Magazine, and the
late lamented Lies of Our Times.
There are also the post-Munich retaliatory assassinations, and other
Mossad  activities. This is not to say that the terrorists you cite are
not equally bad--just that Israel is too often "overlooked" in that
category because of its close ties to the U.S., rather as contra
terrorism was in Nicaragua, and right-wing death squads in Guatemala.

6. Saudi Arabia, like Kuwait, is ruled by a repressive elite. That's not
too controversial.

7. The Cold Warriors of the West, and the Bureaucratic Soviets of the
East both caused more problems than they solved, and the Cold War did
severe damage to the economies of both major players, from which neither
has recovered noticeably. Amazing that, despite the death of "Soviet
Communism," the U.S. is still playing the same kinds of games in the
Third World. Of course, we were doing it well before "the threat of
Soviet Communism" was the current explanation for our behaviors. The way
we acquired Florida is an example.

Meanwhile, the Soviets and Chinese committed their own strings of
atrocities, including activities in Eastern Europe, Tibet, and elsewhere.


Nor does the fact that the Iraquis were criminal in their invasion of
Kuwait justify the corruption in Kuwait before and after the war; nor
does it justify some of the tactics that were employed in fighting the
war, or in quitting abruptly and leaving the Kurds in the lurch, at the
behest of our anti-Kurd ally, Turkey.

Teddy Bears like Teddy Roosevelt, with his "Big Stick"? The Teddy Bears
are running things, to the detriment of most of the world, including most
U.S. citizens.

I've studied history all my life--it's not quite as cut and dried as you
would  have us believe.

Indeed you are right.  But would you be opining that the U.S. is
responsible for that slavery?  I think that was the gist (at least, it is
what I inferred) from the initial post.  As to the current civil rights
climate, the loss of Dr. King, a true hero in my book, was perhaps the
biggest boon to "White" nationalists, etc., and all those who, on the flip
side, see justice somehow served by destroying their own communities and
beating to near death innocent bystanders.  I would argue that things have
improved in terms of "race"; your arguments may have more relevance in
terms of economics and the widening gaps between rich and poor.

Perhaps it would be better to say that "Americans truly seek jsutice."  I
think it is part of our national character and, injustices to Native
Americans aside (who I beleive are the only minority who have a gripe that
has been less-comprehensively addressed than others), when Americans see
something unfair, the general gut response is to try and fix it.

If one wishes to become deconstructionist (dare I say revisionist) what
you say above is true.  Little groups of sabateurs wre crossing back and
forth on BOTH sides of the border.  However, please draw a moral as well
as factual distinction between both sides having antagonisms and one
ultiamtely by force of arms -- an actual invasion -- seeking to impose its
will on the other.  The two societies, even at that time, were quite
different, and seems to lend credence to the view that "autocratic"
societies that we supported are far more reformable thatn the so-called
"totalitarian" versions of our erstwhile foes in the Soviet Bloc.

Our policy towards Cuba can be debated.  However, let us not ignore the
fact that the rafts and dinghys are headed NORTH from Cuba to Florida.  In
addition, it would be interesting to see the reaction of many critics of
the U.S. if it had been America that downed a Cuban military plane in
international waters, instead of Cuban jets destroying an unarmed
aircraft.

Your alluding to the King David hotel and Jaffa Gate do indeed point out
the similarities in tactics of Isralei nationalists and the Palestinians.
The point is, there is ample blame on both sides, although I see the
current problems instigated more from the new right-wing leadership in
Israel.  However, the inital argument wa that somehow the U.S. bears the
blame for all these ills.  That, as you mentioned in your Korea example,
is FAR too simplistic.

Like Iran, (Kuwait, by the way, is moving to have its first parliamentary
elections), but it seems because Teheran is against the U.S., they are
conveniently left out of the equation when discussing repressive regimes.
It is useful to look at where the agitation comes from in KSA, Kuwait,
Bahrain, etc.  Look at where the political opposition has its roots in
Iran as well.  You will probably see a colocation of the sources in Iran
itself - one exported, the other suppressed internally no less brutally
than in those regimes you castigate.

When I see U.S behaviour in the post-Cold War era, I see initial
demobilization, followed by reluctant acceptance of its role as a
superpower.  I see America institute the MArshall Plan, while Soviet
troops enforce its ideas of reconstruction in the Esat.  Mind you, I'm not
saying our rebuilding of the West was completely altruistic.  It does,
however, bear noting, the difference in how we generally pursued our goals
vis-a-vis the Soviets.

Your criticism of Kuwaiti politics ahs nothing to do with the invasion and
Gulf War, nor does it lessen the fact that it was in our interest to se
that situation reversed.  The "blaming the victim" you referred to earlier
seems an admonishment to keep in mind when discussing this issue.

While there is nothing to "debate" in this statement, I nonetheless feel
the need to express my opinion that the U.S. in its actions or politics
has hardly been to the detriment ot the rest of the world.  My post has
probably sounded more "America Right or Wrong" than I would intend, but I
feel that those who cut such a braod swath with theior critiques of the
U.S. miss the underlying current of U.S. policy since WW II.  While all
our actions have certainly not been benign, to cast the U.S. as the
eternal Bogeyman serves neither history nor those who have made it.

I'd add finally that your post is nonetheless just what the doctor
ordered to get some rancor-free debate going . . .

          I have read David Huff's and Martin Shackelford's messages.  They are
     both right, to some extent, in what they say about the US and its role in
     history.  However, it comes down to this.  ALL countries HAVE done things
     they are not necessarily proud of having done.

          Let's try and hold the governments, not necessarily the people,
     accountable for their actions DURING THE TIME THAT THEY HAVE DONE THEM and
     not many decades, hundreds, or thousands of years after the fact.  Usually
     it's not the people of the country doing these dastardly deeds it's the
     governments.

          For those of you who don't live in the United States and live in
     countries that allow their citizens to voice their opinion freely and
     openly, please continue to do so.  Truthful criticism, from all sides, is
     beneficial to all.

          The bottom line is that if you live in the United States of America
     and you don't like the government change the government.  By the way, this
     can be done next week by all of you that give a hoot.  If you don't vote
     don't complain about the situation.  I for one am going to try and change
     the situation.

People spoke out against slavery for centuries, and acted, by teaching
slaves to read, or helping them escape.  Slavery continued despite their
actions.  I think the first ethical opposition to the idea of slavery
(rather than just advocating good conditions for slaves) was
in the 17th century, so there was nearly two centuries of
opposition before the general abolition of slavery in the
west.  If you would like a world cause, slavery still exists
in India, Nepal, the Sudan, Haiti and quite a few other
places, and the British Anti-Slavery Society is still active,
and has quite a bit to do.

Ralph:

       As an admirer of your past writings, it was good to see you
posting here. I also understand from Deanie Richards that we will be able
to access more of your work soon on her excellent website, JFK Place (I
felt that way BEFORE she put my stuff on there, by the way--I hadn't
found any site more comprehensive). Welcome.
       Your post on CIA recruitment and polygraph testing was most
informative. My own reading has indicated the polygraph is about 75%
accurate, which is not very high considering some of the uses to which
the findings are put.
        There have been recent reports of a new computer system designed
to detect lies, but what I've seen so far hasn't impressed me much, as
the computer works with the same kinds of information as the polygraph,
so is unlikely to be more accurate. Apparently, a person sticks his or
her finger into a sensor-glove, which reads physiological changes.

The story actually broke in the SJ Mercury News.  They're doing
continuing updates on what their investigation turns up, and apparently
the DoJ is using their web site as a repository of primary source docs.

I might point out that, when large sums of money are on the table, esp.
"untraceable" money, people will do quite a few things that they might
otherwise not do, simply for the sake of the money. Given that there are
suggestions that upwards of $20 million disappeared (grabbed into the
drug stream, but didn't make it into Contra financing), there's a great
deal of motivation, without any other agendas required.

That's a rather loaded question, IMHO. Genocide, to my mind, has always
been a good deal more complete than what happened in LA. The implication
is that the tobacco industry, by manipulating nicotine levels to
maintain addiction, is equally guilty of genocide. An argument that
simply doesn't hold water.

Old rule - try the simple answers first - they're most often closer to
the truth. How about "it was done by a small group of people who found a
way to (a) raise money for a cause they had an interest in, and (b) skim
a significant amount of cash for their personal use."

There is minimal excitment about the San Jose paper's story because it does
not lead naturally to the conclusions you seem to want to draw from it.
There are some disturbing aspects to the story to those concerned about
institutional controls, but a careful reading of the articles will show
that thay do not state that the CIA as a matter of institutional policy
"sponsored" the importation of cocaine into the United States.  I am not
sure it is possible to get a clear charge of "condoned" based on the
articles alone.  While I do not reject out of hand the possibility that
individuals with some form of CIA ties may have been involved, that is a
long way from drawing the conclusion of institutional support and the
specific targeting for purposes of "genocide" (your word not mine) of the
U.S. African-American population by the U.S. government.

>In the news, the spin on it is always that the CIA is doing it to

That is an interesting comment in view of the situation where I have never
seen or read a mainline news story suggest, much less state as fact, that
the CIA has some vast amount of money for which it is not accountable.
There is a huge gulf between "black" activities and off-the-budget
operations.  This is not the place for a lesson in how government manages
its money, but the the CIA does not have some privately generated fund for
which it is not accountable and which it uses to carry out heinous crimes
against humanity.

>Are we not discussing it because it cuts too close to live nerves?

No, we are not discussing it in the form you have presented here; because
there is nothing to discuss between people who believe that the U.S.
government can, has, or will behave in the fashion supposed here and those
who accept the fallability of government and of the individuals who make up
the government but do not view either the system or the people who work in
the system as pure evil.

I certainly don't think that our government or civil servants are
monstrous, but I do believe that they are fallible, and, sometimes, are
capable of monstrous things.  That's why it's important for us to talk
about it.  I am also not discounting the importance of an intelligence
community; without the CIA, the US would have been rolled over long ago.

Perhaps it's a reach to imply institutional support of depopulation (a
nicer word than genocide, since that seemed to offend you) in the South
Central LA area and others affected by the crack epidemic.  What kind of
internal controls are there within the CIA and other similar
organizations?  What kind of external controls?  In what way are
sensitive operations compartmentalized and yet _still effectively
overseen?_

Actually, I have been waiting specifically to hear your take on the
situation, because as (I assume) a political science professor, you have
a vastly greater knowledge of the subject matter than I, a humble
amateur student of world affairs.

There is one thing I have a question about. You state:
>That is an interesting comment in view of the situation where I have >ever seen

At this point, I could easily raise the standard facile questions about
a controlled media, but that seems a bit naive in this age of muckraking
and rapaciously prying journalists.  What I'm wondering is: what is your
take on the Iran-Contra mess?  Wasn't the whole problem there the
question of whether the CIA did indeed illegally sell arms to Iran and
funnel the money to the "freedom fighters?"  I don't think anything in
my post implied that the "CIA has some vast amount of money" for which
they are not accountable, but the whole point of Iran-Contra is that
they were funnelling money from one place to another through gray,
questionable or downright illegal activities.  Was I wrong about this?
Was there some other reason for bringing Oliver North to the stand?  In
a democratic society, given this kind of track record, don't you think
that continued allegations of the same kind of malfeasance at least
demand a credible investigation, to finally debunk them if nothing else?

At this point, I am questioning the wisdom of getting into a debate in a
public forum with a political science professor, but I am genuinely
curious as to what you think.

My fondest wish is to see this ongoing issue resolved.

Jason Thomas

If these allegations are true (in the manner you have opined here) it
really won't matter whether the CIA was "in" on it or not.  Certainly, we
know that the Agency has dealt with drug dealers (for want of a better
term) in Vietnam/Laos and Afghanistan.  Granted, it was not to support the
drug trade, but was ancillary to other causes (us not griping, basically,
about what the people supporting our interests were doing as a main
business).  The problem is that these charges have been circulating for a
long time, and the Agency, as it does anytime it is underr attack, says
nothing.  Of course, even if they did, it would not matter as denials
would be read as demonstrating just as much complicity as saying nothing
for the more deidcated conspiriatti.

At any rate, if this happened as described in the paper, and people were
shuffling drug money around to get aroundf the Bolan Amendment, I think it
would be worthwhile for the authorites to have a second round of chats
with North, Secord, Fernandez (the CIA station chief, I believe?).  What
galls me personally is that, again, if true, these hyper-patriots have
then done siginificant damage not only to our intelligence agencies but
America in general.  For those in Washington, what has Ollie been saying
on his radio program?  How about Liddy?  What is his take on this?

Subject: Lukanov Murder Wrap-up

From a friend in Sofia, here is a  wrap-up of the murder of former
Bulgarian Prime Minister Lukanov this week:


Bulgarian top Socialist (former Communist) parliamentarian, former Prime
Minister and former head of Topenergy, Andrei Lukanov, 58, was killed
Wednesday morning in Sofia. He was buried yesterday (Friday).

While leaving his home, he was shot to death. Police officers said that
Lukanov was hit in the head and heart by four 9 mm bullets. Forensics
reported later that three 9 mm slugs were removed from Lukanov's body;
one was  not found. Reportedly, the weapon was a Russian-made Makarov
pistol. No one heard the shots, thus it would be safe to presume that
the assassin used a silencer.

Neighbors said that a person aged about 30 years, looking like a
"bagman" or "bum" (some used the French expression "clochard"), had been
observed during the last couple of days in the area collecting old
papers from garbage cans. According to one witness, the man did not
answer questions, which caused people to believe he was either
deaf-and-dumb, or a foreigner, or insane. The same person had been seen
in front of the house minutes before the victim was shot. Police sources
speaking under condition of anonymity, said Wednesday evening that they
have a "computer portrait" of the suspect, based on descriptions from
Lukanov's neighbors.

Last April, Lukanov declined to be protected by Secret Service agents.
He hired a driver and two bodyguards from the private security service
Omega MB. For still unknown reasons, the guards did not appear on duty
that morning and Lukanov was alone on the street while the chauffeur was
driving the car out of the garage. Police took the bodyguards into
custody for questioning.

Authorities would not speak about the motives, but commentators
concentrated mainly at the most probable reasons: political murder,
elimination of "a person who knew too much" about the shadow economics
in Bulgaria, or a mixture of both.

Observers recall that inside the ruling Socialist Party, Lukanov was one
of the main critics of Prime Minister Videnov. During three recent
plenary sessions of the party leadership,  he called for replacement of
the Prime Minister. Last February, Lukanov publicly stated that the
Socialist Party "is regenerating the Stalinist type of state," and "it
is restoring contacts with the former secret services."

Some commentators point out that a decade ago, Lukanov became a partner
and close friend of the late British tycoon Robert Maxwell. According to
insiders, quoted by The Guardian, Lukanov and Maxwell made transfers of
huge sums into and out of Bulgarian banks, especially created for the
purpose of financial speculation and, possibly, money laundering. The
mysterious drowning of Maxwell in 1991 put an end of their partnership.

Most of the independent analysts in Bulgaria are looking into the
controversial role of Lukanov in the field of gas and oil business.
Lukanov was removed last July as head of Topenergy, a joint venture with
Gasprom of Russia, and replaced by Iliya Pavlov, president of Bulgaria's
largest private corporation Multigroup. At that time Pavlov told
reporters that Lukanov caused "friction" between Topenergy and the
Bulgarian government. The same day, he told Bulgarian State Television:
"With all due respect to all politicians and to Andrei Lukanov, we
believe that economic system shall not be guided by political
aspirations."

A close political friend of Lukanov said that two days before the
killing, Lukanov had been talking to several top political allies about
the necessity to change the Prime Minister and his cabinet.  Lukanov
added that he had proof about corruption in the government and about
huge sums misappropriated.

In the past, Lukanov was also deeply involved in a project codenamed
NEVA.  NEVA had been created by the KGB and Bulgarian State Security to
steal US and Western technology in the field of high density memory
discs and to apply the technolody in the State-owned DZU Disk Memory
Factory at Stara Zagora, in South-Central Bulgaria.

It is certainly no coincidence that among the reports about the murder,
Bulgarian newspapers gave prominent place to reports from Moscow,
confirmed later by BBC World Service, that the government of Russia had
frozen the accounts of Gasprom.  Rem Vyakhirev, a close friend and
business partner of Lukanov, has admitted that the company owes three
billion dollars and has payment difficulties.

In a 1992 newspaper interview, Lukanov was asked "You are obviously
standing in the way of some people. Who are they?" His enigmatic answer:
"Both the old and the new Mafia."

You were not looking at genocide. You were and perhaps are looking at is
a huge business that generates tons of cash for tons of cociane and tons of
guns. All tax free.

The motive is simple greed, not necessarily murder. Why kill one's good
customers?

To much together to be a coincidence. Looks like an intelligent well
thought out marketing campaign to me.

I don't the money is going to the US Tresuary. Just where it is going and
where it went will solve any conspiracy question. Mena drug guy Barry
Seal was said to have maintained extensive bank records. Reporters Denton
and Morris supposedly have them as does the office of Kenneth Starr and
Rep. Leach. Will the records ever see the light of day?

To run a business that has sales of 29 billion per year, I would guess you
need about 20 to 30 thousand employess. Accusations that individuals
within the armed sevices in Homestead, Llopango, and, just revealed this
week in Texas where the National Guard is accused of hauling dope, only
amplifiy the fact that many people must be involved. In short there must
be a conspiracy and the motive is greed, not necessarily racism.

As for the media on point, did you ever notice that the subject of dope
dealing is focused on the street dealing and the foreign production.
Distribution and marketing are generally ignored but these are
fundamental to any business legal or otherwise.

I think the estimate of the overall intel budget (which includes NSA) is
generally accepted to be about $28 billion.  I've read estimates that the
NSA budget is around $3.5 billion, but I would guess that that might not
reflect the sheer hardware costs of the satellites, computer systems to
analyze intake, etc., which seems to be what absorbs the technical
intelligence budget in general.  That means that Air Force, NRO, certainly
some Navy offices (SPAWARS comes to mind) and other agencies that have
even more obscure acronyms at least contribute to the overall capability.
The Defense Budget Project in D.C. has a lot of info on this, as does FAS.

At any rate, I think it might be fair to say that the ability to exclude
from further analysis your "Mary Tyler Moore" shows, etc., is pretty
advanced.  In other words, maybe NSA does catch everything in a large
funnel, but what ultimately gets turned into an intel product is a
fraction of what exists as traffic.  My understanding from a generalist's
perspective is that the problem now is fairly strong cryptographic means
available increase the work load of resources at Fort Meade dramatically
(dramatically defined as some big percentage, but I have no way of really
coming up with a realistic figure).  In other words signals and
communication traffic is getting progressively harder to "crack" because
of the proliferation of secure systems.  And this problem actually ties
into HUMINT importance.

It has been suggested by others (a guy by the name of James Bamford, I
believe, who wrote "Puzzle Palace") that it may one day be possible to
have unbreakable codes that the so-called "brute force" method of cracking
(setting up a Cray or whatever to run solutions until it finds the right
one) can't cope with.  This means the only way to "read another
gentleman's mail" is to compromise a key or some other kind of "shortcut"
that gives you a glimpse into how the code may be formed.  As a
non-techie, I lack the precision to be able to describe this more clearly,
but I guess it is kind of like knowing a person's birthday may give you a
hint as to their ATM number.

However, I would not say that a prolifereation of secure systems means
that the towel should be thrown in.  Indeed, operational discipline (kind
of like birth control, forget it once and you're a mommy/daddy),
especially with sub-national level players (terrorist groups etc.) is
often not strong, allowing COMINT to be extremely useful even in today's
world.

   In response to this query I am sending a brochure
of CIABASE which I maintain and sell.  For any who are
interested in more details, please see the addresses at
the bottom of the file.


                       CIABASE

   CIABASE is a computer data base on the Central Intelligence
Agency that provides a vital, easy-to-use, historical resource for
policy makers, academicians, journalists, activists, and students.

   CIABASE consists of ten plus megabytes of data, divided into 100+
categories containing over 33,000 annotated and sourced entries,
for hard disk IBM compatible and MACINTOSH personal computers.

   CIABASE provides data on the CIA and other individual or
organizational entities, from information gleaned from 850+
sources of various political ideologies -- congressional
reports, newspapers, and magazines, including more than 500
books.

   CIABASE provides rapid access to specific data, scanning in
seconds the entire collection for word, or word-combinations, plus
date requests; e.g."Covert Action" "China" "94-95," or, "Domestic
Operations," "96." Results can be displayed, printed, or sent to
user-named files for editing or transmitting.

Well, some of the more recent information that's coming out of this
makes it more interesting. One of the major coke importer/Contra players
in this is one Danilo Blandon. He apparently got raided back in '86, by
LA County Sheriff's deputies, who hit most of his operating sites.  At
his home, a fair amount of rather interesting literature was found, some
of which seemed to point to ties to the CIA.  During the raid, Blandon
specifically requested that the team call Langley, and speak with a Mr.
Weekly.  I'm not sure if that happened or not, but the next bit makes it
rather interesting. It appears that less than 48 hours after the raid, a
group of individuals who identified themselves as CIA personnel appeared
at the LA Sheriff's impound, and removed _all_ of the seized evidence.
At the same time, most of the files, reports, etc. on that element of
the raid were pulled and disappeared.

My read is that someone was at the least acting under the imprimatur of
CIA authority. Which starts to get into issues of oversight
(organizationally, within the CIA) and abuse of authority.

No, actually the current budget is about $30 billion. See:

It does not include the space systems, which are paid for by NRO, nor does
it include the military service Central Security Service components, which
are at least as large as NSA per se. It does, however, include "computer
systems" etc.

Having accessed now the entire document (all 18 parts), and waded through
the SIGINT and Clandestine Services sections (parts 5 and 9 respectively),
I have found a more elegant description of what I was trying to describe
in my last post.  To whit (from Section 9):

"Fifth, the CS will continue to have tremendous potential to ensure the
success of other intelligence collection disciplines. In particular, the
CS will be called upon to continue its support of SIGINT.  It is no
surprise to those who understand cryptogra phy to learn that most
cryptographic systems in use are exploitable only if the codes are in some
way compromised.  Quite simply, brute computer attacks on codes are
usually unsuccessful.  Arguably, a clandestine service's greatest
contribution to intelligence is the compromising of codes.  The
proliferation of sophisticated cryptographic systems ensures the growing
importance of this role of the CS."

As I read through the rest of the CS section, one thing struck me as
extremely interesting given the budget machinations going on regarding
otehr foreign affairs agencies.  The concept of a "global presence" is
seen as necessary for the CS.  I quite agree.  What is puzzling, however,
is that we are currently questioning the concept of "universial
representation" (as it's know in Foggy Bottom) regarding our _overt_
presence.

*
The list provides the reader/reference searcher the names of Soviet-era
Submarines as they were known to the members of the Soviet Navy. The opening
of the Russian Archives has given the West a rare look into one of the
Soviet Military's most potent force.  However, interpreting what you read is
not so easy.

Often times a technical researcher will be confused by the similarities
between the Western NATO designators and the now unclassified Russian Naval
Literature discussing an entirely different submarine( i.e. Akula).  With
the list both the Russian Naval Expert and the Western Naval Expert will
know what each is referring to.  Perhaps the Russian Navy will soon tell the
West about its Submarine Exploits during the Cold War.

A little known identifier for Russian Submarines is their Project Number
(first column).  Using the Project Number a researcher can identify the
evolution of a particular type of submarine and what shipyard it was built
in.

 Notice the only submarine which used an experimental reactor, ALPHA (NATO
designator) never achieved production status, therefore no Russian Class
Name.  A standard Soviet-era practice.

Subject: Military Intel in Southeast Asia

       Military Intelligence in Southeast Asia.

   There is a remarkably informative posting about
military intelligence operations in Southeast Asia -
in Thailand, Laos, China, and elements of activities
in Cambodia and Vietnam during the period from 1954-1977.
The item is located in the usenet conference
soc.history.war.vietnam   and is authored by Sedwick
Tourison who worked in MI and has authored a number
of items and, I believe, two books.

   Much of the article relies on documents released
under FOIA.

   I do have a few reservations about some of his subjective
comments but the details he offers tell much about past military
intelligence operations -- that are not only informative re
the past but also can be used to estimate current MI ops.

Subject: Troop Deployments

          Last week I heard some disturbing news.  The news is that since 1992
     American forces have been deployed to 58 countries throughout the world.
     Other than the countries we've heard about on the news (i.e., Bosnia,
     Somalia, Haiti, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq) where else have American forces
     gone?

          The person I spoke with stated that every country in South America
     might be able to account for some of the deployments.  I might be able to
     see this if those countries asked for help with drug interdiction, but for
     what else?

          Is anyone able to shed some light on this subject?

     Thanks,

     Bob

I would not want to nitpick, but I guess it would depend somewhat on how
one defines "deployment."  If the presence of a military attache counts,
then 58 is probably erring on the small side.  I can't think of "new"
deployments that could come close to that number myself, but if you think
of NATO alone, you've got 16.

Subject: Re: Military Intelligence in Southeast Asia, 1970-1975 (fwd)

 Military and CIA Intelligence Operations in Southeast Asia

   In response to your question re subjective comments -
many of which I agree with -- others not so. I found that
CIA intelligence (your paragraph page 2 - "During
the Vietnam War" wherein you discuss "open source" information)
was a determined resistance against overt information that did
not support continued U.S. involvement in the war.

   Sam Adams a CIA analyst, in describing the failure
of CIA intelligence in Vietnam said, inter alia, that
the CIA until the very end refused to use captured
enemy documents as basis for its analyses.

   The various communist organizations published COSVN
directives, announced their liberation association strengths,
wrote books and publications and facilitated books by
such authorities as Burchett.  Most all of this information was
rejected as so much Communist propaganda -- when in fact much
of it was true. There was no lack of "open source" information
only a lack of ability to appreciate it, or an honesty
in accepting it.

   One problem was the inabilty to recruit penetrations of Communist
structures --  conversely the Thieu government was completely penetrated.
Sam Adams compiled a study that said the Communists had an estimated
30,000 agents in Thieu's government -- this was not a government
it was Swiss cheese. Sam's study never saw the light of day.

   So much of the CIA's reporting focused on this or that event
in the Diem or Thieu Regimes that this very emphasis overwhelmed
and hid what was truly happening. I found that CIA's intelligence
was to a large degree a denial of reality to justify policy -- and
to date nothing has changed.

   Can you imagine the fate of a CIA case officer who might have
tried to report information indicating that our policies re overthrowing
Saddam might backfire?

   CIA is a policy-implementing Agency and much of the same
obviously applies re military intelligence.

   These brief comments cover my main reservations re your
evaluations. A more thorough exmination would require a lengthy
review and an extended dissertation. To shortcut the process you might
want to meet for a detailed discussion.

   I should note again that I found your explanation of military
intelligence operations to be immensely revealing and useful.
It was a surprise to note that many military intelligence
operations duplicated precisely, CIA operations.

Ralph McGehee
CIABASE


   Below is a re-post containing details relevant to this
discussion.

   In response to David Mark's thoughtful presentation re
"The Failure of Intelligence," wherein he uses the Vietnam
War as a prime example to defend the CIA, I must comment.
First as background to my qualifications (Career Intelligence Medal
and other medals and awards), I give a brief precis of my 25-year
career with the CIA. Next I provide a few extracts about Vietnam
and the CIA's intelligence.

   From 1967 on I protested within the CIA about its flawed reporting
on Viet Cong strengths.  My first protests were aimed at defending
U.S. policy on the war. I was so committed to this cause that I asked
to be transferred to Vietnam when other CIA officers were being drafted
and forced to go.

   I soon discovered that the Agency could not or would not recognize
the nature of this "People's War, People's Army," and all of its
intelligence had little to with reality.

   I protested this terribly flawed reporting for the rest of my tour
in Vietnam, and later at CIA Headquarters. In a Headquarters assignment
that allowed me to see highly classified reporting from around the world
I soon perceived that supporting policy with its intelligence was a
common if not universal practice in the Agency's intelligence and
operations.  In that position I also reviewed all available reporting
on Vietnam.  I continued my protests writing numerous memos to the Chief
of the East Asia Division -- Theodore Shackley.  I also composed a
study on Asian revolutions.

   My experience taught me the CIA is a policy-implementing
Agency that uses its intelligence reporting responsibilities to
sell and defend its operations. Its personnel are recruited
for attributes that will not clash with this goal.

   I opted for early retirement and spent the next five years writing
a book about what happened. Researching for that book, I poured over
all three editions of "The Pentagon Papers," and the numerous intelligence
and policy reports in those eighteen volumes.

   After the book was published, I set out to record all important
information on the CIA and developed a computerized data base -- with
a large portion of it devoted to CIA operations and intelligence on
Southeast Asia.

   Below are brief accounts of the nature of the NLF in Vietnam.

Ralph McGehee
CIABASE

                  National Liberation Front

  Former President Dwight Eisenhower in his book, "Mandate for Change,"
  said "I have never talked or corresponded with a person knowledgeable
  in Indochinese affairs who did not agree that had elections been held
  at the time of the fighting, possibly 80 per cent of the population would
  have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh as their leader..."

  60-75  Front was creation in early 60 of association of
  Ex-resistance members, formed by those who had survived the Diemist
  Exterminations. Later developed into people's revolutionary party. About in
  60 a number of other organizations created - peasants associations,
  Workers, associations, and others representing youth, women, students,
  Writers, etc. Vgw 186. Front's order of battle three types: self-defense
  Guerrillas - local village units usually peasants by day and guerrillas at
  Night; regional troops on a more permanent basis - job to deal with enemy
  Forces in their region; regular army to deal with enemy's mobile reserves
  And to carry out military ops. 184,6,8. One area's land reform program. 192
  At beginning of 64 front claimed control of two thirds of territory and
  Over half population. It is gvt in everything but name with committees of
  Military affairs, external affairs, public health, culture, info and
  Education, etc. 223. Women's Liberation Association one of mass orgs
  Affiliated with NLF...within which virtually everyone from children to old
  people in liberated areas could make a contribution to struggle. Burchett,
  W. (1965). Vietnam: Inside Story of the Guerrilla War 265

  56-62 Viet Cong organization of population proceeded hamlet by hamlet,
  incorporating ever-larger numbers into associations of peasants [farmers],
  women, youth. Such village organizations meant reduced rent, distribution of
  free land, freedom from both corvee labor and conscription into army,
  protection from extortion and brutality of appointed village chiefs,
  security police or army. Robert Samsom of U.S. Mission found "the Viet Cong
  land reform program possessed the universality and mass appeal that the
  Diem reform lacked." Guerrillas saw themselves "as the legitimate rulers of
  an independent Vietnam." On 12/20/60, at a secret base near Saigon, National
  Front for Liberation of South Vietnam was announced. NLF best described as
  a coalition led by party members but held together by a common program.
  Front committees were established in thousands of villages. In 2/61, PLAF
  formally organized. Southern and central branches of Lao Dong Party
  merged into central committee directorate for the south which U.S. Called
  COSVN. 75% of villagers supported front, 20% trying to remain neutral, and
  5% firmly pro-gvt. By 10/61, front so successful that gvt troops could not
  drive more than a few kilometers outside of any given provincial capital
  without running into sniper fire. M. Young.  The Vietnam Wars
  1945-1990 pages 67-73.

  Vietnam,  54-75  The U.S. Viewed the NLF order of battle in terms of
  certain number of soldiers and weapons not a mass revolutionary movement -
  and consistently underestimated number of troops and money needed to defeat
  the enemy. American specialists like Lansdale, Trager and Pike never
  [understood] that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese peasants would
  fight and die willingly, for a cause beyond themselves. Senator
  Gravel edition, (1971). Pentagon papers Volume V 205-6

  Vietnam,  45-75 The U.S.'s leading wartime writer/scholar on the
  Vietcong, Douglas Pike, said that the liberation associations of
  the Vietcong were villagers molded into tight-knit, self-controlled,
  self-contained associations. Mao tse-tung of China and Vo Nguyen Giap
  called Liberation Associations the initial phase and the sine qua non
  of their revolutions.  In 63, the Vietcong announced that seven
  million south Vietnamese (generally rural civilians) had joined
  these associations. Pike's article avoids numbers but those
  massive figures were the intel community's most sacrosanct secret
  or most egregious failure. If CIA had known and/or reported the
  7,000,000 person-strong association structure --   it would have
  invalidated all U.S. justifications for the war; liberation association
  members and their dedication, caused our defeat in  Vietnam.
  Victory was never a possibility.  Ciabase 1/95

  Vietnam,  67  The order-of-battle fight of Sam Adams and the CIA's
  sacrificing its integrity on the altar of public relations and political
  expediency. Macv excluded village self-defense forces from Vietcong
  yet SDF were hardened guerrillas who responsible for 40% U.S. Casualties.
  Pike Committee investigation concluded juggling figures "created false
  perceptions of enemy of U.S. Forces...pressure from policymaking officials
  [caused] erroneous assessments..." Valentine, d. (1990). The phoenix
  Program 273-4

  Vietnam,  68   Chief cause of intel failure re vn was degraded image of
  enemy. Second, pressure from policy-makers reinforced erroneous assessments
  of allied progress and enemy capabilities. Mission restriction curtailed
  necessary collection activity by intel officers and forced reliance on
  officers with military responsibility. House of Representatives
  Pike Committee report.

  Vietnam,  54  U.S. Subversion of Geneva agreements began immediately.
  Colonel Lansdale was already in Vietnam. His original mission,
  to by-pass French and to work with Vietnamese in unconventional war.

Weapons of Tomorrow, by Brian Beckett: "The bi-conical

by values of five to seven and reducing critical mass to between 54 and 100
gm. The fission cores of such bombs would have
diameters of only 2.68 to 3.38 cm (1.05 to 1.33in) but still be
capable of one or two kiloton yields. Very efficient weapons using
fusion enhancing reflectors might enable reliable yields of up to
four or five kilotons (Major reference: S. Kaliski, Journal of
Technical Physics, Warsaw, Vol. 19, 4, 1968)."

                  Fission-Free Neutron Bomb (revised: 1 May 1995)
Detailed design drawing located at: http://193.210.10.42/hew/FFBOMB.GIF

Weapons of Tomorrow, by Brian Beckett: " In a fission-free
Neutron bomb an efficient driver would generate enough fusion
energy to cause the explosive shock wave to compress the core to hyper-
densities of 10,000 times the norm. The liner, a heavy metal of variable
density would profile the shock wave for maximum compression. Because of
size considerations, yields would probably be limited to a kiloton or less
and, in such things as artillery shells, the device would be a cylinder
rather than a sphere. This would be less efficient but, with high
compression, the weapon would still be highly effective. The details
illustrate the idea for an enhanced radiation neutron device. The core might
release around 900 tons of TNT equivalent with up to another 100
tons coming from the surrounding shell. An example of a suitable
liner might be a copper-beryllium alloy and the driver would be
made of a dense metal such as iridium. "

Comments by Carey Sublette:
This is a speculative design for producing fusion reactions without using
fissile material to provide the ignition heat. The idea is to use the energy
concentrating effects of an implosion to create fusion conditions by
compressing and heating fusion fuel at the center. This design combines the
several techniques, explosive driven flying plates, shock profiling from
collisions with shock buffers, and the convergence effect of thick
collapsing shells, and spherical implosion waves

In principal, a highly symmetric implosion system could produce fusion
conditions in a very small central
region. Sonoluminescence - the observation that small bubbles oscillating in
a sound field can be made to glow brightly in the laboratory, apparently
through heating to incandescence - is an example of how temperatures far in
excess of ambient conditions can be created by spherical wave convergence.

It does not appear, however, that significant releases of fusion energy have
ever actually been produced by such systems, much less been developed into
usable weapons. Given the very low energy density in conventional high
explosives compared to fissile material, such a system (even if feasible) is
certain to be
far larger and  heavier than fission driven neutron bombs. Since the
principal cost factor in a neutron bomb is the very expensive tritium used
as a fusion fuel, it is doubtful any cost advantage would exist either.


Personal Comment (based on work with this problem): True no cost advantage
does exist, however a huge political advantage does exist.  You can achieve
nuclear effects without the use of a nuclear detonation.  Field use is much
more likely. The Russians are the leaders in the development of operational
devices in the SBER Class.

Birdsey raises a central question:  What is the generator of this "news"
counting as deployments?  Clearly, full-scale deployments of the type that
most of us associate with that term do not equal the number cited.  I
wonder whether port visits by naval vessels are being counted?

Numbers by themselves are rarely meaningful; you need to know what they
consist of and with what they are being compared, which brings us to a
second central question:

Why is the number cited "disturbing?"  Is it too low?  Too high?  What, in
fact, is too low or too high in this regard?  And more important, is the
number any different than for comparable periods prior to 1992?

Also, the suggestion of widespread deployments in South America is
confusing.  Current U.S. troop deployments (using a conventional definition
of a bunch of armed U.S. military types with accompanying equipment and
associated support capabilities) to South American countries are limited to
the bases in Panama and some drug interdiction support operations.

Two points:

1.  Captured enemy documents are not usually treated as open-source or
overt information.  Sam's point may have been valid, but that does not
implicate the CIA's use or nonuse of overt information.

2.  I take exception to the defining of Wilfred Burchett as an "authority."
He was a communist-supporting polemicist period.  There may a need for
such individuals in this world, but their writings do not form the basis
for objective judgments about anything.  There is nothing in Burchett's
background or writings (whether they were correct or incorrect or a mixture
of both) that would suggest we should have been taking him seriously.  I
still do not take him seriously because his pursuit of a specific and
well-focused anti-American agenda was clear.

In addition, I believe we may have some in Thailand and Burma(although I

Well, being old enough to remember watching the war on TV, yet fortunately
young enough not to have served, I've always been impressed by Stanley
Karnow's book.  In fact, the PBS series of the same name seemed to do
justice to the political and military machinations of the Vietnam War.

In addition, about ten years ago, a book was published by a former member of
the VC provisional government that was quite critical of the revolution
being "stolen" by the North (one thing, and perhaps Mr. Mc Ghee or others
may have some knowledge of this, is that there were some very real regional
differences that U.S. intelligence either ignored or failed to exploit ).

I was also impressed by "Neil Sheehan's "Bright Shining Lie," the biography
of John Paul Vann.  The book was an extremely readable tale that, I think,
fleshed out a number of points in Karnow's dryer history.  In sum, perhaps
one book might not suffice, but for my money, these three provided a fairly
comprehensive background.

One thing regarding the military intel thread and Vietnam:  Messrs. Clark
and McGhee are clearly divided on Wilfred Burchett.  If I might add just one
observation: polemicists do sometimes have useful insights and offer
intriguing analyses, but I buckle at the suggestion that those who have
valid criticisms of his work are either
". . . loyal to their CIA backgrounds and/or fooled by the CIA's and
official propaganda and archival intelligence."  Very little in this world
is "beyond debate," and I look forward to seeing additional arguments from
both of these posters.

Military Intelligence in Southeast
       Military Intelligence in Southeast Asia, 1970-1975.

                                   by Sedgwick Tourison

(C) Sedgwick Tourison, 1996, Crofton, MD.  This document may not
be reproduced in whole or in part with the author's written
permission.

     Many Americans have said that military intelligence is an
oxymoron.  In 1966 I asked a Vietnamese Communist defector, a
magazine publisher, for his comments on how the rank and file
Viet Cong viewed military intelligence.  The cadre laughed.

     "None of us ever see the military intelligence people doing
anything.  They just seem to sit along the road and count
trucks."

     The cadre was right and he was wrong.  The Vietnamese
Communist intelligence service, both military and civilian, was,
and still is, quite adept at disguising who is who, who is doing
what, what they are doing, when are they doing it and what is the
end objective of what they are doing.  That is a trademark of a
professional intelligence service.

     In the case of the Viet Cong truck counter, he just sat out
in the open and counted trucks.  Another way to do the same would
be to ask your friend to count the trucks for you and report that
information to you.  If you have enough friends and they covered
a wide enough area, your little network of friends could report
to you about all the trucks in a given area.  The sum of their
information could give a fairly reliable index of just what was
happening to the unit to which all the trucks belonged, just for
beginners.

     Another way to get the same information is to piggyback
yourself onto a group that is already collecting the information
you want.  The Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense
Department have done that for years through relationships
established with friendly foreign intelligence services.  One
problem with such arrangements is that you often lack the ability
to ensure a uniform quality in the information you receive.
Another problem is you must take into account the reality that
the foreign government providing you the information often has
its own foreign policy agendas and world visions quite the
opposite from your own and their information may be slanted to
suit their needs, not yours.  This was certainly true during the
Vietnam War.

     Duplication.  That is another word often associated with
intelligence.  Duplication.  Report after report that seems to
say the same thing and this gets to a problem faced by those who
need information; when is enough, enough?

     Satellite imagery seems to provide a lot of answers, but not
all; satellites can not see through walls.   Intercepting and
decrypting a foreign nation's electronic signals also tells you a
lot.  Intercepted signals not only give you the information being
transmitted but you can learn a lot about the level of technology
being used to send, and encrypt, that information.  All too often
the information you may intercept and decrypt tells you about
things that already happened, not things that will happen in the
future.  Spies can be helpful in that regard because it is people
who create the plans of tomorrow.  But, if your job is to recruit
spies, it does not take a rocket scientist to realize that it is
next to impossible to predict who will be the person that will be
in a position to answer the great unknowns in the future.

     When all is said and done, the information from spies, from
satellites, from intercepted information, and yes, even from
truck counters, may seem to be too much of the same thing,
particularly when everyone reports essentially the same
information.  In fact, when one takes a look at much of the
information collected through the more sophisticated means, much
of it may duplicate what is called "open source" information,
meaning information readily available to the average person on
the street through from books, television, Internet, foreign
newspapers, foreign magazines, professional journals, all
relatively free for the asking.  Plus, they are a lot less
hazardous and a lot less costly than the sophisticated hi-tech
equipment that seems to cost more than the national debt.

     But, how reliable is the information floating around for the
asking and is it true or is it false?  Answering that question
usually leads to inevitable duplication as different groups of
information collectors are brought to bear on a problem that
feeds information to a process known as intelligence analysis.

     During the Vietnam War, for example, there was relatively
little "open source" information exiting North Vietnam and the
Communist controlled areas inside Laos and Cambodia.  And, what
information did exit those areas, had been carefully examined
prior to publication to ensure it contained little of substantive
value to a foreign intelligence service.

     Thirty years ago the problems the military intelligence
community faced in Southeast Asia were formidable.  We did not
have satellites, pilotless drones were still in the future, our
communications intelligence was often limited by the terrain in
Vietnam and the low power of the enemy's transmitters, computers
were still in their infancy and highly sensitive programs such as
the SR-71 Blackbird high altitude reconnaissance aircraft were so
compartmented that few people had access to their information.
Except the Russians, of course, who in 1961 shot down Francis
Gary Powers AND got him, AND his U-2, and its cameras, and film.
Then, that told them a lot about us at a time we were trying to
find out more about them.

     By 1966, based on my own personal experience and the
experience of many military intelligence colleagues, a lot of
information was reaching intelligence analysts concerned with
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  In fact, so much information was
coming to the analysts that the challenge was to separate the
wheat from the chaff, to be able to wade through mountains of
information for those nuggets that would help solve the analyst's
puzzle.  Computers have helped us a lot with that problem.

     As many of us said at the time, there was no lack of
intelligence during the Vietnam War; there was an intelligence
information glut, too much information and too few people who
knew what it meant and how to use it.  Of course, by the time an
analyst learned what was happening, his or her one year tour was
up and the analytical puzzle was temporarily sidetracked as a new
analyst with no overlap with the departing analyst had to learn
from scratch.

     I mentioned earlier about duplication.  To some, duplication
might seem unnecessary.  But, when you are challenged to solve a
particular intelligence puzzle, you employ all the resources at
your disposal.  There is no one source of information that is so
reliable and so predictable that it can be counted on to solve
every puzzle, every time.  Add to that such problems as
disinformation and deception and it becomes obvious that some
duplication is necessary.  Where some in the intelligence
community has had problems is in defining how much duplication is
acceptable and when is enough, enough.

     And so it was during the Vietnam War that military
intelligence units received identical questions to answer. One of
the units was a small detachment in Bangkok, Thailand, known as
Detachment K of the U.S. Army's 500th Military Intelligence
Group.  Many of the archival operational files of Detachment K
were recently opened in response to Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) requests and most of its operations can now be talked
about, although some details in its files will not be open before
the year 2001.

     Detachment K's operations can be traced to its birth in
Thailand shortly following the signing of the 1954 Geneva
Accords. From that point until the later 1960s, Detachment K
provided the Thai Army with a limited amount of intelligence
training, although its primary effort at the outset was in the
field of counterintelligence, looking for potential threats to,
or among, our own forces based in Thailand.

     Any scholar familiar with the history of Southeast Asia is
well aware that Thailand was an accessible and relatively safe
haven for many of the Vietnamese Communist revolutionaries who so
bedeviled the French in Indochina prior to 1954.  Records
released by the French intelligence service for the period of the
1930s reveal that the French were able to learn, and report,
information about high level activities of the Indochinese
Communist Party in Thailand within days of the events taking
place, a certain indication that the French had reliable agents
inside the Communist party.

      The Vietnamese community in Thailand grew and many within
its ranks were willing to support the aims of objectives of the
Vietnamese Communist party.  This gave the Thai and American
governments reasonable security concerns as the American military
presence grew inside Thailand in the 1960s, often at Thai air
bases adjacent to large communities of Vietnamese.  The Thai also
faced an expanding internal security problem from Thai trained in
the People's Republic of China, their movement across Laos
supported by a joint Pathet Lao/North Vietnamese Army special
command.  The aims of these Thai dissidents was to overthrow the
government of the Kingdom of Thailand, or at least to make it
appear that way.

   The 500th Military Intelligence Group, based in Hawaii, was
the U.S. Army's information collection force that covered the
Pacific through field detachments in Thailand, Vietnam, the
Philippines, Taiwan and Japan.  These detachments worked with
local friendly military forces, providing limited training to
them while using the local host's natural presence and knowledge
of the area to launch what are termed bilateral operations, one
spinoff of the type of arrangements with friendly foreign
military services that I mentioned early.  The 500th Group
operated in Vietnam until October 1965 when the 525th Military
Intelligence Group arrived to relieve the 500th Group of the
increasingly heavy demand for information to support arriving
American forces.

     The drawing up in Saigon in 1966 of contingency plans for a
American withdrawal from Vietnam meant the need to begin to
prepare to monitor the pace of Communist activities through
Southeast Asia. Within Vietnam, the 525th MI Group responded with
instructions to prepare for agent stay-behind operations, should
a withdrawal take place.  Within Thailand, however, the 500th
Group's Detachment K was under little pressure to expand.

     The elections of October 1968 and the moves toward
Vietnamization by the Nixon administration brought concurrent
moves to begin a process of moving toward normalization of
relations with China.  This occurred as Chinese military forces
were building a road across northern Laos toward Thailand and
Chinese antiaircraft and military engineer forces were deployed
across the width of extreme northern Vietnam, largely north of
the 19th parallel, and with some miliary advisors in South
Vietnam.  With Chinese training to Thai Communist dissidents
creating domestic insurgency problems within Thailand, Detachment
K's presence in Thailand was seen by the U.S. Army's Pacific
Command as a readily available resource that could be used to
assess the threats to the expanding U.S. military presence in
Thailand.  To compound questions about China's role and future
plans and intentions, the Cultural Revolution of the mid-1960s
brought anarchy to many parts of China.

     By the end of the 1960s, intelligence questions being sent
to Detachment K had transformed the detachment into the second
largest of the group detachments, second only to Detachment N in
Japan.  As the decade ended, Detachment K embarked on an expanded
effort to create a new series of bilateral intelligence
operations with the Thai as a means of answering the many
intelligence requirements from within Thailand, the Pacific
Command and Washington.

     For example, as one means of answering some of the unknowns
about the People's Republic of China, Detachment K established
early-on a joint operation in 1963 with the Thai to conduct
espionage into China.  The purpose of this effort was to identify
Chinese units and activities that could, or were, threatening
American interests in Thailand and Laos.  Those who went into
China were Chinese often native to the area where they were to
operate.  To evaluate the reliability of those who agreed to
return to China, analysts could compare the information these
from agents and verified by closeup photographs of military
targets taken by the agents using small handheld cameras, against
aerial photography of ground targets collected by American
overflights of China.  The detachment also worked for years
attempting to identify Chinese who could legally travel to China
and might prove to be lucrative agents.  None were identified and
this detachment operation was finally cancelled.

     The Cultural Revolution led many Chinese to flee the
upheaval of the mid-1960s.  Many walked overland across Burma and
Laos to reach a safe haven inside Thailand.  When the Chinese
crossed into Thailand, alert members of the Thai Border Patrol
Police often met them and escorted them to debriefing centers
supported by the CIA.  The U.S. Army's need for information the
CIA was not reporting soon led to an agreement to permit
Detachment K to establish Project 5310-02-E in order to collect
the accessible military information about southern China.  By
1971, some refugees were recruited as agents and agreed to return
to China, the objective being to collect information and attempt
to recruit agents who would operate inside China.  All too often,
the agents who were recruited and returned to China to collect
information and recruit agents brought back only information but
no new agents.  By 1974 this project was terminated due to a lack
of prospective sources.

     In the summer of 1970, the Army Attache in Vientiane, Laos,
Col. Ed Duskin, asked the U.S. Army's Assistant Chief of Staff
for Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Joseph A. McChristian, to dispatch a
team of human intelligence experts to Laos.  Concurrent with the
team's dispatch that summer, the American Embassy in Bangkok
asked that this team evaluate certain human intelligence
activities conducted jointly with the Thai Communist Suppression
Operations Command.  I was a member of the survey team in
question and my portion of the survey looked at interrogation
operations and captured document exploitation in both countries.
As a result of the three month survey, the CIA agreed that
Detachment K could expand its efforts on a limited basis, both
within Thailand and Laos, but under the very close monitoring of
the CIA.

     In March 1971, I arrived in Laos as the first Army
interrogation officer and was assigned on paper as an Assistant
Army Attache.  My actual duties were to work with the Royal Lao
Army Headquarters G-2 interrogation center at Vientiane and the
G-2 staff of Military Region 5 which had territorial
responsibility for the area surrounding Vientiane.  That summer,
Major Henry DuRant arrived as the team chief for what was then
termed the Laos Exploitation Team, Project 5310-03.

     From the CIA's perspective, Laos was their turf.  The CIA
did not want U.S. military intelligence mucking around in their
domain. Laos was, and still is, an underpopulated country.  One
way the CIA controlled things in 1970 was to make sure the agency
identified everyone in Laos who might be of value and then
politely informed military intelligence that they, the CIA, had
already developed an interest in the individual.  This turf
battle kept nearly all U.S. military intelligence out of Laos
until the Laos Exploitation Team arrived.  In the mid-1960s, for
example, the covert operations group based in Saigon and known as
MACSOG attempted to establish its own effort out of Laos.  Its
officer arrived in Vientiane and was promptly put on the next
plane heading out of country.

     The function of the Laos Exploitation Team was to work
through the Royal Lao Army to get every scrap of information
available from prisoners, defectors, captured documents, and
captured equipment.  The CIA was trying to do the same, but
lacked the trained resources to do the job as effectively as the
U.S. military.  Of course, if the CIA needed someone, they would
recruit the individual from the U.S.military by making him an
offer he could not refuse.

     In the case of the Laos Exploitation Team, the CIA Station
in Vientiane closely monitored our operations until satisfied
that our efforts in Laos were truly supportive of the agency's
mission in Laos and not designed to open a back door for military
espionage.

     By 1972 the Laos Exploitation Team had grown to five
Americans and five local employees.  The American component
included an American team chief; a senior interrogation officer,
me; two case officers, one Army and one Army Force; and an
administrative sergeant assigned from the Thailand based group
augmenting the Attache offices, Project 404.

     Our local employees were interrogators, or debriefers, if
you prefer, who questioned the prisoners and defectors arriving
at Vientiane.  Two of the interrogators were former members of
the North Vietnamese Army.  The remaining three civilians had the
ability to interview people in Lao, Vietnamese, Black Tai and
Hmong.

     To explain this teams's activities within the context of the
war in South Vietnam, beginning in October 1965, South Vietnam
saw the beginning of a stream of North Vietnamese Army prisoners
and defectors as the People's Army of Vietnam began to flood the
southern battlefield.  Tens of thousands of prisoners and
defectors eventually came into American, Korean, Thai, and South
Vietnamese hands during the conflict.  In Laos, however, there
was only slightly over 150 North Vietnamese prisoners or
defectors reaching Vientiane between 1966 and 1974.

     Each prisoner or defector was literally milked for every
scrap of information the intelligence community wanted, or
needed.  In 1974 the North Vietnamese prisoners were repatriated.
The defectors, for the most part, were released to live out the
war in Laos going from job to job until the Lao Communist
takeover in 1975.  Then, they disappeared.  As to the team's
local employees, all exited Laos safely, three now in the United
States and two in France.

     The Laos Exploitation Team was not simply involved in
collecting information, it also acted on the information it
collected when the information was of tactical value to those
engaged in combat, whether it be the Royal Lao Army or the CIA
paramilitary officers.

     For example, in the summer of 1971 a Pathet Lao defector
arrived at Vientiane.  The defector was the chief of
quartermaster supplies for the Pathet Lao Xieng Khouang Region
Headquarters, the headquarters controlling the limited Pathet Lao
forces opposing General Vang Pao's forces in Military Region 2,
that area of Laos containing the Plain of Jars.  I say limited
because the major force opposite Vang Pao was North Vietnamese,
not Pathet Lao.  The young officer had been caught in several
indiscrete sexual affairs with female cadre and he knew that his
last dalliance would send him to a military security prison.  He
opted to go to Vientiane instead.

     The young cadre, while at the Pathet Lao's Region 2
Headquarters, had been responsible for supervising all
quartermaster supplies reaching Pathet Lao forces in his region.
He had traveled the supply lines from the point where supplies
arrived at the port of Hai Phong in North Vietnam to the rear
area supply depots along Highway 7 inside Nghe An Province to the
east of Xieng Khouang Province, Laos.  From there he was
personally responsible for ensuring that supplies were
prepositioned at certain depots set along Highway 7, mimicking
and paralleling the North Vietnamese Army's own supply system to
a degree.  He was observant, detail oriented, and quite
cooperative, having nothing else to return to.

     Beginning soon after his arrival in Vientiane, information
from the defector was ferried daily to an Army captain photo-
interpreter working alone in a trailer adjacent to the 7/13th Air
Force targeting office in Udorn, Thailand.  Air Force tactical
and strategic bombers were sent against each of the supply
depots. The quartermaster officer also knew the location of other
targets of interest involved in the movement of his supplies,
including fuel depots, truck parks and major heavy weapon sites
such as the PT-76, howitzer and 37mm antiaircraft units.  After
all, he had to provide clothing and other supplies to these
units.

     The first strikes against the Pathet Lao supply system in
Region 2 began in July 1971 and continued until about September
1971, by which point there were no more targets.  We were acutely
aware that supplies can be replaced.  But, an army which lacks
the supplies to sustain a fight can not sustain combat.  As
history has demonstrated, starting in the fall of 1971 it was
almost entirely a North Vietnamese Army show in Region 2.

     By 1972, as we expected, the Pathet Lao had rebuilt their
supply lines and restocked their depots.  But, we were able to
lessen their combat potential for from three to six months.

     The bilateral operation in Laos became the model for other
operations Detachment K was developing from Thailand.  For
example, Project 5310-04 was established as a result of the 1970
survey and was both to gather information on Thai insurgents and
upgrade the Royal Thai Army's own intelligence collection
capabilities.

     Another effort, Project 5310-05, worked with the Thai Army
command conducting low-level intelligence operations into
Cambodia from its base of operations at Arunyapathet, aimed at
trying to gain as much information as possible about Khmer Rouge
and Vietnamese Communist operations inside Cambodia, particularly
in the northwest part of the country.

     Another operation, barely off the ground by 1974, worked
through the Thai and their friendly counterparts in the Lao Army
in Savannakhet Province, Laos.  That operation ceased in the
summer of 1975 when the rightist portion of the Royal Lao Army
went into reeducation.

     The initial expansion of Detachment K was a stepping stone
to a further expansion in February 1972 when the Pacific Command
issued Plan 2/72 to prepare for a continuing military
intelligence presence in Vietnam after the withdrawal of American
ground forces to be mandated by the Geneva Accords.  The 500th
Group dispatched a survey team to Vietnam to identify the 525th
Group's operations that could be continued after the Accords.  In
February 1973, civilian clothed members of Detachment K arrived
to conclude the necessary agreements with the Armed Forces of the
Republic of Vietnam to implement Plan 2/72 through a program
codenamed FASTPASS.

     As the fates would have it, I accompanied the Detachment
commander, Col. Albert Weidhas, and his chief of bilateral
operations, Henry DuRant, serving as the interpreter for the
agreements that permitted continuity operations with the South
Vietnamese Navy's N-2, Captain Hai, and Unit 101, the South
Vietnamese Army's clandestine intelligence collection unit.
Within days of that agreement, Detachment K civilians and
military in civilian clothes arrived at the Defense Attache
Office where they became part of Col. William LeGro's DAO
Intelligence Division.  Returning from Saigon, we reached similar
agreements in principal in Phnom Penh with the Khmer Army G-2.

     Military resources through the Pacific Command were being
reduced in 1972 as the Army's Pacific Command prepared to expand
the 500th Group's operations as a replacement for the withdrawing
525th Group.  The authority for the continuation was a perceived
need for information about hostile forces that even the Joint
Chiefs of Staff had expected in 1972 would soon takeover all of
South Vietnam following the ceasefire in Vietnam.  Thus, the
function of the 500th MI Group under the project nicknamed
FASTPASS was to collect and report information required to assess
the situation throughout Indochina following the American
withdrawal.

     The preparation for the post-cease fire period occurred as
the Army Pacific G-2 mandated an tight evaluation of all
detachment intelligence operations, the result being that 10
percent of all operations were eliminated due to no, or marginal,
productivity.  Increasing pressure to continue the reduction in
marginal intelligence activities led by 1974 to the end of 500th
Group detachment operations in the Philippines which included
eliminating a marginal operation through Cambodia targeted
against North Vietnam, marginal operations such as Project 0611
from Japan into North Vietnam, and deactivation of the group's
detachment on Taiwan which included activities at the Taiwan
interrogation center.    Another project patterned on the Laos
Exploitation Team was envisioned for Cambodia, Project 5310-06,
an effort that it was hoped could operate jointly with the
Cambodian Army at its rudimentary interrogation center in Phnom
Penh.  The CIA offered to employ Detachment K's personnel but
refused to approve the Army's presence in Cambodia.

     This reduction in the Pacific theater was paralleled by
similar reductions in Europe.  For example, these reductions
brought to an end to the military intelligence involvement at the
Cuban interrogation center in Span and the Army's involvement in
the interrogation center in Greece.

     Between February 1973 and April 30, 1975, Detachment K was
the U.S. Army's primary human intelligence collector throughout
Southeast Asia.  With the surrender of the Republic of Vietnam
and increasing pressures in Laos, much of Detachment K's
operations were overtaken by events that effectively ended its
bilateral operations with friendly governments that ceased to
exist.  And, with the end of the Kingdom of Laos, as well as the
republics of Vietnam and Cambodia, there was no longer a need for
the operations envisioned for Detachment K.

     And so, in 1977, Detachment K folded its flag, shipped its
records to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, and the detachment was
disestablished.  Many of its records never reached any archives,
they were destroyed in a belief that the records were no longer
of value or interest.

     After the end of each conflict, regardless of its size,
there exists a need for some mechanism to capture the oral
histories of those who performed where "the rubber meets the
road," so to speak.

     None of this happened at the end of the Vietnam War.  The
post-1975 period, at least for intelligence, was one of
discarding many of the wartime archives from Southeast Asia that
spelled out what worked, what did not work, and why, placing the
surviving operational files in corners, somewhere, that with the
passage of time have become forgotten.  As we move forward on a
new relationship with Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, some of these
files may yet prove to be of value so that we do not, once again,
repeat the mistakes of the past.

  Thank you.

Re David Birdsey's post:
Re question for Professor Clark:

   Karnow's book and the TV series -- I found both did
not understand or discuss the Viet Cong mass-based
organizations. Because of this I can credit little that
he writes. When the series was under production one
of the people associated with it contacted me and I
presented my views -- which did not make the series.

   The VC author you mention is probably Troung Nhu Tang.
His book is Vietcong Memoir.  I am always suspicious of
memoirs written by ex-communists since writing and publishing
such books is a cottage CIA industry (1000-to 1200 CIA-unattributed
books in a period of years).  Also one of his co-authors is Doan Van Toai
who is reported to have a history of U.S intelligence links:
1) Doan Van Toai, author of "the Vietnamese gulag" is
presently doing research at the Fletcher school of law and diplomacy at
tufts university. Toai was a u.s. agent during Vietnam war.
counterspy spring, 82 25-26.

   The CIA's book publishing responsibility later was assumed by the National
Endowment for Democracy -- Ned is funding the institute for democracy to
publish writings of dissidents.  "the Vietnamese gulag," by author Doan van
Toai.  national endowment for democracy annual  report 87 30.
This does not make Tang's story untrue but it does raise many questions.

   I have no argument with Sheehan's book, but it has been some
time since I read it. I believe it also does not discuss the
mass-based nature of the Viet Cong.

   Wilfred Burchett's "Vietnam: Inside Story of the Guerrilla War,"
to me is the most detailed least polemic and "insider" look at the
VC forces. It is undoubtedly friendly in its observations re the VC
but achieves an accuracy never even slightly approached by CIA
intelligence. Indeed an early CIA directive stated that there
was no need to count the village supporters as part of the
VC order of battle as they were forced by the VC to cooperate.
This ended all chances for accuracy in CIA reporting.

   The details of the nature of the mass VC organizations and the
authorities and scholars that wrote about them have been listed
by me many times before.

  My comment "Loyal to their," was my euphemism for a near total
mis-appreciation or complete lack of knowledge for this phenomenon
that exists among the American people and especially among CIA veterans
even those who served in or had duties related to Vietnam.

   Even Mr. Birdsey's post does not address this issue although
I have posted many items covering the VC liberation associations.
I believe we Americans have so many mis-conceptions about the war
that no amount of information will ever change those perceptions
except by those tiny few who study the matter.

   On one posting to the alt.war.vietnam conference I was
excoriated for my posting.  One veteran of the war, came to
my defense and said "Don't get mad at McGehee he is just
trying to tell the truth. We all know what he says is true."
This is not an exact quote but the correct substance.

   I still request Professor Clark's comments re the
assignment of David Cohen as Director of Operations
given Cohen's reputation of bending intelligence to support
policy.

An open question for all. I am interested in any information available on

I did not address it because 1) it was not really what my post was about; I
was offering my thoughts on some books I thought useful on Vietnam, and 2) I
don't dispute your characterization of the VC as mass-based.  To be honest,
I don't think Karnow did either.  It may be he did not emphasize it enough
to your liking, but I certainly got the same message.   I don't think it is
revisionist or "anti-American" to admit that we did not appreciate the
nationalist nature of VC resistence.

In sum, I'd disagree with a lot of what Mr. McGhee writes, but the response
to my earlier post seems to reflect a disagreement where none exists. And my
only point about commenting on the nature of people being "loyal to . . ."
was that it really is simply the flip side of the same coin: one can call
one author a "pro-Soviet propagandist," or one can call another a "CIA dupe"
(no one has resorted to this kind of name-calling; I'm merely trying to be
illustrative).  The point is, labels aside, one can learn from different
sources, regardless of their ideological bent.  One should simply be aware,
however, that when it comes to analysis of the facts, that personal
prejudices or ideological taint should not be ignored when forming an
opinion.  I think that goes for both ends of the political spectrum.   OK,
Mr. McGhee?

Mr. McGehee's post is so filled with potential topics of discussion that it
is difficult to know where to begin.  For now, I will address the analysis
and Wilfred Burchett issues, and leave a discussion of my opinion of David
Cohen's appointment to another time.

1.  I am glad we agree that captured documents do not fall under the rubric
of overt information.  But that is just a detail (not unimportant, but a
detail, nonetheless).  The bigger question concerns how the United States
intelligence community used open-source intelligence during the Vietnam
War.

Mr. McGehee's point was:  "...the CIA did ignore tremendous amounts of open
source material including proclamations by the various communist
organizations re their plans, and strengths."  I am not sure that the word
"ignore" is a precise description of what occurred.  There was a tremendous
amount of open-source material readily available from the North Vietnamese;
for example, FBIS did a solid job covering the public reporting and
pronouncements of the North Vietnamese throughout the war.  A number of
analysts around the community (Douglas Pike with USIS comes immediately to
mind, although he have might objected to being included in a discussion of
intelligence work) were using this material to produce analyses that
certainly went beyond pure policy support.  More to the point than its
being ignored, I suggest that open-source intelligence may not have been
used as effectively as it could have been or that we can show it should
have been using our 20-20 hindsight.

2.  Please note that my reference to Burchett as "communist-supporting
polemicist" was meant to be factually descriptive not an exercise in
name-calling.  The point is relevant because the accuracy of that
description clearly leads to a devaluation of the credibility (but not
necessarily the accuracy) of his reporting.  It is really pushing the edge
of the envelope to argue that we should have been listening to him.  That
observation is especially true when you consider that as a polemicist much
of Burchett's reporting was directed toward specific objectives not toward
providing an objective truth.  Yet, I know that much of his published
material was available to those within all levels of the U.S. government.
I certainly was well aware of his reporting for most of the Vietnam years.
Again, the question really is one of whether we should have given
particular weight to what he was saying.  Even in retrospect, I have to
answer that question with a no.  However, I do agree that as a nation, as a
government, and as intelligence collectors and analysts we did not
understand the nature of people's war.

3.  Life is complicated.  I respect Mr. McGehee's experience and accept the
conclusions he draws as appropriate for that experience.  Nevertheless,
when the issues are broad ones, as in the appropriate policy-intelligence
interface or the role of intelligence in the war we lost in Southeast Asia,
we are back to the old cliche about the blind men and the elephant.  My
part of the elephant felt different and reflection on that experience leads
at times to different (although not necessarily mutually exclusive)
conclusions.

4.  Mr. McGehee notes:  "That the CIA implements policy is not a question.
That the CIA adjusts its intelligence to support that policy is proven
through its history."  All repeat all bureaucracies implement policy; that
is the primary reason for the existance of bureaucracies.  The second
assertion vaults us into the policy-intelligence interface, a subject for
another day.

        Regarding the use of open source material:

        The use of open source material is always suspect unless it can be
     verified through other means.  It is especially suspect if the entity
     publishing the information views the press and propaganda as another
     weapon in war.  That doesn't mean the information is incorrect, it
     just means you have to verify it through other means.
        From July 1983 to September 1985 I ran the El Salvador Analytical
     Cell for the US Southern Command.  During that time we saw a definite
     trend in the value of FMLN radio broadcasts gathered by FBIS.
        In 1983 and into 1984, the information put out by the FMLN was
     pretty accurate.  Things were going so bad for the government the FMLN
     didn't need to lie.  Sometimes the FMLN radio broadcasts were the
     first indications we had of a significant action in the field.  Of
     course, we were able to verify the accuracy of the information because
     we could compare it to the government's reporting.
        However, as the war began to turn against the FMLN, their open
     source radio broadcasts became less useful as they began to fabricate
     information in an effort to keep up the morale of their soldiers and
     supporters.  Again, we were able to compare their reports to all
     source information to establish ground truth.
        Obviously, this required some knowledge and experience on the part
     of our analysts to notice the trend, and to be able to verify the
     accuracy of the open source reporting.
        Other intelligence gleened from the analysis of their broadcasts
     also had to do with the FMLN's changing fortunes in the war.  During
     their 1983 offensive and into early 1984, their broadcasts were full
     of terms like "destroying" enemy or "annihiliation."  During this time
     the FMLN was very effective against the government (not that the
     guerrillas were so good, but the government forces were so bad).
        Later, as the war turned, they stopped talking about "destroying"
     the government forces and talked about harassement etc.  Just the
     change in terminology indicated their intent.
        And there was a direct relationship between the political rhetoric
     and their combat actions.
        Again, it took experienced analysts to pick up on these trends, and
     in all cases the information was compared to other sources -- always.

To which I responded:

Picking up where I left off....  [Caveat -- I do not know jack about what
is going on in the CIA on a daily basis at the present time.]

Interestingly, Mr. McGehee and I arrive at the same point -- a less than
positive attitude toward the current DDO -- but our reasoning reflects the
divergence in our views of the roles and functions of intelligence.  While
accepting that it is the height of arrogance to quote yourself, I will
begin with some (edited) comments made when Cohen's selection was
announced:

[begin quote]  DCI Deutch and his "committee to name a Deputy Director of
Operations" have labored mightily to bring forth a nomination guaranteed to
please almost no one....  On one side, the professional CIA haters can find
things wrong with this appointment.  If nothing else, Cohen's "management
style" ... will be targeted.  Cohen's testimony at Gates' confirmation
hearing will be rehashed.  He will undoubtedly be called that most telling
of insults, "a team player."  On the other side, the Clandestine Services'
old-timers will grouse mightily about this appointment of a non-Directorate
of Operations person to the position....  [By his actions,] Deutch has
reinforced the view ... that he ... believes that you do not have to know
anything about an organization to manage it.  This is a popular view among
people who think of themselves as professional "managers."  It may not be a
wrong view (the public administration literature supports both sides of the
argument), but it has an element of arrogance to it that rankles many.....
If Deutch's idea of reform stops with the idea of giving people jobs they
don't know anything about, we can expect a string of nonsubstantive but
decorative changes in the future. [end quote]

My negative opinion at the time has only been reinforced by the manner in
which Deutch and Cohen handled the tempest in a teapot with France in March
1995.  Their utter abandonment of Dick Holm at that time reflected a level
of callousness that probably is directly related to the thoughts expressed
above.  (See:  Vistica, Gregory L., and Evan Thomas.  "The Man Who Spied
Too Long:  The Inside Story of How a Cold-War Hero Became a Fall Guy for a
Troubled CIA."  Newsweek, 29 Apr. 1996, 26, 31.)

Notice that none of this is related to Mr. McGehee's analysis that Cohen is
suspect because he has a history, in Mr. McGehee's words, "of distorting
information to support policy."

Issues surrounding the policy-intelligence interface are more complicated
than either Mr. McGehee or the late Sam Adams, both honest and sincere
individuals, seem to want to recognize in their criticisms.  Neither seems
to take into account that at any given moment there are multiple streams of
thought on any contentious issue; and, over time, one stream or a
combination of streams tends to drive out the others.  That does not make
it the "correct" answer, but the process does make it the "accepted"
answer.  Adams tended to ascribe evil intent to those who disagreed with
him, rather than recognize that his position lost because he failed to
convince enough people to his side to make it the dominant or accepted
position.

Certainly, there is a narrow line between intelligence in support of
policymaking and intelligence in support of a particular policy or set of
policies.  The former is the purpose of intelligence; the latter negates
that purpose.  Was that line crossed during the Vietnam War?  Yes, at
times.  Was supporting (justifying) administration policies with regard to
Southeast Asia the sole goal or purpose of CIA and other intelligence
collection and analysis entities during that period?  No, at least not in
my opinion.  There were plenty of analytic and other voices pointing out
some of the problems posed by the Vietnam War.  That they were not heard or
their advice not acted upon does not mean they did not exist.
Decisionmaking is a complicated process and intelligence is only one factor
in that process.

 My response is in two parts. Immediately below are some
citations from CIABASE re David Cohen.  The citations speak for
themselves.  The second part of the response discusses Professor
Clark's reasoned presentation of the role of intelligence in support
of policymaking.

  77-95  the new DO David Cohen began his CIA career in the east Asia
  division, responsible for the disastrous estimates of viet cong strength in
  Vietnam, and fought off internal critics such as Sam Adams and Ralph
  McGehee. Per "intelligence" sources, Cohen apparently "bent with the wind"
  and supported agency-biased estimates. "u.s. news & world report" said
  Cohen was "a company man ... Who will find out what way the wind is blowing
  and then go with it." His most noted role as analyst was as senior intel
  directorate manager and reviewer of the April 1985 CIA assessment
  supporting KGB involvement in ali agca's 1981 attempt to assassinate pope
  Jean Paul ii. The report was "ordered" by CIA director William Casey and
  his assistant, Robert gates, and was so biased that the CIA itself
  criticized it in its July 1985 "Cowey Report". Cohen was also one of six
  CIA analysts to testify before the senate select committee on intel during
  the 1991 confirmation hearing of gates as CIA director. Cohen supported
  gates and became associate director of intel. His appointment as DDO in no
  way spells reform and "scrubbing down" the DO. Intelligence - a
  computerized intelligence newsletter published in France 9/11/95 15

  USSR,  81-85  CIA's papal task force issued "Cowey Report," a critical
  analysis of CIA's April 85 report outlining Soviet involvement in pope's
  assassination. CIA analysts noted that "calling paper `the case for Soviet
  involvement'" and marshaling evidence only for that side `stacked the
  deck' in favor of Soviet involvement. Analysts thought report lacked
  qualifications, especially in area of source reliability. Ops directorate's
  reservations about sourcing of raw intel was serious enough to stop them
  from distributing reports, if not for high interest in subject. Dci Casey
  was known to support idea of Soviet involvement. Cowey Report noted that in
  analysts view, "the paper was deliberately skewed to make case for Soviet
  complicity look more solid than it is; they thought authors had been
  `manipulated.'" [ciabase comment: the director of ops as of 8/1/95, David
  Cohen, in a 91 prepared statement for senate committee said he was the
  senior manager and reviewer for "the case for Soviet involvement" and
  associated research]. Washington post 10/4/91 a8

  91  senate intel committee called on six former CIA analysts to testify in
  both closed and open sessions with regard to charges of politicization
  against Robert gates in Sep/Oct confirmation hearings. They were: Melvin
  Goodman, graham fuller, Hal ford, Larry gershwin, Jennifer glaudemans and
  Douglas maceachen. Committee also asked sworn written statements of
  following people: carolyn mcgiffert ekedahl, kay Oliver, mark Matthew's,
  lance haus, David Cohen, john hibbits, Thomas barkesdale, Paul limberg and
  john mclaughlin.  Sic, (10/24/91). Nomination of Robert m. Gates 99

  in a prepared statement to the senate intel committee
  David Cohen records he was one of intel directorate managers directly
  involved in the April 85 intel assessment re possible Soviet involvement in
  agca's assassination attempt on the pope. He was the senior directorate
  manager and reviewer for that paper and associated research. Senate intel
  committee report nomination of Robert m. Gates, 10/91 vol. iii 110-116

  USSR,  81-91  five analysts who wrote a report on Soviet involvement in the
  1981 assassination attempt against pope john Paul ii have denied charges by
  a former analyst that the assessment was politically slanted. They said new
  information led to a study in 1985 on the Kremlin's role in the shooting
  after an 83 estimate dismissed such involvement. Former CIA analyst Melvin
  goodwin charged in senate testimony that analysts "were ordered" to
  implicate the Soviets. Kay Oliver, lance w.haus and Elizabeth t. Seeger
  testified. David Cohen [just named director of operations] an intelligence
  manager who worked on the report, denied any effort to influence, slant or
  bias the analysis. Washington times 10/5/91 a4

  95  defense dept has merged covert intel ops of individual services and
  plans to expand espionage abroad, starting with establishment of phony
  businesses overseas as cover. This partly a result of pressure from
  congress on CIA and military intel to send more agents overseas to work on
  terrorism and weapons proliferation that cannot be covered by satellites.
  CIA's DO under fire re aldrich Ames and [Guatemala]. Uniting military spies
  once spread thru army, navy, air force and marines led to establishment of
  over past 3 years of defense humint service (dhs). This part of dia and has
  more than 1,000 uniformed and civilian personnel. CIA has roughly 4,500 in
  DO, of whom 900 called case officers. CIA is national manager of spying,
  but has uncertain control. David Cohen heads interagency group coordinating
  humint so CIA can monitor the dod ops. Earlier scandal re yellow fruit. CIA
  working with dhs personnel to help plan establishment of cover companies.
  Cohen's responsibilities to ensure relationship avoids redundancy and
  activities and ops are appropriately coordinated. Washington post 10/30/95

  95  David Cohen, new deputy director for clandestine operations, is a
  career economic analyst who once headed agency office that monitors trade
  and technology trends. Cohen's July 31 appointment underscores a concerted
  move by CIA to elevate what had been a backwater mission -- economic intel.
  under president Clinton, scope and volume of economic tasks by CIA is
  unprecedented. A recent example: the agency briefed u.s. negotiators on
  Japan's position in recently concluded auto talks. Business week 8/14/95 50

  CIA has established internal procedures for flagging intel goof-ups and
  embarrassments and triumphs that to be provided lawmakers weekly. Congress
  notified for first time about some serious human rights abuses committed by
  CIA informants, and some sensitive liaison ops. Policy designed to comply

  10/11/95 a7

  93  CIA beginning effort to use university personnel, including
  undergraduates, to DO classified intel work now done by CIA's hqs. Idea
  prompted by budget squeeze, is to have students trained to analyze
  intelligence about particular countries for which CIA is short of staff.
  David Cohen of the directorate of intel says he hopes universities can
  provide "surge capacities." Cohen in his remarks to an audience at
  Smithsonian institution, said he had talked to officials at Florida a&m, a
  mostly african-american school about contract work for CIA. A&m had
  accepted a 1.7 million defense department grant in November to teach
  languages. CIA spokesman said this is a program in the works. He said the
  CIA for years operated a cooperative program with universities in which
  students work full time at CIA hqs for half a year and attend school the
  other half. Part of "surge" effort is to provide more analysis on such
  problems as ethnic conflict and weapons proliferation. No analysis would be
  done on campuses. Part of effort to help CIA recruitment - CIA pays part of
  college tuition fees for students. About 70% of those who participate later
  become regular staff members. Los Angeles times 2/26/93 a4

  was associate deputy director for intelligence beginning 11/18/91. Cohen
  entered on duty on 3/20/66. He worked in the office of research and reports
  and the office of economic research, where he worked primarily on east Asian
  economic matters. He became deputy dir of office of economic research in 77

  military affairs; David edger for operations; Paul Redmond for ci; and,
  Christine wiley for personnel issues. Intelligence newsletter 8/31/95 8

  95  David Cohen named to be new DO. Cohen a former high-ranking DI
  officer, gained some espionage experience running the CIA's domestic
  collection ops which spies on foreign gvts in the u.s., specifically the
  U.N. DCI Deutch made announcements at a rare press conference at CIA hqs.
  Paul Redmond to be associate deputy director for counterintel. John gannon,
  until recently director of European analysis, to be deputy director of
  intel - in charge of all analysis. Ruth David, director of advanced info
  technology at sandia national laboratory, to be deputy director for science
  and technology. Leo hazelwood, former CIA executive director, to be deputy
  director for administration. Re Cohen he is "an outsider who is not very
  well liked within the do" but is "hardnosed." He wont take a lot of crap.
  two new associate deputy directors of ops are David edger, a respected case
  officer who was Ames supervisor at the time of his arrest, to be senior
  deputy for espionage ops. Christine wiley, former chief of human resources
  staff, to be top deputy for human resources in the do. John mclaughlin, a
  senior analyst in the Russian section, appointed number 2 official at the
  national intel council, and jay castillo was named director of office of
  personnel security. Washington times 8/1/95 a4

  95  David Cohen to be new director of ops. He was acting deputy of DI. He
  created the national resources div. out of separate domestic and foreign
  collection services. He practices "management by fear." "a company man from
  the word go - who will find out what way the wind is blowing and then go
  with it." Some mid-level and senior employees conclude the DCI Deutch is
  not serious about reform. U.s. news & world report  7/31/95 20

  95  DCI Deutch appointed four new deputy directors, all named were
  longtime CIA employees, completing his sweep of eight top executives. New
  appointees selected with help of a panel headed by former deputy DCI
  mcmahon. David Cohen new do. Washington post 8/1/95 a17

  95  DCI Deutch appointed last month a 30-year agency veteran David Cohen
  to the politically-sensitive post of deputy director of operations (ddo)
  where he will oversee ops. Deutch was given good marks by the press for
  picking "an agency man" and for putting an "analyst" rather than a "covert
  operator" in charge of the "dirty tricks" directorate. Cohen will be
  working with four associate deputy directors: u.s. army general David
  barrato (who will continue as head of covert actions), David edger (intel
  ops), Paul Redmond (counter-intel) and Christine wiley (personnel). That
  gen. Barrato has kept his job is to be a clear indication that Deutch is
  not going to "scrub down" CIA dirty tricks, to maintain and reinforce
  CIA-pentagon ties, and to "box in" Cohen at his new post. Redmond is a
  "forced" appointment since he was instrumental in pursuing the aldrich Ames
  case as a senior official of the CIA counter-intel center, and the CIA has
  had to acquiesce to FBI demands for a larger role in counter-intel in the
  CIA. Intelligence - a computerized intelligence newsletter published in
  France 9/11/95 15

  95  DCI Deutch filled one of most politically sensitive posts in u.s.
  intel community, naming David Cohen, a 53-year-old career CIA official, to
  head agency's clandestine espionage arm. Cohen's appointment as CIA's
  deputy director of ops is a modest break with tradition, since he has spent
  most of his career on analytical, rather than clandestine, side of CIA.
  Cohen is a Boston native who joined CIA in 1966. He put in a stint in
  clandestine ops earlier in his career but most recently has been serving as
  CIA's associate deputy director for directorate of intel. Turnover in
  management ranks at CIA gave Deutch a chance to put his own people in
  almost every top position. Deutch said john gannon would take over as head
  of intel directorate. With a ph.d. in history, gannon has been director of
  CIA's office of European analysis. Deutch went outside agency to fill top
  spot at CIA's science and technology arm, naming Ruth David, director of
  advanced info technologies at sandia national laboratory in Albuquerque,
  n.m. he also named Leo hazlewood, formerly CIA's executive director, to be
  deputy director for adm. Los Angeles times 8/1/95 a9

  Italy, Bulgaria, USSR,  81-86  attempted assassination on the life of the
  pope -- CIA did not know who behind the plot. In 84-85 CIA began receiving
  info about the Bulgarian and Soviet role. Gates ordered a paper analyzing
  terrorism assessing the Soviet role - paper titled "agca's attempt to kill
  the pope: the case for Soviet involvement." Paper circulated widely inside
  CIA and elicited a very negative reaction. Anne Armstrong sent the DCI a
  memo critical of the handling of the "papal plot." Gates commissioned an
  independent review. The paper on the assassination attempt was published in
  5/85 -- we never did get additional info from CIA sources, even after the
  collapse of the USSR. CIABASE comment the "Cowey Report," was a critical
  analysis of CIA's April 85 report outlining Soviet involvement in pope's
  assassination. CIA analysts noted calling paper the case for Soviet
  involvement and marshaling evidence only for that side stacked the deck.
  "the paper deliberately skewed to make case for Soviet complicity look more
  solid than it is." The Deutch appointed director of ops, David Cohen, was
  manager of "the case for Soviet involvement." Gates, r. (1996). From the
  shadows 354-6

  There are many points raised by Ransom Clark re the role of intelligence.
In my experience, William Colby, the Agency's point man for
Vietnam, cut off the production of relevant information that challenged
United States involvement in the war. The finer points that Professor Clark
outlines had no chance to play -- just block out most non-supportive
information and continue the war.  At one point probably to make the
intelligence more positive, the CIA created the Special Assistant
Vietnam Affairs Office, headed by George Carver -- a half-way home
for operations and intelligence.

   There are many ways to excuse the CIA's gross failure of intelligence
re Vietnam but there is no way to avoid the truth (The Pentagon Papers)
-- its intelligence and operations created the Vietnam War and initially
and after the U.S. made a full commitment to this action, its intelligence
failed and failed miserably, e.g., the 1968 Tet Offensive.

   I have heard and read many sophisticated arguments about the
role intelligence (in support of policymaking and policy).  My main point
is that the CIA exists to implement policy through its covert operations.
Inconvenient intelligence that challenges such policies is ignored,
buried, resisted, not collected, etc. The tragedy of this reality is
that the American people and its leaders tend to believe the intelligence
and support or continue polices based on that information.

   To create the necessary tunnel-visioned institution, the CIA must
recruit individuals who will not "see" the reality, and if they do, are
such team players, they will not protest.

   Now we have the challenge of international terrorism.
Targeting that threat you have the Agency's officers who in
the case of Vietnam could not see either the trees or the forest.
Can we expect that this severely flawed institution will be able to
deal with this dangerous, and diffuse challenge. We cant.
(The various examinations of intelligence prior to the terrorist
bombing in June 1996 at the air base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
give no credit to the CIA.  One study praises State Department
and Defense Department intelligence.)

   My observations may seem overly naive -- but I believe any
examination of the CIA's horrendous intelligence record from 1947
to the present demands the conclusion that the CIA writes intelligence
to support policy.  My goal is to see the United States have the best
intelligence possible -- intelligence that will avoid future Vietnams
-- but I also fear that the Agency has moved in the opposite direction
-- and future "Vietnams" loom.

Absolutely.  But this is true for most types of intelligence (and, I would
argue, especially so for human intelligence).  You must understand your
sources in terms of what they can do for you and what they can't.  Few
decisionmakers are willing to act on the basis of single-source
intelligence.  That said, however, your case study is a good one, and an
accurate reflection of how the process of using ever-changing material is
done to good effect.
