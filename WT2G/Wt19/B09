Subject: Re: US Intelligence in the Indian subcontinent

An open question for all. I am interested in any information available
on CIA and other US intel agency operations in INDONESIA.

All kind of data would be greatly appreciated, as would any information
on specific cases on US intelligence involvement in the area.

Or if anyone have any links about it,just let me know.

Best

Subject: For The Record

              For the Published Record

   I must put this on the published record.  Someone
is apparently upset at my postings re the CIA and e-mailed
me disgusting, salacious material suggesting I am interested
in an illegal activity.  The e-mail asks for a reponse. I cannot
tell them to go to hell as this would put me on record somewhere
as responding to their address.

   When CIABASE first became known, I began receiving "catalogues,"
at the CIABASE Herndon, VA post office box.  A "Sixty Minutes" program
in the last year or so noted how the government ran sting ops like
this.

   The danger in this posting is that someone might assume
I am "guilty" but that danger is less than not recording what
happened.

I recieved an offer to buy or sell child pronography through e-mail this
morning, deleted it, and then read Ralph's public notice.  Then I went on
to read similar complaints from other lists that I am on, so it may not be
this list that has generated such interest.  Also posted on another list
was a response from the AOL postmaster to a complaintant saying that
privileges for AOL accounts TIPTOE0001 and r9ch have already been
terminated and the matter has passed into the hands of the AOL legal
department for followup.

Hope this helps.

No.  I am not trying to provoke you.  I would

Subject: Re: For The Record

The problem is NOT with conspiracy, but one of "guilt by association" AND
a lack of Common Sense by some investigative agencies.
And IHMO:  this does bare with the purpose of THIS mailing list.

 The E-mail in question starts out with these lines'

 "Hi, I sent you this letter because your email address was on a list that
fit this category. I am a fan of child pornography....ETC:"


FWIW:   I am NOT  one of those types. And I have filed a complaint with AOL
and the local crimes against children unit & with the special investigation
unit concerned with Internet crime.
Child pornography brings out some special stupidity on the part of some
folks in certain agencies.
 The fact that my Email address and therefore me, may be on someone's list
that I did not ask to be on, and no control over, AND may be part of a
witchhunt, bothers me.  call it paranoia, whatever.

I have seen power and information abused by those in authority with lack
of common sense.  Guilt by association, real or false can ruin a person,
or a company....

It might even fall under the heading of DISINFORMATION.

   Attached is the full text of a message from another list I read. It seems
the spammers are at work here, in a more twisted mode than usual. C&D seems
not to be the only list affected by this most recent prank or whatever it is.

   For those who may not have seen or heard of the individual who posted
this message, I'd like to help establish his bona fides. Patrick Crispen, a
student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, was responsible for
writing two free online Internet training workshops (ROADMAP and ROADMAP96)
as well as assisting in the ongoing TOURBUS list (a WWW workshop) from which
the post below originates. Tens of thousands of Internet and WWW users have
benefited from these efforts. See his home page for details- the URL is
listed below. He'd probably rather you didn't email him directly with
questions, however.

From: Patrick Douglas Crispen <crispen@campus.mci.net>
Subject:      ADMIN: CHILD PORN LETTER
To: TOURBUS@LISTSERV.AOL.COM

Thousands of Internet subscribers around the world recently received e-mail
letters from <TipToe0001@aol.com> or <R9ch@aol.com> with the subject lines
"Child Fun!" or "Child XXX" offering child pornography for sale over the
Internet.  I want to assure the readers of this list that:

     1. The sender of the "Child Fun" letter did not get your
        e-mail address from this LISTSERV list.  The only person
        in the world who can even see this list's subscriber
        information is the listowner -- me.  :)

     2. I immediately contacted, and faxed a copy of the "Child
        Fun" letter to, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
        office in Tuscaloosa.

     3. I personally believe that the "Child Fun" letter is a
        "spoof," written by someone who decided it would be funny
        to exact some sort of revenge on "Steve Barnard."  (The
        second line of the letter -- "I sent you this letter
        because your email address was on a list that fit this
        category" -- is the classic opening line for the new
        generation of mass-mail spams).

If you receive or have received a copy of the "Child Fun" letter, simply
delete it.  The federal law enforcement agency of the United States is
aware of the letter, and is investigating the matter.

IHMO that is almost certainly the case, since the whole thing was so
provocatively outrageous that it seems to have been solely intended to cause
trouble for "Steve Barnard" [whoever he might be and whatever he might have
done to deserve this].

Subject: Spamming - ...for the record...

Dear List Members,

I am sad to say that our list has been the target of this type of abuse!

I also received such letter but I chose to ignore it, however, I see that
it offended a number of you and thus I am sending a letter to
<postmaster@aol.com> with my objection in no uncertain terms.

Please follow my example and ignore it! If you respond to this type of
garbage, you give that person what he/she wants: your indignation. I also
received this very same letter at my compuserve address as well as other
online addresses I have...

This list is set up in such a fashion that no one - no one - can get your
address from the list - not even you the subscriber! In other words, one
cannot subscribe to the list with the intention of getting the names and
addresses of other subscribers! The names on this mailing list are
onfidential! I just thought I mention this to put your mind at ease.

Please continue to stay on target with your discussions on this list. Do not
allow others to distract you from that objective! Keep this list free from
discussions concerning this type of abuse. Contact me personally if you have
questions.

Thanks to all for your cooperation.

My very best wishes to all of you.

Entering into a philosophical discussion as to who received this e-mail
or who did not - or offering advice to that effect - is not part of the
subject matter under discussion on this list. I don't like to see this

An "intelligence" tip of sorts: a quick search of Alta
Vista (the Usenet section) reveals that the author of
the offensive post spammed the entire Internet and has
ignited a massive uproar among net users all around the
world. This is a global controversy.

Before taking any post like this personally, always do
an initial check in the major search engines to get
your bearings. (I am referring to people in general,
not to you personally, David. <g>)

One can't rule out the possibility that the author was
attempting to damage the reputation of the Internet.
There are a number of powerful political interests that
are quite eager to find any excuse to impose oppressive
legislation on the Internet. They've been trying to
whip up hysteria about the net for at least a year or
two now, and would probably not be averse to using
dirty tricks. The Internet represents a very real and
potent threat to many entrenched interests.

This statement raises some interesting questions regarding the Swett
document on the intel value of the internet, as well as discussions in a
number of groups regarding the potential political power of the internet,
USENET in particular.

I am not a Luddite, but I would have to say I am not convinced that the
internet poses any threat to politics as we know it.  That said, you are
of course spot on that some are seeking to impose strict regualtion on
that which is apparently unregulatable (however, the Chinese apparently
did it; I'm curious as to the technical "how" since most internet pundits
have said it's impossible).  I would only add that those seeking to
regualte are doing so not because of fear of the internet, but out of,
IMHO, a very calculated desire to appeal to groups that are "against" what
they think the internet is (of course, that means pornography because
everybody knows that is the main source of interest on the net, right?)

Dear List Member:

Let me make one more comment concerning this so-called "spamming":

I've written a letter to <postmaster@aol.com> concerning this issue. If and
when I receive a reply, I will share it with you. In the meantime, please
don't use the list as a discussion forum concerning this issue; if you
received this e-mail in your private mail box, then, clearly, it is not a
list topic and does not relate to intelligence matters that would concern -
or interest - the majority of list members. If the objective of the sender
is to disrupt this or similar lists, then you are playing into his/her hand.

As I said, I also received this mail in private mail boxes; I chose to ignore
it...

Besides, it would be a "faux pas" in thinking to believe with certainty that
the sender of this mail is in fact of that persuasion merely because he
writes and sends it. After looking at the writing style - English, Grammar,
and Sophistication - it seems that someone devised a different kind of
"virus" with which to infect the internet...in other words a game you're
invited to play; and it also seems that some of you jump at the opportunity
to play it...

Any private investigator - if you don't have the data bases - can give you
a work up on the name and address listed in that letter!

Again, please don't use this list to send messages to "John" and "Nancy", and
"Mary" and "Sam". This is not what this list is about. If you want to send
e-mail to one specific person, address him or her not the list! Unless your
post has a specific intent to address the subject matter under discussion on
this list, or answer one, don't post it! I don't want to see another
"...for the record...", please!

I'm afraid I'd have to disagree. There are several already-extant cases
where the internet and "it's" interests have been sufficient to change
political outcomes - Alan Simpson's immigration battle last year, for
instance, or the "round one" fight over Clipper.

It's actually not that difficult if you're seeking to restrict access
for 99% of the populace. No solution is 100% perfect, but there are a
number of technologies that can combine to give you that 99% figure. For
example, a combination of filtering routers, site blocking software tied
to a 'net worm, and a small user base would yield a fairly useful
result. For a country with 30-40 million users, it'd be much more
difficult to get effective levels of protection. For <1 million users,
it would actually be quite easy.

Oh, there are other interests at threat, too. The "traditional" banking
industry is under noticeable threat. newspapers and the printing
industry in general have been watching this come for several years now,
and are only just starting to adapt to it. A lot of other, similarly
information-intensive industries that have a lot of money tied up in
physical plant are similarly looking around, being very worried.

Subject: 'Failure of CIA's Terrorism Intelligence

      CIA'S FAILURE OF INTELLIGENCE RE TERRORISM

   The failure of intelligence in Saudi Arabia in the bombing
at Khobar Towers in Dhahran in June 1996 and the earlier
bombing in at the National Guard Training Center in Riyadh
in November 1995, forebodes additional intelligence failures.
This is particularly true for all intelligence operations aimed at
radical Islamic fundamentalist terrorists in the Middle East and
around the globe.

   Many of radicals were activated by the CIA's own operation in
Afghanistan during the 1980s that brought fundamentalists from
around the Middle East and trained, armed and energized their
terrorism. There is an irony in all of this -- the CIA creates
the threat that is now the primary reason for its existence. Yet
another irony is that the Agency seems totally incapable of controlling
or penetrating the Frankenstein of its own creation.

   A number of investigations of the Khobar Tower's bombing blames
the lack of adequate intelligence for that disaster. However, an
investigation by Senator Specter's Senate Intelligence Committee
concluded there was adequate intelligence but a failure to by the
commanders to act on that information.  Significantly Senator Specter
credits State and Defense Department intelligence but ignores the CIA's
(lack of) contribution.

   A Defense Department investigation led by General Downing of the
Khobar Towers bombing states there were numerous indicators but
no specific intelligence that allowed for counter action. In his
report, General Downing lists various defense intelligence publications
for the indicators intelligence but does mention the CIA. His report
also lists a number of corrective actions specifically an increase
in the number of analysts to collate and understand the information
gathered locally and around the world.

   This to me is where the CIA should have been at the forefront
but is where its bureaucratic, tradition-based and secrecy-locked
operations and intelligence have not, and cannot perform.

   I repeat two arguments from other postings -- one the CIA
in the middle of the Vietnam War with literally tens-of-thousands
of assets could not penetrate the all-pervasive Communist
structures.  Now we are asked to believe that it can penetrate
widely scattered, often non-connected, small, secretive terrorist
groups. But the CIA uses essentially the same structures and
procedures that have repeatedly failed in much more promising
and less challenging milieus. The list of its intelligence
failures is massive.

   Some might argue but that was Vietnam and this is now. We need
look only to the views of the current Director of the CIA, John Deutch,
to see the fallacy in that reasoning. In 1995, Deutch said he was shocked
by the (DO) Director of Operations's "inability to formulate solutions."
The DO did not have the desire or ability to reinvent itself. "Compared to
uniformed officers they certainly are not as competent or as understanding
of what their relative role is and what their responsibilities are."
The deep rot of the DO in Guatemala is a core sample of the deep rot of
the overall Directorate. The curse of old boys is the patrimony of an
elite secret society that degenerated into an elitist bureaucracy, an
inbred tribal culture. Rules and laws are not for them. The curse of
old boys has so damaged the morale and reputation of the CIA that it
is hard to find good people. "The CIA has been imprisoned by its own
lies."

   Below is information from CIABASE files re the
various investigations of the failures of intelligence
in Saudi Arabia.

Ralph McGehee
CIABASE

  Saudi Arabia,  96  A home-grown Islamic underground has emerged in Saudi
  Arabia with a violent fringe sworn to attack its American protectors. many
  Saudis and Americans predict continued bursts of violence. most were among
  the estimated 15,000 Saudis who fought in Afghanistan, where some had
  received CIA-organized military training and forged links with radical
  leaders from a number of countries who since have helped organize terrorist
  attacks against the west. The bombing at the National Guard Training
  Center on 11/13/95 was (probably) the work of Saudi's own Islamic
  extremists. Many in the radical underground are veterans of the war
  against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. A small circle of
  ultra-radicals, from among the thousands of fundamentalists who
  embrace audeh's criticisms decided to take action. A group, the Movement
  for Islamic Change, issued warnings in April and June 95 calling on
  U.S. forces to leave Saudi Arabia by 6/28/95, or become legitimate targets.
  They claimed to have carried out the November bombing in Riyadh and the June
  bombing in Dhahran. Of the four who confessed to November bombing, three
  were veterans of the Afghan conflict. Washington Post 8/15/96 1,22

  Saudi Arabia, The Pentagon's report on 6/25 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi
  Arabia, cited a long list of bureaucratic and intel failings in U.S.
  counter terrorism program. Retired General Wayne A Downing, who led
  the investigation emphasized the intelligence community's inability to
  penetrate terrorist groups. The report said "we still have enormous
  difficulty in gaining firsthand, inside knowledge of terrorist plans
  and activities." To some the main threat comes from a murky net of
  home-grown, privately-financed and largely independent groups a kind
  of international terrorists internet. Net is extremely difficult for
  U.S. Intel agencies to locate and penetrate. Washington Post
  10/17/96 a25

  Saudi Arabia,  95-96  There was no intelligence from any source which
  warned specifically of the nature, timing, and magnitude of the 6/25/96
  attack on Khobar Towers. However, a considerable body of info, including a
  series of ten suspicious incidents in the proceeding 90 days, was available
  that indicated terrorists had both capability and intention to target U.S.
  interests in Saudi Arabia, and that Khobar Towers was a potential target.
  Command was not well served by an ad hoc intel structure. Command did not
  have a dedicated, organic, and focused intel analytic capability re
  intention to target U.S. advisers in Saudi Arabia and that Khobar Towers
  was a potential target. secretary of defense, report to the president,
  9/16/96, force protection: global interests, global responsibilities.

  Saudi Arabia,  96  Intel failures left the military in Khobar (Dhahran)

  Washington Post 8/15/96 a33-4

  Saudi Arabia,  96  Secretary of Defense, report to the President, 9/16/96,
  force protection: global interests, global responsibilities. (General
  Downing's report re the bombing of Khobar Towers, Saudi Arabia). there were
  intel indications, while they lacked specificity, they did warn that new
  attacks were being planned and caused the U.S. to take further steps to
  protect the forces. DOD does not know the perpetrators. report recommends
  tailor anti-terrorism training for deployed personnel; provide more focused
  anti-terrorism intel to field units; improve interchange with host nations
  on intel and security. U.S. intel community was providing 24-hour coverage
  of terrorist and terrorist-related activity. all available intel widely
  distributed in theater. Intel support was very good is some areas,
  sufficient in others, and lacking in at least one key area - that of
  providing tactical warning of impending attack. U.S. forces acted on
  General threat Intel, but forces lacked specificity that would have made
  the crucial difference. what was missing was the hard tactical warning of
  impending attack - info needed to thwart the op before it reached fruition.
  need improved analysis in Washington at the counter terrorist center. to
  improve Intel forces to augment the southern watch fusion cell with
  counter-terrorism analysts. a fusion cell combines on a timely basis,
  national strategic Intel, gathered around the world, with local or tactical
  Intel. DOD elements had the authority, but were not exploiting all
  potential sources of info. the U.S. Intel community must have the requisite
  authorities and invest more time, people and funds into developing humint
  sources. makes this a general recommendation. field units had limited
  access due [highly classified] Intel. report re Intel organization

  General Downing's report re the bombing of Khobar Towers, Saudi Arabia.

  Saudi Arabia,  95-96  Ability of theater and national Intel community to
  conduct in-depth, long term analysis of trends, intentions, and
  capabilities of terrorists is deficient. Development monitored in parallel
  with the country team. Beginning in spring of 95, concerns about the
  possibility of terrorism began to increase. Intel community produced a
  series of reports which expanded and was updated as new intel was
  collected. These events were documented in the Defense Intel Terrorism
  summary, the National Military Joint Intel Center executive highlights, the
  chairman, joint chiefs of staff, daily Intel briefing and the military
  Intel digest. However, focus was on current trends and promulgations of
  warnings. Military intel community lacks sufficient in-depth, long-term
  analysis of trends, intentions, and capabilities of terrorists. DIA had 40
  people assigned to the terrorist mission at the time of the Khobar Towers
  bombing, yet only seven analysts were committed to accomplish detailed
  assessments because of other priority commitments. similar conditions exist
  at service component commands and in the military department elements
  charged with analyzing terrorism. this is particularly crucial re terrorism
  analysis which must promote insight and anticipation of future potential,
  not just repetition of historical anecdote. secretary of defense, report to
  the president, 9/16/96, force protection: global interests, global
  responsibilities. General Downing's report re the bombing of Khobar Towers,
  Saudi Arabia, 30

  Saudi Arabia,  94-96  Senate Intel chairman, Specter, finds Khobar Towers
  bombing "not the result of intel failure." A new committee staff report,
  focused on adequacy of intel re terrorist threat in Saudi Arabia. "There
  was a failure to use intel." Staff reviewed raw and finished intel from
  late 94 through 6/96 from CIA, DIA, NSA, State and others. Staff
  interviewed various members from the intel community. Committee held seven
  hearings. Report determined intel in Saudi Arabia gave its highest priority
  to the terrorist target and aggressively collected against a range of
  internal and external threats from Iran, Hizballah and others. From 4/95
  through the bombing the analytic community produced more than a 100
  products on terrorism in the Arabian peninsula. Among most significant were
  the 6/13/96 Department of State report and the 6/17/96 Military Intel
  Digest outlining numerous suspicious incidents... that warrants improved
  security efforts. Senate Select Committee on Intel staff report on Khobar
  Towers terrorist attack 9/12/96

  Saudi Arabia,  96  Intel failures left the military in Khobar (Dhahran)
  unaware of the magnitude of the threat. Per the chairman of the House
  National Security Committee. "Available intel was virtually devoid of

  that U.S. military overstated the extent of security measures sought prior
  to the bombing in Dhahran on 6/25/96. Military only asked Saudis to move

  most of he report concerns U.S. intel reports that Muslim fundamentalists
  and Iranian agents targeted U.S. personnel. By march 95, intel had
  determined that Iranian ops in Saudi Arabia were no longer simply intel

I would have to say I am in strong agreement with you,
and in strong disagreement with David. I believe that
David is underestimating the potential impact of the
Internet on the American political system and on the
global political system.

Why don't we talk about the impact of the Internet on
the intelligence community? That's on target for the
list.

One important impact: with the arrival of the Internet,
intelligence agencies in democratic nations in the
Western world are going to find it much more difficult
to control the flow of information in the mass media
and to maintain the secrecy of their operations.

On the Internet, publications like Conspiracy Nation
(which is a mix of nonsense, partial truths and a few
truths) are as easily accessible to anyone with a net
connection as The New York Times or ABC's Nightline.
For many users, the fringe publications tend to be more
interesting than the stodgy mainstream publications,
whose algorithms for transforming information are
mind-numbingly predictable and boring.

Increasingly I suspect you will see leakers within the
intelligence community using forums like Conspiracy
Nation to broadcast their information to the entire
word--on an equal footing with any of the traditional
big media, and perhaps with stronger impact.

The IC can respond either by attempting to impose
draconian restrictions on the Internet, or, what would
be much smarter, learning how to use the new
information regime, playing skillfully by the new
rules.

Here is my reasoning.  First, the internet is predominantly "male and
pale," that is, for lack of a more eloquent description, a bunch of nerdy
white guys with computers (exaggeration for effect, as I am obviously
included in this group).  In fact, whatever political impact the internet
does have is basically expressing the interests of this rather small and
self-selecting group.  In terms of democracy, then, one could argue that
it is actually counterproductive, rather than expanding influence to the
masses.

In addition, I would hesistate to claim the internet as being responsible
for the immigration issue (indeed, there are far more powerful lobbies at
work than those on the 'net; and what is the internet's position on
that issue anyway?  I follow this issue fairly closely and I don't see any
consensus.)  In sum, until the internet causes a dramtic increase in the
number of people actually exercising their vote (and those "people" being
a far larger cross-section of society than it is currently), I remain
dubious about its political impact of the internet.  Perhaps it can't be
discounted, but it is hardly the vox populi that internet denizens may
wish it to be.

However, precisely because the internet is made up of a smaller, more
educated, at least marginally techinically literate population, I do
believe the intel value of the 'net is definitely there.  The Pentagon
thought piece amkes all the right arguments in my mind, and just from a
personal perspective, I can say that soem of the information on the
internet rivals what one might read in even classified cable traffic.

Well said, Mr. McGuire. But I do have a question. Just how easily and
with what level of willingness will the IC agree to change and 'play by
the new rules'? We all saw what happened when the CIA started to indulge
in economic espionage in the early nineties. How would they react to this
new twist in the landscape?

Subject: Narco-Democracy Here and Now

The disclosure of the Lippo Group's ownership of the First
National Bank of Mena Arkansas and the sworn testimony of Jack
Blum before the Senate Intelligence Committee, seemly unrelated
events, show further steps in turning this great country into a
narco-democracy.

The emergence of the facts surrounding the Lippo group confirm
the central theme of Roger Morris' _Partners in Power_: Bill
Clinton was always a CIA tool and almost always had much more
money than his election opponents. His specific support came in a
large part from Lippo/Stephens. Both Lippo and Stephens are worth
near or more than billions. Neither group had a Bill Gates or
Steve Jobs, nor a new highly profitable legitimate product or
service, yet each accumulated billions.

The critical fact about Lippo/Stephens is the ownership of the
National Bank of Mena. You had to get the money out of Mena,
which was arriving in dufflebags stuffed with hundred dollar
bills. A local bank was ideal. The amounts involved, an estimated
320 million dollars per year, made contributions to the various
Clinton campaigns mere petty cash.

So Clinton gets the big prize and does what George Bush may have
wanted to do but could not: stonewall all the various scandals
hanging around since the Reagan/Bush years. Next, he whatever he
does, has the effect of enhancing the illegal drug business.
NAFTA, passed without meaningful drug interdiction measures,
opens a flood gate of cocaine via Mexico. Vietnam is offered
relaxed trade rules and heroin again flows through that country
from the Golden Triangle to our shores. He executes an
unconstitutional 50 billion dollar package, suggested by the
opposing party, which bails out the peso and has a direct benefit
to the 24 Mexican billionaires, most of whom got wealthy quickly
when Mexico became the major drug transshipping entry to this
country. Clinton does more to undermine individual rights than
all of his predecessors combined. An unrestrained police state
begins to emerge, evidenced by Waco and the Ruby Ridge coverup.
Clinton appoints Ruth Bader Ginsberg to the Supreme Court, after
she paid her dues by affirming the _Inslaw_ decision in which the
government stole a private company's software. His other
appointment has record of 15 out of 17 decisions in favor of
business trusts, as one way to preserve illegally accumulated
wealth is to take down the anti-trust laws developed over the
last 90 years or so. All time the Clinton was executing his
agenda, Dole stood by silently in the Senate or took an active
role of support.


Clinton's opponent, Dole, should be screaming for justice and the
rule of law but only speaks of braod generalities. On CSPAN today
Jack Blum testified before a Senate committee that the 80's drug
probe came to a screeching halt by a rather simple device. The
old committee's mandate expired and no one, either party, sought
to renew it. Blum also testified that the Senate itself was
unable to get a complete copy of Oliver North's diary. Likewise,
Blum said that the Senate was totally stonewalled from receiving
any information or cooperation from the Department of Justice.
The person responsible for the stonewall was William Weld, now a
candidate for the Senate. When all of this was going on, Bob
Dole, a Senate power, stood by silently watching his
institution's prerogatives trampled by the executive branch. Dole
also was a very vocal opponent of any funding for Iran Contra
investigation making him a principal actor to that stonewall.

So the current election boils down to a CIA stooge or narco
government dupe, with Intelligence Community with its 30 billion
dollar budget watching democracy take a back seat to a government
for the drug dealers and, if not, by the drug dealers.

Certainly. I would point out that those information distribution
industries are worth watching, though - they deal with many of the same
issues, have many of the same problems, and are more-or-less tied to the
IC. They may not be primary actors, but I still think that what happens
to/with them is of great interest to the IC.

Another case in point. For a fairly modest investment, one can now
"build" a virtual online bank, with all the protections and utility of a
full-size bank. At present these are going to be custom-done. Expect to
see OTS "online bank" packages and expertise within 2 years, for an
end-run cost of <$200,000, and a facility/personnel need of 2-3 people
in a small office.  What does that kind of utility (and ability to
appear/disappear) do to the dynamics of money movement and tracing?

Alternately, one can build a (large) virtual library with not much more
than a full-time librarian, a few $K in software, and a properly built
NT system. Total startup cost? Less than $10K, and you can run it out of
your spare bedroom. Throw another $5K at it, and you've got the whole
thing completely associative - you can automate your basic analysis and
association of all that data.

The former is a losing game. Period. The PRC is already trying that, and
will not succeed in the long run - though they will be able to hold the
lid on there for several more years.

I am not willing to argue that the internet has no intel value; but if I
were managing intel resources, I can think of a lot of other ways I would
spend my dollars and people before turning my attention to the internet.
Sourcing remains a major problem in the internet arena.

I accept that there is some decent information to be gathered through the
internet, but the best of that information is through tapping into
commercial databases.  Little of the information being generated by private
individuals is of any conceivable use to intelligence collectors.
Disinformation (in the generic, not technical, sense) and outright
fabrication abound.  False names and pseudonyms, coupled with a strong
extremist bent to much of the material, makes everybody and everything on
the internet suspect.  Sorting out all this at the present stage of
development of the internet is not be worth the bother in a constrained
resource environment.

Ask yourself who is having the greatest strategic
impact on the world at the present: the research
centers at MIT and elsewhere which created and dominate
the highest levels of the Internet, or traditional
political science departments.

I would argue that the hacker culture is running
circles around the traditional political science
culture in all the domains that are of greatest
interest to the intelligence community. I doubt that
most of the traditional social science and humanities
communities even understand what are the strategic
stakes and issues at the cutting edge of the Internet
community.

The most powerful tool in the arsenal of any
intelligence community these days is a brilliant hacker
who knows his or her way around the secret channels of
the Internet. This new hacker elite, in fact, may
eventually evolve into the ruling priesthood of
intelligence communities worldwide. If you don't
understand the net these days, you are almost out of
the game.

Dear List Member:

One of the ways in which Listserv (St. Johns University) maintains a mailing
list is to periodically ask subscribers to *confirm* their subscription.

This reduces address problems, error messages, and adds to the security of
our list by eliminating *phantom* subscribers. If you received such a notice,
please comply with their request. If you need help, please let me know.

If you haven't yet received this notice from Listserv, you will somewhere
down the road.


Thanks for your cooperation.

This is confirming my subscription

Incidentally, is there any way to receive a single digest file containing all
the correspondence over a period, such as a day or a week, instead of each of
the individual messages posted to the forum?

If this is not currently possible, would other members not be interested in it?

Many thanks,

Dear List Member:

I am receiving some nice comments concerning the list, some here on ClaoKs,
some in my private mail box; but please wait 'til you hear from LISTSERV
before you confirm your subscription, and then only to LISTSERV. I,
personally cannot confirm your subscription, that is a relationship
between you and Listserv.

Thanks again!

I thought some might be interested in this little tidbit...

  Global Marine Inc unveiled plans to charter the "Glomar
Challenger" for a deep water drilling project in the Gulf of
Mexico. Global Marine will take delivery of the ship and have it
ready for drilling in 7,500 feet of water by February 1996.
Engineering work and procurement is underway and will continue into
March 1997. The 5 year, $260 million contract is with a
Chevron/Texaco partnership. The 619 foot Glomar is currently
stationed in Suisan Bay, California as part of the naval reserve
fleet.

Subject: Bulgarian Developments -- Long

Greetings from Munich (Just back from Prague for a few days).

For those interested in East European developments, including
intelligence matters, it appears that Democracy is making a fierce
comeback in Bulgaria.  Details from a friend in Sofia:

1.  The democratic opposition candidate for Bulgarian President.
Peter Stoyanov, just won the first round of the election. He got 46.43%,
followed by Ivan Marazov (the ruling Socialist Party & coalition) with
26.13% and the populist George Gantchev (Business Bloc) with 22.13%.

Since neither from the first two did get 51%, next Sunday a second round
will take place. The name of the next president is Peter Stoyanov. He
and his Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) clearly stated that their first
objective is to cause early parliamentary election and to put an end to
the majority in Parliament the Socialists still have.


2. TWO FORMER MINISTERS, FORMER AMBASSADOR TH THE US AND  FORMER TOP
MANAGERS OF "DISK MEMORY SYSTEMS" COMPANY (DMS, a.k.a. DZU) CHARGED IN
BULGARIA

In a press release issued October 25, Bulgarian National Police informed
that six persons hve been charged with criminal breach of trust and
mismanagement causing gross damages to the State (Articles 219, 220,
221, 282 and 283 of Bulgarian Penal Code).

This was the result of investigation conducted by National Security
Service and the Regional Direction of Police in Stara Zagora, Central
South Bulgaria. The case now is with the Office of Bulgarian Prosecutor
General, Ivan Tatartchev, for preparing of an indictment.

The individuals charged are:

        (1) Rumen Bikov, former Industry Minister;

        (2) Ratcho Petrov, former Deputy Minister of Industry;

        (3) Rafael Sarkissian, former Executive Director of the state
       company Disk Memory Systems (DMS, a.k.a. DZU) at Stara Zagora,
       now  residing in the USA;

        (4) Peter Yantchev Tanev, former Chairman of the Board of
       Directors of DMS( a.k.a. DZU);

        (5) Ognyan Pishev, former Chairman of the Board of Directors of
        DMS (a.k.a DZU), former Bulgarian Ambassador to the USA;

        (6) Eftim Pandev, Authorized Representative of DMS  (a.k.a.
       DZU) in the USA and head of DMS subsidiaries  in the USA (such
       as Point  Peripherals, Peripheral Research Corporation and
       Gigastorage, all of them based in California), now residing in
       the USA, or in France.

All persons charged in Bulgaria have been ordered not to leave the
country until exonerated. Police did not say if there was a request made
to US  authorities to establish the whereabouts of Rafael Sarkissian and
Eftim  Pandev and eventually to subpoena the two.

The Background:
----------------

THE NEVA PROJECT

The first part of a combined KGB and Bulgarian intelligence cooperative
project for scientific and industrial espionage was "NEVA." It called
for "transfer" (theft and illegal purchase) of Western (American)
computer hardware, know-how: processors, fast-data transmission, and
high-capacity storage devices. The second part (practical use by DZU of
the obtained hardware and know-how in production of disks, optical
memories, etc.), was not accomplished. Reportedly NEVA was declared dead
on December 23,1994.

NEVA had the active support of the Bulgarian holding company TRON. The
father of one of the owners of TRON, Stoytchev Sr., used to be director
of DZU in  Stara Zagora. The other owner of TRON, Stuart Karalian, held
26%% of  shares of the telecommunications company Mobiltel. Last
September Mobiltel ceded all its shares (75%) to an Italian company
reportedly financed by undisclosed dubious Russian corporations.
Multigroup, the largest Bulgarian holding company, is (or was) also
related to the Neva Project and to the Gigastorage affair of Bisser
Dimitrov in Belfort (France). Bisser Dimitrov has been called "The
Lukanov's man in California". According to French intelligence sources,
Dimitrov has been used by KGB under the code name of Mont Blanc and his
father has been bearing the code name Nova.

A certain Ognyan Bozarov was arrested by FBI on 10 December 1990 in
California on charges of illegal export of American high technology.
Ognyan Pishev, at that time Bulgarian ambassador to the US, attempted to
propose the Bulgarian embassy building as security on Bozarov's $200,000
bail.

LUKANOV

The man regarded  as political engine and "godfather" of the NEVA
Project, Andrei Lukanov, was shot down by four 9 mm bullets October 2,
in  front of his home in Sofia.

One of the top Socialist (former Communist) Party leaders, former
Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, former Prime Minister, and a
close friend of the late British Tycoon Maxwell, Lukanov is said to be
responsible for the transfer of about $8,000,000,000 out of the country
and for creating in the late 1980s of a network of "mail-box
corporations" of the Bulgarian Communist Party in many foreign
countries.

Police sources said off the record that they have a description of the
suspect, obviously a professional killer, and that a computer-created
sketch was sent to all border crossing points. However, the description
and the sketch have been never made public. Moreover, the authorities
have denied their very existence. Observers in Sofia say that the
government does not want the murder to be investigated.

Lukanov was removed last July as head of Topenergy, a promising joint
venture with Gasprom of Russia, and replaced by Iliya Pavlov, president
of  Multigroup. A close political friend of Lukanov said that two days
before the killing Lukanov has been talking with his top political
allies about the necessity to replace Prime Minister Zhan Videnov and
his cabinet. Lukanov allegedly also said to the above mentioned that he
has obtained proof about corruption in the government and about huge
sums misappropriated.

Last summer Lukanov publicly called "a marauding ring" the circle of
close friends around PM Videnov, widely known as "he Orion Circle."

SOME OTHER DEAD BODIES

July 7, 1995, in a mountain park at the outskirts of Sofia, police found
the body of Assistant Professor Lambo Kyutchukov, former Deputy Minister
of Education. Kyutchukov was executed point-blank, with four slugs.
Three months later, police detained as suspects the president and the
vice president of an insurance company. Last month they have been
released due to lack of sufficient evidence.

On March 27, 1996, Zhivko Zhelev, former director of the state owned
disk memory plant DMS (a.k.a. DZU) in Stara Zagora, told reporters: "I
have submitted to Prosecutor General Tatartchev, proofs to the effect
that Kyutchukov was killed to prevent the disclosure of a $2,000,000
fraud at DZU."

Zhivko Zhelev (not related to Bulgarian head of state) claimed that
Andrei Lukanov was behind the killing. According to Zhivko Zhelev,
Andrei Lukanov was involved in the creation of the scandalous
GigaStorage project in France. Lukanov, through the "puppet figures"
Bisser Dimitrov and R. Sarkissian, allegedly has caused $21,000,000
damage to Bulgarian state. Zhivko Zhelev also claimed that as Minister
for Foreign Economic Relations, back in the 1980s, Lukanov had destroyed
documentation about illegal transfer to the West of a total amount of
$2,500,000,000.

April 12, 1996, in a Sofia hotel owned and used by Multigroup, Ivo
Yantchev was found dead. Yanthcev was a former member of Bulgarian
intelligence and a representative of Multigroup in Skopje, the capital
of Macedonia. Although police concluded that Yantchev had committed
suicide, Yantchev's former intelligence service colleagues said that
they were "conducting their own investigation" into what may be either a
battle between former senior intelligence officials now involved in
business, or in a Multigroup "internal house cleaning"

Following the October 1995 assassination attempt against Macedonian
President, Kiro Gligorov, press reports mentioned possible involvement
of Multigroup in the car bombing.

Tyrone man targeted at Heathrow

BY MICK NAUGHTON

SINN Fein's Francie Molloy has exposed another British
undercover operation in London this week.

Molloy revealed that a young nationalist, from the
Coalisland area of east Tyrone has been hounded by British
agents, both at his home and workplace in Britain.

The man in his mid-20s, who did not wish to be named for
fear of losing his job, first became suspicious last May as
he returned to London from Tyrone where he had been
attending his grandmother's funeral. As he disembarked from
a flight two men, `Chris' and `John', struck up a
conversation with him about the problems of getting regular
work in London. Both had what sounded like polite Belfast
accents.

The Tyrone man, who works at Heathrow airport's Terminal 4
and who has lived in London for four years, thought nothing
more about the short encounter until he walked into his
local bar weeks later to find the pair drinking together.
They reminded him of their earlier discussion. After that
the pair appeared regularly in a number of other places and
on several occasions called to the man's home to get him out
for a drink. During conversation `Chris' and `John' told him
they were thinking about opening a bar and asked if he would
be interested in ``regular employment.'' They pressed him
repeatedly, promising `easier money.' The man's present job
entails him doing 12-hour shifts. He said he wasn't
interested.

However, at the beginning of this week, on Monday evening,
the pair's concentrated attention finally came to a head
when `Chris', (described as being of a heavy build) declared
they ``worked for the government and had access to huge sums
of money.''

The worried man, speaking by phone to this reporter from a
north London location on Tuesday morning, related what
happened next.

``After telling me this, they showed me a photograph clearly
taken at my workplace in the airport at 9.40am this Monday
morning. They showed me another photo of my brother's former
partner and they said they knew he had served time as a
republican POW and was now `working in England.' To be
totally honest, I was terrified, they knew so much about my
movements, who my girlfriend was (she comes originally from
Co Kildare), and information about my employer.

``I was so nervous at being alone with them that I agreed to
meet them at 6.40pm on Monday evening at a bar in Heathrow.
I was due to start my shift at 6.30pm so they clearly had
checked this week's shifts arrangements. Hailing a taxi they
said they would leave me home as they didn't want `something
terrible' to happen to me.

```Chris' then showed me an envelope full of bank notes, but
I refused to take it. As they got out of the taxi `Chris'
threw a =A320 note, laughing, saying they would `at least pay
the taxi for now'. I told the driver to head on and stopped
when they were out of sight. Even though the fare was only a
couple of pounds I gave the driver the =A320 and asked him for
a receipt, which he signed. I then took myself off, phoned
my employer and asked for a few days holiday. I am very
frightened.''

=46rancie Molloy called to the young man's father's house in
Tyrone that same night and talked with the British agent's
victim by phone, assuring him that he had notified human
rights lawyer, Gareth Peirce and an Irish-based lawyer
familiar with similar threats and approaches. Molloy has
also given him a contact number in London where he can be
reached during Molloy's visit to London this week.

``This is a disturbing case,'' explained Molloy. ``Over the
past number of weeks other victims have come forward but
requested no publicity. Worringly these approaches have
increased from the murder of Diarmuid O'Neill on 23
September. It is clearly a signal from MI5 and other covert
agencies that they are intent on targeting the Irish
community in England. What other shattered lives are they
leaving by these heavy-handed oppressive tactics? I would
appeal for anyone caught in a similar trap to contact a
lawyer, or public representative to document their
activities. Not to do so entails a life of manipulation and
misery at the hands of a government dismissive of people's
human rights.''

The only thing that dim-witted comments such as the one above will accomplish
is that you will be placed on "nopost" as well as "nomail"; which means that
you've become a "non-person" as far as the list is concerned!

Once again: your names and addresses are secure because the whole list is
set to "review-by-owner", which means that no one can get your name! Try it
and test it!

Once again: Subscription confirmation is a mechanism by LISTSERV by which
the list is kept free from error addresses and bogus names...to some extent.

Once again: with my comments I simply tried to make sure that you don't miss
the subscription confirmation notice from listserv because LISTSERV will
delete your name if you don't confirm! AFTER YOU'VE BEEN NOTIFIED!
I intended this to be a service to you! Listserv will do this for all our
benefit every three months!

Once again: if you have questions, please contact ME - not the list.

Once again: if you post crap on this list, you'll do it only once!

My apologies to the vast majority of the list members that have to read and
deal with this sort of thing.

Not quite sure what you mean by "intelligence cycle".  But the oldest texts
making reference to Intelligence (spying) would be texts from Sun Tzu and
Wei Liao-Tzu, two chinese warfare strategests that ripped mystism from
chinese warfare strategy.

"Those unguarded in their communications can be clandestinly listed to."
--Wei Liao-Tzu

Something like the 3rd B.C.

I'll have to check.

Suspected Nuclear-Dealer Attended Clinton Fund-Raiser

By Christopher Ruddy>
FOR THE TRIBUNE-REVIEW  10/30/96

WASHINGTON - Why did President Bill Clinton meet with Grigori
Loutchansky, a man whose company the current CIA director has
told Congress is "an organization associated with Russian
criminal activity"?

That question has a number of national security experts who
are concerned about Loutchansky and NORDEX - an international
company which has been linked to the smuggling of nuclear
materials - wondering. In October of 1993, Loutchansky was
invited to the U.S. to attend a private fund-raising dinner
for the Democratic National Committee where Loutchansky met
with the President. The meeting was memorialized in the
Latvian newspaper SM Today on Nov. 12, 1993.

In 1995, though Loutchansky was still a priority concern for
U.S. intelligence, he was again invited by the DNC to attend
another fund-raising dinner with the president. Disclosures
about Loutchansky come on the heels of questions about dealings
the president and the DNC have had with businessmen from
Indonesia, South Korea and Taiwan. Earlier this month,
Republicans sharply criticized the president for meeting with
a Miami drug dealer after he had made a $20,000 donation to
Democratic coffers.

NORDEX CONNECTIONS

TIME magazine, in an expose on Loutchansky only three months
ago, reported that NORDEX, based in Vienna and Moscow, has been
"one of the top intelligence targets in the West". Since NORDEX
was formed in 1989 to trade Russian commodities and natural
resources with the West, allegations have surfaced that the firm
has been involved in money laundering, narcotics trafficking,
arms deals, and other Russian Mafia criminal activities.
Loutchansky, a former professor and Latvian university official
who once served a two-year term in prison for embezzlement, has
not been charged with any crimes in Russia or elsewhere since
he founded NORDEX.

According to a secret German intelligence report, NORDEX was
created by the old Soviet regime "with the aim of bringing
foreign currency accumulated by the KGB and top Communist Party
officials into the West," as well as a means to continue earning
hard currency for Russian intelligence organizations. Domestic
intelligence sources believe numerous such companies were created
for that purpose, but NORDEX, with its $3 billion in annual
business, appears to be the largest such concern operating in
the West.

NORDEX also may be the most dangerous. In the spring of 1995,
Ukrainian officials in Kiev inspected a NORDEX-owned cargo plane
that had emanated in North Korea and was destined for Iraq. The
aircraft was carrying SCUD missile warheads.

Suspicions, too, have been raised about nuclear smuggling to
rogue states like Iran, Iraq and North Korea. According to TIME,
in the past three years the National Security Agency has
"found indications" that NORDEX has been "engaged" on the black
market with nuclear materials. Christopher Story, editor of
the London-based Soviet Analyst - the one-time British Foreign
office newsletter on Russian matters - told the Tribune-Review
that sources in British intelligence believe NORDEX is "a rapidly
proliferating amoeba or cancer, constantly replicating and
mutating into a network of business fronts engaged in enterprises
ultimately controlled by Russian intelligence." NORDEX controls
more than 100 Russian firms and has more than three dozen businesses
in the West.

SECOND INVITATION

In an unpublished, extensive interview with TIME magazine, excerpts
of which the Tribune-Review has obtained, Loutchansky explained
how he ended up meeting with Clinton: "I was invited by a friend
of mine - Sam Domb - he was a trustee (sic) of the Democratic
National Committee - to take part in a dinner which was given by
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore and 20 Senators ... in October 1993.
It was in Washington in some museum. ... I was invited as an
outstanding Jewish businessman."

Loutchansky went on to say he spoke privately with the president
for about two minutes, discussing the "problems of nuclear missiles
in the Ukraine." Loutchansky also told the Jerusalem Report he
"agreed to a request from the president to deliver a private message
to the leader of the Ukraine." New York businessman Sam Domb told
the Tribune-Review he has no idea who Loutchansky was, and had never
met him before the dinner. Domb, apparently agitated by the call,
had no explanation as to why he was photographed with Loutchansky
and Clinton, or why he was previously quoted extensively in a
Russian emigre newspaper praising Loutchansky.

According to Federal Election Commission records, in the months
immediately following the October, 1993, Washington dinner, Domb
donated $90,000 to the DNC. In the past three years he has forked
over $155,000 to the committee. Loutchansky has stated he never
donated any money to the Democratic Party or the Clinton-Gore
campaign. Federal law prohibits donations by foreign individuals
or companies to political candidates or parties. Sometimes
foreigners try to skirt the law by having American citizens make
donations on their behalf. There is no evidence that has occurred
here. But Loutchansky has a track record in Russia and elsewhere
of showering officials with money and gifts for favors and access.
For instance TIME located a dummy Swiss company owned by NORDEX
called Dorotel AG which, according to a NORDEX official, was nothing
more than a bank account "used to make discreet payments for
friends of NORDEX. ..."

Calls to the Democratic National Committee for comment as to why
Loutchansky was invited to a fund-raising dinner for the president,
and why Loutchansky, according to a source familiar with the case,
received a letter from the president thanking him for his support,
went unreturned. Also unexplained is the invitation Loutchansky
received just last year from the Democratic National Committee for
a VIP dinner with Clinton. "Dear Mr. Loutchansky," wrote DNC finance
director Richard Sullivan, "I cordially invite you to have dinner
with President Clinton on Tuesday, July 11, 1995, at the Hay Adams
Hotel in Washington, D.C."

Loutchansky told the Jerusalem Report he did not go to that event
because he feared U.S. officials would not allow him to enter the
country. Already Loutchansky has been barred from Britain and Canada.
Soviet Analyst editor Story suggested Loutchansky's meeting and
invitations to see Clinton were "nothing short of scandal." "It's
preposterous to believe Loutchansky came once to meet the president,
and was invited again without giving some benefit, or receiving
some in kind," Story said.

Who knows?  I guess there always might be some nefarious conspriatorial
reason.  But my first guess would be this: sloppy staff work, in the way
that Reagan's Bitburg visit turned into a fiasco, and numerous other gaffs
and faux pas have been made.  Given that there was already, according to
the article, an investigation going on concerning this fellow, and
information about him in the press, I can't imagine anyone associating
him/herself with such a person, _especially_ if there were something
conspiratorial going on.

More likely is the fact that this guy's name registered on a who's who
list of possible contributors in his particular ethnic community, and the
GS-9 or whatever special assistant (and there are LOTS of them), or maybe
even an intern, put him on the list, which then went up the food chain to
the higher reaches of the admin part of the Adminsitration where someone
with some actual authority who has about 5,678 things to do glances at it
for 5 seconds and says "yeah that's fine."

Of course, I could be wrong . . .<g>

Let's do a little thought experiment.

Let's imagine that in France, Russia or some other
major nation, someone is seeking the job of chief
analyst of American politics. This person is given this
news story, and asked to produce a report on its
significance, using all the latest information
technology and best relevant data.

Would the analysis that the contact was probably a
bureaucratic SNAFU without any larger political
significance get the analyst the job?

I don't know. This is just a question to produce a
thought or two.

I have no opinions about the news story other than to
notice that it is possibly interesting, and that the
facts should be filed away for future reference and
cross-referencing. The issues to which the facts
pertain are highly strategic.

I think your last sentence hits it on the head.  The "new" nuclear
problems out of the old USSR have indeed gotten short shrift.  In fact,
last year there was a bit of a "scandal" regarding Germany's BND and what
may have been a setup to "sting" such people as Loutchansky might be.  The
main significance is that there is clearly a market for this, and when you
combine it with what I think David Huff was pointing out in his earlier
post on "mini-nukes" it does serve to lower one's comfort level.

Nothing so far.  The web seems a little slow at this time (64bytes per

One source is

        http://www.fas.org/irp/cia/guerilla.htm

And as I never tire of reminding folks, just about everything of an official
procedural nature that is online is online @

        http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/

I just searched our site for <interrogation> and found lotsa publications
that mentioned this issue.

I would say in passing, however, that the USG, despite its manifold
shortcomings, is not normally in the habit of encouraging such strong
methods, so you might come up a bit short in your search.

No doubt you are referring to the manuals that were found at the School of
the Americas.  The offending parts (which you are evidently interested in)
were allegedly never part of the curriculum.  The Washington Post did an
expose of this issue several weeks ago.  I believe that the chapters on
these subjects were redacted in 1990, but that some of the manuals not
destined for use in the school evidently wound up there and, subsequently,
in the press.  You may wish to check the Post's web site and see if they
have made this article aprt of their pages.

   A check of CIABASE files produces a lengthy list of

I have been thinking about this matter myself quite a bit.  How do we
prevent the actions of cell-groups operating from secure bases in
countries unfriendly to us?  Much of the problem is generated by the
media; airwaves are the resources for which these organizations are
fighting.  They want to produce horror-reactions in US citizens that
will further their political goals.  I also think a lot of it is Islamic
cultural macho: beaten but unbowed.  And we can't just cover up the
terrorist actions; how does one "cover up" a bomb downing a jet carrying
three hundred people?

Could the answer be neutralization of the information, a la G.G. Liddy?
If we desensitise the audience to the effects of the terrorist actions,
the actions will hold no power.  Instead of showing photos of
incinerated children, we mention the incident (briefly, without
sensationalism) on the news, and move on with our lives.

This is a country nearing a population of three hundred million.  We
obviously can't just sit idly back while "terrorist nations" bomb our
airlines, but we can't have our media blowing things out of proportion.
A three-hundred person airline downed is on the level of a few large
apartment fires; apartment fires don't make the national news, even if
they are set by arson.

The real problem arises when one of our enemies releases a large amount
of a nerve agent (say TABUN or sarin) in a mist over New York.  Or, far
worse, a genetically engineered biological agent, like one of those
bleeder viruses we keep hearing about.  How do we stop a nation from
producing the kind of thing that can be made in a well-equipped
basement?  Use of this kind of agent is obviously an act of war, and,
while horrific, we do know how to retaliate to that kind of thing.  We
have done so before.

Since we can't answer small package bombs with widespread chemical
attacks, perhaps the answer is to retaliate in kind, or tenfold.  For
each airliner bombed and claimed by a terrorist organization, we throw
ten cruise missiles into urban areas, some with leaflets, others live.
We use our technology to counter propaganda in these nations, and
replace it with UNBIASED news.  This way, the US begins to be seen as a
purveyor of truth, though we are of course only doing it because it
serves our purposes.

As for intelligence: satellite footage and computer-assisted information
gathering leverage our greater technological capability.  Another idea
might be to simply stop training people to be our future enemies.  In
this age of computerization, technical knowledge is true power.  We are
training Iraqi and Iranian computer science (and microbiology) students
in our universities on student visas. Then, they return to their
countries of origin and get jobs in the war machine.  This is a kind of
braindrain that we don't want.  Perhaps we could create a stipulation on
our student visas that the students must stay in this country for ten
years after the degree is complete.  In that time, they could be
contacted by our intelligence agencies and offered the chance to work
for the US once they return to their countries of origin.

Another idea is proactive strikes on known terrorist training camps
using antipersonnel cruisemissiles.  The terrorist countries are, once
again, disadvantaged or developing nations; they wouldn't be engaging in
this kind of sub-guerrilla warfare if they weren't.  They spend a great
deal of money training people to do things like make explosives.  If we
kill enough of the terrorists, trainers and students alike, it will make
it difficult for them to make war.

Finally, and more peacefully, we should give these nations a diplomatic
"out."  If we are seen as always supporting their enemies, as producing
propaganda against them, as constantly running blockades and embargoes,
what recourse do we leave them other than to make what feeble gestures
they can?  These nations are tiny and weak, struggling to keep afloat
and losing the battle.  Negotiations and diplomacy; killing with
American kindness and commercialism.  Make them dependent on our aid,
our chipped weapon systems and our electronic entertainment (mind
control, mind virus) devices, and they'll come to us like lambs.

On Tue, 5 Nov 1996, Jason Thomas wrote about his feelings concerning the
prevention of terrorism.  I believe that several  points need to be
added to this.

Firstly, there is a great overemphasis on problems relating
to Islamic Terrorism.   This is just one part of the larger whole.  The
danger is far more likely to come from Militia Groups, Animal Rights or
Anti-Abortion Campaigners.  These people have already killed far more
people in America than the above groups witness Okalahoma.  Even outside
the US where you suffer most of your casualties targeting may be by
Columbian guerillas, Kashmiri separatists, etc.

Second, on the point about that `Much of the problem is generated by the
 media' does that included groups like ours transmitting messages from
the Irish Republican Army.


 Third you say 'For each airliner bombed and claimed by a terrorist
organization, we throw
ten cruise missiles into urban areas'.   This is just  to simplistic you are
fighting groups not
countries.  Should Britain bomb Boston for given the support to NORAID.  Syria
used to be
targeted as a prime supporter of terrorism but since the Gulf War she is now
seen as a friend.
Lybia on the other hand still has sanctions imposed upon her yet the
responsibility for the Pan
Am bomb appears to lie with groups `possibly' supported by Syria.  Dropping
bombs on
people only encourages more terrorism by people who may have liked you before.

Fourth: `Perhaps we could create a stipulation on our student visas that the
students must stay
in this country for ten years after the degree is complete.  In that time, they
could be contacted
by our intelligence agencies and offered the chance to work for the US once they
return to
their countries of origin'. - I am sure the CIA is not so inefficient that for
the 3/4 year they are
 in you country they are not already approached.  What about by 'adopting' these
students in
the period they are in the country and showing them what a great place it is and
how nice the
American people are.

Lastly: 'Another idea is proactive strikes on known terrorist training camps
using antipersonnel cruisemissiles'.  - What is an antipersonnel cruise missile.
Is this some
great new development that we have not been told about where the missile
destroys people
but not buildings.

The simple answer is that there are now simple answers as I am afraid Britain
has found for
the twenty plus years she has been involved in the troubles.

I am reporting:

Translation of the report of the Deputy Chief of  the  General  Staff,
Vietnamese  People's Army, General-Lieutenant Chan Van Kuang (Tran Van
Quang), at the Politiburo session, Tsk PTV (Central Committee  of  the
workers' Party of Vietnam), 15 September 1972.

This  report  outlines the measures which are being carried out by the
leadership of the  Democratic  Republic  of  Vietnam  (DRV)  in  South
Vietnam  to  develop  opportunities  for  cooperation with and for the
recruitment of representatives of the Saigon government  and  army  to
the  side  of  the  Patriots.  With  this  in mind, contacts have been
established and meetings conducted with several civilian and  military
leaders,  to  include  generals  Ngo Din' Dzu (Commander, 2nd regional
Corps), Nguen Khan and Zyong Van Min' (former  leader  of  the  Saigon
administration),  Khoang  Suan  Lam  (former  Commander,  1st Regional
Corps) and others.

According to the speaker, during these meetings many of  the  generals
have  spoken  against  the  Tkhieu (Thieu) regime and against the U.S.
policy of "Vietnamization", have acknowledged the major  victories  of
the  Patriotic  forces  and  also  agreed  to  be  part  of the future
coalition government for South Vietnam. The leadership of the  DRV  is
convinced  that even though they have anticommunist views, such people
will be able to greatly assist the Patriots in overthrowing the  Thieu
dictatorship and in forming a coalition government.

Tran Van Quang has presented the contents of the plan "Ba Be" which is
planned  for  execution  in  South  Vietnam.  This  plan envisions the
resolution of a number of tasks, the principle one  of  which  is  the
physical  extermination  of  the  reactionary  leaders  of  the Saigon
administration who have harshly criticized DRV policy.

The development of plan "Ba Be" was  undertaken  jointly  by  the  DRV
Ministry  of  National  Defense  along  with  the  Ministry  of  State
Security. They were assinged responsibility for the  magament  of  its
execution.

It  was  noted  that  preparation  for  execution  of "Ba Be" is going
successfully. Up until the middle  of  September  of  this  year,  406
people,  who  have  recieved  special  training  and  know  the  local
conditions well, have been sent from the DRV to south  Vietnam.  These
people  were  also  assigned  the  task  of  carrying  out  operations
according to plan  "Ba  Be".  The  insertion  into  South  Vietnam  of
specially  trained  agents  is  scheduled for completion by the end of
September.

The report states that conduct of operations in accordance  with  plan
"Ba  Be" is scheduled for October of this year. It is assumed that its
successful execution will assist  in  the  realization  of  plans  for
combat  operations  to  a  significant  degree  and  will  lead to the
development  of  an  improved  situation  in  South  Vietnam  for  the
Patriots.  In  addition,  substantial influence will be exerted on the
negotiations in Paris.

Tran Van Quang explained the American POW issue in detail.  The  total
number  of American POWs captured in combat actions and who are now in
the DRV consists of 1205, of which 671 were taken  prisoner  in  North
Vietnam, 426 in South Vietnam, 43 in Laos and 65 in Cambodia.

There  are  767  aviators among the prisoners, 3 of which went through
training for space flights, and 15 of which have more than 4000 flight
hours each.

All of the American POWs are held in  11  prisons  and  were  assigned
according  to  military  rank  (there  are 16 colonels, 104 lieutenant
colonels, 235 majors and the remaining prisoners are of lower rank).

It was noted that during the interrogations of the prisoners, the  NVA
command  succeeded  in collecting valuable information on the US Armed
Forces on combat equipment and various types  of  weaponry,  including
chemical   weapons,   which   provides   the  opportunity  to  develop
countermeasures against the enemy.

According to the speaker, the US government does not know the  precise
number of POWs in the DRV since the NVA command holds this information
in strict secrecy. Up until now, a list of only 368 prisoners has been
published officially. There are indications that the leadership of the
DRV  considers  the  issue of releasing American POWs as a part of the
whole Vietnamese problem and can be settled only after the  resolution
of the political and military issues.

              (translation from Vietnamese into Russian)

                              Moscow - 1972

Dear Comrades: I reported to you earlier about the situation which has
developed,  about the fundamental characteristics of the past stage of
our people's conflict against American imperilists. I  will  dwell  on
the  main  tasks of the people and the army of North and South Vietnam
which were proposed by the 23rd Plenum of the Tsk PTV.

These tasks once again confirm our  resoluteness  to  attain  victory.
This   a  very  correct  course  for  our  party  and  people  in  the
contemporary stage of conflict. We have already  worked  out  measures
for  the  realizing  the resolutions of the 23rd Plenum of the TsK. We
will also  dwell  on  a  number  of  the  Supreme  Command's  and  the
Government  Defense Council's positions, in which an evaluation of our
victories gained over the period from 30 Mar  72  to  the  present  is
given.

The military situation for us is developing favorably on all fronts. A
number  of profound changes which took place in the military situation
demanded that we develpo a necessary point of  view  for  solving  all
issues  which comes up during the war. Several meetings between us and
the US aimed at developing measures of  resolving  the  Vietnam  issue
have already taken place.

We  have  decisively  rejected  a number of proposals put forth by the
American side. With assistance  from  a  number  of  countries,  there
should have been secret meetings in Paris and in other places aimed at
drawing  up a solution to the Vietnam issue. Such meetings took place.
They once again testified to the deranged nature of the proposals  put
forth  by  the  American  side.  As previously, we have maintained our
position, the essence of which includes the following: if the US truly
wants to resolve the Vietnam issue, then above all else it must refuse
to support the Nguyen Van Thieu regime, and only  afterwards  will  we
engage  in  a  discussion  about a cease fire. This demand is the main
tenet in our conflict against the American imperialists.

If Nixon continues adhering to his policy of "Vietnamization"  of  the
war  and  desires  to  leave the present Saigon Government of Thieu in
power, then the peace negotiations between us  and  the  US  will  not
yeild any results.

During  our general offensive on the fronts of South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia, the progress which we  have  attained  in  implementing  our
strategic  and  tactical  line  (direction,  orientation)  was clearly
evident.

I earlier analyzed the activity of our command, elucidated  the  great
victories  we  have attained and I also explained the shortcomings and
mistakes that we made during the general  offensive.  The  lessons  we
learned  from  analyzing  the  mistakes we made were also discussed. I
stated all of this to the Politiburo in order to work out a  direction
for solving the fundamental priciple problems.

Today  I  will  report  a  number of positions regarding expanding the
scope of our future offensive.

We organized meetings with South Vietnamese representatives  aimed  at
preparing  a  solution  of the military and political in South Vietnam
according to the Politiburo's and State  Defense  Council's  plan,  we
organized  meetings  with  South  Vietnamese  representatives  . These
meetings have great  significance  for  us,  and  we  are  affiliating
several  of  our plans with them [South Vietnamese representatives]. A
number of our comrades have met  with  representatives  of  the  South
Vietnamese  authorities,  and it can be said that we have succeeded in
winning their sympathy at these meetings. We  were  able  to  exchange
ideas  not only orally, but also in written form during these meetings
and  contacts.  This  gave  us  the  opportunity  to   draw   definate
conclusions.  Recently,  we  have  conducted  8  similar meetings with
representatives  of  the  Saigon  authorities  and  South   Vietnamese
political figures.

First, we will dwell on meetings with General Ngo Dinh Dzu.(1) Earlier
Ngo  Dinh Dzu was listed as a candidate for president of South Vietnam
and battled with Nguen Van Thieu and Nguen Kao Ki for this  post.  Ngo
Dinh  Dzu  is  a  prominent  Sout Vietnamese capitolist and well known
political figure. He occupied  the  post  of  chairman  of  the  upper
chamber  of  the  Saigon  Parliment  and  during  the  Ngo  Dinh  Diem
government, he was a senator in the upper chamber. Ngo  Dinh  Dzu,  in
his  own  opinion, is a nationalist. He speaks against American troops
on  South  Vietnamese  territory,  and  also  against  several  policy
positions conducted by the Saigon authorities. AT the same time, he is
characterized  as a reactionary, an enemy of communism. Afterwards, as
Ki and Thieu attained  victory  in  the  presidential  elections,  the
latter undertook all measures to take revenge on General Dzu. Dzu used
the  pre-electioncampaign  to  criticize  the  Saigon  regime  and  to
undermine its security. He spoke  against  American  troops  on  South
Vietnamese  territory,  for  which  he was subjected to bitter attacks
from Nguen Van Thieu. General Dzu was forced to  leave  the  political
arena  after  9  months under pressure from Thieu. Afterwards, General
Dzu became an even greater enemy  of  the  Nguen  Van  Thieu  and  his
government. This why we tried to attract this person to our side.

(1)  Commander  of  the  2nd  Regional Corps of South Vietnam, General
Lieutenant (GRU's note).

Despite General Dzu remaining an enemy  of  communism,  his  relations
with  Nguen  Van Thieu and the present Saigon alignments, and also our
meetings with him have allowed him to see the nature of the  Americans
and the present face of the Saigon government.

We  sent  one  of  our comrades from the Supreme Command to Saigon for
meetings with General Dzu. At  the  meeting,  which  lasted  3  hours,
General  Dzu  agreed  to  enter into a future coalition government and
spoke out against the policy of "Vietnamization" of  the  war  carried
out  by Nixon and also against the Nguen Van Thieu clique. During this
meeting he also stated that he will fight against  Nguen  Van  Thieu's
clique and Nixon's present designs.

Now,  we  see well how significant changes have taken place in General
Dzu's life and way of thinking. He is  already  not  the  same  ardent
anticommunist.  In  his  views, now prevail those features such as the
conflict against Nixon's policy of "Vietnamization"  of  the  war  and
against  Nguen Van Thieu's clique which he considers as fascist and as
expressing the interests of the financial oligarchy which  is  against
freedom  and  independence.  And,  finally,  General  Dzu  is  for the
expansion of democracy and freedom over the entire territory of  South
Vietnam.  These  are  the  main  national traits of General Dzu, which
correspond to our present course. This is whay we  are  attempting  to
attract  General  Dzu to our side and why we entered into contact with
him. After the first meeting, there were recently three other meetings
during  which  he  spoke  his  opinions.  During  these  meetings,  we
understood  what  kind  of  major  changes  took  place  in his way of
thinking and in the position he has  taken  and  in  his  approach  to
solving the problem.

Thus,  we  can ascertain that these meetings and contacts with General
Dzu had very good results. Recentyl, General  Dzu  requested  to  meet
with  one  of  the  prominent  leaders of the NFO [National Liberation
Front] of South Vietnam. We are now busy preparing  for  the  upcoming
meeting  between General Dzu and Khyuin' Tan Fat. This meeting will be
conducted secretly in order to insure  the  fulfillment  of  our  main
principles  because  we  understand  that  this  new  person expresses
contradictions - he is amog  those  in  the  Saigon  government  whose
number is growing every day.

The  second  person  is  Nguen  Khan'  who  earlier occupied the prime
minister post for three years after the overthrow of  Ngo  Din'  Diem.
Nguen  Khan' is a representative of the army. Earlier he served in the
French Army; now he is a prominent  South  Vietnamesecapitolist  whose
capitol  is  invested  in  various  foreign enterprises, especially in
France, Nguen Khan' is a representative of the new trend. This is  why
we  have  entered  into contact with him. These contacts took place in
Paris, where we have conducted 5 meetings.

Nguen Khan' maintains constant contact with military  circles  in  the
Nguen Van Thieu government. After being removed from his post, he left
the  country,  but  periodically returns to Saigon where he engages in
political activities in the capacity of an emigree representative.

In summarizing the five  meetings,  we  noticed  in  Nguen  Kkhan  the
following: first, as regards the ruling faction he believes that Nguen
Van Thieu is a dictator and a fascist who is not capable of being head
of the government. Khan' considers the present government to be rotten
to  the  core;  second,  he  is  against the bombing of North Vietnam;
third, while criticizing  the  Nguen  Van  Thieu  faction,  he  speaks
against  the  participation  of  Saigon  troops  in  combat actions on
Cambodia territory. He believes that the threat of disintergration has
arisen over the Saigon ARmy,  that  it  has  poor  morale  and  combat
spirit.  Nguen  Khan' speaks for the establishment of a new government
which would have authority with the people which  would  carry  out  a
nationalist  policy,  while recieving foreign aid. These are the views
of Nguen Khan'. He says nothing about his feelings toward  the  policy
of  "Vietnamization"  of the war. This explained, first of all, by his
connections with military circles. Therefore, we are not  striving  to
directly   attract   him  to  our  side.  Presently,  Nguen  Khan'  is
maintaining connections with the current Saigon generals.

The third person is Zyong Van Min', who also represents  the  military
circles.  Previously,  he occupied the prime minister post after Nguen
Khan', and was sent out of the country as an ambassador. The political
views of Zyong Van Min' differ  from  the  political  views  of  Nguen
Khan'.  This  is  first  expressed Zyong Van Min' speaking out against
Nixon's policy of "Vietnamization" and for  the  independent  solution
internal  problems  by  the  Vietnamese  without  US  interference. He
believes that the US should carry responsibility for drawing  out  the
Vietnamese  War  and  for its consequences. He subjects the Vietnamese
policy of Nixon to sharp critisism, and also the policy carried out by
the current Saigon government. These are very good political views. He
speaks against Thieu's  clique,  considering  it  to  be  pre-fascist,
anti-democratic  and  not  capable  of carrying the leadershipo of the
country. These are the main political views of Zyong Van Min'.

As a result of these contacts with Zyong Van Min', we have attained an
important victory, forcing him to reflect. He also met with Nguen Tkhi
Bin' several times in Paris. At these meetings, Zyong  Van  Min'  felt
that  he  as  before  was  close  to  the  Fatherland  and  that he is
Vietnamese. This is why he began to conduct this great  work  with  us
and  with  the  intelligentsia and military circles located outside of
the country, with the aim of entering into a coalition government  and
in the hope of solving the Vietnamese issue on the basis of conducting
consultations  and negotiations between the various political factions
of South Vietnam. This is Zyong Van Min's desire.

The fourth person is the former emporor  Bao  Daj.  At  one  time  the
possibility  exsisted  that  the former emporor would have been behind
us. But, under pressure from reactionary  factions  after  the  August
revolution,  he  was  forced to emigrate to France. As before, Bao Daj
holds great influence amongst the political figures in  the  Kyang-Chu
and  Tkxya-Tkxien Provinces, and also in the city of Gyeh, the ancient
capitol of Vietnam. This why we moved to make contact with Bao Daj. We
are not hoping that Bao Daj becomes part of the coalition  government,
but  to  attract  him  to our side is to attract his supporters in the
regions where he has influence. As a result of the meetings conducted,
we clarified that Bao Daj  will  come  out  against  the  presence  of
American troops in the territory of South Vietnam, and also critisizes
Nguen Van Thieu's exsisting regime. Bao Daj is also calling for all of
the  political  factions  to  create  a  free,  neutral,  peace-loving
government that would resolve the tense situation that has taken  form
in  the country. This is whay we entered into contact with Bao Daj and
are trying to attract him to our side. We hope that he, in turn,  will
work  with his people in a plan for securing peace and freedom for our
country.

The fifth person is General Nguen Van Vi who earlier occupied the post
of Minister of Defense of South Vietnam. Tkhieu removed him  from  the
post  for disorder and chaos in the army's financial affairs. The real
reason, however, for Nguen Van  Vi's  retirement  was  the  series  of
serious  defeats  that  the  puppet  army has suffered. From Nguen Van
Tkhieu's viewpoint, the military circles responded to this  move  with
specific  reaction.  We  also  had  contacts with General Nguen Van Vi
which allowed us to understand his political position. He thinks  that
the  US  will  certainly  suffer  defeat in this war and that a war in
Vietnam is not the responsibility of the American Army.  This  is  why
Nguen  Van  Vi  is  also  coming  out  for the creation of a coalition
government in order to resolve  the  Vietnam  issue  through  peaceful
negotiation between all of the political factions of South Vietnam.

Nguen  Van  Vi  is also coming out against Nixon's "Vietnamization" of
the war. Such are the basic political views of General Nguen  Van  Vi.
We  scored  a  great  victory at the meeting with him; we received his
agreement to take part  in  a  coalition  government  to  resolve  the
Vietnam   issue  through  peaceful  negotiation  between  all  of  the
political factions of South Vietnam.  Nguen  Van  Vi  also  officially
recognized the victories won by the National Liberation Front of South
Vietnam, i.e. our victories.

As  concerns  our  contacts  within  the  South  Vietnamese  governing
apparatus, it is fitting to mention here the letter from Nuguen Kao Ki
addressed to our address. In the letter, he lays out his views on  the
route to a resolution of the Vietnam problem.

I  have  reported to you today on the contact with all of these people
so that you  would  know  how  the  Politburo's  instructions  on  the
recruitment of these people to our side is being carried out.

The  srtong  protest  from  their  side  is  a  result  of a growth of
contradictions within Nguen Van Tkhieu's clique and of  contradictions
of   Nixon's   "Vietnamization:   of   the   war.  We  can  use  these
contradictions to improve the situation in South Vietnam,  to  resolve
the  issue  in  our  favor, and the agreement of these people to enter
into a coalition  government  will  precisely  go  in  our  favor.  In
addition  to  a  resolution  of  the  issue  by  military means on the
battlefields of South  Vietnam,  we  have  engaged  in  contacts  with
several  South  Vietnamese  political figures, who may be able to join
the ranks of a coalition government. As a result of these contacts  we
have  gained  an  understanding of the political views of these people
and have expressed our point of view on ways to  resolve  the  Vietnam
problem.

These  contacts  with  people  who  occupy  high  stations,  prominent
military and political figures, ministers and senators  of  the  upper
and  lower chambers of the saigon parliament give the basis for making
the following conclusions:

1.  They  are  against  the  present  regime  of  Nguen  Van   Tkhieu,
considering   that,   Nguen   Van   Tkhieu's  clique  is  dictatorial,
profascist, rotten and not capable of carrying out the  leadership  of
the country under the situation that has developed in South Vietnam at
the  present. They also think that if the US withdraws its troops from
South Vietnam and  stops  aiding  the  regime,  the  government  would
instantly fall to pieces.

2.  The  majority  of them are against Nixon's "Vietnamization" of the
war, against the broadening of the bombing of North Vietnam, and think
that Nixon does not want to resolve the Vietnam issue or the Indochina
issue as a whole.

3. They consider that  the  National  Liberation  Front  has  recently
scored  enormous victories on the military, political and were able to
win over extensive heavily prpluated regions. They also recongnize the
National Liberation Front's great success with  the  strengthening  of
the army, the increase in its conbat ability and leadership level, the
improvement  in  cooperation  between the branches of service and many
other areas.

In the provinces and in many towns amongst the people who occupy  less
improtant  positions in the state apparatus, we also tried to win over
this catergory of people to our side. It is possible to say that  they
are also ready to ais in the creatioon of a coalition government. They
are  also  against  the  policy of "Vietnamization:, against Nguen Van
Tkhieu's clique and want to resolve the Vietnamese issue on the  basis
of a cessation of war.

Thus,  on  the  orders  of  the  Politbguro  we have been preparing to
conduct meetings with various catergories  of  the  South  Vietnamesse
population,  aimed  at  resolving  the  South Vietnamese issue through
peaceful negotiations between all of the political factions  of  South
Vietnam.  As a result of the contacts that have taken place to recruit
these people to our side, conditions have presented themselves so that
these people will be able to aid us in the  creation  of  a  coalition
government  and  in  the  overthrow  of Nguen Van Tkhieu's dictatorial
regime. We see that we have chosen the correct course.  This  is  also
clearly indicated in the resolutions of the 23rd Plunum of the Central
Committee.

In  other words, we should recruit these people to our side, and bring
them into the coalition government so that we use them to our favor in
the diplomatic and political plan. In order to create a base  for  the
successful   resolution  of  the  issues  that  stand  before  us,  we
epecifically want to bring into the coalition government those  people
who earlier worked in the South Vietnamese state apparatus and held or
are holding at the present a high post in the power structure.

If  we are successful in resolving these issues, we will be concluding
a mammoth case on which we will again report to the Politburo so  that
you  are  well  informed  on  these  issues  and have formed a plan of
acction for mission completion. Thanks to these meetings, we are  able
to  know  who  supports  us and who is against us in South Vietnam. We
have also worked out a  new  plan  for  the  realization  of  our  new
intentions  in South Vietnam and now know which representatives of the
present South Vietnam power apparatus are in favor of the war.

The meetings and contacts  which  we  initiated  were  conducted  with
complete  equality  of rights and helped us recruit representatives of
all strata of South Vietnamese  society  to  our  side.  This  is  our
grandest victory, won in the course of these contactrs with the aim of
resovling the Vietnamese issue.

Thus,  thanks  to  these  contacts  we  understand  which  part of the
popluation considers the course we are taking to be just i.e. we  have
exposed  all  of  those  who  are  against  Nixon's  politics  for the
prolongation of the war. against Nguen Van Tkhieu's  clique  and  will
join with us in the creation of a coalition government.

In addition to the military issues, this is one of the problems we are
trying  to  resolve.  We  are  therefore conducting these meetings and
contacts directed  at  the  resolution  of  political  and  diplomatic
problems.

With  the  goal  of  realizing  these  aims,  the  Supreme Command, in
conjunction with the Governmental Council of  Defense,  has  developed
directives for the army to prepare and conduct the "Ba Be" plan, which
is  scheduled to be executed in October. The "Ba Be" plan provides for
the  resolution  of  a  number  of  problems.  Four  hundred  and  six
individuals  were  sent  to  execute  the plan in South Vietnam. These
individuals had gone through sufficient preparation  and  well  armed.
Earlier  these people worked in the South Vietnam goverment apparatus.
After the August revolution, during the  resistance  war  against  the
French  colonials,  these people were left behind by us to active work
with the enemy and therefore enter into the staff of various organs of
the Saigon government apparatus. Prior to departure for South Vietnam,
we prepared and armen them well for the fulfillment  of  the  "Ba  Be"
plan.

The  basic  tasks of the "Ba Be" are: - elimination of all people: who
are stubborn and oppose our course; who occupy leadership positions in
the realm of the province uezd and above; a full paralyzation  of  the
wills  of  these  people;  -  conduct  of  activities for carrying out
discruption in the Saigon governement apparatus. [installation] of new
people at the  next  shift  of  this  apparatus.  We  are  attentively
observing  the  people who oppose us with our decision with regards to
this group must be very serious and  firm.  This  matter  occupies  an
imprtant place in carrying out the "Ba Be" plan. We must have lists of
these   people  and  full  dossiers  on  them  beforehand  to  conduct
preparatory training in carrying out the plan in order to  quickly  do
away  with  them  and ruin their order; - search and acquire materials
testifying to the crimes of  the  Americans  and  their  puppets  with
regards  to the Vietnamese people, so that during opportune conditions
we may accuse them of the perpetration of these  crimes  by  means  of
publishing the materials.

These  are  the three basic missions of the people for carrying out of
the "Ba Be" plan. As for the time of completion,  general  opinion  is
that  it  will  be  completed  simultanqously  with  Plan T8-6 (Chyong
Shon-6)*, that is, in the month of October. This  plan  must  be  well
carried-out  in order to infulence the course of the Paris Peace talks
on Vietnam and the development of conditions in the near future.  This
is  a very important task, the decision of which may help us carry out
a more successful attack on the front,  the  pace  of  development  of
which  we need to increase in oder to achieve great victories in short
amounts  of  time.  Therefore  the  "Ba  Be"  plan  is  already  being
implemened  and  we  are continuing the trainging of people to realize
it.

(* Plan T8-6 - a military action plan of the VNA in South Vietnam with
a focus on the basic strengths in the Gueh region (GRU note.)

The pace must be increased to realize this plan. We  have  to  quickly
throw  these  people from North to South Vietnam in order to destroy a
large amount of the enemy's  kinetic  energy  from  within.  In  other
words,   the   elimination   of   all   traitors,  reactionaries,  and
counter-revolutionariess, who currently make up a  fairly  significant
portion in South Vietnam is an imprtant task to the "Ba Be" plan.

We must attract the neutral forces to our side; those who are fighting
for  national independense; against the USA; forces who earlier fought
against the regime of Ngo Din' Dhiem and now fight against the  regime
of  Nguen  Van  Tkhieu. We must to do everything necessary in order to
successfully carry out the "Ba Be" plan.

Along with that, we must work for the  demoralization  of  the  puppet
army  on  all fronts. The conduct of such work in good conditions will
bring down the fighting sprit of  the  puppet  army  soldiers  in  the
future,  and  increase  the number of servicemen who cross over to our
side. This is a basic fundamental which helps us to create  conditions
for  revolts  in the puppet army. We were faced with this matter after
the victory in Quang-Chi.

Subject: 1205 Document 2 of 3

Was  ther  actually  a  collective  anti-military uprising in the 56th
puppet regiment? No, in actuality the matter at the front was not like
that.  After being surrounded by us, the upper echolon  of  the  241st
Regimental  command  understood the futility of further resistance and
along with their soldiers, surrendered.  However,  with  the  goal  of
increasing  the  effect  of this work, we revealed that as a result of
the good emplyment of propoganda  work,  there  was  an  anti-military
uprising  the  the  56th regiment. This is the new form of stimulation
anti-military uprisings in the puppet army.

The political views of puppet army officers captain and above are very
reactionary. Previously they  were  officers  or  speak  out  for  the
prvious    Saigon    goverment,    inciting    couter-revolution   and
anti-nationalism, and hating the revolution. Therefore, the conduct of
propaganda among soldiers  and  especially  the  officer  corps  is  a
difficult  and  varied  work,  demanding  study  from  all sides and a
creative approach in the choice of methods and means.

One must be aware of the shining results which we achieved in the past
in the propaganda organization among the High Command staff  right  up
to Saigon Army generals.

We  had  contacts and meetings with a series of officers. For example,
with General Khoang Suan Lam, the former Commander  of  the  1st  Corp
region.  He  was  very  reactionary  man  and  came  out  against  our
revolution. After the defeat at Kuang-Chi Tkhieu dismissed him and  he
contacted  us.  At  the meetings, Khoang Suan Lam told us, if one must
say, a number of his views. In his opinion,  the  Saigon  puppet  army
will  not  be  able  to  carry  out  missions,  led by the plan of the
'vietnamization' of its forces. He  believes  that  the  revolutionary
forces will gain the victory and that the puppet army will not be able
to  stop  it.  The  Tkhieu  regime is a dictatorship, pro-fascist, and
doesn't have the support of the people. These are some  of  the  basic
attitudes spoken by General-Lieutenant Khoang Suan Lam.

As  for the closest person to the Tkhieu regime, General Ngo Din' Dzu,
he expressed, at the meetings arranged between us,  the  opinion  that
even  the  2nd  Corps regions will be lost and that no matter what the
cost, the puppet army will not be able to stand  against  us  in  this
region,  ie: the Taj-Nguen region. In this way, Dzu also expresses the
idea of Khoang Suan Lam. He also said that the puppet army will not be
able to stand against us uf the Americans leave Vietnam. Ngo Din'  Dzu
sees  a  growth  of  rebellion  and  revolution  in  South Vietnam, an
increase in authority for the National Front for the Freedom of  South
Vietnam,  an  increase  in  the  level  of  our strategic and tactical
leadship, and even [an increase] in the level of military action.  Dzu
remembers Nguen Van Tkhieu as a bloody dictator, a fascist, as one who
reated a regime that is absolutely anti-democratic.

In  This  way,  we  see  that these meetings with the generals are our
greatest victory and will aid us. In order to successfully cope with a
resolution of this matter, tied in with the use  of  propaganda  among
the  generals  of the South Vietnamese Army with the goal of awakening
their  conscious  and  attracting  them  to  our  side  necessary   to
understand  that  the  outcome  of  the coming battle depends upon the
solution of these important questions. It is  necessary  to  attain  a
clear  understanding  among  the  generals  of the fact that the Thieu
regime never will employ popular support and cannot  exist.  Such  are
the fundamental questions which we should resolve in the near future.

>From  the utterances of the generals set forth above, we see that the
situation is developing in a direction gavorable to expand the net  of
communicatioons  and  connections  with people who will carry out Plan
"BA BE." The Supreme Command and Ministry of State Security  discussed
all  matters  related  to  successful  implementation of this plan and
levied new tasks upon the commands of the combat zones responsible for
implementation of all regions and now are conducting the final work in
order to complete preparatroy measures for this Plan by September 30th
of this year. In comparison to other plans, the preparatioon  of  Plan
"BA  BE"  is  developing  will.  Such a plan we will formost ring into
being on the  territory  of  South  Vietnam.  In  the  course  of  its
realization  we  will acquire experience which can help us counter the
designs of the enemy at the front.

However more cruel the bombings and barrages of the enemy may  become,
so  much  greater  the victory we should grasp at the front, just such
victories ais realization of Plan "BA BE." With the implementation  of
this  plan we join great hopes; especially in accelerating the pace at
which the offensive at the front develops, of which I reported to  you
above.  The  favorable development of the situation will be a huge and
significant factor in collapse of military desgns of the  USA  and  of
the  puppets  at  the  front  in  South  Vietnam.  We  must thwart the
tickheaded and treacherous plans of the enemy, successful carrying out
of Plan "BA BE" will indeed help us  to  grasp  new  victories.  These
victories  will have great strategic significance in implementation of
Plans T8-6 and 1) Plan S-6, which were topics above.

The goal of Plan "BA BE" is introduction of division into the ranks of
the  enemy  and  lowering  of   his   will   to   resist.   Successful
implementation of Plan "BA BE" will help us to attain successes at the
Paris  negotiations  on  Vietnam.  The closer is victory, so much more
clearly   will    appear    the    treacherous    designs    of    the
Nixon-Kissinger-Laird clique, and likewise of the puppet government of
Nguyen  Van  Thieu.  Therefore  implementation of Plan "BA BE" will be
great step in the resolution of many issues in the current  situation.
Because of this, its significance is so great.

For  successful  realization  of this plan we should as so as possible
deploy our forces, in order to approach implementation of this plan in
the month of October in accordance with indicated deadlines.

In the Paris negotiations on Vietnam we have met in recent days with a
series of difficulites. These difficulites are explained by  the  fact
that Nixon begin stubborn as before and is trying above all to achieve
amilitary  solution of the issu and only then to move to settlement of
political issues, which exercises great influence  on  the  course  of
developement  of the situation in Vietnam. As a result of the exchange
of opions in the private meetings with Nixon's advisor, Kissinger,  we
understood  that  Nixon  as  before  is being stubborn on settling the
situation which is developing today in Vietnam. To  attain  settlement
we  should conduct careful preparation to counter Nixon's designs. Let
him understand: if he does not renounce this war, then  precisely  the
USA  will  suffer  defeat  in  it. However, Nixon is being stubborn in
continuing aggressive war and maintaining the status quo. That is  why
we  think, that with the USA taking such a position, peaceful solution
of the Vietnamese question is  not  possible.  We  see  that  the  USA
obstinately  continues  aggression,  while  Nguyen Van thieu as before
holds to his insolent  position.  That  is  why  we  are  filled  with
resolution to carry out Plan "BA BE," the realization of which will be
a turning point in the settlement of the situation at the front.

This  would  be  our  first  military  thrust  on  the  front aimed at
resolving the complicated political issue at the present stage.  Until
this,  the Supreme Command had never tried woking out a plan simial to
the plan "Ba Be".

Over the course of Six months,  we  prepared  to  execute  this  plan.
During  this  time,  we  gathered everyone who should take part in its
realization, and then conducted a thorough  training  with  them.  The
intelligence  directorate  of the Ministry of National Defence and the
Ministry of State Security conducted the training of these people.  We
well  understand  that  the  better  the  training  of these people is
conducted, the fewer the losses we will carry and the faster  we  will
be able to attain execution of this plan.

Thus,  once  again  evaluating the plan "Ba Be", the thorough training
which is now going on, and which will be  realized  jointly  with  the
plan   T8-6   in   October,   it  can  be  said  that  its  successful
realizationwill assist us to attain new large victories at  the  Paris
negotiations  on  Vietnam. These are very serious issues which we must
devote constant attention to.

Yesterday the State Defense Council directed the  Supreme  Command  to
conduct  a  conference  for  the  cadres  responsible for training and
carrying out his plan.  At  this  conference,  the  forms,  means  and
methods  were  stated,  which were worked out. According to the organs
and confirmed at a Politburo session.

Now we can say that we  have  achieved  great  successes  and  we  are
convinced  that  this  plan  will be realized. Presently, this plan is
being carried out. We have already suceeded in inserting a portion  of
our  comrades  into  South  Vietnamese  territory.  Wee succeeded with
difficulty in certain areas  and  for  this  we  had  to  procure  all
possible  means.  In  other areas, this operation was carried out more
successfully, and now our people are occuping stable positions in  the
puppet governing apparatus.

Dear Comrades! In summing up what is stated above, it can be said that
we  are  going  in  the  right  direction  in  carrying out our plans,
especially the plans T8-6 and "Ba Be", and also in  training  for  the
realization  of  our  plan s-6, the realization of which is stated for
the near future.

In addition to these issues, in accordance with the instructions  from
the  Politburo,  I  will  also  report  to  you today on American POWs
captured on the various fronts of Indochina.

The work with American prisoners of war has  always  been  within  the
field  of  vision  of  the  Politburo  and  has  been reflected in its
decisions, such as decision No. 21 DST Dated 23 Mar 71,  and  decision
No. 21 E dated 4 Apr 72. Both of these decisions concern the issues of
exploiting  these American POW issue. Some of these are correct, other
are not, but even among us  there  are  a  number  of  comrades  whose
opinions differ from the opionion of Politburo. These comrades are not
taking  into consideration the particulars of the developing situation
not the inherent difficulties in their judgements. These opinion  harm
us in our search for methods of resolving the American POW issue.

Dear  comrades! The American POW issue to very complex. The peoples of
the world [world opinion] and the peoples of our  fraternal  socialist
nations [allied popular opinion] as well as North Vietnam. Allow me to
inform  you specifically on this matter. We have captured a very large
number of American POWs on the fronts of Indochina since the time that
the US introduced their troops into Vietnam,  escalated  the  air  war
against   North  Vietnam,  and  expanded  the  total  scope  of  their
appreassion by spreading this aggression onto the territories of  Laos
and  Cambodia. At first, the number of American POWs was not large and
world public opinion paid little attention  to  them.  The  number  of
Americal POWs in North Vietnam grew day by day after 5 Aug 65 when the
US  imperialists started massive air bombing and off-shore bombardment
by the 7th fleet of the territory of North Vietnam, and  after  having
expanded  their  aggression onto the territories of Laos and Cambodia.
The number of American POWs in the DRV has not  been  made  public  to
this  day.  We  have  kept  this  figure  secret. At today's Politburo
session, I will report to you, Comrades, the exact number of  American
POWs.

                           For Official Use Only

The  total  number  of American POWs captured to date on the fronts of
Indochina, ie in North Vietnam,  South  Vietnam,  Laos  and  Cambodia,
comprises  1205  people.  Of  them,  671 people were captured in North
Vietnam and 143 aviators [were captured] in South Vietnam. This  means
the  total  number of aviators, and diversionists (special operations)
(American advisors on diversionary ships and divers), captured on  the
territories  of  North  and  South  Vietnam  comprises  814 people. In
addition, from other categories of American servicemen  in  Indochina,
we  have  captured  391 people, including: 283 in South Vietnam, 65 in
Cambodia and 43 in Laos; 814 and 391 comprises 1205 people.

Here is more data on the 1205 POWs.

We have captured 624 American aviators in North Vietnam, to include  7
colonels,  85  lieutenant colonels, 183 majors, ie the total number of
senior US Air Force and Navy officiers comprises 275 people.  The  624
American  aviators  include  3  astronauts, i.e. three people who have
completed the necessary training for space flight, for  instance,  Jim
Katlo,  who  was  captured  in the vicinity of Hanoi. This figure also
includes 15 US Air Force aces having more than 4000 flight hours each:
Norman Klarvisto, Karmet, Jim Intist Shasht and others.  This  is  the
specific data on American aviators captured in North Vietnam.

Among  the  other 47 prisoners captured in North Vietnam, there are 36
advisors of diversionary detachments who were inserted in  the  border
region   between  the  DRV  and  Laos;  lone  diversionists  who  were
conducting reconnaissance ships;  and  several  seamen  who  abandoned
their  ships  that  were  damaged and whom we picked up. Therefore the
figures 624 and 47 add up to 671.

In South Vietnam we have  captured  143  US  aircrew  members,  mainly
helicopter aviators and some jet aviators.

Among  the  391  American  POWs  captured  in  South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia, we have 9 colonels, 19 lieutenant colonels  and  52  majors.
The  remaining  officers  are  captain  and below, as well as American
enlisted soldiers.

Thus in summary, I want to remind you again  that  the  1205  American
POWs presently in prisons of North Vietnam include:

-624 aviators captured in North Vietnam

-143 aviators captured in South Vietnam

-47 diversionarists and other American servicemen captured in
North Vietnam;

-391  American  servicemen  of  other  categories,  which includes 283
captured in South Vietnam, 65 in Cambodia, and 43 in Laos.

All of them are presently in prisons in North  Vietnam.  Currently  we
have  11 prisons where American POWs are held. We used to have 4 large
prisons, however after the American attempt to free  their  POWs  from
Kha-Tej  (Son  Tay)  we  expanded this number to 11. Each prison holds
approximately 100 POWs.

Seven Air Force colonels captured in North Vietnam and  nine  colonels
of  various  branches  of  service captured in South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia (16 officers in all) are being held together;  through  them,
we  are  attempting  to gain an understanding of the current situation
which has developed in the American Army,  extract  the  material  and
information we need, and determine our position toward them.

We  are  also holding 104 American lieutenant colonels in one location
and are attempting to extract information - secret  information  about
troop   dispositions   and   information  concerning  the  US  Defense
Department from them.

We have 235 majors concentrated in two locations.

Thus we have dedicated special prisons  for  senior  officers  of  the
American  Army:  one for colonels, one for lieutenant colonels and two
for majors. The rest of the POWs, captains and below, were  placed  in
other prisons.

A few words about the political views and attitudes of American POWs.

There are 368 POWs who have progressive attitudes.

They  understand  very  well  that this war is unjust and unpopular on
their part. They condemn the American  administration  and  express  a
strong  protest against this war. We will be able to release these 368
POWs first, if as a result of the struggle of the progressive  peoples
of the world, including the American people, a favorable international
environment will develop, forcing Nixon to move toward a resolution of
the  political  issue. We are carrying out work with this catergory of
POWs to explain to  them  the  aggressive  nature  of  the  war  being
conducted  by  the regime, and also to make them understand the unjust
character of this war which is inflicting great damage on the American
people. One can assert that this group of POWs is progressive in their
political views.

There are 372 of the POWs who hold neutral views, i.e. their political
outlook is not fully progressive, yet not too reactionary. We  plainly
see that they still do not clearly understand the role of the American
administration in unleashing the aggressive war in Indochina.

The remainder of the POWs hold reactionary views. In spite of the work
carried  on to explain to them the real state of things, they have not
changed their reactionary views.

The following is a summation: - - 368 POWs holding  progressive  views
can be released first;

- - 372 POWs hold neutral positions;

- - 465 POWs hold reactionary views.

All  the  POWs  among the senior officers hold reactionary views, i.e.
they do not condmn Nixon, they do not protest his policies,  and  they
distort  our  course of action. We understand that these officers come
from rich families. Their reactionary views are precisely a result  of
this.

We  well understand that the American POW issue has great significance
for the resolution of the South Vietnamese problem. We  must  continue
propagandistic and educational work with the American POWs, leading to
their  understanding  of the nature of the aggressive war which the US
is carrying out in Vietnam, as well as the senseless obstinateness  of
Nixon, which only delays the release of POWs and their return to their
homeland.  Soon  we will free several POWs in order to put pressure on
the Nixon administration, observe this reaction and  the  reaction  of
the  American public, as well as to demonstrate our good intentions in
this matter.

Thus, the 1205 American POWs captured on the fronts of  Indochina  (in
North and South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), presently kept in prisons
in North Vietnam represent a significant force in the American army, a
basic part of which is made up of American aviators.

The  large  number  of American aviators imprisoned during the time of
Johnson and Nixon inflicted huge damage on  the  US  Air  Force.  This
should cause the US government and Nixon himself to reflect. We intend
to resolve the American POW issue in the following manner:

1.  The  US  government must demonstrate compliance, i.e. a cease fire
and the removal of Nguyen Van Thieu, and then  both  sides  can  begin
discussing the matter of returning POWs to the Nixon government.

2.  While the American side is resolving the above-mentioned problems,
we  can  free  several  more  aviators  from  the   number   who   are
progressively  inclined.  Nixon  should not hinder the return of these
aviators to their homeland and not undertake any disciplinary measures
toward them.

3. Nixon must compensate North Vietnam for the great damage  inflicted
on it by this destructive war.

Here  then are the principles on the bases of which we may resolve the
American POW issue. However, Nixon continues to resist  resolving  the
Vietnamesse  question, thereby delaying the resolution of the American
POW issue.

I have reported these specific figures and fundamental aspecrs of  the
American  POW  issue to the Politburo. But we also have these comrades
who do not understand this  problem  correctly.  It  is  necessary  to
resolve  this  issue taking into account settling the military and the
political aspects of the Vietnamese problem. If  we  take  a  path  of
concession toward Americans and release POWs, then we would lose much.
That  is  why  our  point of view on this issue remains the same: this
issue must be resolved on the basis of military and political  aspects
of settlement.

Holding  1205  POWs  creates  certain  difficulties  for  us, but more
importantly, the loss of 1205 POWs, particularly aviators, is a  great
detriment  to the American Army, particularly the US Air Force. At the
same time, we were able  to  collect  data  about  American  weaponry,
tactical/technical  characteristics of aircraft, Air Force directives,
as  well  as  materials  about  to  uncover  US  intentions   in   the
international  arena and on a number of other issues which are related
to war in Indochina.

That is why we are convinced that our position concerning POWs has and
continues to be correct. If we  could  successfully  resolve  the  POW
issue,  then the other issues would not exert any concentrating on the
successful resolution of this problem on the aviators  who  were  shot
down over North Vietnam and American specialist, as well as scientists
in  other  technical  areas.  Their  loss is a major liability for the
American Army, because in  no  other  war  have  there  been  so  many
captured Americans as there are in this war of aggression.

The  1205 American POWs kept in the prisons of North Vietnam present a
large number. For now, we have officially published a list of only 368
POWs. The resst are not acknowledged. The US government  is  aware  of
this,  but  they do not know the exact number of POWs, or they perhaps
only assume an approximate number based on their lossess. Therefore in
accordance with the instructions from the Poliburo, we are keeping the
number of POWs secret.

We are continuing to collect and study materials  from  interrogations
of  POWs  in order to have a basis in specific circumstances to expose
US designs in the Indochina war of aggresstion as  well  as  in  other
matters. Collection and study of these materials has provided us great
assistance  in  studing  the  scientific  discoveries  of  the USA, in
developing methods to cunter contemporary weapons, including chemical,
which have inflicted great harm upon us in this war.

I reported to the Politburo several fundamental  aspectrs  related  to
the  matter  of  American  POWs,  namely: concerning the policy we are
implementing on this matter, I gave the concrete  number  of  American
POWs seized in North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

We  still  have among us Comrades who think: why do we keep these POWs
and not take advantage of the Nixon proposals? Do we  really  want  to
resolve  this matter after all? It needs to be noted that such a point
of view is profoundly mistaken. This is  not  political  horse-trading
but  rather an important condition and serious argument for successful
resolution of the Vietnam problem. That  is  why  the  matter  of  the
American  POWs  has  great significance in exposing Nixon's designs in
this matter and condemn individualistic mistaken views  current  among
us  on  this  matter.  We  firmly  hold  to  our position - - when the
American government resolves the political and military issues on  all
three  fronts  of  Indochina,  we  will set free all American POWs. We
consider this a very correct course.

Dear Comrades!

I have reported the  following  matters  to  Politburo  sessions:  the
course  of  our  party  on  the  general  offensive conducted in South
Vietnam from March 30th to the present; our errors and deficiencies in
the offensive and  summing  up  results  of  the  offensive  in  South
Vietnam,  Laos and Cambodia; positive and negative things taking place
in the course of the offensive; short term plans of the enemy and  our
operations;  analysis  of  errors  permitted in strategic and tactical
leadership; our contacts with political figures of South Vietnam  from
the  Saigon regime; the matter of American POWs, captured on the three
fronts of Indochina.

Today on assignment of the Supreme Command, the State Defense  Council
and  the  Military  Committee  of  the Politburo, I reported to you on
these matters so that the Politburo could stufy these problems,  could
express its opinion on them, and set forth forms and methods for their
resolution. Soon, the State Defense Council, together with the Supreme
Command  will  study matters related to carrying out new operations at
the front. The State Defense Council assigned the Supreme Command, and
later in turn the General Staff, to address  matters  related  to  the
development  of  new  military plans for the year 1973. At the present
time these plans are being worked out with the goal of  preparing  the
necessary  forces  for  their  implementation.  We  are  occupied with
matters of mobilization and traingin  of  reinforcements  for  two  or
three  Indochinese  fronts.  We should mobilize 250,000 men 200,000 of
which would be sent to South Vietnam and 50,000 to Laos and Cambodia.

Summing up this report it is necessary to say that I have  touched  on
the  fundamental  features  of  the  developing  conditions  in  South
Vietnam,  on  our  difficulties  and  successes,  and  also   on   the
difficulties  existing  for  the  enemy.  I  set out our plans and our
course, illuminating also a series  of  matters  which  the  Politburo
assigned  to the State Defese Council and Supreme Command. At the next
Politburo session I shall set forth matters touching upon the  present
sit  necessary  to  understand  that  the outcome of the coming battle
depends  upon  the  solution  of  these  important  questions.  It  is
necessary  to  attain  a clear understanding among the generals of the
fact that the Thieu regime  never  will  employ  popular  support  and
cannot  exist.  Such  are  the  fundamental  questions which we should
resolve in the near future.

>From the utterances of the generals set forth above, we see that  the
situation  is developing in a direction gavorable to expand the net of
communicatioons and connections with people who will  carry  out  Plan
"BA  BE." The Supreme Command and Ministry of State Security discussed
all matters related to successful  implementation  of  this  plan  and
levied new tasks upon the commands of the combat zones responsible for
implementation of all regions and now are conducting the final work in
order to complete preparatroy measures for this Plan by September 30th
of  this  year. In comparison to other plans, the preparatioon of Plan
"BA BE" is developing will. Such a plan  we  will  formost  ring  into
being  on  the  territory  of  South  Vietnam.  In  the  course of its
realization we will acquire experience which can help us  counter  the
designs of the enemy at the front.

However  more cruel the bombings and barrages of the enemy may become,
so much greater the victory we should grasp at the  front,  just  such
victories  ais realization of Plan "BA BE." With the implementation of
this plan we join great hopes; especially in accelerating the pace  at
which  the offensive at the front develops, of which I reported to you
above. The favorable development of the situation will be a  huge  and
significant  factor  in  collapse of military desgns of the USA and of
the puppets at  the  front  in  South  Vietnam.  We  must  thwart  the
tickheaded and treacherous plans of the enemy, successful carrying out
of  Plan  "BA  BE"  will  indeed help us to grasp new victories. These
victories will have great strategic significance in implementation  of
Plans T8-6 and 1) Plan S-6, which were topics above.

(I)  Plan  S-6  -  - Plan for military operations in the Saigon region
(footnote of the GRU)

The goal of Plan "BA BE" is introduction of division into the ranks of
the  enemy  and  lowering  of   his   will   to   resist.   Successful
implementation of Plan "BA BE" will help us to attain successes at the
Paris  negotiations  on  Vietnam.  The closer is victory, so much more
clearly   will    appear    the    treacherous    designs    of    the
Nixon-Kissinger-Laird clique, and likewise of the puppet government of
Nguyen  Van  Thieu.  Therefore  implementation of Plan "BA BE" will be
great step in the resolution of many issues in the current  situation.
Because of this, its significance is so great.

For  successful  realization  of this plan we should as so as possible
deploy our forces, in order to approach implementation of this plan in
the month of October in accordance with indicated deadlines.

In the Paris negotiations on Vietnam we have met in recent days with a
series of difficulites. These difficulites are explained by  the  fact
that Nixon begin stubborn as before and is trying above all to achieve
amilitary  solution of the issu and only then to move to settlement of
political issues, which exercises great influence  on  the  course  of
developement  of the situation in Vietnam. As a result of the exchange
of opions in the private meetings with Nixon's advisor, Kissinger,  we
understood  that  Nixon  as  before  is being stubborn on settling the
situation which is developing today in Vietnam. To  attain  settlement
we  should conduct careful preparation to counter Nixon's designs. Let
him understand: if he does not renounce this war, then  precisely  the
USA  will  suffer  defeat  in  it. However, Nixon is being stubborn in

conducted, the fewer the losses we will carry and the faster  we  will
be able to attain execution of this plan.

Thus,  once  again  evaluating the plan "Ba Be", the thorough training
which is now going on, and which will be  realized  jointly  with  the
plan   T8-6   in   October,   it  can  be  said  that  its  successful
realizationwill assist us to attain new large victories at  the  Paris
negotiations  on  Vietnam. These are very serious issues which we must
devote constant attention to.

Yesterday the State Defense Council directed the  Supreme  Command  to
conduct  a  conference  for  the  cadres  responsible for traingin and
carrying out his plan.  At  this  conference,  the  forms,  means  and
methods  were  stated,  which were worked out. According to the organs

Now we can say that we  have  achieved  great  successes  and  we  are

being carried out. We have already suceeded in inserting a protion  of
our  comrades  into  South  Vietnamese  territory.  We  succeeded with

Dear Comrades! In summing up what is stated above, it can be said that

especially the plans T8-6 and "Ba Be", and also in  training  for  the

In addition to these issues, in accordance with the instructions  from
the  Politburo,  I  will  also  report  to  you today on American POWs
captured on the various fronts of Indochina.

The work with American prisoners of war has  always  been  within  the
field  of  vision  of  the  Politburo  and  has  been reflected in its
decisions, such as decision No. 21 DST Dated 23 Mar 71,  and  decision

Dear  comrades! The American POW issue to very complex. The peoples of
the world [world opinion] and the peoples of our  fraternal  socialist
nations [allied popular opinion] as well as North Vietnam. Allow me to
inform  you specifically on this matter. We have captured a very large
number of American POWs on the fronts of Indochina since the time that
the US introduced their troops into Vietnam,  escalated  the  air  war
against   North  Vietnam,  and  expanded  the  total  scope  of  their

The number of American POWs in the DRV has not  been  made  public  to
this  day.  We  have  kept  this  figure  secret. At today's Politburo
session, I will report to you, Comrades, the exact number of  American
POWs.

The  total  number  of American POWs captured to date on the fronts of
Indochina, ie in North Vietnam,  South  Vietnam,  Laos  and  Cambodia,
comprises  1205  people.  Of  them,  671 people were captured in North
Vietnam and 143 aviators [were captured] in South Vietnam. This  means
the  total  number of aviators, and diversionists (special operations)
(American advisors on diversionary ships and divers), captured on  the
territories  of  North  and  South  Vietnam  comprises  814 people. In
addition, from other categories of American servicemen  in  Indochina,
we  have  captured  391 people, including: 283 in South Vietnam, 65 in
Cambodia and 43 in Laos; 814 and 391 comprises 1205 people.

Here is more data on the 1205 POWs.

We have captured 624 American aviators in North Vietnam, to include  7
colonels,  85  lieutenant colonels, 183 majors, ie the total number of
senior US Air Force and Navy officiers comprises 275 people.  The  624
American  aviators  include  3  astronauts, i.e. three people who have
completed the necessary training for space flight, for  instance,  Jim
Katlo,  who  was  captured  in the vicinity of Hanoi. This figure also
includes 15 US Air Force aces having more than 4000 flight hours each:
Norman Klarvisto, Karmet, Jim Intist Shasht and others.  This  is  the
specific data on American aviators captured in North Vietnam.

Among  the  other 47 prisoners captured in North Vietnam, there are 36
advisors of diversionary detachments who were inserted in  the  border
region   between  the  DRV  and  Laos;  lone  diversionists  who  were
conducting reconnaissance ships;  and  several  seamen  who  abandoned
their  ships  that  were  damaged and whom we picked up. Therefore the
figures 624 and 47 add up to 671.

In South Vietnam we have  captured  143  US  aircrew  members,  mainly
helicopter aviators and some jet aviators.

Among  the  391  American  POWs  captured  in  South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia, we have 9 colonels, 19 lieutenant colonels  and  52  majors.
The  remaining  officers  are  captain  and below, as well as American
enlisted soldiers.

Thus in summary, I want to remind you again  that  the  1205  American
POWs presently in prisons of North Vietnam include:

-624 aviators captured in North Vietnam

-143 aviators captured in South Vietnam

-47  diversionarists  and  other American servicemen captured in North
Vietnam;

-391 American servicemen  of  other  categories,  which  includes  283
captured in South Vietnam, 65 in Cambodia, and 43 in Laos.

All  of  them  are presently in prisons in North Vietnam. Currently we
have 11 prisons where American POWs are held. We used to have 4  large
prisons,  however  after  the American attempt to free their POWs from
Kha-Tej (Son Tay) we expanded this number to  11.  Each  prison  holds
approximately 100 POWs.

Seven  Air  Force colonels captured in North Vietnam and nine colonels
of various branches of service captured in  South  Vietnam,  Laos  and
Cambodia  (16  officers in all) are being held together; through them,
we are attempting to gain an understanding of  the  current  situation
which  has  developed  in  the American Army, extract the material and
information we need, and determine our position toward them.

We are also holding 104 American lieutenant colonels in  one  location
and  are  attempting to extract information - secret information about
troop  dispositions  and  information  concerning   the   US   Defense
Department from them.

We have 235 majors concentrated in two locations.

Thus  we  have  dedicated  special  prisons for senior officers af the
American Army: one for colonels, one for lieutenant colonels  and  two
for  majors.  The rest of the POWs, captains and below, were placed in
other prisons.

A few words about the political views and attitudes of American POWs.

There are 368 POWs who have progressive attitudes.

They understand very well that this war is  unjust  and  unpopular  on
their  part.  They  condemn  the American administration and express a
strong protest against this war. We will be able to release these  368
POWs  first, if as a result of the struggle of the progressive peoples
of the world, including the American people, a favorable international
environment will develop, forcing Nixon to move toward a resolution of
the political issue. We are carrying out work with this  catergory  of
POWs  to  explain  to  them  the  aggressive  nature  of the war being
conducted by the regime, and also to make them understand  the  unjust
character of this war which is inflicting great damage on the American
people. One can assert that this group of POWs is progressive in their
political views.

There are 372 of the POWs who hold neutral views, i.e. their political
outlook  is not fully progressive, yet not too reactionary. We plainly
see that they still do not clearly understand the role of the American
administration in unleashing the aggressive war in Indochina.

The remainder of the POWs hold reactionary views. In spite of the work
carried on to explain to them the real state of things, they have  not
changed their reactionary views.

The following is a summation:

- - 368 POWs holding progressive views can be released first;

- - 372 POWs hold neutral positions;

- - 465 POWs hold reactionary views.

All  the  POWs  among the senior officers hold reactionary views, i.e.
they do not condemn Nixon, they do not protest his policies, and  they
distort  our  course of action. We understand that these officers come
from rich families. Their reactionary views are precisely a result  of
this.

We  well understand that the American POW issue has great significance
for the resolution of the South Vietnamese problem. We  must  continue
propagandistic and educational work with the American POWs, leading to
their  understanding  of the nature of the aggressive war which the US
is carrying out in Vietnam, as well as the senseless obstinateness  of
Nixon, which only delays the release of POWs and their return to their
homeland.  Soon  we will free several POWs in order to put pressure on
the Nixon administration, observe this reaction and  the  reaction  of
the  American public, as well as to demonstrate our good intentions in
this matter.

Thus, the 1205 American POWs captured on the fronts of  Indochina  (in
North and South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), presently kept in prisons
in North Vietnam represent a significant force in the American army, a
basic part of which is made up of American aviators.

The  large  number  of American aviators imprisoned during the time of
Johnson and Nixon inflicted huge damage on  the  US  Air  Force.  This
should cause the US government and Nixon himself to reflect. We intend
to resolve the American POW issue in the following manner:

1.  The  US  government must demonstrate compliance, i.e. a cease fire
and the removal of Nguyen Van Thieu, and then  both  sides  can  begin
discussing the matter of returning POWs to the Nixon government.

2.  While the American side is resolving the above-mentioned problems,
we  can  free  several  more  aviators  from  the   number   who   are
progressively  inclined.  Nixon  should not hinder the return of these
aviators to their homeland and not undertake any disciplinary measures
toward them.

3. Nixon must compensate North Vietnam for the great damage  inflicted
on it by this destructive war.

Here  then are the principles on the bases of which we may resolve the
American POW issue. However, Nixon continues to resist  resolving  the
Vietnamesse  question, thereby delaying the resolution of the American
POW issue.

I have reported these specific figures and fundamental aspects of  the
American  POW  issue to the Politburo. But we also have these comrades
who do not understand this problem correctly. is necessary to  resolve
this issue taking into account settling the military and the political
aspects  of  the  Vietnamese  problem. If we take a path of concession
toward Americans and release POWs, then we would lose  much.  That  is
why  our point of view on this issue remains the same: this issue must
be resolved  on  the  basis  of  military  and  political  aspects  of
settlement.

Holding  1205  POWs  creates  certain  difficulties  for  us, but more
importantly, the loss of 1205 POWs, particularly aviators, is a  great
detriment  to the American Army, particularly the US Air Force. At the
same time, we were able  to  collect  data  about  American  weaponry,
tactical/technical  characteristics of aircraft, Air Force directives,
as  well  as  materials  about  to  uncover  US  intentions   in   the
international  arena and on a number of other issues which are related
to war in Indochina.

That is why we are convinced that our position concerning POWs has and
continues to be correct. If we  could  successfully  resolve  the  POW
issue,  then the other issues would not exert any concentrating on the
successful resolution of this problem on the aviators  who  were  shot
down over North Vietnam and American specialist, as well as scientists
in  other  technical  areas.  Their  loss is a major liability for the
American Army, because in  no  other  war  have  there  been  so  many
captured Americans as there are in this war of aggression.

The  1205 American POWs kept in the prisons of North Vietnam present a
large number. For now, we have officially published a list of only 368
POWs. The resst are not acknowledged. The US government  is  aware  of
this,  but  they do not know the exact number of POWs, or they perhaps
only assume an approximate number based on their lossess. Therefore in
accordance with the instructions from the Poliburo, we are keeping the
number of POWs secret.

We are continuing to collect and study materials  from  interrogations
of  POWs  in order to have a basis in specific circumstances to expose
US designs in the Indochina war of aggresstion as  well  as  in  other
matters. Collection and study of these materials has provided us great
assistance  in  studing  the  scientific  discoveries  of  the USA, in
developing methods to cunter contemporary weapons, including chemical,
which have inflicted great harm upon us in this war.

I reported to the Politburo several fundamental  aspectrs  related  to
the  matter  of  American  POWs,  namely: concerning the policy we are
implementing on this matter, I gave the concrete  number  of  American
POWs seized in North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

We  still  have among us Comrades who think: why do we keep these POWs
and not take advantage of the Nixon proposals? Do we  really  want  to
resolve  this matter after all? It needs to be noted that such a point
of view is profoundly mistaken. This is  not  political  horse-trading
but  rather an important condition and serious argument for successful
resolution of the Vietnam problem. That  is  why  the  matter  of  the
American  POWs  has  great significance in exposing Nixon's designs in
this matter and condemn individualistic mistaken views  current  among
us  on  this  matter.  We  firmly  hold  to  our position - - when the
American government resolves the political and military issues on  all
three  fronts  of  Indochina,  we  will set free all American POWs. We
consider this a very correct course.

Dear Comrades!

I have reported the  following  matters  to  Politburo  sessions:  the
course  of  our  party  on  the  general  offensive conducted in South
Vietnam from March 30th to the present; our errors and deficiencies in
the offensive and  summing  up  results  of  the  offensive  in  South
Vietnam,  Laos and Cambodia; positive and negative things taking place
in the course of the offensive; short term plans of the enemy and  our
operations;  analysis  of  errors  permitted in strategic and tactical
leadership; our contacts with political figures of South Vietnam  from
the  Saigon regime; the matter of American POWs, captured on the three
fronts of Indochina.

Today on assignment of the Supreme Command, the State Defense  Council
and  the  Military  Committee  of  the Politburo, I reported to you on
these matters so that the Politburo could study these problems,  could
express its opinion on them, and set forth forms and methods for their
resolution. Soon, the State Defense Council, together with the Supreme
Command  will  study matters related to carrying out new operations at
the front. The State Defense Council assigned the Supreme Command, and
later in turn the General Staff, to address  matters  related  to  the
development  of  new  military plans for the year 1973. At the present
time these plans are being worked out with the goal of  preparing  the
necessary  forces  for  their  implementation.  We  are  occupied with
matters of mobilization and training  of  reinforcements  for  two  or
three  Indochinese  fronts.  We should mobilize 250,000 men 200,000 of
which would be sent to South Vietnam and 50,000 to Laos and Cambodia.

Summing up this report it is necessary to say that I have  touched  on
the  fundamental  features  of  the  developing  conditions  in  South
Vietnam,  on  our  difficulties  and  successes,  and  also   on   the
difficulties  existing  for  the  enemy.  I  set out our plans and our
course, illuminating also a series  of  matters  which  the  Politburo
assigned  to the State Defese Council and Supreme Command. At the next
Politburo session I shall set forth matters touching upon the  present
situation in Laos and Cambodia and views on its development.

Presently  the situation is turnig out quite favorable. The peoples of
South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have decisively frustrated  the  plan
for  "Vietnamization" of the war and identical plans being implemented
in  Laos  and  Cambodia.  We  hold  high  the  invincible  banner   of
Marxism-Leninism!

We are carrying out the precepts of Ho Chi Minh. The war of resistance
against American imperialists for the salvation of the Fatherland will
yet  be  stubborn  and  hard, yet we will definitely grasp victory. We
will decisively frustate the plans of Nixon or anyone  who  takes  his
place and continues the aggresive war!

The  course  of  our party is assuredly correct. Our people are heroic
people. Our forces are heroic forces!

The three countries of Indochina, closely  united  one  with  another,
will  fight to the last drop of blood for the freedom and independence
of their Fatherlands. The Vietnamese people will fully carry  out  its
international duty toward the fraternal peoples of Laos and Cambodia!

To the current session of the Politburo I wish successful work. I have
completed the presentation of the report.

Subject: Re: Terrorism.

You're absolutely right: there are no easy answers.  And I certainly did
not mean to insinuate that the problem stems entirely from islamic
groups; it's just that Mr. Mcgehee was referring to INTERNATIONAL
terrorism.  I don't even want to think about the domestic variety.
Either way, you're facing Hobson's choice with regards to balancing
morality and national security.  On the one hand, you have safety of
people and airports.  On the other hand, you have the very freedoms that
you are trying to protect.  Domestic terrorism is such a sticky issue
that I don't see any way to stop it other than control of information
and draconian proactive law enforcement.

A problem with reprisals that you did not mention is the possibility of
parties using them as dragons teeth; "framing" a nation and directing
repercussions against it.  One thing I was trying to say is that while
we technically have the option of doing such things as bombing villages
and training camps, it is neither politically nor morally feasible.

It's very easy to undermine the ideas of others when you aren't
advancing any of your own.  Do benefit us with some of your knowledge
and experience.  Your posting, though quite ascerbic, does seem to
demonstrate some glimmer of original thought.

Jason Thomas

Subject: Books About the Secret War in Laos

Laos, 55-75 timothy n. castle, "at war in the shadow of Vietnam:
u.s. mlitary aid to the royal Lao government, 1955-1975," columbia university
press. this book concentrates on military and diplomatic policy tracing both
overt and covert military aid. he shares a strong antipathy for the
pathet Lao and sympathy for the Hmong. but this the best available overview os
u.s. diplomatic and military objectives. Bulletin of Concerned
Asian Scholars 3/96 64.

Laos, 55-75 kenneth conboy with james morrision, "shadow war: the
CIA's secret war in Laos." book provides a blow-by-blow account. book is also
based on exhaustive research. Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 96 64.

Laos, 71-73 james e. parker, jr, "codename mule: fighting
the secret war in Laos for the CIA." this is a millitary memoir, by a former
CIA case officer in Laos from late 71 - 73. it is Hmong centric that renders
lowland Lao and other ethnic groups invisible and demonizes
the opposing forces. war stories, hijinks of CIA personnel, etc.
this a chilling account of the attitudes and motivations
of the personnel involved in implemeting u.s. policy.
Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 3/96 64.

Laos, 55-75 roger warner, "back fire: the CIA's secret war
in Laos and its link to the war in Vietnam." book offers the
broadest scope and greatest accessibility of various works (mentioned in the
Bulletin issue). Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 3/96 64.

Laos, Vietnam. 42-75 "rumor, innuendo, propaganda, and disinformation"
"tragic mountains: the Hmong, the American, and the secret wars for Laos,
1942-1992," by jane hamilton-merrit, bloomington, in: indiana u. press, 1992.
for many years jane hamilton-merrit has carried out a publicity
campaign in support of Vang Pao, while condeming the Lao people's democratic
republic (pdr). crucial elements of the argument depend on allegations made
with no primary evidence. some of her facts are simply wrong or invented.

Subject: CIA operations in africa

I am intersted in any information on CIA/US gov. operations in africa.

I came across a copy of the book _Red Star over Southern Africa_.  I was
quite inspired by it.  I donated it to the library in hopes of giving
someone else the chance to learn from the book.

It never showed up in the holdings.....

One hears a lot of conspiracys on the CIA Vs. Africans side, but very little
if any on the opposite side of the argument.  There is evidence to the
contrary, but its very hard to come across.

I have read previous posts of covert operations in asia (laos, vietnam,
ect.) and south america.  But I am intersted in African operations.

Subject: Propaganda and TWA/CIA-Cocaine

Two recent events in the media are prompting my writing a very brief commentary:
allegations of a cover-up in the TWA Flight 800 disaster and the alleged
CIA-Cocaine connection into the L.A. urban environment. My comments will be
directed at the propaganda value of these media events, as I'm currently engaged
in writing a primer on propaganda, and these make interesting case studies.

Modern propaganda comes in many forms, but of primary concern in these two cases
are:
- 'Mobile truth,' or the reinterpretation of events (revisionist history), a
common feature on the Internet, which is increasingly becoming an entry point
into the more conventional media;
- Psyops in support of operations, including spin control, after action reports,
or informative accounts when the media is controlled by intelligence and law
enforcement;
- The digital nature of media--text, photographs, video, audio--has undermined
the ability to establish the reality of what they represent as observational
proxies. This has recently been termed the 'fictive environment' by the
military, and I'll use the term for lack a better one.

Let me discuss the two cases in terms of these points:

TWA 800
Ever since Flt. 800 went down, the conspiracy theorists have been out on the
Internet, alleging everything from a Syrian missile to a 'friendly fire'
accident. Part of these allegations have been blind assertions, but some have
been backed up with 'proof' that entails supposed photographs and internal
government documents.

Mobile truth: in the absence of public facts or knowledge, speculation has run
wild. As usual, everyone's favorite pet suspect emerges--terrorists, the U.S.
Navy, government cover-ups, etc. This 'playing to the audience' has received
wide audience and coverage, because it is media hot--it attracts a lot attention
simply because it receives attention in the viewers, readers, etc. in a
self-fulfilling way. It plays on public and hidden fears; provides simple
solutions; gives an enemy to hate, react against; it justifies the beliefs and
agenda of many. The only solution is to provide facts, hopefully answers; of
course, this is antithetical to the investigatory (scientific and criminal)
process. This vacuum of data is being capitalized on by individuals or
organizations who know that the official channels are going to be closed to the
public--their motive is something I have no desire to quantify.

PsyOps: this game is lose-lose for everyone; the public is confused and angered,
the investigation is hampered or discredited, the sources of the false
information will eventually be shown to be wrong (although they will launch
secondary operations to manage this as well, alleging further cover-up,
conspiracy, and so forth). What happens though is a continual lessening of the
resistance in the information environment to future psyops operations, and this
is the long term benefit sought by the perpetrators. Confidence in the
government is at an all time low--post Viet Nam, Watergate, Iran-Contra,
Whitewater, etc. The readiness to believe the worst becomes greater and greater,
and public mental health suffers.

Fictive environment: while ground truth comes from direct observation, we're
becoming more dependent upon observational proxies than ever before--photos,
audio, video, documents, etc. The memories of observers is a questionable thing
at best (the madness of crowds), but digital trickery are removing the trust
values that we, only a few years ago, were able to place in 'more reliable'
materials. In the case of TWA, just as in most any case, the creation or faking
of evidence requires only modest skills and a personal computer. Photos can be
digital from their origin, and once transferred into a computer with the right
software, they can be merged or altered in ways that are difficult to refute,
even when false. Documents are trivial to manufacture; elements used for
provenance, showing a truth and history of origin, can be falsified in a variety
of ways (optically scanning letterhead or signature, creation from scratch by
matching typeset, etc.), and the textual body can be anything imagined (and
textual analysis or comparison is commonly beyond the capabilities of the
audience). Video and audio are slightly more complex (in levels of effort);
video modification, loosely based on the same technology used to alter
photographs, requires greater skill and more powerful equipment, but is
gradually coming into the range of the average consumer, just as audio sampling
and modification technology has reached the 'garage' level. All this calls into
question any materials of physical evidence, but those distributed over the
Internet are particularly untrustworthy--even the lower resolution of
net-distribution works to the advantage of the creation of such materials. I
expect this problem to have increasing impact as time goes on, including in
criminal and civil cases (for instance, in the Yousef case in New York, where he
claimed his computer files were faked, or the potential falsification of
photographic evidence in the Simpson civil trial).

In short, the discussion and materials on/using the Internet have done little to
advance the search for the truth of the matter in TWA 800, and have done much
harm (diverting critical manpower from the investigation, damaging the
credibility of the investigation, etc.).

CIA-Cocaine connection
TWA and this accusation actually have much in common from a propaganda
standpoint. The allegation (made by the San Jose Mercury News) was that assets
associated with the CIA-backed effort in support of the Contras were trafficking
in cocaine, which helped to finance the (c)overt war. In particular, the cocaine
smuggled into the U.S.A. was supposed to have been converted into the 'crack' or
rock (smokable) form, and introduced into the African-American urban setting in
Los Angeles, with the undertones being that it was a conspiracy to undermine the
solidarity of the A-A community.

Mobile truth: the basic assertion never actually connected the CIA with any
involvement or trafficking, yet the implication (made indirectly or directly,
depending on the source) was that it was a tacit CIA operation. Far be it for me
to write the apologia for the Agency, but not only is the supposed action
illegal and immoral, it is also highly unlikely. Creative interpretation of the
events allowed a rather clever ontological judo--the all-powerful, all-knowing
CIA either had to admit they had no idea what their assets were involved in
(thus damaging the all-knowing aspect of their reputation); they could admit to
knowledge but inaction (thus criminal facilitation, or having to say that
sometimes they need the help of 'bad' people, not a politically correct
position); or they could deny any involvement, and foster the continual
suspicion of cover-up, conspiracy, and hidden agendas. Any way they move, they
lose. This is again a position where history has created an impression that the
Agency would perform the worst action in support of their own agenda, and then
actively protect themselves from investigation; no amount of reform or
whitewashing can reverse the trend. The strength of this attack on the
credibility of the Agency is that it plays so well with public impressions of
the Agency, appears to fit the profile of previous Agency violations of public
trust, but can't be defended against because of the secrecy requirements of the
Agency, and the improbable success of proving a negative assertion (that the
Agency wasn't responsible).

PsyOps: a factor to consider is that the accusations were made during an
election period in a key state where the issue solidified a constituency into a
solid position against their 'traditional' opposition. The issue is very much a
political one, and directed at rekindling public animosity about past deeds (and
misdeeds) to shape current public impressions. Again, the long term casualties
of all this are the public trust and credibility of a key but troubled Agency;
politically expedient attacks which undermine the political process; and the
continued progression of the perversion of the information environment.

Fictive environment: no proof was actually offered (mostly proof by assertion,
as well as collateral association), but the very absence of proof feeds in to
the mobile truth and psyops elements of the operation. Clearly no public
documentation and argument could be offered from an Agency that must maintain
its security and integrity, and no proof could be offered to prove the Agency
wasn't involved, a negative assertion (a common element in this sort of
propaganda operation).

The CIA, Congress, and Justice Department are now engaged in investigations of
the allegations; as such, they will be on-going events to continue the
propaganda campaign, with a predictable end--the Agency finds no proof in their
records and interviews, which is then interpreted as continuing evidence of a
cover-up and conspiracy.

Conclusion
Media manipulation, particularly using the Internet as a method of propagation
of the propaganda message or as an entry point into the conventional media
cycle, is becoming more of a problem. Clearly everyone suffers, and the general
atmosphere of distrust and disbelief, not to mention disgust, prevail.

An opposing point of view: the Internet will greatly
enhance participatory democracy, in the U.S. and
worldwide, and undercut the ability of governments and
other large institutions to foist lies on the public.

The Internet puts a high premium on rational debate and
the competent analysis of objective information in the
discussion of and formation of attitudes on issues.
True--public policy discussions on the net are often
heavily disfigured by flames, personal attacks and wild
rumors, but over the long haul in policy debates the
best minds and best information tend to dominate, and
dominate consistently. It is impossible on the Internet
to use official titles and official authority to win
arguments. If your information and analysis aren't rock
solid, you will be humiliated. The Internet is in some
respects the purest meritocracy I've ever seen.

I've seen a test case of this process at work in the
discussion about the death of Vince Foster in the
Whitewater newsgroup. I don't want to get into the
details of the controversy here, but I will observe
that the defenders of the official account of Foster's
death (The Fiske Report), have run into very deep
difficulties on the Internet in making their case.
Critics and skeptics of the government report have been
able to expose dozens of weaknesses in the report that
raise serious questions about its truthfulness. When
you cut through all the noise and flames concerning the
Foster case--and this is quite easy to do with the
skillful use of filters--what you uncover is a debate
in which one side is prevailing over the over in the
presentation of facts and arguments.

Anyone familiar with 20th century politics, and with
the history of governments in general, knows that
governments tend to lie a good deal in order to protect
or advance the interests of the power elites who
control them. I can't imagine that any true
Jeffersonian would object to a technology which
frustrated the ability of governments to behave as
usual. A true participatory democracy would be a
refreshing experiment indeed.

With regard to the problem of manipulating and cooking
digital documents--that is going to be a huge issue.
Stewart Brand first addressed this problem a few years
ago in his book "The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at
MIT."

Increasingly individual documents by themselves will
prove nothing without relying on other multiple sources
of evidence for corroborating assertions, claims and
charges. Distinguishing between reality and illusion in
the digital age is going to be difficult.

I was about to stomp my feet for a second, but I see that you do provide a
caveat of sorts to the "rational debate" argument.  However, for my money,
not very many newsgroups dealing with political subjects retain the basic
quality in terms of substance and flame content/trolls/et.c that this one
has.

Here is the problem I see with this: I would certainly not doubt your
assessment of that group (though I don't read it myself), but what I see
as the major difficulty is that those who may be able to poke some holes
in an "official" report take that ability as prima facie evidence that
_their_ _own_ analysis is correct.  Were their critical faculties to be
turned on their own analytical product with the same vigor and tenacity,
their "unofficial" reports may fall even further short of any objective
credibility test.  In other words, just because someone might find an
error in the Warren Commission Report, this does not mean that the space
aliens/CIA/insert hypothesis here theory is therefore correct.
Tautologies and Cognitive Dissonance reign, especially in the more
conspiracy oreiented groups. (NB: I make no claims to be anything like an
"expert" etc. on JFK: this is just an attempt to provide an illustrative
example).

> charges. Distinguishing between reality and illusion in

This is why the masses I believe will not view the internet as a vehicle
for political expression.  There is far too much information (real and
illusory) for the average person who is trying to make a living to digest.
Instead, you have "niche groups" interested in say, intelligence policy,
that focus time (some spouses may say, an _inordinate_ amount of time) on
a couple of thematic areas where one may already have some knowledge (and
is therefore less likely to be bamboozled) to complement what one finds
interesting.

But by and large this is going to be a self-selecting group,
limited further by the general demographics of the internet that already
exclude, by most accoutns at any rate, non-white male netters.  Sending
emails and the like may provide some more universal appeal, but the vast
majority of people, I think, are not going to be hard core devotees of
forums like this one, certainly not to the extent where it may affect
their participation in the democracy out in the "Real World."

The trick in unmoderated discussion forums is to
identify the strongest minds on either side of an
issue; filter them in; filter the obvious ranters out;
observe carefully a few exchanges between the best
minds on the issue; apply your independent intelligence
to the exchanges and draw your own conclusions.

You would be surprised at how quickly many issues can
be sorted out with this method. Weak positions are
quickly exposed. For instance, in the case of the Fiske
Report, defenders of the report were repeatedly reduced
to name-calling, personal abuse or obvious factual or
logical absurdities. No one was able to mount a
credible defense of the report.

The critics of the Fiske Report have exposed not "some
holes" but dozens of holes in the report. The dozens of
anomalies in the report consistently point to one
conclusion: Vince Foster did not commit suicide in Fort
Marcy Park. The report is a farce.

I don't know precisely how Vince Foster died, but I do
know that it is highly improbable that he committed
suicide in Fort Marcy Park. The data within the Fiske
Report powerfully contradicts its own conclusions.

If the report is bogus--and the debate among the
strongest minds in the Whitewater newsgroup strongly
leads to the conclusion that it is--then in the Foster
incident we are looking at a possible national security
scandal of the greatest seriousness and magnitude.
It is quite likely that Vince Foster, a high-ranking
official in the White House, was murdered.

I think the Internet is going to displace the
traditional media in the setting of the national and
global political agenda. The "masses" will be deeply
influenced by what goes on on the Internet, whether
they participate directly or not. Elite opinion almost
always leads mass opinion.

Any interest that is unable to speak for itself
effectively on the Internet is going to be in deep
trouble. It is difficult to manipulate the Internet
with the same ease that one manipulates the mass media.
On the Internet, issues get fully aired and discussed.

The essence of democracy is free and open debate. The
Internet is the most democratic communications tool
ever devised by the human race. The Internet fosters
free and open debate and the free and open exchange of
information.

Now, actually, I can buy into your argument much more given your latest
post, but I would point out that you (correctly, I believe) are
differentiating between elite opinion and the "masses."  That is not what
I thought we were talking about when we discuss the internet and its
"democratizing"  effects.  If anything, the Internet itself then becomes
yet another "gatekeeper" (if we can discuss this in terms of poli sci
theory) that requires its own form of secret handshake to participate. One
might even argue that if the internet is going to be the molder of elite
opinion, the "masses" will be left even further out of the loop on
decision-making.  The very agenda of any putative debate in the real world
will be set by Internauts, whose somewhat narrow focus on a particular
issue drives how they view reality.  I don't think the "masses" will stand
for this.  Again, I'm speaking very generally; I'm not disputing your
assessment of any Foster/Whitewater issue.

Excellent point. To a strong degree, the Internet will
simply replace one gatekeeping device with another.
Possibly, however, this new gatekeeping device will be
more open and meritocratic than the previous
gatekeeping device (the traditional media), which are
relatively closed, plutocratic and under the control of
a handful of individuals (namely, the small set of
billionaires who own them). I would expect to see a
major decentralization of media power in the emerging
Internet regime, and the loss of power by governments
to control the flow of information. The U.S. should
fear this development less than most nations--we have
some experience in dealing with a fairly chaotic and
even anarchistic environment compared to most other
societies in the world. We should be able to adapt
quickly and well, although certain entrenched interests
are probably going to suffer.

Subject: Vietnam - No Death to Old Myths

TO: Sedwick Tourison

   I cannot imagine your response had I meant my earlier posting to be
critical, I meant it to be supportive. There are many positive points
made in your posting "Military Intelligence in Southeast Asia, 1970-1975,"
and of course, many I challenge. (Your posting follows at the end of
this message).

   I admire you for your defense of those agents dispatched to North
Vietnam as described in your book SECRET ARMY SECRET WAR. These agents of
Operation Plan 34-ALPHA were often met by North Vietnamese soldiers
at supposedly secret drop zones and executed or imprisoned -- and later
the U.S. withheld promised benefits. But I am appalled at your
misunderstanding of the forces of opposition in South Vietnam. You repeat
the mistakes of officialdom in the Vietnam War era and learned nothing.
In your posting I can almost see "the light at the end of the tunnel."

   Please Mr. Tourison, read some of the below cited material before
returning to this fray. I want at the onset to state my great respect
for you and your endeavors. I do not mean the below to detract from that,
but I believe if we allow the lies and distortions of Vietnam to live
on unchallenged, we give credence to all future endeavors of the CIA
and the power structures to continue to brutalize the world in the
name of supporting Democracy.

Ralph McGehee   CIABASE

   A question -- when did the US military or CIA intelligence state
that we could not win in Vietnam?  From the end of World War Two
until we helicoptered off the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon,
the intelligence community had nearly thirty years to write that
report and never did -- a three-decade failure of intelligence.

  "Not once during the war did the Joint Chiefs of Staff advise the
  president or the Secretary of Defense that the strategy being pursued
  in Vietnam would probably fail and that the US would be unable to
  achieve its objectives." General Bruce Palmer, Jr.

  Robert McNamara on the lessons of Vietnam.  We misjudged the
  North Vietnamese, and the Vietcong and exaggerated the dangers
  to the United States.  We totally misjudged the political forces
  in South Vietnam. We underestimated the power of nationalism.
  We had a profound ignorance of the history, culture, and politics of the
  people [in Southeast Asia]; we failed to recognize the limits of
  high-tech military equipment; and, we totally underestimated the
  nationalistic aspect of Ho Chi Minh's movement. None of the leadership
  was satisfied with the information on Vietnam.  If we had more Asia
  experts perhaps we would not have been so simple-minded about China and
  Vietnam.

   You are "dumbfounded" at my lack of knowledge about military
intelligence operations, usually those were a country or two removed
from my postings.  Let me add to your befuddled state -- I was
nearly equally unaware of what some of my colleagues in CIA were
doing -- we practiced compartmentation. In some cases I shared
an office with a co-worker and other than knowing a general operational
or geographic area he or she handled, I had no idea re the details of
their work. Possibly your group operated without compartmentation or
operational security and therefore, all should have known of your
agent operations -- if so I feel sorry for your agents, who probably
had a very short shelf life. I hope you take little pride in your claim.

   How did the efficient intelligence machine you describe miss the
1968 Tet offensive?  This is recorded history's greatest intelligence
failure. It appears you left Vietnam sometime late in 1967 or early 1968,
if you had all the intelligence you claim, then why the surprise of
the 1968 Tet Offensive?

   You say you are convinced that Orin Deforest who worked for the
CIA in III Corps was "either blind or mentally deficient." I know him
only by his book "Slow Burn."  But you may be informed by the statement
of Colonel Stuart Herrington, United States Army Military Intelligence,
"Certainly there is no question that the intelligence operation run by
Orin DeForrest was the most effective in the war.  The damage that he
and his operators inflicted on the Vietcong's political and military
structure was massive. DeForest was one of a small number of professionals
who were in the thick of the fray and he can speak with unchallenged
credibility.  His contribution will undoubtedly take its place as a
classic in the literature on revolutionary warfare."  (Comment: not
according to NCO Tourison. I do not evaluate Deforest's revolutionary
knowledge - and without much study cannot evaluate his successes.)

   Your recent post takes the difficult position of both defending and
criticizing the CIA -- my position is less ambiguous. You state
"the CIA officers in the field that I encountered believed they were
a law unto themselves..." You may be surprised that DCI Deutch apparently
recently made nearly that same claim.

   You note that former CI Staff office Bill Johnson said the CIA
in Vietnam was more interested in covert action than in sound clandestine
intelligence.  AMEN!

   In my book, "Deadly Deceits," I state that the CIA in all cases
related to policy adjusts, writes, creates or otherwise manipulates
intelligence to support its covert policy -- this was particularly
true re Vietnam.  How would you speculate on the intelligence now
coming out of the Middle East and Africa where the CIA now runs at
least three paramilitary operations?

   Your discussion of open source information makes a good point --
COSVN directives were not open source information -- my error. But
frequently COSVN directives were quoted in the media. It has been a
long time since I have read any of those directives but I believe
they all claimed that they would win the war. We went to tremendous
effort to acquire the directives but apparently chose to ignore their
message.

   I am in awe of all the valuable information you claim we drew from
open sources: uniforms, rank, insignia, weapons, hydroelectric power
plants, vehicles, personalities [and photographs]. If the enemy only
knew we had identified their insignia, they probably would have
accepted defeat and surrendered.

   I commend you to retired Colonel Robert Steele of Open Sources
Solutions who, I believe, states that the CIA today is most resistant
to using Open Sources and open sources.

   I also commend to you such open source documents as: Troung Chinh's,
THE RESISTANCE WILL WIN; Le Duan's, THE VIETNAMESE REVOLUTION IN
SOUTH VIETNAM; Vo Nguyen Giap's, PEOPLE'S WAR PEOPLE'S ARMY; the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam's National Assembly Standing Committee
report, 9 April 1975; Tetsuya Katoaka's, RESISTANCE AND REVOLUTION IN
CHINA; Mao Tse-Tung's, THE PEOPLE'S WAR, SELECTED MILILTARY WRITINGS;
and, Volume I SELECTED WORKS OF MAO TSE TUNG, especially his 1927 essay,
"Report of an Investigation into the Peasant Movement in Hunan."

   You ignore my statement that the CIA had virtually no agent assets
at any significant level in the forces of the enemy.  The CIA had
700 staff personnel in Vietnam, and liaison and cadre operations
running into the tens of thousands. The US military had legions of
intelligence operators and liaison assets, yet the US did not
penetrate the VC/DRV mechanisms at any significant level. (The massive
failure of intelligence to predict the Tet Offensive is just one example.)
The CIA did claim one rather well-placed agent, but due to his longevity
and the nature of his reports - I suspect he was a double agent used to
feed us material such as COSVN directives -- claiming inevitable victory.
(We know now that all of CIA's Cuban agents and most of the East German
agents were working for the other side).

   You discuss Sam Adams unfavorably, e.g., he was irked (by low
MACV enemy estimates).  You question his knowledge of communist
penetrations in Thieu's Government -- he claimed 30,000 -- leading me to
the comment on the Swiss cheese-like composition of that government.
I do not know all the sources Sam drew upon to make this estimate but he
outlines his information in the article he wrote for the May 1975 issue
of Harpers: "VIETNAM COVERUP: PLAYING WAR WITH NUMBERS: A CIA CONSPIRACY
AGAINST ITS OWN INTELLIGENCE. He also covered the same information in
his book, WAR OF NUMBERS.  You might want to visit these open sources.

   I served in Vietnam after the Tet Offensive and worked in liaison
with the Chief of Vietnam's Special Police. While there we rolled up
Communist spy net after net.  One such included President Thieu's
Foreign Affairs Advisor and his National Catholic advisor -- the net
included about 40 spies at various levels in both the Thieu government
and civilian structures.  The successes we experienced rolling-up the nets
were the result of accidents and heavy analytical input, not penetrations.
I felt some pride in our accomplishment until later when I realized we were
shooting fish in a barrel. This gives one to speculate -- why the communists
had the US-backed Thieu Government penetrated from top to bottom
while we could not recruit agents in their structures.

   After the round-up of the 40-person spy net I had the happy task
of writing up intelligence derived from their interrogations -- only
to see CIA Headquarters' extreme distress evidenced by efforts to block
the details recounting the near total penetration Thieu's Government.

   Lastly and most importantly you state re me: "...you know nothing about
the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam."  You then, Mr.
Tourison, go on to rehash all the old untrue tales re the origins
and composition and actions of the NFLSVN.  Here you demonstrate the
fallacy of all military and CIA intelligence -- you actually believe those
old Cold War justifications. I will not bother to recount all of the
untruths in your assessments as that would take too much time and
you long ago accepted the official line and no facts will apparently
make a dent in your hardened mental facade.

   If you respond to this post please focus on the below information
-- the rest of our discussion being primarily name-calling that could
re-echo till the end of time.

               The National Liberation Front

  Former President Dwight Eisenhower in his book, "Mandate for Change,"
  said "I have never talked or corresponded with a person knowledgeable
  in Indochinese affairs who did not agree that had elections been held
  at the time of the fighting, possibly 80 per cent of the population would
  have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh as their leader..."

  Vietnam,  54-75  The U.S. Viewed the NLF order of battle in terms of
  certain number of soldiers and weapons not a mass revolutionary movement -
  and consistently underestimated number of troops and money needed to defeat
  the enemy. American specialists like Lansdale, Trager and Pike never
  [understood] that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese peasants would
  fight and die willingly, for a cause beyond themselves. Senator
  Gravel edition, (1971). Pentagon papers Volume V 205-6

  56-62 Viet Cong organization of population proceeded hamlet by hamlet,
  incorporating ever-larger numbers into associations of peasants [farmers],
  women, youth. Such village organizations meant reduced rent, distribution of
  free land, freedom from both corvee labor and conscription into army,
  protection from extortion and brutality of appointed village chiefs,
  security police or army. Robert Samsom of U.S. Mission found "the Viet Cong
  land reform program possessed the universality and mass appeal that the
  Diem reform lacked." Guerrillas saw themselves "as the legitimate rulers of
  an independent Vietnam." On 12/20/60, at a secret base near Saigon, National
  Front for Liberation of South Vietnam was announced. NLF best described as
  a coalition led by party members but held together by a common program.
  Front committees were established in thousands of villages. In 2/61, PLAF
  formally organized. Southern and central branches of Lao Dong Party
  merged into central committee directorate for the south which U.S. Called
  COSVN. 75% of villagers supported front, 20% trying to remain neutral, and
  5% firmly pro-gvt. By 10/61, front so successful that gvt troops could not
  drive more than a few kilometers outside of any given provincial capital
  without running into sniper fire. M. Young.  The Vietnam Wars
  1945-1990 pages 67-73.

  60-75  Front was creation in early 60 of the association of
  Ex-resistance members, formed by those who had survived the diemist
  Exterminations. Later developed into people's revolutionary party. About in
  60 a number of other organizations created - peasants associations,
  Workers, associations, and others representing youth, women, students,
  Writers, etc.  Front's order of battle three types: self-defense
  Guerrillas - local village units usually peasants by day and guerrillas at
  Night; regional troops on a more permanent basis - job to deal with enemy
  Forces in their region; regular army to deal with enemy's mobile reserves
  And to carry out military ops. At the beginning of 64 NLFSVN claimed
  control of two thirds of territory and over half of the population.
  It is government in everything but name with committees of
  Military affairs, external affairs, public health, culture, info and
  Education. Women's Liberation Association one of mass orgs
  Affiliated with NLF...within which virtually everyone from children to old
  people in liberated areas could make a contribution to struggle. Burchett,
  W. (1965). Vietnam: Inside Story of the Guerrilla War 265

  Vietnam,  45-75 The U.S.'s leading wartime writer/scholar on the
  Vietcong, Douglas Pike, said that the liberation associations of
  the Vietcong were villagers molded into tight-knit, self-controlled,
  self-contained associations. Mao tse-tung of China and Vo Nguyen Giap
  called Liberation Associations the initial phase and the sine qua non
  of their revolutions. In 63, the Vietcong announced that seven
  million south Vietnamese (generally rural civilians) had joined
  these associations. Pike's article avoids numbers but those
  massive figures were the intel community's most sacrosanct secret
  or most egregious failure. If CIA had known and/or reported the
  7,000,000 person-strong association structure -- it would have
  invalidated all U.S. justifications for the war; liberation association
  members and their dedication, caused our defeat in Vietnam.
  Victory was never a possibility.  CIABASE 1/95

  Vietnam,  67  The order-of-battle fight of Sam Adams and the CIA's
  sacrificing its integrity on the altar of public relations and political
  expediency. MACV excluded village self-defense forces from Vietcong
  yet SDF were hardened guerrillas who responsible for 40% U.S. Casualties.
  Pike Committee investigation concluded juggling figures "created false
  perceptions of enemy of U.S. Forces...pressure from policymaking officials
  [caused] erroneous assessments..." Valentine, d. (1990). The phoenix
  Program 273-4

  Vietnam,  68   Chief cause of intel failure re Vietnam was the degraded
  image of the enemy. Second, pressure from policy-makers reinforced
  erroneous assessments of allied progress and enemy capabilities. Mission
  restriction curtailed necessary collection activity by intel officers and
  forced reliance on officers with military responsibility. House of
  Representatives Pike Committee report.

  Vietnam,  54  U.S. Subversion of Geneva agreements began immediately.
  Colonel Lansdale was already in Vietnam. His original mission,
  to by-pass French and to work with Vietnamese in unconventional war.
  Now he redirected to "paramilitary ops in communist areas." U.S.
  imported one million catholic Vietnamese from north that were a resource
  for Ngo Dinh Diem. Lansdale's rumors re U.S. use of nuclear weapons
  in Vietnam. Young, M. (1991). The Vietnam Wars 1945-1990 page 45

  U.S. Could not acknowledge Vietnam was one country and to ensure triumph
  of its creation, U.S. Sent over U.S. 400,000 combat troops to fight in
  Vietnam. None of this could be acknowledged without irreversible
  Damage to American rationale for intervention.  M. Young. The Vietnam Wars
  1945-1990 page 179

  Military proceeded to misunderstand Vietnam. But in a sense this was
  necessary - to have acknowledged popular southern base of NLF, to
  have abandoned diem in favor of a coalition gvt, would have required a
  complete reversal of U.S. Policy. In may 1960, three U.S. Special forces
  Teams arrived in Vietnam to train Vietnamese special forces for
  counterinsurgency.  U.S. counterinsurgency entirely focused on
  establishing control over the population. A U.S. Conference said
  Vietnamese "are willing to support whichever side is in momentary
  local control." Kennedy's CI experts viewed insurgency as result of
  a byproduct of disruptive process of modernization, where a small
  band of ruthless outside agitators were able to exploit poverty and
  confusion of a passive population through propaganda and intimidation
  to seize power on behalf of communism. Young, M. The Vietnam Wars
  1945-1990 pages 74-7

  Vietnam,  65  Liberation (NLF) forces by mid 65 had four-fifths of
  territory and 10 out of vn's 14 million population in liberated zones.
  There were 4,300 front "fortified villages" in SVN. Exact size of
  front's armed forces a secret but Dang Thang Chon, v.p. Of liberation
  youth federation said its youth org had 500,000 young members - this
  did not include those in the local Self-defense units but half who
  remained in villages expected to enlist in them. Burchett, W. (1965).
  Vietnam: Inside story of the Guerrilla War 84

   Comment -- information from Colby's book "Honorable Men," demonstrates
   the universal U.S. intelligence ignorance about Vietnam:

  "In (1968?) Komer asked me to prepare a briefing for the September
   MACV commanders conference, with all leading American military and
   civilian chiefs in attendance, describing the nature of the war in
   the countryside and the enemy there. To that audience I set forth
   something different from the usual rundown of communist main- and
   local force battalion, logistic chains from Hanoi through Laos
   and Cambodia, and bombing targets in the North. I outlined instead the
   structure and functions of the Lao Dong Party and its southern section,
   named the People's Revolutionary Party, the National Liberation Front,
   the Provisional Government of South Vietnam, the liberation committees
   and the National Alliance of Democratic Forces, which had made post-Tet
   appearances. I pointed out that "these failed to attract much popular
   support" (emphasis added) but they nevertheless were the phantom political
   skeleton that the communists would use in any negotiation for a peace
   treaty or cease-fire.

   To repeat, please read some of the above cited material before
returning to this fray. I again want to state my great respect for you
and your endeavors. I do not mean this to detract from that respect
but I believe if we allow the lies and distortions of Vietnam to live on,
we give credence to all future endeavors of the CIA and the power structures
to continue to brutalize the world in the name of supporting Democracy.

Your own service with CIA not-withstanding, I can not agree with your
conclusion that CIA was resistant to the use of open source
information that did not support continued U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War.   As to Sam Adams and the issue of what he believed to be
the CIA's failure to use captured enemy documents as the basis for its
analysis, here too I must disagree.  Also, your conclusion that the
[CIA] rejected COSVN directives and other "open source" publications
is also not correct.  While you cite Sam Adams as the author of a
study on the DRV penetration of the Thieu government, what is the
source of the information Sam Adams used and did he "publish" it or
merely have a hand in it?

As to your feeling of surprise that many military intelligence
operations duplicated precisely CIA operations, I am dumbfounded that
you were surprised at this.

Let me explain --  Info from "open sources," information available to anyone,
literally without restriction such as radio, television, newspapers,
books, etc. has always been looked at with some suspicion.  However,
any serious student of the Vietnam War is well aware that "open
source" material was a very valuable resource.  That some chose to
overlook it is a deficiency on the part of the individual, not an
indictment of the system.

Let's take a look at where "open source" material has been accessible
and how it has been used.

The Library of Congress has massive quantities of "open source"
material pertaining to virtually every country of the world, including
Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, the CIA and U.S. military combed the
world for every snippet the could get their hands on and the LC files
document just how successful that effort was; quite successful.  I
refer to the People's Daily newspaper, the People's Army newspaper and
the full range of books and magazines that were published in the DRV.
The CIA purchased substantial quantities of the material in East Bloc
countries, Hong Kong and elsewhere. The 500th Military Intelligence
Group based in Japan operated an entire translation center that
focused on the translation of documents from areas of intelligence
interest, including Vietnam.  In Washington, the CIA directed
Joint Publications Research Service under the Department of Commerce
translated massive quantities of Vietnamese language material, among
others. Photographs of captured U.S. POWs at the National Photographic
Interpretation Center and found in "open source" magazines, for
example, became part of the basis for some of the earliest evidence
that certain Americans were taken prisoner.

As someone who was working at the MACV J-2 Translation Section prior
to its conversion to the Combined Document Exploitation Center, I can
say with some authority that there were few DRV published open source
materials captured in South Vietnam prior to the arrival of the first
NVA units in infantry size in 1965, many of whose members brought
books and magazines with them; items like this were not taken by
earlier infiltration packets.  Each item was reported and intelligence
producers selected those items they wanted abstracted or translated in
full.  How the material was used depended on the office that requested
the information.

As many of us have said, it reached a point in the Vietnam War that
there was no dearth of information, merely a problem in trying to
digest what was there and that can be applied to "open source"
material as well.  Where do you apply your meager linguist resources?
Do you have them translate copies of the Communist Party daily
newspaper or captured daily operations reports?  Do you translate
personal histories of communist party members or do you translate
decrypted messmates?  In fact, we did them all, doing some better than
others, missing some things and scoring quite highly in other areas.

Was anything of value found in the "open source" documents?  Yes,
quite a bit, and the archival records of the intelligence producers
shows just how much was used: Uniforms, rank, insignia, weapons,
hydroelectric power plants, vehicles, personalities...  You name it,
it was all there.  If you go to any CIA, State or DoD biographics
files you will invariably find that an "open source" photograph of the
individual appears there.  Open source photographs of targets were
often compared with overhead imagery to give a good sense of what
things really looked like on the ground; examples of this can be found
in what the U.S. Army produced in its imagery keys, sample of which I
had declassified some years ago.

COSVN directives were not, I say again, were NOT found in "open
source" documents.  The files of the CIA, Pentagon and State are cram
full of full translations of these directives which were highly
classified and limited in distribution to party members.  There was an
intensive intelligence collection effort each time a directive or
supplement was issued and captured notebooks, prisoners, defectors and
all other sources were combed for all information that could be
obtained about them, to include how they were applied in each of the
areas.  So -- you can't lump COSVN directives into the "open source"
puzzle.

In short, when you make the statement that open source material was
not used, you are incorrect.  It was used and quite effectively.  I
submit that you were just in a position to collect it, translate it,
evaluate it, and use it in a piece of finished intelligence.

As to Sam Adams, I am not aware that Sam Adams "published" anything;
that wasn't his job.  As to the issue of the penetrants of the GVN,
that Sam would have had some knowledge about and in fact it gets to
the crux of Sam's early confrontation, long before anything else
emerged to irk him.  By this I am referring to U.S. penetration of the
North Vietnamese agent networks and what Sam learned about them, as it
was part of his job.  Sam, according to his former supervisor, was
angered that Westmoreland would not include the DRV agents in South
Vietnam within the MACV enemy "numbers."   It was only after that blow
up that Sam looked at even more "numbers" issues.

Regarding the issue of duplication between CIA and military
intelligence operations --

As Major General Joseph A. McChristian has noted, the doctrine that
was SUPPOSED to happen in Vietnam did not happen and I am sure there
are logical reasons for it.  What I am referring to is the theory that
in the event of open conflict, the U.S. military was to take over
certain CIA controlled agents.  Well, in the case of OPLAN 34A and the
operations into northern Vietnam that I wrote about in "Secret Army,
Secret War" we now know how much of a debacle THAT was.  Former CI
Staff officer Bill Johnson has noted for the record that the CIA was
more interested in covert action than in sound clandestine
intelligence, for the period we are talking about during the Vietnam
War.  That was an institutional failure, in my judgment.

As to duplication of operations, that there will always be, up to a
point, depending on how you define "duplication."  You will not find
both the agency and the military running the same agent, or the same
operation; doesn't normally happen in theory or in practice, speaking
from the perspective of some knowledge in this area.  What you DO
find, and quite understandably so, is the CIA and others collecting
the same information from different sources; it provides a breadth of
coverage that is necessary.  Now, if the intelligence producers tend
to give one source more weight than the other, that has nothing to do
with the process of intelligence collection -- it is a judgment call
on the part of the analyst.

For the paper that I presented, I did not go present any operations
that described the U.S. military duplicating what the CIA was doing.
In fact, the opposite is true.  For example, within Laos the agency
had few officers who spoke Vietnamese adequate for interrogation and
intensive debriefing, particularly on military related subjects.  That
is why I was detailed there as the senior interrogation officer.  The
CIA employed some local hires, Vietnamese who spoke English at a
certain level of proficiency, to do everything from limited interviews
to contacting assets, decrypting intercepted commuications,
translating documents, etc.  However, the available resources within
Laos were scarce to say the least.

The same situation applied to Cambodia where the CIA wanted our
intelligence officer assigned there but did not want even a one-man
U.S. Army team there on its turf; the same applied to Laos, as I have
written.

As to Vietnam, the book "Slow Burn" by Orin DeForest must go down in
intelligence annals as an example of how NOT to employ contract
employees; taking someone who is not a trained intelligence
professional and giving him an intelligence assignment.  DeForest
notes that when he arrived in Vietnam and set up the III Corps
interrogation operations, he duplicated the manual card file
procedures used by the Japanese police because he could not find
anyone in Vietnam with a data base.  Having read that and having just
left Vietnam shortly before DeForest arrived, I am conviced he was
either blind or mentally deficient; the information was all there, he
just didn't know where to go and it is unfortunate that no one in the
CIA Station saw fit to show him.

As I mentioned earlier, what was SUPPOSED to happen if a war broke out
in Vietnam was that the CIA would turn over its assets to the
military.  That did not happen in part because the theory was that the
U.S. military commander would be a Theater level commander, which
Westmoreland was not. Ergo, the CIA kept control of its own assets and
continued to run them inside South Vietnam as they had before that,
always mistrustful of the miltary and very jealous of its own turf.
The CIA officers in the field that I encountered believed they were a
law unto themselves, failing to appreciate that it HAD to be a team
effort, which it was not.  All the rules of the book that guided our
clandestine efforts elsewhere were thrown out the window during the
Vietnam War, and that can be laid to CIA arrogance and a failure of
our own military up the entire chain to straighten it out from the
very outset.  Unfortunately, not even McNamara worked out that one.

In summation, I go back to my initial question that started this
thread.

You read what I resented and concluded that some of my comments
subjective. I asked you to identify which comments you found
subjective and you have not. Once again, I will be more than pleased
to discuss any you identify.  Until then, you have not offered
anything to back up your statement.

Conversely, Burchett's statements which you summarize regarding the
National Liberaration Front ARE flawed and I will limit my
observations to your second paragraph.

According to your writing, the NLF was not created in the early 1960s
as an assocation of ex-resistance members who had survived the Diemist
exterminations, developing later into the People's Revolutionary
Party.

I will stop here and not go further because the remainder of the
paragraph, which I could address as well, suggests you know nothing
about the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam.

The NLF was created by the DRV government to serve as its overt arm in
South Vietnam to create the illusion of a broadly based
anti-government force through which the population could be organized
to achieve the DRV's aim of subvertiving South Vietnam.  The Socialist
Republic of Vietnam has acknowledged this in its modern writings.

In point of fact, the NLF was a figurehead force that did nothing on
its own. It did NOT lead to the formation of the Vietnam People's
Revolutionary Party. The party was created as the southern arm of the
north's Lao Dong Party and was given a different name to avoid
implicating the north in the struggle within SVN and neighboring Laos.
Vietnam has acknowledged this in its modern writings.  As I believe I
wrote in "Talking With Victor Charlie" (Ivy Books, 1991), the DRV had
to ensure that southerners did not get some notion that they were
independent of the Lao Dong Party and for that reason termed the
senior leadership body of the PRP the "Trung Uong Cuc."  Some
dunderhead in Saigon translated this to be the Central Office for
South Vietnam, COSVN for short, and we were stuck with it.

In point of fact, and I believe somewhat with tongue in cheek, there
were actually TWO "COSVNs" in South Vietnam.  The first COSVN that
actually pre-dated the DRV's formation of the PRP was the name applied
internally to the South Vietnam government's covert action force
operating against the DRV, the VC in the South, and in third
countries.  I am referring here to the forced head by Lt. Col. Le
Quang Tung and known as the Presidential Survey Office (PSO), the So
Khai Thac Dia Hinh, renamed in 1965 the Strategic Technical Service
(STS) and later the Strategic Technical Directorate (STD).

In 1966, at the Combined Military Interrogation Center, we produced a
rather elaborate chart from national level down to the lowest hamlet,
identifying and describing the PRP and showing for the first time in a
military product the inter-locking relationship through the military
party committees to each military command command headquarters, the
military headquarters staff, the party committee staffs, and the Front
organization.  We also produced a rather elaborate description of how
the Front operated and who pulled the strings, how those strings were
pulled, and how the party's political decisions were transformed into
actions by its own staffs, the military and the Front.  That report,
and others from knowledgeable defectors and prisoners, is in the
archival files of the Combined Military Interrogation Center at the
National Archives.  I urge that you read the material. Sedgwick Tourison

Clinton Aide Case Witness Sues FBI

By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in Washington

   A KEY witness in the investigation of the death of the White House aide,
 Vincent
Foster, has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the US government of a conspiracy
 to
obstruct justice and of a violation of his civil rights.
   In a fresh blow to the FBI, already reeling from bad publicity after the
 mishandling
of the Atlanta bombing, the witness, Patrick Knowlton, has named two FBI agents
 as
defendants, alleging that they were part of an orchestrated scheme of
 intimidation.
   Knowlton, the first witness to discover Vincent Foster's car at the crime
 scene on
the afternoon of Foster's mysterious death, says that he was the victim of
 intense
harassment in October 1995 after he accused the FBI, in an interview with The
 Telegraph,
of falsifying his witness statements.
   The intimidation, he claims, involved threatening gestures by a surveillance
 network
of more than 20 people. It began, he says, on the day he received a subpoena to
 appear
before the Federal Grand Jury to answer questions about the Foster case. The
 lawsuit
alleges that the threats were intended to discourage him from telling the truth
 in his
appearance before the Grand Jury and at the same time to discredit him.
   "I never believed that anything like this could happen in the United States,"
 said
Knowlton, 41, a businessman in Washington DC. "They've turned my life
 upside-down and
I'm not going to let them get away with it."
   He was interviewed by the FBI in 1994 during the investigation of Robert
 Fiske. The
Fiske Report concluded that Foster committed suicide for personal reasons.
 Knowlton
claims that the report falsified his testimony and that of other crime scene
 witnesses.

David and Wayne:

           I think the great advantage of the Internet is that anyone
with access to it, not anyone selected by a TV, radio or print executive,
can present information and express views. Obviously, some of the stuff
is going to be pretty much off the wall.
          David mentioned the JFK assassination, with which research I am
very familiar. This is clearly a subject which has attracted both serious
researchers (Sylvia Meagher, Peter Dale Scott, John Newman, to name a
few), as well as extremely unsound ones (Bill Cooper's lectures claiming
JFK driver shot him; identification of one of the Dallas photographers as
an assassin; Howard Donahue's claim that a Secret Service agent in the
followup car shot JFK accidentally; and countless others).
          Once one becomes familiar with the evidence, avoids becoming
tied to a theory, and examines information and claims with a critical
approach, it is possible to make some progress. There are  65 web sites
on the JFK assassination on Internet; most are of limited value, but some
are excellent. There are also some newsgroups, and I find it easy to go
through their contents in a relatively short period of time, because the
trivia and much of the nonsense is easy to spot--then I can focus on the
material of value.            There are some very good people working on
the case at present, including many professionals whose interest in the
case was stirred by the film "JFK." Combining the expertise with some of
the newer people with veteran researchers' familiarity with the evidence
continues to produce some real progress.
           The trend toward more careful research in the JFK case, the
wider availability of e-mail, and the increasing use of Internet have all
raised the quality of the work, though much remains to be done. It has
also made evidence from the newly-released documents more quickly
available to more people. The series of articles I've been writing for
Review Magazine on this new evidence can be found on the JFK Place
website:
  gopher://gopher.freenet.akron.oh.us:70/11/SIGS/JFK
              I have seen some of the same valuable interchanges on
Cloaks and Daggers. I would guess that the same thing has been happening
in a variety of other fields. It would seem a particularly useful
resource for scientists, political scientists, etc.

Subject: Secret Power - Online and For Sale

Ordering information for and some chapters from "Secret Power - New
Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network" by Nicky Hager are now online @

        http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/

Here is some teaser from the book:

Many people are vaguely aware that a lot of spying occurs, maybe even on
them, but how do we judge if it is ubiquitous or not a worry at all? Is
someone listening every time we pick up the telephone? Are all our Internet
or fax messages being pored over continuously by shadowy figures somewhere
in a windowless building? There is almost never any solid information with
which to judge what is realistic concern and what is silly paranoia.

What follows explains as precisely as possible -- and for the first time in
public -- how the worldwide system works, just how immense and powerful it
is and what it can and cannot do. The electronic spies are not ubiquitous,
but the paranoia is not unfounded.

Few New Zealanders have heard of the Government Communications Security
Bureau (GCSB). In this startling new book, the shadowy world of the GCSB is
broken open for the first time. Secret Power exposes, in remarkable detail,
the secret workings of this organisation and the global network of which it
is part

The global system has a highly secret codename -- ECHELON.  The intelligence
agencies will be shocked to see it named and described for the first time in
print. Each station in the ECHELON network has computers that automatically
search through the millions of intercepted messages for ones containing
pre-programmed keywords or fax, telex and e-mail addresses. For the
frequencies and channels selected at a station, every word of every message
is automatically searched (they do not need your specific telephone number
or Internet address on the list).

All the different computers in the network are known, within the UKUSA
agencies, as the ECHELON Dictionaries. Computers that can search for
keywords have existed since at least the 1970s, but the ECHELON system has
been designed to interconnect all these computers and allow the stations to
function as components of an integrated whole.

Excellent point!

However, New Zealand doesn't seem to be the only Country engaged in this=
 type=20
"internal security". Below is an article on this topic that caught my eye a
couple of years ago. For those of you that read German, The German version
of the CIA (Bundesverfassungsschutz) - in-and- outside of Germany - has been=
=20
engaged in this type of "monitoring" activity for quite some time.

Perhaps the only thing "new" in this concept is the method: no Court Order
required here to open private mail...

Re:     Papers available

Given recent interest in some of my papers, let me point out that they are
archived at URL http://www.fas.org/cp/eprint/index.html (thanks to John Pike and
the Federation of American Scientists).

Topics of the papers cross the range of infrastructural warfare, of which
terrorism and infowar are subclasses.  I'll also be making available another
three or four papers by the end of the year, including my primer on modern
propaganda.

Best wishes,

While this should guarantee an upsurge in Kiwi bashing <g>, I am certainly
intrigued by the technical capabilities that this ECHELON project is
purported to have.  But this seems to me to be only half of the issue.

Certainly, the abiltiy to sift through such tremendous amount of data is
awesome.  I would be even more interested, though, in how decisions are
made, as all these data are collected, to put a "piece" of traffic on
analyst's desk.  There are a number of personages on the internet who will
make the claim that the "CIA is monitoring this newsgroup."  Yes, in the
broadest possible sense, that is likely true.  Just as
rec.cooking.south-asian may also be "sifted" with this capability.  But
how many "hits" of these codewords are required before a post, for
instance, gets set aside for "special handling" (quoted words used for
sinister effect).  What kind of weight is such traffic ultimately given in
an end-user intel product?  In sum, I remain impressed by the technical
wizardy, but to what useful effect can/is it being put to considering the
admittedly high signal to noise ratio of a target like the internet?

Take a look at the World News Connection [aka FBIS] search engine, which is
an astonishingly sublime creation, for a hint on how this is done.

I am beginning to redefine "Open Source" intelligence as encompassing all
modes of COMINT that do not involved collecting against encrypted traffic.
As the encrypted traffic becomes less vulnerable to COMINT [as opposed to
mere traffic analysis or EOB plotting] it would be difficult to follow the
drunk to the lamp post to at least look for things where they might be
found, ie, in non-encrypted traffic of whatever source.

>how many "hits" of these codewords are required before a post, for

I have these number sitting around here somewhere, but as I recall the NSA
intercepts just about all international [broadcast and otherwise] message
traffic, which amounts to something on the order of 100 milliion messages
per day [as I recall this is approximately the right order of magnitude] of
which only a few thousand ever wind up being touched by human hands.

Along with voice, it is a very large haystack and some very small needles.

Subject: Covert Action and Narcotics

   Biographic Information on John Deutch indicates he was a protege
of Mr. Covert Action, Colonel Lansdale.  He is living up to his mentor's
legacy by sponsoring paramilitary operations -- aimed at three countries --
Iraq, Libya and now the Sudan.  Paramilitary operations arm civilians to
kill people in target countries who oppose their goals. The CIA, of course,
is also active against Iran and probably backs the Taliban in Afghanistan.

   Historically, major CIA paramilitary operations produced massive
increases in drug trafficking.  We can, therefore, anticipate
the CIA's again looking the other way as narcotics produced by their
assets flood world markets. (Mr. Deutch also earlier was the Pentagon's
point man in denying the Gulf War Syndrome.)

Ralph McGehee

  95  the new DCI Deutch's father, Michael Deutch, was a Russian Jew. In 51,
  he went on a presidential mission as an economic adviser and became
  impressed with Colonel Lansdale - and became a lifelong friend of the
  Colonel. in 61 Lansdale recruited John Deutch for his first gvt job. at 22,
  he became one of Macnamara's whiz kids at the Pentagon. John spent four
  years in systems analysis. he later held political posts in democratic adms
  and went back to academic and advisory posts in republican times. he was on
  president Reagan's commission on nuclear strategy, Bush's foreign
  intelligence advisory board and six other similar panels. He became rich.
  the CIA he says "is an org suffering because it's had tremendous criticism
  because of its own mistakes," it does not want to admit. new york times mag

  95-97  9/12/95, dci deutch told a national press club lunch that the
  united states needed "to maintain, and perhaps even expand, covert action
  as a policy tool." Statement came just as the republican- dominated house
  of reps was getting ready to vote on next fiscal year's approximately $28
  billion intel budget which passed: a simple voice vote endorsing a 1.7
  percent increase. House select committee on intel had recommended an
  increase and praised deutch's reform efforts. Committee's recommended
  increase was explicitly earmarked for fighting terrorism, nuclear
  proliferation, drug smuggling and "rogue nations" iraq, iran, libya and
  north korea. Only "ruffle" is senate's proposed intel budget which has not
  yet been passed, but does not include a 1.7 percent increase. Intelligence
  - a computerized intelligence newsletter published in france 9/25/95 30

  95  dci deutch announced on 9/12/95, a policy of expanding covert
  operations. What cia primarily has in mind are ops against drug smuggling,
  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and international crime and
  terrorism. Washington post 9/13/95 a7

  sudan,  95-96  has emerged as a clear threat to stability of nearby africa
  and middle eastern states because of its support for subversive activities
  of regional opposition groups. Threat is likely to remain as long as the
  national islamic front (nif) is the dominant political force in country. In
  its effort to spread its version of islamic fundamentalism beyond sudan and
  destabilize regional moderate gvts friendly to us, nif supports insurgent
  and terrorist groups opposed to gvt of egypt, eritrea, ethiopia, and
  uganda. Sudan also provides safehaven and limited material support to other
  radical groups such as hizballah, hamas, abu nidal organization, and the
  armed algerian extremist groups. From dci john deutch's "worldwide threat
  assessment brief to the ssci" on 2/22/96. Iwr 2/24/96

  70-95  john deutch's confirmation statement. He presently deputy secretary
  of the department of defense. From 4/1/93 to 3/11/94, he was under
  secretary of the department of defense for acquisition and technology.
  prior to this he held positions at massachusetts institute of technology as
  dean of science, provost, he is on leave from mit gvt service. During the
  period 78 to 80, he served in a number of positions in doe, where he was
  responsible for managing the basic science, energy technology development,
  conservation, and nuclear weapons programs. In intel matters he is senior
  defense dept official responsible for intel. He earlier served on several
  intel advisory committees, including the dci's science and technology
  advisory committee, nsa's science advisory board, and, technology advisory
  committee formed to advise the senate intel committee. From 91 to 93 he was
  named to pfib. In early eighties he was on president's commission on
  strategic forces ("scowcroft commission") and later white house's science
  council. His statement gives his views on problems, needs and future of
  intelligence. Statement before the senate intel committee 4/26/95

  80-96  dci deutch and sod william perry have been friends since appointed
  as senior pentagon officials under les aspin. They have long championed
  better intel and defense high tech systems. Along with dod's paul kaminski,
  they are business partners in cambridge research associates - a small but

  collection ops which spies on foreign gvts in the u.s., specifically the
  u.n. dci deutch made announcements at a rare press conference at cia hqs.
  paul redmond to be associate deputy director for counterintel. John gannon,
  until recently director of european analysis, to be deputy director of
  intel - in charge of all analysis. Ruth david, director of advanced info
  technology at sandia national laboratory, to be deputy director for science
  and technology. Leo hazelwood, former cia executive director, to be deputy
  director for administration. Re cohen he is "an outsider who is not very
  well liked within the do" but is "hardnosed." He wont take a lot of crap.
  two new associate deputy directors of ops are david edger, a respected case
  officer who was ames supervisor at the time of his arrest, to be senior
  deputy for espionage ops. Christine wiley, former chief of human resources
  staff, to be top deputy for human resources in the do. John mclaughlin, a
  senior analyst in the russian section, appointed number 2 official at the
  national intel council, and jay castillo was named director of office of

  95  david cohen to be new director of ops. He was acting deputy of di. He
  created the national resources div out of separate domestic and foreign
  collection services. He practices "management by fear." "a company man from
  the word go - who will find out what way the wind is blowing and then go
  with it." Some mid-level and senior employees conclude the dci deutch is
  not serious about reform. U.s. news & world report  7/31/95 20

  95  dci designee, deutch, is sharp-tongued and tough-minded. New york
  times 4/26/95 a5

  95  dci deutch appointed four new deputy directors, all named were
  longtime cia employees, completing his sweep of eight top executives. New
  appointees selected with help of a panel headed by former deputy dci
  mcmahon. David cohen new do. Washington post 8/1/95 a17

  95  dci deutch appointed last month a 30-year agency veteran david cohen
  to the politically-sensitive post of deputy director of operations (ddo)
  where he will oversee ops. Deutch was given good marks by the press for
  picking "an agency man" and for putting an "analyst" rather than a "covert
  operator" in charge of the "dirty tricks" directorate. Cohen will be
  working with four associate deputy directors: u.s. army general david
  barrato (who will continue as head of covert actions), david edger (intel
  ops), paul redmond (counter-intel) and christine wiley (personnel). That
  gen. Barrato has kept his job is to be a clear indication that deutch is
  not going to "scrub down" cia dirty tricks, to maintain and reinforce
  cia-pentagon ties, and to "box in" cohen at his new post. Redmond is a
  "forced" appointment since he was instrumental in pursuing the aldrich ames
  case as a senior official of the cia counter-intel center, and the cia has
  had to acquiesce to fbi demands for a larger role in counter-intel in the
  cia. Intelligence - a computerized intelligence newsletter published in
  france 9/11/95 15

  95  dci deutch filled one of most politically sensitive posts in u.s.
  intel community, naming david cohen, a 53-year-old career cia official, to
  head agency's clandestine espionage arm. Cohen's appointment as cia's
  deputy director of ops is a modest break with tradition, since he has spent
  most of his career on analytical, rather than clandestine, side of cia.
  cohen is a boston native who joined cia in 1966. He put in a stint in
  clandestine ops earlier in his career but most recently has been serving as
  cia's associate deputy director for directorate of intel. Turnover in
  management ranks at cia gave deutch a chance to put his own people in
  almost every top position. Deutch said john gannon would take over as head
  of intel directorate. With a ph.d. in history, gannon has been director of
  cia's office of european analysis. Deutch went outside agency to fill top
  spot at cia's science and technology arm, naming ruth david, director of
  advanced info technologies at sandia national laboratory in albuquerque,
  n.m. he also named leo hazlewood, formerly cia's executive director, to be
  deputy director for adm. Los angeles times 8/1/95 a9

  95  dci "deutch leaving no doubt who is in charge of intelligence." Deutch
  is paying more attention to all intelligence-gathering operations,
  including dia, nsa, nro, and all pentagon operations. He has turned over
  cia management to nora slatkin who is the cia's executive secretary. All
  four deputy directors of the cia report to slatkin. Deutch is seizing the
  fiscal reins of the entire intel community. Washington post 12/10/95 a6

  95  dept defense sec., John deutch cancelled trip to moscow for next week
  under pressure from senators who threatened to derail his nomination as dci

  95  deutch shocked by do's "inability to formulate solutions." Do did not
  have desire or ability to reinvent itself. "compared to uniformed officers
  they certainly are not as competent or as understanding of what their
  relative role is and what their responsibilities are." The deep rot of the
  do in guatemala is a core sample of the deep rot of the overall do. Curse
  of old boys on deutch. Curse is patrimony of an elite secret society that
  degenerated into an elitist bureaucracy, an inbred tribal culture. Rules
  and laws were not for them. Larry huston's funeral. Dci casey in 80s hired
  thousands of new spies of questionable quality. Aldrich ames case -- no one
  told dcis webster and gates anything close to the truth about the case.
  milt bearden lives in a new hampshire hamlet - was the last chief of the
  soviet division. He says, "out of 5000 people, you've got 1,500 buggy-whip
  makers," in the spies' ranks. There's nothing worse than having a couple
  thousand more troops than you need....their mission is greatly reduced:
  intelligence support to other agencies that will do things about the great
  transnational problems." Their service is backing up the military and the
  fbi and drug-enforcement agents and friendly foreign intel services who
  will do the dirty work. The curse of old boys has so damaged the morale and

  95  john m. Deutch although highly-respected for his work a at pentagon,
  deputy defense secretary john m. Deutch, is being criticized in congress
  for his friendship with chairman of defense industry giant martin marietta
  corporation. Mr. Deutch was expecting a relatively easy confirmation
  process, but he is a close friend of norman augustine who will receive a
  bonus of $8,200,000 for helping to arrange his firm's merger with lockheed
  corporation under a pentagon-approved plan. Defense department, where
  deutch is number two, will pay one-third of that bonus under terms of a
  prior contract. Marietta executives will receive bonuses of $92,000,000,
  one-third paid by u.s. taxpayers. Mr. Deutch, defense secretary william
  perry, and mr. Augustine are friends and have long worked together.
  following a stockholders' meeting in chicago, it was decided that merged
  company would be called lockheed martin. It will be based in state of
  maryland and receive $11.6 billion a year for military sales to pentagon.

  95  on 5/17/95 dci deutch announces senior personnel appointments: george

  at nsc. He was staff director for the senate select committee on intel for
  more than four years. Nora slatkin be executive director responsible for
  activities and ops of all cia components and for the national
  reconnaissance office (nro). Deutch has asked leo hazelwood to remain on in
  a senior management role. Slatkin is currently the assistant secretary of
  the navy for research, development and acquisition and has extensive

  95  rear admiral dennis blair is right where spies and military cross each
  other's tracks. With stronger ties developing between pentagon and cia
  under dci deutch, blair has been nominated by deutch to make sure the intel
  community gives maximum support to "warfighters." When at the pentagon as
  deputy defense secretary, deutch had noticed blair as a leading navy
  proponent of creating greater awareness of the battlefield. A 25 percent
  reduction in intel resources had already eliminated "a lot of shops that
  were looking at the same thing" in intel and now objective is to "do more
  with same rather than eliminate redundancies." Blair graduated from the
  u.s. naval academy and attended oxford university as a rhodes scholar. He
  has served as a white house fellow and a chief of naval operations fellow
  in the strategic studies group. Clinton, who was a fellow rhodes scholar at
  oxford with blair, has nominated blair to serve at cia in the grade of vice
  admiral. Intelligence - a computerized intelligence newsletter published in

  john deutch's nomination for dci to the full senate. Iwr 5/8/95

  95  the new dci deutch's father, michael deutch, was a russian jew. In 51,
  he went on a presidential mission as an economic adviser and became
  impressed with colonel lansdale - and became a lifelong friend of the
  colonel. In 61 lansdale recruited john deutch for his first gvt job. At 22,
  he became one of macnamara's whiz kids at the pentagon. John spent four
  years in systems analysis. He later held political posts in democratic adms
  and went back to academic and advisory posts in republican times. He was on
  president reagan's commission on nuclear strategy, bush's foreign
  intelligence advisory board and six other similar panels. He became rich.

  because of its own mistakes," it does not want to admit. New york times mag

  95  with nomination of john m. Deutch, cia is about to get, by accident,
  just what it has wanted for past two years -- a forceful and well-connected
  director who can represent its interests at high levels of adm just when
  long-term future of intel community is questioned. Deutch is an old friend
  of woolsey's. They worked on national security issues in carter adm, and
  both are friends and proteges of brent scowcroft, who was bush's national
  security adviser. In 1983, scowcroft headed an 11-member commission on u.s.
  strategic forces, its democratic members included woolsey, deutch and
  william j. Perry. Before serving in clinton adm, deutch, 56, spent most of
  his life at intersection of science, academia and government. He has a
  doctorate in chemistry and has taught at princeton university and mit. In
  1990, while serving as mit's provost, deutch wanted to become university
  president. But he lost out after faculty critics complained that he was a
  symbol of a too-cozy relationship between mit and gvt. Since 60s, deutch
  has served as a consultant to every administration except nixon's. In 1990,
  bush appointed him to president's foreign intel advisory board. Los angeles

  95  with the quick retirement of hugh e. "ted" price, cia director of ops
  and the most senior official reprimanded in the aldrich h. Ames case, john
  j. "jack" devine moved up to take his place. The cia has not released an
  official biography of devine, who was born on 14 november 1940 in
  pennsylvania, but it is known that devine was ames' station chief while the
  latter worked in rome and spied for the russians, a fact that may not
  endear devine to new cia director john deutch. Devine received a bachelor's
  degree at west chester state college in 1962 and a master's degree at
  villanova university in 1964. From 1962 to 1967 he was a high school
  teacher. As a cia officer he was posted to santiago, chile, in 1971 and
  apparently was still there in 1973. On 11 september 1973, gen. Augusto
  pinochet overthrew the elected government of salvador allende and gave
  "carte blanche" to manuel contreras, head of the dina, to eliminate the
  regime's adversaries. It is quite likely devine knew pinochet and contreras
  who has just been condemned by the chile supreme court for the

  her on the job. The resulting fiasco generated an internal inquiry which is

Do you have any documentation on this?

It seems to me that one of the most significant
features of Deutch's career as DCI is that he presided
over the bungled covert operation against Iraq and
Saddam. This was a major intelligence and operational
failure, to say the least, but there has been almost no
discussion or analysis of the debacle in the American
mass media. For some reason the media overall have
chosen to maintain a discrete silence on the matter.
Fascinating.

Deutch testified before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on
April 26, 1995, during his confirmation hearing for post as DCI that:
"With the help of an independent panel, I examined those instances where
there are allegations of use or presence [of CBW agents], and it is my
judgment at the present time that there has been no use or presence,
but that judgment is amenable to change if further information comes up."

Deutch had also appeared on CBS News' 60 Minutes on March 12, 1995 and
made similar statements, although at that time (more than a month earlier)
he was seemingly less categorial in his denial after being pressed
repeatedly with sharp questions by the 60 Minutes interviewer.  Deutch
then said that there was no evidence of "widespread use."  During his
confirmation hearings over a month later, in addition to making the
categorial denial quoted above, Deutch also accused 60 Minutes of
misleading the public with tricky editing: "I attach no particular
significance to use of that word [widespread use].  'No use' would
be equally accurate from my point of view."

Senator Bob Kerrey continued to press Deutch for a clarification of
this issue during the confirmation hearings:

Kerrey: "And you have no evidence at this point that there was any
kind of use or presence of CBW [chemical or biological warfare agents]
during that 42-day period?"

Deutch: "That's correct."

Other high-profile Pentagon denials included statements by Dr. Stephen
Joseph, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in sworn
testimony before the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Hospitals
and Health Care on March 8, 1995: "There is no persuasive evidence of
such exposures [to CBW agents], even after much scrutiny."  And in
a joint statement issued on May 25, 1994 by Defense Secretary William
Perry and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Shalikashvili, it was
claimed that "there is no information, classified or unclassified, that
indicated chemical or biological weapons were used in the Persian
Gulf."  This last statement may or may not be strictly true, but
was clearly misleading in that exposure can occur without deliberate
"use" by Iraqi troops.

Note for the record that a November 12, 1991 military action report,
not released to the public but later obtained by journalists and
reported in the Associated Press, confirmed that when U.S. troops
exploded Iraqi bunkers in Kamisiyah, chemical weapons agents were
released.  This priority document had been prepared by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and distributed to the DIA, CIA, White House situation
room, and the Secretary of State.

A good article dealing with these and other issues appeared in Covert
Action Quarterly, No. 53, Summer 1995.  I drew heavily from it here,
but can also confirm many of its points from my own recollection of
Deutch's 60 Minutes appearance, Associated Press dispatches, etc.
Also see CAQ's "covert briefs" in its Fall 1996 issue.

No one can accuse Deutch of not being highly
intelligent, cautious and circumspect: he chose his
words with great care and precision.

The information which follows is disturbing. Either
Deutch and his colleagues made an honest mistake, or
they have been lying.

Why they would lie is a great mystery: the lies are
easily found out, and there is a painful price to be
paid for being exposed as a liar.

Or is there? The culture and standards of
accountability in government and the intelligence
community often seem to be a good deal slacker than
that in the private sector. And this is why governments
and intelligence agencies are often able to get in
worse trouble and make bigger messes than any other
institutions on the planet: no accountability. If you
don't continously receive feedback from the real world
and pay for your mistakes, you go on to make more and
bigger mistakes.

In any case, the controversies and scandals around the
American intelligence community under the Clinton
administration continue to pile up. In my estimation,
the IC has been severely damaged during the last few
years, and could be facing an historic crisis during
the next year or two. A deep rot has been allowed to
take hold in certain sectors of the community, and it
has been spreading. Agencies like the CIA and FBI seem
to have more and more explaining to do, and their
explanations are not compelling.

I think we need a strong and effective IC, by the way.
This is why I am raising these issues. Dangerous
predators in the world, like organized crime and
international terrorist groups, are going to have an
opportunity to run wild if the American IC suffers any
more damage to its reputation and credibility. The
entire IC needs to be cleaned up with a strong hand.
People who have abused their power in the IC need to be
exposed and removed from power.

There doesn't seem to be.  The major media, who frequently end up
reporting the lies, never seem to thread it all together or remember
it long enough to draw firm conclusions about the credibility of
institutions like the CIA, the Pentagon, and others.  Agent Orange,
human radiation experiments, unwitting drug tests, School of Americas
training manuals in blackmail, murder, torture, and false imprisonment;
domestic spying, political spying, the subversion and overthrow of
foreign governments in the third world, the protection of Nazi war
criminals...there is a never ending parade of denials, exposures, new
admissions and counterspin covering the entire post-WW II period.

The establishment media never stops treating these agencies as credible.
The agencies' PR departments create the impression after the fact that
there was no lying or bad faith but merely bureaucratic error and a
lamentable but honest absence of alacrity in responding to the issues,
and they are allowed to get away with this.  At worst, this behavior
is treated not as the historical evidence demands -- as a systemic
reflection of institutional values and tactics -- but as isolated
incidents which belong to the past and which don't reflect upon the
supposedly reformed agencies.  Within government, very little happens.
Occasionally somebody loses their job (usually somebody in the lower
to middle portion of the food chain).  Rarely is anyone prosecuted
on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice, Neutrality Act
violations, or other criminal charges.  The people who are usually
end up getting pardoned or otherwise beating the rap.  No, I'm afraid
that, more than anyone else, the institutions which engage in these
kinds of behaviors, and the people who run them, understand better
than most of us just how likely they are to escape significant
culpability or lasting damage to their careers.

While I agree with your sentiments, I doubt that organized crime
and international terrorist groups will run any more wild than they
currently do, regardless of the reputation of the American intelligence
community (which, abroad in the third world, could scarcely be any worse).
Nor do I have much hope for fundamental reform.  People are just too
chauvinistic about their own leaders and institutions, which are an
extension of their egos and personal identities.  This is especially
true for those who are integral parts of the establishment.

From:    MARK ADKINS <emerald@AZTEC.ASU.EDU>
Subject: My Dinner with the NSA

Back in March 1996, I read a Scripps Howard News Service story headlined
"Soviets infiltrated U.S. in '40s, files show."  The story, based upon
VENONA intercepts (cables sent by Soviet intelligence officers to Moscow
in 1944 and 1945), claimed that "more than 100 Soviet agents had
infiltrated the State, Justice, War, and Treasury departments, and
even the Office of Strategic Services, the CIA's precursor."

While the general theme of Soviet infiltration seemed plausible enough,
I wanted to get a better idea of just what these intercepts showed,
and the scope of the problem, particularly since they were being
used by conservative historians to revive the reputation of McCarthy
and other Cold War pit bulls.  Were distinctions being made, as
Nation editor Victor Navasky recently asked, "between witting and
unwitting sources, between political gossip and political intelligence,
between ideological analysis and espionage; between Soviet intelligence
officers stationed in the United States who cabled back facts and those
who cabled back fiction, trying to curry favor with their Moscow
superiors by portraying targets as contacts and contacts as recruited
agents"?

I decided to let the experts at the source decide, so I sent a Freedom
of Information Act request to the NSA (which, to their credit,
responded within about a month's time).  Here is a portion of
their response, signed by James P. Cavanaugh, Deputy Director of
Policy:
****

Dear Mr. Adkins:

    This responds to your 28 March 1996, Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) request for "copies of those materials which identify, either
by name, code-name, or position, U.S. citizens then employed by
U.S. Government departments and agencies who appear to have been
witting agents of the Soviet Union."  Your request has been processed
under the provisions of the FOIA.  A thorough search of our files
was conducted, but no records responsive to your request were located.

****

Note that at the time this response was written, about 1,500 pages of
VENONA translations had been released.

Obviously this response is subject to more than one interpretation.
But it does make one wonder how many of these revelations are based
upon solid evidence which the NSA is willing to explicitly characterize,
and how much is based upon innuendo and ambiguity.

It's hard to disagree with the proposition that the
reputation and morale of the American intelligence
community at the moment is at an all-time low. During
the last few years it has been involved in one major
screw-up and scandal after another, with very little
accountability. Aldrich Ames, Ruby Ridge, Waco, the
World Trade Center bombing, the failed effort to
overthrow Saddam, rumors about Mena and Vince Foster,
the Gulf War Syndrome cover-up....

I'd hate to try to imagine a world without effective
and principled intelligence agencies, however.

For instance, have you been following developments in
Italy during the early nineties? The Italian government
has been waging a valiant war against the Mafia, in
which some decent public officials have had to pay the
ultimate price--with their lives. To throw in the towel
and let dangerous predators run wild without checks or
resistance would not be a good idea. There are worse
things in this world than corrupt or bungling
intelligence agencies which are still somewhat
susceptible to democratic controls.

Of course, there may be nothing more dangerous in this
world than the intelligence community of a superpower
which becomes totally unaccountable and uncontrollable.
The Soviet Union provided a wonderful example of that
state of affairs. In such societies distinctions
between the government and criminal organizations like
the Mafia become totally irrelevant. The government IS
the Mafia. Same thing.

I don't believe the U.S. has reached this state of
affairs--yet. And I frankly don't believe that the U.S.
will ever degenerate to that level. The tradition and
love of freedom is too strong here.

Dangerous predators these days are likely to be armed
with highly concealable weapons of mass destruction.
We need defenses.

WMC --  This data you have gathered is extraordinarily useful

WMC --  the summaries, or are they from other sources?
WMC --  Wayne McGuire http://www.cybercom.net/~wmcguire

   I have been building CIABASE since 1983 -- I would estimate
I have summarized from source documents close to ninety-nine percent
of the entries.  In the last year or two, with the advent of computerized
publications re intelligence, Web pages and Internet, I selectively
download material but still invariably edit the entries to reflect the
crux of the data.

   In another post you ask where to find categories of information --
below I list some of the categories in CIABASE.

   When I started CIABASE I did not know if the CIA would permit me to
publish it when I submitted it to CIA review (as required by law) in the
early 90s. After a battle they relented, but it was a scary time.

   With today's faster computers I can in a matter of a few seconds
complete a search of the nearly 11 megabytes of information.

   It is a great joy to read CIA denials or claims and within a minute or
two be able to post documented refutations.

   CIABASE search mechanisms allow for various levels of search --
for instance searching for John Deutch I used only the first field
search for "Deutch" and had the data in seconds. Other searches can be
compiled using a combination of subject category, first and second field
and date.

   Normally when one undertakes such a project, one is disappointed
with this or that and wishes it could have been done differently --
this is a problem I do not have (except due to early computer case search
capabilities, I put all entries in upper case -- now this is offensive to
the eyes of Internet).

   If any reader would want to help, pls. let me know. I am inundated
with material and want to keep the data current -- which is increasingly
difficult given all of the material now coming out.

   One negative and ironic note -- with Internet, et al, the small
market for CIABASE has almost dried up.

   My activities, of course, have earned me the enmity of the Agency
and the citizens of Herndon -- one might call Herndon, CIAville --
and all is done to make me feel uncomfortable and wary re law enforcement.
I have been grazed by a car, nearly struck by Herndon police vehicles,
had police cars outside my home when meeting with other CIA critics, had
a policeman verbally threaten me when visiting the local recreational
facility and have been harassed my security officials in shopping malls
-- and on and on.  My protests to Deutch and local officials always seem
to result in additional harassment.

   I do believe that the CIA and its operations have been disastrous
for peoples of the world including we Americans and that all must be
done to expose the terrible consequences of this secret state.

Not to be picky, but there are sufficient unpleasantries in which the
American intelligence community may have been involved without events in
which it had no part being blamed on it.  At least two of the incidents in
the above list (debating whether some of the others are legitimate is not
the point here) had nothing to do with the intelligence community.  I refer
to Ruby Ridge and Waco.  Neither the FBI (except for its
counterintelligence side) nor the ATF are part of the intelligence
community; they are law enforcement functions that, in this country, are
not properly equated with intelligence.

Subject: FBI guidelines & powers: truth, myth, and mystery

As a U.S. citizen concerned with civil liberties and the perennial power
grabs of the national security state, I made a point of obtaining the
Attorney General's Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise
and Domestic Security/Terrorism Investigations by the FBI, and the
corresponding guidelines for FBI Foreign Intelligence/Counterintelligence
and International Terrorism Guidelines.

In particular, I wanted to know what the thresholds for investigation
were and the powers authorized.  This was no idle whim.  The
"intelligence" (as opposed to the criminal) wing of the FBI has a long
history of domestic political spying (and worse) as COINTELPRO and
subsequent COINTELPRO-like operations make clear.  With respect
to the Domestic Security/Terrorism guidelines, I was captivated
by statements made by FBI officials and private intelligence gurus
in the wake of the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing, claiming that the
FBI was hamstrung in investigations of domestic groups and calling
for vast new powers in response to this and other recent events.  These
give some idea of the depths to which ostensibly responsible public
officials and their private sector allies will stoop to alarm and
manipulate the American public.

For example, former Assistant Director of the FBI's New York office,
James Fox, who had only barely retired at the time he made these
remarks, appeared on national television claiming that "you have to
wait until you have blood on the street before the Bureau can act."
Peripatetic intelligence guru Steven Emerson simultaneously made
the rounds of national television news programs, misinforming his
gullible audience of television journalists and national opinion
makers that the FBI is severely restricted in infiltrating known
extremist groups, that it has no terrorism database like the CIA,
and that it is powerless to stop extremist groups masquerading as
"religious" groups.  Whereas Fox surely understood the flagrantly
misleading character of his remarks, one can only speculate on
whether Emerson's comments were deliberate propaganda or merely
the result of an ignorance appalling in someone accepted by the media
establishment as an expert on such matters.

My copy of the AG's Domestic Security/Terrorism guidelines, effective
since 1989 (and active in nearly identical form since William French
Smith issued them in 1983) were provided to me by the Justice Department
in response to a FOIA request.  They are unclassified in their entirety
and they are quite clear on certain relevant points.

For example, these guidelines explicitly state as a matter of general
principle that "when statements advocate criminal activity or indicate
an apparent intent to engage in crime, particularly crimes of violence,
an investigation under these guidelines may be warranted unless it is
apparent, from the circumstances or the context in which the statements
are made, that there is no prospect of harm."  They also state that
"In its efforts to anticipate or prevent crime, the FBI must at times
initiate investigations in advance of criminal conduct."

The lowest threshold for investigatory activity under these guidelines
is for a "preliminary investigation" or "inquiry."  The standard for
this type of investigation requires only that the FBI "receive
information whose responsible handling requires some further scrutiny
beyond the prompt and extremely limited checking out of initial leads.
In such circumstances, though the factual predicate for an investigation
has not been met" the FBI may institute a "preliminary investigation."
This type of investigation may be authorized by an FBI supervisor for up
to 30 days without headquarters approval and for up to 90 days total with
headquarters approval.  During a preliminary investigation, without any
prior authorization by an FBI supervisor, agents may examine FBI records,
other federal state and local government records, examine information
available to or provided by the public; may interview previously
established informants and confidential sources as well as conduct
"interviews of persons who should readily be able to corroborate or deny
the truth of the allegation" (except the subject's employer unless he
is also a complainant); and they may also "conduct physical and
photographic surveillance of any person."

A full investigation may be instituted whenever there is "reasonable
indication" that the applicable federal crime has been, is being,
or will be committed.  The guidelines state that: "The standard of
'reasonable indication' is substantially lower than probable cause.
In determining whether there is reasonable indication of a federal
criminal violation, a Special Agent may take into account any facts or
circumstances that a prudent investigator would consider.  However, the
standard does require specific facts indicating a past, current, or
impending violation...a mere hunch is insufficient."

As pointed out in an excellent analysis dated April 26, 1995, the
Center for National Security Studies noted that nearly two thirds of
the *full* domestic terrorism investigations undertaken since 1983
were opened before a crime had been committed.  The targets of such
investigations have included paramilitary, militia, right-wing, anti-tax,
and anti-government groups, as well as groups operating under a
religious mantle such as a variety of white supremacist groups subsumed
under the "Christian Identity" movement as well as a militant black
group in Miami called the Yahweh Church, and others.

The Center also noted that the FBI has a state of the art, on-line
computer database known as the Terrorist Information System containing
information on over 200,000 individuals and over 3,000 organizations
or enterprises (which numbers include not only subjects of investigation
but also contacts, associates, known or suspected members, and also any
affiliated non-terrorist organizations or enterprises).

More recently the FBI attempted to push through a congressional bill
authorizing in domestic terrorism cases so-called "roving" wiretaps
and also "emergency" wiretaps to be undertaken without a court order.
While this was shot down by a coalition of liberal and conservative
members, it should be noted that the FBI in actuality *already has
these powers* and under considerably more mundane circumstances
than terrorism investigations.

18 U.S.C. 2518 (11)(b) permits the use of electronic surveillance
without specifying the location, provided the federal authorities
demonstrate, to a judge's satisfaction, that the target is attempting
to thwart interception by changing facilities.  According to the 1995
Wiretap Report issued by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
in 1995 four federal intercept applications requesting "roving" wiretaps
allowing prosecutors to target a specific person rather than a specific
telephone or location were made (and granted).  Two of these involved
narcotics investigations in the Northern District of Illinois, and the
other two were employed in kidnapping investigations in the Western
District of Texas.

18 U.S.C. 2518 (7) authorizes emergency intercepts for up to 48 hours
without a court order (provided one is then sought) provided "an
emergency situation exists that involves; immediate danger of death
or serious physical injury to any person, or conspiratorial activities
threatening the national security interest, or conspiratorial activities
characteristic of organized crime."

The real purpose of these proposed "reforms" was simply to obviate
the need for demonstrating the relevant special circumstances to a judge
(whether beforehand, as with roving tap requests, or after the fact,
as in emergency wiretaps).  The establishment media bemoaned the
unholy coalition of "fringe" liberals and conservatives for refusing to
accomodate the Justice Department in removing this one remaining
inconvenience.  Ultimately of course, Congress capitulated on a number
of other, more serious issues, but the press nevertheless criticised
congressional obstructionism for the "seriously weakened" version
ultimately passed.  (See for example Vol. 20, No.2 (June 1996) of
First Principles, an informative quarterly newsletter of the Center for
National Security Studies, available at a reasonable subscription rate:
cnss@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu.  CNSS is a non-profit, non-partisan public
interest organization dedicated to ensuring that civil liberties and
human rights are not eroded in the name of national security.)

The AG's guidelines for FBI Foreign Intelligence/Counterintelligence
Investigations are considerably more mysterious, since large sections
of them remain classified.  One might ask what legitimate reason an
honest U.S. citizen would have for being interested in these guidelines.
The answer is simple.  These guidelines are even less restrictive than
the preceding one (!) and in fact do not even require a criminal
predicate.  Merely talking to the wrong foreigner (wittingly or not)
could draw one into an foreign counterintelligence or international
terrorism investigation.  More specifically, there are documented cases
such as the multi-year international terrorism investigation of CISPES,
an organization which was composed primarily of U.S. persons and which
peacefully objected to the Reagan administration's foreign policies in
Central America; and the ten year investigation of the General Union of
Palestinian Students which ended in 1989 under increasing pressure from
within and without.  In neither case was any terrorist activity found,
nor was CISPES found to be the agent of a foreign power.  (In fact,
the CISPES investigation was originally predicated upon the premise
that CISPES was the unregistered agent of a foreign power, and this
premise was changed to international terrorism as an expedient measure
when CISPES was found NOT to be the agent of a foreign power!)
(The GUPS was explicitly the student wing of the PLO, but was being
investigated as a terrorist organization).

But then, the investigation and prosecution of actual criminal behavior
is often not the focus of these types of investigations; the focus is
often the mere collection of information about groups and individuals
espousing beliefs contrary to U.S. foreign policy (and the collection
of information on their friends, family, and associates), or the
manipulation of movements through infiltration and intimidation.

Some of the redactions in this 32 pages document are quite puzzling.
My administrative appeal of some of these withholdings took over a year,
ending in the release of just two additional paragraphs.  Some of
the remaining redactions are mindbogglingly bizarre, even by the most
anal standards of government classification.

For example, it's impossible to determine the threshold standards for
various types of investigatory activity, because the descriptive labels
for these investigatory activities are blacked out!  For example, one
section reads:

"When information is received that an organization or group substantially
composed of U.S. persons is acting for or on behalf of a foreign power,
********************** investigation of the organization or group should
be directed toward collecting information relating to the relationship
to the foreign power..."

Another section under the heading "Investigations of Groups or
Organizations" reads:

"******************** on a group or organization should be directed
toward acquiring information relating to the group or organization
as a whole."

A later subsection reads:

"In the course of an investigation of a group or organization,
********************* may be conducted on members of the group
or organization..."

Yet another section, dealing with infiltration of groups, states
that one precondition is that the appropriate supervisory personnel
determine that such infiltration:

"is relevant to *********************************************
investigation being conducted under these guidelines or is being
used as the basis for instituting *******************************
investigation."

Even the portions indicating what kind of broad statistical data
shall be kept contain similar deletions.

What investigatory form or measure could be so mysterious as to
require the classification "secret" -- upheld by top level
intelligence policy committees after review?  (Please note that
I am NOT soliciting classified information from ANY current or
former government employee or contractor.)

Well, I suppose you're curious to know what the two declassified and
released paragraphs (previously classified "secret") said.  They came
under a (previously unclassified) heading, "CIA and DOD Activities within
the United States" and read as follows:

A. Whenever the FBI is notified of or asked to coordinate CIA or
Department of Defense (DOD) activities within the United States
involving the clandestine use of any technique directed against
a U.S. person to collect foreign intelligence or counterintelligence
or to implement any special activity, the FBI will evaluate the
proposed activities under established procedures or agreements.

B. The FBI, except in cases where it withholds coordination, will
inform the Office of Policy and Review of the specific facts and
circumstances of such notification or request.  When the Office of
Intelligence Policy and Review deems it appropriate, it will advise or
seek the approval of the Attorney General.  The FBI will not respond
to a notification of or request to coordinate the CIA or DOD activities
that have been referred to the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review
prior to a determination whether to advise or seek the approval of
the Attorney General.

An open inquiry to all....

Does anyone know of any good material on the topics of photanalysis,
ELINT and TECHINT gathering techniques, more specifically, image data,
the kind gathered by spy satellites. I am interested in this topic. Also,
does anyone know of anything the NRO has released, or if anyone has ever
written something on th NRO?
Thank You

Clearly both the FBI and the ATF are deeply involved in
intelligence activities, and engage in significant
cooperation with the American intelligence community as
a whole. Perhaps if one wants to apply creative
bureaucratic abstractions to these matters, one can
argue that the FBI and the ATF are not part of the
American intelligence community. In the real working
world, they are essential components of the community.

In some sense, the entire federal government is an
organ and instrument of the intelligence community.
Certainly CIA insiders take that view. If they didn't,
they wouldn't be very good at their work.

The main point is that the reputation and morale of the
CIA and the FBI are now at an all-time low, as is that
of the American intelligence community in general.

I forget to mention the Richard Jewell case in regard
to the FBI. That was another major screw-up that has
damaged the FBI in the eyes of the American public.
There is also immense public dissatisfaction with the
way the TWA Flight 800 case has been handled. It seems
that the IC can do nothing right these days in the eyes
of the public. It's in a state of free fall.

Matters could get much worse. Some are predicting that
the U.S. could suffer major setbacks in the Mideast at
any time now, and perhaps lose the Mideast altogether.
If that happens, the blame is going to fall fully on
the CIA.

With regard to the FBI, the Filegate scandal is still
percolating and could explode at any time. Janet Reno,
Louis Freeh and Howard Shapiro have a good deal of
explaining to do about Filegate. This issue is not
going to go away, and it serious enough to bring down
the entire Clinton administration.

Ralph,

You deserve all the praise you have received from many
reputable sources. CIABASE is a remarkable resource for
journalists, historians, scholars and ordinary
citizens. It's an amazing piece of work.

If the CIA is somehow upset with CIABASE, they need to
get an attitude adjustment and get it fast. The
Internet is going to change radically the distribution
of information power in the world. Everyone in the
world is going to have at their fingertips the same
information power that was once enjoyed only by the
world's elite intelligence agencies.

The American IC can either be smart and adjust to the
new world information order, or be stupid and throw
tantrums. Nothing is going to stop the information
revolution that is underway--certainly not throwing
snits. Every social change creates new opportunities
for those who are flexible and alert, including for the
IC.

There are widespread rumors that Steven Emerson is
closely associated with the Israeli government and the
Mossad. See, for instance, Robert Friedman's comments
on Emerson in The Nation some time after the Oklahoma
City bombing.

Emerson is quite an intelligence genius: just after the
Oklahoma City bombing he was trying to blame the deed
on Israel's enemies--namely Muslim fundamentalists. The
pattern of wacky misattributions for terrorist acts
among Emerson's political network has continued with
TWA Flight 800 and the Atlanta bombing.

Emerson is one of the finest examples on the planet of
the dangers of allowing ideological messianism to cloud
your ability to conduct objective intelligence
analysis. You should always keep your analysis separate
from your ideological or political agenda; if you
don't, you are sunk. You will inevitably screw up and
screw up big time.

If the American IC continues its current precipitous
and ignominious descent, it will in part be because it
has allowed itself to get drawn into the sort of games
that Steven Emerson is playing and the shoddy methods
he is using.

It is not in the American interest to get sucked into a
holy war with world Islam or to give the Emersons of
the world an opportunity to impose their police state
mentality on American society. This is a free and open
and libertarian country, and that openness is the
source of our strength and vitality. If we allow others
to push us into the armed siege mentality that afflicts
some other nations in the world, we will lose
everything that we most value.

          I would say that both the FBI (especially) and the ATF engage
in domestic intelligence funtions. The FBI keeps "discontinuing" programs
like COINTELPRO, a sort of domestic version of overseas CIA dirty tricks,
but continuing the same kinds of activities under new names. Much of the
FBI's intelligence function, in fact "is not properly equated" with law
enforcement, but is a unconstitutional attack on the First Amendment.
         There is, of course, a sense in which the atrocities at Ruby
Ridge and Waco had nothing to do with intelligence, despite a major role
by the "intelligence" community. Perhaps they are the 90s domestic
versions of the Bay of Pigs.

Subject: Jack Blum on drugs & the national security state

      Commentary: Former Senate special counsel discusses controversy

                          Published: Oct. 23, 1996

                                BY JACK BLUM
                     Scripps-McClatchy Western Service
      When the public outcry for a congressional investigation of CIA
      involvement in drug trafficking arose in response to Gary Webb's
     articles in the San Jose Mercury News, I wanted to say I had been
   there and done that. There is already a detailed Senate report on the
   subject. It followed a two-year investigation that included both open
                 and closed hearings and sworn depositions.

    From January of 1987 to May 1989 I served as the special counsel to
   the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In that capacity I staffed the
       investigation by the Subcommittee on Narcotics, Terrorism and
    International Operations into whether the effort to achieve foreign
      policy objectives had interfered with law enforcement efforts to
           control the flow of narcotics into the United States.

    We found no evidence whatsoever that the African American community
   was the particular target of a plot to sell crack cocaine. Cocaine has
   been and continues to be an equal opportunity destroyer. The flood of
     cocaine that hit the United States in the mid-1980s ruined whites,
              Latinos and African Americans indiscriminately.

    We found no evidence to suggest that people at the highest level of
      the United States government adopted a policy of supporting the
    contras by encouraging drug sales. For the most part the contras on
    the ground were forgotten men, short on both supplies and money. The
   drug trafficking some contras engaged in went to line their pockets --
                     not to help their political cause.

   There was, however, plenty of evidence that policy makers closed their
       eyes to the criminal behavior of some of America's allies and
     supporters in the contra war. The policy makers ignored their drug
     dealing, their stealing, their human rights violations. The policy
       makers allowed them to compensate themselves for helping us by
      remaining silent in the face of their impropriety and by quietly
   undercutting the law enforcement and human rights agencies that might
                        have caused them difficulty.

      What you say about drugs and the contras depends entirely on the
   question you pose. If the question is ''Did the CIA sell crack in the
    inner city to support the contra war?'' the answer is a categorical
    no. If you ask whether the United States government ignored the drug
   problem and subverted law enforcement to prevent embarrassment and to
          reward our allies in the contra war, the answer is yes.

     Those of us involved in the Senate investigation were aware of the
    contra connection to the West Coast cocaine trade. When we tried to
    pursue the investigation, the Justice Department Criminal Division,
   then headed by Bill Weld, fought giving us access to essential records
     and to witnesses in government custody. The Justice Department did
   everything possible to block our investigation. It moved prisoners to
    make them inaccessible, instructed Justice employees not to talk to
   us, punished an assistant U.S. attorney for passing information to the
                               subcommittee.

    Since the publication of Gary Webb's stories in the San Jose Mercury
   News in August, many people have asked why they never heard about our
    investigation. The reason is that we were the target of a systematic
      campaign to discredit our witnesses and the quality of our work.
       Justice Department officials called the press that covered our
   hearings and told them our witnesses were lying. The White House staff
   decribed our work as a ''politically motivated attack.'' Once we were
   attacked the press treated the conclusions with caution and downplayed
                      the testimony of our witnesses.

    Our findings raised issues that needed extensive public discussion.
     The involvement of the covert operations side of the intelligence
      community with drug traffickers and criminals is a long-standing
      problem. The willingness of the foreign policy establishment to
     subordinate every other priority in international relations to the
   crusade against communism created the opportunity for that problem to
                                  fester.

   A careful review of the history of covert operations in the Caribbean
   and South and Central America shows a 40-year connection between crime
     and covert operations that has repeatedly blown back on the United
    States. The same history will show that the operations in the region
        were, for the most part, moral and political failures. Other
     operations in Asia and Europe have had similar consequences -- the
                        worst in the narcotics area.

      Before reviewing that record, it is important to understand why
    criminals have played such a large role in covert activity. Contrary
     to popular literature and belief, the best covert operators do not
    lead revolutions or play a direct role in the societies they seek to
    influence. As a rule, criminal organizations offer covert operations
   many advantages. Criminals are used to staying out of the reach of the
    law. They have identified the corrupt elements of the government and
   suborned them. They know the territory. They are disciplined, flexible
    and open to the profit motive. If you want an illegal job done, and
             are willing to pay, they are ready to go to work.

   For criminal organizations, participating in covert operations offers
      much more than money. They may get a voice in selecting the new
      government. They may get a government that owes them for help in
    coming to power. They may be able to use their connections with the
   United States government to enhance their political power at home and
     to wave off the efforts of the American law enforcement community.

       The problem is how to prevent criminal allies from becoming a
   permanent fixture once the need for them has passed. From time to time
    we have trained groups to run a covert operation. When the operation
    is over we have had a ''disposal'' problem. The difficulty has been
       finding safe and useful work for people trained in the arts of
     killing, smuggling and bomb making. Our disposal efforts have been
       only marginally successful, and covert operations alumni have
   consequently peopled the ranks of criminal organizations for decades.

       The first such marriage of convenience was the Lansky-Luciano
   cooperation with the Office of Naval Intelligence during World War II.
   Meyer Lansky brokered a deal for Lucky Luciano that allowed Luciano to
   be freed on parole and deported to Italy in exchange for intelligence
     information and protection against Axis spies on the docks of New
      York. Luciano delivered, and he was freed to resume his criminal
        career in Sicily. Part of that career included the post-war
               reintroduction of heroin to the United States.

   That was followed by covert assistance to the organized criminal gangs
   in the port of Marseilles. The gangs opposed the Communist unions and
   helped insure that France stayed in the non-Communist world. The gangs
   also went on to become the ''French connection'' in the heroin trade.
   We worked with the Japanese Yakuza to contain the Communists in Japan
          after World War II. The Yakuza became a major source of
                         methamphetamine in Hawaii.

    Khun Sa, the well known leader of the heroin business in the Golden
     Triangle, succeeded in the heroin business because of American and
    French support for remnants of the defeated Kuomintang Chinese army
    that fled across the border to Burma when Mao took over and the rest
      of the nationalists went to Taiwan. We are still living with the
   resulting heroin problem even though Khun Sa has just retired from the
                                   trade.

    The story of the connection between our covert allies in the Vietnam
    War -- especially the hill tribes in Laos -- and the drug trade has
      been documented in Al McCoy's book, ''The Politics of Heroin in
     Southeast Asia'' (Harper & Row, 1972). Returning Vietnam veterans
                 brought a heroin epidemic home with them.

    More recently our efforts in Afghanistan have helped turn the region
   into one of the world's largest producers and exporters of heroin. The
   war focused the Afghan farmers on their best crop -- opium poppy. The
   poppy requires little attention. Opium paste is light weight, is very
    valuable and can be moved to market over high mountains on the backs
     of donkeys. It is the perfect crop for people fighting a guerrilla
                                    war.

    The Latin American story is equally depressing. The Bay of Pigs left
      the United States with both a disposal problem and with criminal
        organizations that thought they had enhanced their power by
   ''helping'' with the problem of Fidel Castro. The CIA ran an enormous
         operation in Miami to keep the Bay of Pigs veterans busy.

    During the Carter administration, when human rights became a public
    priority, we quietly encouraged other countries to act as our proxy.
   The subcommittee took testimony from a former civilian employee of the
    Argentine military government, Leandro Sanchez-Reisse, who described
    how Argentine intelligence officers engineered a coup in Bolivia and
   used the profits from their control of the Bolivian cocaine market to
    finance an anti-Communist ''battalion'' which operated all over the
   continent. He testified that he set up a money laundering operation in
   Fort Lauderdale to provide funds for the covert battalion and claimed
   that our government assisted his efforts. The Argentines were the ones
      who first trained and supported the contra resistance movement.

     Gen. Manuel Noriega was on our payroll even though it seems almost
    everyone knew he was in the drug business. When efforts were made to
    seize his funds at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International on
    the grounds that they were the proceeds of criminal transactions, he
    argued that he at least wanted back his CIA pay. For four long years
    we ignored Noriega's drug trafficking because he was helping us with
         our Nicaraguan problem. The high -- or low -- point of the
     relationship is memorialized by Ollie North in his notebooks. The
       general, North recorded, was willing to assassinate the entire
    Sandinista leadership, if the U.S. would only help him clean up his
                            drug-burdened image.

   We had similar problems in Haiti where intelligence sources of ours in
   the Haitian military turned their facilities over to the drug cartels.
   Instead of putting pressure on the rotten leadership of the military,
                             we defended them.

    Honduras was a key country for the contras. Their base of operation
    was there, and most of their supplies came through the country. When
    Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a notorious drug trafficker, took refuge in
          Honduras, our response was to close the Drug Enforcement
   Administration office there. The subcommittee took testimony from the
   head of the Honduran DEA office who was shifted to Guatemala. He told
    us the move was inexplicable because all the real drug problems were
   in Honduras. He believed the office was closed to protect the corrupt
                     officers who were helping the U.S.

    In sum, we ''paid'' our friends in Central and South America by not
    interfering with their criminal business. The long-term price in my
   view was the solidification of the power of the drug cartels and their
     transformation into wealthy, sophisticated international business
       organizations. But I seriously doubt that this consequence was
     considered or whether the policy was debated in these terms at any
                            level of government.

    As our investigation progressed, we became aware of the connections
    between the intelligence community and the law enforcement agencies.
        We heard that CIA people insisted on screening all of DEA's
   informants. We heard that CIA people sat in on witness interviews and
     trial preparations in important drug cases. We were told there was
      machinery through which the intelligence community could get the
    Customs Service to pass on inspecting both in- and outbound flights.
     On several occasions we documented Oliver North's intervention in
               pending court matters to help our ''friends.''

   Washington should now do what we could not get done: Put the complete
   record of intelligence interference with drug cases during the contra
      war before the public. Covert operations, especially those that
    require the services of drug dealers, should be a matter of absolute
   last resort in moments of national desperation if they are to be used
                                  at all.

    If you go to bed with dogs, you are likely to get up with fleas. If
       you empower criminals because empowering them is helpful, the
    criminals are sure to turn on you eventually. The people who planned
                 covert operations should have known that.

   The most important loss that came as a result of the Central American
       overt/covert war was a loss of public trust in the honesty and
   integrity of the people who run the country's clandestine operations.
    One measure of that is how ready the public is to believe the fables
    told by crack dealer ''Freeway Ricky'' Ross about his role as an arm
    of the CIA in promoting crack in Los Angeles. Ricky deserves life in
   prison for what he did to his own community. The CIA did not make him
      do it, and the profits from his deals went into his own pockets.

     Jack A. Blum is the former special counsel for the Senate Foreign
       Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Narcotics, Terrorism and
      International Operations. This article for the Sacramento Bee is
   adapted from his testimony Oct. 23 before the Senate Select Committee
          on Intelligence on Drug Trafficking and the Contra War.

Subject: postscript on FBI powers & guidelines

In a previous post, referring to the Attorney General's Guidelines on
General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Domestic Security/Terrorism
Investigations, I wrote in part:

>The lowest threshold for investigatory activity under these guidelines
>is for a "preliminary investigation" or "inquiry."  The standard for
>this type of investigation requires only that the FBI "receive
>information whose responsible handling requires some further scrutiny
>beyond the prompt and extremely limited checking out of initial leads.
>In such circumstances, though the factual predicate for a [full]
>investigation has not been met" the FBI may institute a "preliminary
>investigation."
>
>This type of investigation may be authorized by an FBI supervisor for up
>to 30 days without headquarters approval and for up to 90 days total with
>headquarters approval.  During a preliminary investigation, without any
>prior authorization by an FBI supervisor, agents may examine FBI records,
>other federal state and local government records, examine information
>available to or provided by the public; may interview previously
>established informants and confidential sources as well as conduct
>"interviews of persons who should readily be able to corroborate or deny
>the truth of the allegation" (except the subject's employer unless he
>is also a complainant); and they may also "conduct physical and
>photographic surveillance of any person."

In fact, this actually understates the powers of the FBI during a
preliminary investigation.  As noted above, those actions can be taken
by agents *without* any prior authorization from a supervisory agent.
With approval of appropriate supervisory personnel, these guidelines
approve for use in preliminary investigations any other lawful
investigatory methods, with the sole exceptions of mail covers (the
copying of addresses off of envelopes), mail openings, and nonconsensual
electronic surveillance.

As a final comment on these guidelines, bear in mind that they "are
set forth solely for the purpose of internal Department of Justice
guidance.  They are not intended to, do not, and may not be relied
upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable
at law by any party in any manner, nor do they place any limitation
on otherwise lawful investigative and litigative prerogatives of the
Department of Justice."  In other words, the enforcement of even
these lax guidelines is solely at the discretion of the Department
of Justice.

  1. CIA at War With Islam (4)

Date:    Mon, 18 Nov 1996 08:44:50 -0800
From:    Ralph McGehee <rmcgehee@IGC.APC.ORG>
Subject: CIA at War With Islam

               THE CIA AT WAR WITH ISLAM

   Apparently there was considerable anger generated by my
earlier posts re DCI John Deutch wherein I defined paramilitary
operations as operations that use civilians to kill those
opposed to the goals of the covert actions. I did bother in
those posts to list sourced data -- a few of these are provided
below.

   I also noted that large-scale CIA paramilitary operations
inevitably produce massive increases in the world's drug traffic.
This to me is beyond need of authenticating.  For those who still
doubt this claim I suggest you read Professor McCoy's book, "The
Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade," or read
the frequently posted testimony of Jack Blum, former chief investigator
for the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that investigated Contra
drug-running in 1989.

   One thought I did not post earlier was that the large-scale operation
in Afghanistan/Pakistan in the eighties produced a generation of radical
Islamic fundamentalist/terrorists throughout the Middle East. (An operation
that made Afhganistan a moonscape.) We seem never to learn and are again
supporting such groups and actions.

   It seems now that our first effort against any perceived threat is
covert action ala Colonel Lansdale and his protege, John Deutch. So now
we, at DCI Deutch's operational behest, with "intelligence" provided by his
CIA, conduct more paramilitary operations to ravage the Middle East and
the Sudan in Africa.

   It is relevant to note that CIA's policy now more closely aligns
with Israel's militant policy re terrorism.

CIABASE

  95-96  "tremendous growth in terrorism" to keep CIA afloat. dci deutch's
  1/16/96 testimony to the house select intel committee was a concentrated
  effort to justify deutch's cabinet level status as dci, "director of
  central intel," to flash up "buzz words" to keep CIA in money and to
  reserve an intel field that pentagon won't take away from it. CIA has
  either missed boat again or is talking though its hat. re russia and china.
  u.s. intel experts -- and hopefully members of house select intel
  committee -- know that CIA will not be "paying its closest attention"
  to military developments in china and russia and shouldn't justify its
  budget on that basis. that's where the "buzz words" terrorism, drug
  trafficking, weapons smuggling, organized crime and religious fanaticism
  come in, and the traditional "bogeymen":  iran, iraq, north korea and
  libya. intelligence - a computerized intelligence newsletter published in
  france 1/22/96 41

  middle east,  96  clinton adm considering a more activist policy that could
  include preemptive strikes and expanded covert counter-terror ops. to some
  the main threat comes from a murky net of home-grown, privately-financed
  and largely independent groups a kind of international terrorists internet.
  net extremely difficult for u.s. intel agencies to locate and penetrate.
  dci deutch said CIA drawing up list of military options "to act against
  terrorist groups directly either to prevent them from carrying out ops or
  to retaliate against groups we know are responsible for ops." philip c.
  wilcox, who heads state's counter-terrorism office says, however,
  role of states in promoting terrorism is in sharp decline." israel has
  a militant policy against terrorism. washington post 10/17/96 a25

sudan

  sudan, eritrea, ethiopia, uganda,  96  CIA sending military equipment to
  ethioia, eritrea, and uganda to support sudanese opposition groups
  preparing a joint offensive to topple the khartoum government. much of the
  aid consists of basic items suitable for outfitting a guerrilla force. in
  april 96 john m. deutch spent three days in addis ababa. the CIA and the
  nsc have been driving force behind the tougher line. all three countries
  are supporting the sudan people's liberation army led by john garang, and
  eritrea is helping it and two other rebel groups launch a new offensive.
  more than 3000 sudanese rebels are marshaling in eritrea for a joint
  offensive aimed at cutting the road from khartoum to port sudan. washington
  post 11/10/96 a34

  sudan,  95-96  has emerged as a clear threat to stability of nearby africa
  and middle eastern states because of its support for subversive activities
  of regional opposition groups. threat is likely to remain as long as the
  national islamic front (nif) is the dominant political force in country. in
  its effort to spread its version of islamic fundamentalism beyond sudan and
  destabilize regional moderate gvts friendly to us, nif supports insurgent
  and terrorist groups opposed to gvt of egypt, eritrea, ethiopia, and
  uganda. sudan also provides safehaven and limited material support to other
  radical groups such as hizballah, hamas, abu nidal organization, and the
  armed algerian extremist groups. from dci john deutch's "worldwide threat
  assessment brief to the ssci" on 2/22/96. iwr 2/24/96

  libya,  90-96  fundamentalist rebels are CIA assets. the armed conflict
  in jabal akhdar mountains in eastern libya is a CIA covert op backing
  col. khalifa haftar and the libyan national army, the armed wing of the
  salvation front of liberation of libya which has been financed in the past
  by CIA. these CIA "assets" have supposedly joined up with escaped prisoners

I think your defining paramilitary/covert actions that way just displays a
particular anathema for them; that's ok, we are al entitled to an opinion,
but in terms of reflecting accurately the goals of covert ops, I would
hope that you would agree taht it is a bit of an oversimplification at
best.  Again, this is not to discount or even take issue with some of your
specific points, just that it does not do complete justice to the concept
as it exists i reality.

For those interested, Mr. McCoy has written an article on this subject
published in the latest issue of "Foreign Service Journal," the magazine
published by the Foreign Service Officer's union, AFSA.

I would look further into the alleged link between the Saudis and the
Taliban.  And while Pakistan's official denial of support wears a bit
thin, be careful not to assume that some of these actors in the region
have their own agendas quite independent of U.S. policy.  To imply that
these "poor brown brothers" somehow lack political finesse and an acute
awareness of international relations and are mere dupes of the omnipresent
hand of the U.S./CIA smacks of the same kind of paternalism that begat
colonialism in the first place.  Just my $.02 on general principles.

This is not quite a completely accurate picture.  The U.S. has been
pressing for a cease-fire between all factions.  The fact that the U.S.
has maintained contact with the Taliban as well as the Dostam/Rabbani
factions only underscores that it is not quite clear who is going to end
up "in charge" in Afghanistan.  Maintaining contact with all factions
seems logical, as 1) none is more or less anti/pro U.S. than any of the
others, and 2) it makes no sense to back one side without a very good
reason/possible political gain.  There is not currently a strong strategic
interest in Afghanistan (as long as the other 'Stans in the former USSR
remain on a relatively pro-western path.

Interestingly, and what I think is an important omission in most reports,
is that the U.S. in the past year has found itself on the same "side" as
Iran on several issues: Bosnia, the moderation of the Taliban, and the PUK
in Iraq.  What has also received short schrift is the fact the the U.S.
has made entreaties at the under secretary level -- which were rejected
by Iran -- for talks on a possible resumption of relations.  This should
at a minimum give caution to those seeking to prove a consistenlty
negative U.S. role in the region.

True, but be wary of simply assuming this support has continued.  In sum,
your connection from point A (ISI support) to point B (CIA support now) is
rather thin.

ABC News Nightline had a program this evening (11-19-96) on the U.S.
policy of providing a variety of surplus military equipment to the Bosnian
army: everything from tens of thousands of M-16s to two score tanks with
infra-red night scopes; as well as training the Bosnians' officer corps
in leadership, strategy and tactics.  The price for this was the severance
of ties to Iran.  Nightline noted that in fact just this week a Bosnian
cabinet minister seen as sympathetic (or receptive) to Iran was fired --
at U.S. insistence.  So, it would seem that in Bosnia the U.S. is less
on the side of Iran and more interested in co-opting Iran's position
as a way of undercutting the Great Iblis.  This is the very same
knee-jerk foreign policy which has caused so many problems in the
long run in the past.  Whether arming and training the Bosnians to
ostensible military parity will produce a lasting bilateral detente,
as the U.S. suggests, or whether it will encourage the Bosnians to
expand attempts to resettle areas previously "cleansed" by the Serbs
and perhaps lead to a new outbreak of war once the peacekeeping force
leaves, as our European allies fear, only time will tell.

The Taliban has, until very recently, been opposed to Iran: not only are
they Sunni fanatics (as opposed to Iran's Shiite fanatics), but they
are also under the strong influence of our ally Pakistan.  Early on
in fact the U.S. seemed to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate
government of Afghanistan, at least until it made a blatant international
embarassment of itself.  The initial U.S. State Department response was
to downplay reports of Taliban barbarisms.  Then, under great public
pressure both domestically and internationally, State has altered
its rhetoric.  At the same time, however, the Taliban and Iran have
recently made something of a rapprochement.  It would seem, then, that we
were on opposite sides to begin with, and are now on opposite sides once
again.  And once again, U.S. foreign policy was based upon the same
knee-jerk theory -- the same one which has been in operation since
the end of WW II -- which held that any group rhetorically opposed to our
Enemy of the Day must be, if not a splendid bunch of chaps, then at least
someone we ought to support.

As for Iraqi Kurdish factions, it is my understanding that the CIA
backed both of them, both the victims of Hussein's attacks and their
Machiavellian competitors who decided to invite him in.  The fact that
Iran was offering nominal support to at least one of them only further
of our own Machiavellian pragmatism.  Since the only threat given higher
priority than the Great Iblis is that presented by Mr. Saddam Hitler II,
it's only good sense to enter into an uneasy, limited cooperation with
the former, provided it could be accomplished without too much public
notice.

ABC News Nightline had a program this evening (11-19-96) on the U.S.
policy of providing a variety of surplus military equipment to the Bosnian
army: everything from tens of thousands of M-16s to two score tanks with
infra-red night scopes; as well as training the Bosnians' officer corps
in leadership, strategy and tactics.  The price for this was the severance
of ties to Iran.  Nightline noted that in fact just this week a Bosnian
cabinet minister seen as sympathetic (or receptive) to Iran was fired --
at U.S. insistence.  So, it would seem that in Bosnia the U.S. is less
on the side of Iran and more interested in co-opting Iran's position
as a way of undercutting the Great Iblis.  This is the very same
knee-jerk foreign policy which has caused so many problems in the
long run in the past.  Whether arming and training the Bosnians to
ostensible military parity will produce a lasting bilateral detente,
as the U.S. suggests, or whether it will encourage the Bosnians to
expand attempts to resettle areas previously "cleansed" by the Serbs
and perhaps lead to a new outbreak of war once the peacekeeping force
leaves, as our European allies fear, only time will tell.

The Taliban has, until very recently, been opposed to Iran: not only are
they Sunni fanatics (as opposed to Iran's Shiite fanatics), but they
are also under the strong influence of our ally Pakistan.  Early on
in fact the U.S. seemed to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate
government of Afghanistan, at least until it made a blatant international
embarassment of itself.  The initial U.S. State Department response was
to downplay reports of Taliban barbarisms.  Then, under great public
pressure both domestically and internationally, State has altered
its rhetoric.  At the same time, however, the Taliban and Iran have
recently made something of a rapprochement.  It would seem, then, that we
were on opposite sides to begin with, and are now on opposite sides once
again.  And once again, U.S. foreign policy was based upon the same
knee-jerk theory -- the same one which has been in operation since
the end of WW II -- which held that any group rhetorically opposed to our
Enemy of the Day must be, if not a splendid bunch of chaps, then at least
someone we ought to support.

As for Iraqi Kurdish factions, it is my understanding that the CIA
backed both of them, both the victims of Hussein's attacks and their
Machiavellian competitors who decided to invite him in.  The fact that
Iran was offering nominal support to at least one of them only further
demonstrates the extent of our own Machiavellian pragmatism.  Since the
only threat given higher priority than the Great Iblis is that presented
by Mr. Saddam Hitler II, it's only good sense to enter into an uneasy,
limited cooperation with the former, provided it could be accomplished
without too much public notice.  This last item is very important.  You
have to remember that during the middle of the 1980s, at the very time at
which the Reagan administration was rabidly excoriating Iran as the
fountainhead of international terrorism, it was secretly transferring
large quantities of arms to it, including hundreds of TOW and Hawk
missiles.  That's how U.S. policy makers think: all rhetoric about a
government "by, for, and of the people" aside, the great unwashed masses
are cynically regarded by U.S. politicians either as tools to be
manipulated into validating a hidden agenda, or as sheep to be kept
ignorant of the affairs of their betters.  Meanwhile, our civilians and
grunts take it on the chin in the world of endless enemies we create,
while the bosses stay at home, play golf, and review the latest speech
some PR hack has written for them.

The U.S. did a great deal more than maintain contact with them.  On
September 27, Glyn Davies, a State Department spokesman, said the United
States wanted to send diplomats to Afghanistan to meet with the Taliban,
and held out the possibility of re-establishing full diplomatic ties.
(New York Times, 10-23-96).  John Holtzman, the charge d'affaires in the
U.S. Embassy in Pakistan, had scheduled a meeting with Taliban leaders for
October 3. (ibid.)  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel had
already met twice with Taliban leaders earlier in the year.

But after consequent public pressure (and after it became clear that
the Taliban's victory was by no means irreversible), U.S. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns issued a public statement reversing the previous
position, saying there was no thought of upgrading diplomatic ties and
expressing concern about the Taliban's human rights record; and Washington
canceled Holtzman's trip.

The impression created by Washington's initially receptive remarks
was so deep and so widespread that the U.S. government felt the need
to issue a statement: "The last thing we wanted to do was fuel this total
misperception that we were recognizing and embracing the Taliban," a
senior State Department official said, the Times reported.

The Times also reported that "the shifting of the administration's position
coincided with a similar shift by Unocal Corp., the U.S. oil company,
which is working with Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil Co. to build a gas pipeline
and an oil pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through parts of
Afghanistan under the Taliban's control...The Clinton administration has
pushed the project, and President Clinton himself last year personally
urged President Saparmurat A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan to sign a contract
for it, a senior administration official said."

Unocal's Executive Vice-President, Chris Taggart, described the Taliban's
capture of Kabul as "very positive" and urged the U.S. to formally
recognize them.  After the State Department flip-flopped, company
officials issued a statement claiming that Taggart was misquoted.
"We are fanatically neutral when it comes to politics" said Marty Miller,
another Unocal VP.  Yeah, sure.  Big oil companies are known for
their fanatical neutrality in politics.

On the contrary, as my comments above show, we were ready to recognize
the Taliban until it became tactically and politically inconvenient.
The U.S. is virulently anti-Iranian and one of its chief goals in
this region is to cut Iran out of oil and gas transit deals.  (Note:
in August the President signed the Iran-Libya Sanctions act, which imposes
sanctions on foreign companies investing in Iran's or Libya's petroleum
industries.)  More broadly, the U.S. goal is to block and reduce Iranian
influence worldwide.  And as the Times noted, "the Taliban have been
anti-Iranian, while some of the other factions in Afghanistan have had
good relations with Iran."

The U.S. also expressed support for the Taliban ostensibly because
it would have controlled Afghan "terrorist camps" and curbed opium
production, according to the Times: "To the extent there was a sense
that a Taliban victory might be positive, it was focused on ending the
anarchy and controlling terrorist camps and drugs," a senior State
Department official said.

So, the U.S. was never really neutral.  But its claims regarding
its motives vis a vis the drug trade were specious.  The Times reported
that the Taliban has had control for more than a year over the Helmand
Valley, where vast amounts of opium poppy are grown.  And while its
opposition to Shiite factions *might* have some effect on the flavor of
any terrorist camps operating within Afghanistan -- assuming these
exist -- its rabid fundamentalism makes it a poor bet in general.

According to the Washington Post (11-4-96), the United States immediately
rejected a proposal by Iran that the two jointly mediate an end to
military conflict in Afghanistan.  U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns, in issuing a statement, affirmed the U.S. government's
bizarre obsession with Iran, calling it "a uniquely perverse place."
The fact that Iran successfully overthrew the CIA installed puppet
government of the Shah, nationalized its oil companies, and has rubbed
our nose in it ever since, may have some relevance to the U.S. attitude.

As Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's embassador to the United Nations wrote in
his Washington Post piece: "Whether in Afghanistan, Tajikistan or in
Azerbaijan and Armenia, Iran's efforts at conciliation for political
settlement of disputes invariably have faced overt and covert U.S.
sabotage."  It is indisputably true that the U.S. sabotages Iran,
politically, diplomatically, and covertly, whenever possible.  Far from
"specious," my characterization of U.S. foreign policy with respect to
Iran, in Afghanistan and beyond, is quite accurate.

The Post also reported that at the same time the U.S. turned down Iran's
offer of joint mediation, the U.S. spokesman urged Turkey to shelve an
agreement to buy natural gas worth $20 million from Iran.  No wonder
Iran wants to talk with us through a third party.

>I would further add that any rapproachment you might be seeing between
>the Taliban an Iran is premature at best.

In claiming a rapprochement between Iran and the Taliban, I may have
misrepresented the facts.  I can't seem to find the reference and my
memory is a bit fuzzy on the details.

Taking meetings with the Taliban and characterizing that as U.S. support
for the same stretches somewhat the reality of the situation.  The U.S has
sought and maintained contacts with all factions (about ten of them,
without exaggeration) and has given teh same talking points to all:  solve
the dispute without force, form a broad based government, curb tendencies
toward extremism vis-a-vis interpretations of Islam.  Factually, what you
are reporting is accurate, but the analysis minimizes the importance of
what has been stated, before the Taliban threatened Kabul, as U.S. policy.

I would say the clarification was not due to the U.S. somehow seeing its
"horse" as not coming in; rather, I was quite surprised by the attention
in media to Afghanistan.  It merely confirmed what I said in the previous
post: the U.S. does not want to be left out in the cold if the Taliban is
winds up being successful in Afghanistan.  But they are but one player
and the only one that was making headlines.  Hence, any contact with the
Taliban (no reports about simialr meetings with other faction leaders hit
the news) was scaled back as it was clear the impression being given was
as you have stated.

It is definitely true that the U.S. would like to reopen Kabul, and would
be prepared to deal with the Taliban IF they are ultimately successful.
Should that not be the case?  I would certainly see it as faulty policy if
the U.S. were to again start taking the position that because we don't
like them, we'll shut our eyes and pretend they don't exist.  At any rate,
does U.S. diplomats meeting with Dostam and Masoud also mean we are
supporting them too?  This is my point: we are (finally) doing it right by
keeping options open.  It would be a far stretch given our interests and
limitations to try to play Kingmaker in Afghanistan.

Again, I would say the "shifting" of the position is a non-issue.  There
was no position that was shifted from, only a repeated clarification of
what our policy actually is.

Sigh.  The "flip-flop" as reported definitely underscores a major
problem:  that the State Department is not successfully getting its
message out on the public diplomacy front.  I can make no claim as to what
the "oil company big-wig" said or meant.

Unfortunately, your comments do not show that.  They merely repeat what
has been published, with an interpretation that highlights contacts with
the Taliban, minimizes or even ignores our contacts with other groups, and
postualtes an "anti-Iranian" element that while not necessarily
antithetical to U.S. policy, does not jive with what is actually happening
in our relations with either Pakistan (which is definitely wary of Iranian
support for some of the groups in Afghanistan -- a point missing from your
analysis and one further complicated by the fact that WE are talking to
them, too) or with the various Afghan groups.

And we have maintained contact with all of them . . .

Yes, because the Taliban looked like they might be actually able to govern
the country and the people appeared to be quite supportive of them.
However, had the government managed to do the same thing, I dare say we
would have said the same thing.  Again, my very simple point is that we
maintained contacts with all of them because it was painfully clear that
no one knew who was going to come out on top.  There were even ideas
floated about the former King of Afghanistan (now in Rome, I believe)
coming back to form a governmetn with all parties to be included -- the
goal: anything to stop the fighting and allow an effective government to,
well, _govern_.

This remains to be seen.  The drug money is attractive to all sides (and
all have played there role in it) so I would not say that any one faction
will mean that this issue will dry up.  As to the "terrorist camps" be
careful:  Shia and Terrorist are not synonymous, and if you look at where
some major terror activities are going on a few steps to the east in that
there region, you'll find Sunnis, not Shias.

Iranian efforts at peaceful settlement in Tadjikistan?  U.S. covert
support for one side or the other in the Armenian-Azeri conflict?  I would
say that stretches the limits of credulity there.  The extent to which
those areas and issues are even on our radar screens is peripheral to the
current messes we are in at best.  You are of course correct that the U.S.
is currently no friend of Iran.  You are incorrect in viewing the Taliban
as a U.S. puppet somehow designed and created by the USG to put a thorn in
Iran's paw.  Also completely omitted is Iran's involvement in at least one
of those areas.  I would only hope that the educated public will take the
USG at its word in its stated policy as readily as some do the word of the
Iranian ambassador.

Perhaps the various offers/counter-offers for talks between the U.S are
the first small steps to what many hope will be the restoration of
relations.  You made earlier mention of the Shah's overthrow etc., and
that is definitely an issue.  Let us not forget the hostage-taking and the
scar that has left.  Also, let us not confuse the authoritarian rule under
the Shah and the current regime in Iran as too dissimilar in how they
handle democracy and dissent.  But your point is well taken in general
that, at some point, there must be a return to constructive dialogue.  My
only thought on that is that it takes two to tango.

Actually, and not to make your point for you, it is most likely that Iran
is seeking its own feelers with the Taliban.  I certainly would not call
your statement a "misrepresentation" (I hae a much more charitable view of
your postings) But I hope I have somewhat clarified my point that Iran's
engaging them is no more evidence of "support" for the Taliban than our

For someone who implies an insider's view of diplomacy, you are singularly
insensitive to its nuances.  There is a great deal of difference between
"maintaining contact" and the recognition implied by meetings with
this collection of important U.S. officials (both before and after the
Taliban took power), not to mention the recognition implied by official
public statements by the State Department announcing that the U.S. was
considering the establishment of full diplomatic relations with the
Taliban.  Furthermore, once the Taliban came to power, these gestures
took on an inherently different character, unquestionably that of
state level negotiations between two governments, rather than mere
neutral "contacts".

If you have evidence that the contacts maintained by the U.S. with
all the other factions were at the same diplomatic levels, please
cite checkable references and provide quotes to support your
interpretation -- not that this would change the character of U.S.
overtures *after* the Taliban came to power.  You will also need to
provide evidence that my source, the New York Times, grossly
mischaracterized the September 27 remarks of U.S. State Department
spokesman Glyn Davies.  My description was taken verbatim from the
Times.

If the U.S. position vis a vis the Taliban was so defensible, why did
it scurry away from this position once it became known, canceling
meetings, retracting its statement that full diplomatic relations were
contemplated, and making a number of other retreats which I did not
bother to quote but which are available to anyone who cares to read the
Times story I cited?  And if, as you acknowledge above, the U.S. was
prepared to recognize the Taliban had the situation not degenerated
both for the Taliban and for the U.S. administration, does not your
objection to the Times' characterization become inconsistent?  Either
the U.S. was or was not considering the extension of full diplomatic
relations. If it was, as indeed its own spokesman publicly stated, and
if you believe this position to be defensible, then precisely what is
your complaint?  You can't have it both ways.

Yet our position with respect to the various Afghani factions was hardly
neutral.  We had a definite preference for the Taliban, for a variety
of reasons including but not limited to: (a) its antithetical attitude
toward Iran; (b) its client relationship with our client, Pakistan;
(c) its control of land necessary for our oil and gas transit deals;
(d) its self-serving and specious anti-drug and anti-terrorism rhetoric;
(e) the fact that it looked as though it was going to be the winner, and
would bring "stability" to the country for our commercial and other
interests.  There is also an important distinction between having a
preference and "playing Kingmaker."  The extent of covert support for
the Taliban, provided by the U.S. through the Pakistanis (or more
indirectly still) is currently unknown, and will likely remain unknown
for years if not decades.

I haven't said that the U.S. has had no contact with other groups.  I
said that the U.S. had a number of motives for viewing a Taliban
victory favorably, that it publicly and diplomatically expressed this
favor, and that it reversed itself when the tenuous military position
of the Taliban became clear and when its barbaric social policies
became a campaign year liability for the Clinton administration, which
was courting the swing vote of "Soccer Mom" Republicans and of women in
general (who, as a group, were one of his most supportive large
constituencies).

As I said above, it was already clear that the Taliban would not make
good its promises, since it has held control of the Helmand Valley for
more than a year without any cessation or decrease of opium production
from that region.  As for terrorist camps, I was quite careful: I even
went so far as to regard the very existence of terrorist camps in
Afghanistan as an open question.  Nor did I state or imply that
Shiites (or Muslims in general) are synonymous with terrorists, nor that
Sunnis are incapable of it.  I simply said that if such camps exist
in Afghanistan, the flavor (i.e., Shiite, Sunni, or other) might be
altered by the Taliban but that the Taliban was an unlikely ally in
broader, non-factional anti-terrorist measures.

Please do not indulge in gross mischaracterizations.  I have neither
written nor implied that the Taliban is a U.S. puppet put into power
in order to annoy Iran.  Even assuming U.S. covert support, this would be
an egregious oversimplification.  I merely stated that, as a matter of
public knowledge, one of the reasons the U.S. has viewed the anti-Iranian
Taliban more favorably than it has viewed competing factions less hostile
to Iran is that it HAS been firmly anti-Iranian.

I do in fact take the word of the U.S. Government in its stated
policy, at least in its initial statements about the Taliban.  I merely
take issue with its disingenuous "clarifications" of these earlier
statements.  As for the Iranian ambassador, it should be obvious to
anyone paying attention to world events that, in general, the Iranian
ambassador to the U.N. is no less of a liar and a charlatan than is his
U.S. counterpart.  But even a stopped clock is correct twice a day, and
I don't need the Iranian ambassador to confirm that the United States
has a hostile overt AND covert action policy toward Iran whenever and
wherever Iran attempts to influence events.

The taking of civilian hostages, particularly under abusive conditions
for a prolonged period of time, is inarguably a cowardly and depraved
act.  The fact that Iran under the Mullahs is comparable in its police
state authoritarianism to Iran under the Shah is also clear.  I do
not even claim that we should normalize relations with Iran.  I merely
point out that we have had and do have normal, even friendly relations
with regimes whose turpitude equals or exceeds that of the revolutionary
government of Iran, some of whom have even victimized the U.S.  My
point was to observe the curious inconsistency between U.S. rhetoric
and U.S. actions and to note explanatory factors.  I believe that
U.S. psychology with respect to Iran is on a par with that involving
Cuba and other third world states which have dared to oppose the U.S.
and survived to gloat about it.

Subject: Re: CIA at War With Islam

Rather than beat a dead horse and clog this post with even more editing,
let me succintly point out what has been the position of the USG, as far
as I know it.  I would also add that I imply no insider knowledge of
anything, and that anything in my posts should be pretty much common
knowledge or is flagged as my humble opinion.

The crux of my disagreement I think is that you seem to be focusing on
U.S. support for the Taliban, and present as evidence your interpretation
of USG spokesman comments.  I would note that I am reading the same
language, and cannot in any reasonalbe way come to the same conclusions.
That the USG said it would dela with the Taliban if they became the
defacto rulers in Afghanistan is simply common sense.  Somehow construing
this as "backing" the Taliban is indeed a leap not justified by the facts.
You mentioned being aware in diplomacy of "nuances."  One must also be
aware of ambiguity, which is part and parcel at times of policy making.
One must also be careful not to be so intent on finding an answer and
piecing together some Metternichian grand design that he relys more on
what lies "between the lines" than the simple facts at hand.  Or as Freud
might say, "sometimes a banana is just a banana."

At any rate, you view the comments you have read as supporting evidence
for U.S. "support" for the Taliban, implying covert aid but failing to
mention any particulars.  All I can say is that such a supposition should
require more than what USG policy has been declared to be to date.  In
sum, the U.S. has:

- pursued contact with all factions, but provided support to none of them,

- acknowledged the Taliban's capture of Kabul as making them likely to be
the ultimate authority in Afghanistan, ane expressed hope that IF the
Taliban does become "the Government" that we will somehow be able to work
with them,

- as well as with the other factions, consistently raised the drug issue
and supported UN efforts to track eradication efforts (albeit somewhat
unsuccessfully) through the UNDP,

- urged moderation of policies inimical to our fundamental concepts for
democracy, particulary vis-a-vis women.

If this is tantamount in your mind to providing aid and comfort,
supporting, or even favoring the Taliban, then there is little I can do to
dispute your claims.  I can however, post for you the unclassified talking
points that were distributed to Embassies in the region that summed up our
policy vis-a-vis the Taliban, not as a rebuttle to your arguments - as I
think you have made up your mind on this issue -, but for your further
edification.  Therefore, I'll post them titled accordingly on
Sunday/Monday.

  leaders with the authority of its alliance, CIA provides protection that a
  drug lord can use to expand his share of traffic. thru alliance he gains

Subject: Re: CIA at War With Islam

While this discussion has been going on, I have twice begun efforts to
comment on the differences between the points of view being expressed.
Neither effort achieved its purpose and, accordingly, was wiped.  That was
fortuitous, as Mr. Birdsey has done an excellent job of reiterating his
position in direct contrast to the opposing view.  His analysis is on the
mark and reflects the kind of common sense approach to interpretation of
events that has been the hallmark of his posts over time.

Two points:  1) It is unfair to imply that Mr. Birdsey pretends to insider
knowledge; he has not done so even by the broadest interpretation of his
comments.  And 2) too many people ask the remarks made by U.S. Government's
spokespersons to carry too much weight.  It is usually preferable to stick
to the language of their statements and to pay strict attention to the
qualifiers they use.

The article is currently at work.  I will try to piece together a
reasonable "review" of the main points when I go to the office on Sunday.
His take on the issue is a bit broader that in his previous work, and
basically puts it in the framework of an economic question that makes one
dubious of just what can be done to really affect the trade.

I do not intend to turn this discussion into a personal appraisal of
list members.  However, let's be clear: at no time did I suggest that
Mr. Birdsey *pretended* anything.  I said that he implied an insider's
knowledge of diplomacy; or so I inferred from his remarks.  In future,
please stick to the language of my statements and pay strict attention
to the qualifiers I use.  :>

As for your item #2, I believe that public statements by the official
spokesmen of the U.S. State Department carry considerable weight,
at least where those statements express the U.S. diplomatic posture.
It would seem to me that in counseling us to discount official public
statements while paying strict attention to them, you are dangerously
close to the position of the Alice-in-Wonderland character who said:
"Words mean what I say they do -- no more and no less."

You aren't flogging a dead horse: you're applying rouge & lipstick and
presenting it as Betty Grable.  I originally wrote that the USG "seemed
to recognize the Taliban," and its initial actions and statements more
than bear this out.  After meticulously documenting my points, I am no
longer concerned with your impotent misrepresentations of my remarks,
and will not therefore bother to deconstruct this latest obfuscatory
exercise.  I challenged you to provide specific information supporting
your counter-claims, citing checkable sources and providing quotes to
support your interpretation.  You have not provided evidence that the
New York Times misreported U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies'
official statements of Sept. 27.  You have not provided evidence that
U.S. contacts with the other Afghani factions were at the diplomatic
level of our contacts with the Taliban.  You have not explained how
these gestures, made after the Taliban came to power but before the
other major factions joined and took up arms against it, could be viewed
as anything other than state level negotiations -- with all that implies.

Subject: CIA's War on Islam Part II

                 CIA'S WAR ON ISLAM PART II

   I have frequently speculated here and other places why DCI Deutch
appointed David Cohen to the CIA's most sensitive and important
position.  He named David Cohen to be the Director of Operations
-- that element of the CIA that both collects intelligence and runs
covert operations. David Cohen is on record by even a CIA internal
investigation of gross manipulation of intelligence to support policy
-- this man should have been fired, but instead he promotes him to
the CIA's most powerful position -- why?

   Deutch apparently wanted a man after his own heart -- one who
would give him the "intelligence" he needed as he initiated his
paramilitary operations against the various countries of the
Middle East and Africa. Deutch is on record many times saying he
wanted more covert operations and he is getting them -- supported
by contrived intelligence.

   To me Cohen's elevation proves my contention that the CIA
exists to support policy and that its intelligence in all
cases related to policy is manipulated to support those policies.
Below are severely limited entries in CIABASE re Paramilitary
operations.

   In my first post re the CIA's War on Islam, I stated paramilitary
operations arm civilians to kill those opposed to our policies -- the below
clips prove that statement.

   I also claimed that paramilitary operations massively contributed
to drug trafficking -- the material from McCoy's books, posted earlier,
documents this phenomenon. Many other sources exist but his is the
clearest and most comprehensive. For the skeptics, I suggest the book
by a former DEA officer Celerino Castillo III, POWDERBURNS, COCAINE,
CONTRAS, AND THE DRUG WAR.

   Lastly, I claim that paramilitary operations in Afghanistan in the
eighties, created the "International Terrorist," movement that now
justifies the existence of the CIA. The former factor is admitted by
even Administration spokesmen as we sponsor more Islamic radical
fundamentalists and others in the Middle East and Africa.  The
CIA continues to build the force that it will use to justify its
future.  The Past is Prologue.

Perhaps you chose the word "impotent" due to my earlier Freud reference; I
will assume you are being good natured, although I would add that if you
wish to view our exchange as some sort of "contest," then you may indeed
be better off not being "concerned" with my differing opinion.  You seem
to wish me to prove a negative: that we are not favoring the Taliban.  I
would only suggest that the burden under standard forensic rules is that
you prove your positive statement.  While you indeed have meticulously
provided factual statements from the press, etc., (ironically, the same
notes I view as underscoring my points), it is your interpretation that I
dffer with.

Please let us keep this on a more professional level in our
respective tones.  I am an honest interlocutor.  Please don't characterize
me as 1) implying, as you did before, that I claim "insider" knowledge; I
suggest that you, again, are maiking an erroneous interpretation of my
comments, and 2) being obfuscatory, disingenuous, or deliberately
mischaracterizing your points.  If I might be so bold as to offer a
small observation that I think has held true over time from my USENET
experience, this draws attention away from your otherwise fine arguments.

You are asking for evidence.  As I have said, you have posted it. My point
remains that you appear willing to see this as supporting your claim that
the USG favored the Taliban.  If that is your evidence, then I am afraid
you have failed, at least in my opinion, to prove your hypothesis.  In
addition, the general tone of your posts has become increasing shrill; if
this is in response to some misinterpretation of my remarks as personal
attacks, then please accept my sincere apologies.  However, I would add
that subtle (and not so subtle) accusations of being obfuscatory, etc.,
don't encourage one to continue a reasonable and level-headed discussion,
even if the opinions are so markedly different.

I would say one thing however regarding a substantive point:  you imply
that USG talks with the Taliban represent "state level negotiations --
with all that implies."  I can only repeat what has been said before and
what you have even acknowledge yourself: that we were having discussions
with almost all factions.  Simply expressing the willingness to deal with
the Taliban should they become the "power" in Kabul is simply accepting
reality, not expressing any putative preferance.  And while arguably there
may be some who are indulging in a bit of Schadenfreude at the thought of
a group that is not well-liked in Teheran possible being the BMOC in
Afghanistan, this hardly can be translated as U.S. preference for them.

I wrote that your remarks "implied an insider's knowledge of diplomacy,"
i.e., that you are or have been a diplomat or worked in a support position.
I can't imagine how this could be construed as unprofessional.  As for
inside knowledge of U.S. diplomatic talks among the various Afghani
factions, you asserted that the only talks to receive press attention
were those with the Taliban.  This implies that you have some source
of knowledge, other than the press, for this information.  Even if
this source consists of nothing more than water-cooler gossip at
your USG office, it could rightly be described as insider information
of a sort.  Again, I fail to understand how this description could
be construed as unprofessional.  Have a cup of tea and stop being
overly sensitive.

If you read the full text of my post, instead of just the portion you
quoted, I think you'll see what I'm driving at.  But I am heartened at the
thought that if I were to pass on what I might hear at the water cooler, I
could qualify as having let out "inside knowledge."  I am overwhelmed by
the honor you do me, and will immediately ask for a raise and change my
on-screen name to "Deep Throat."

As for Taliban contacts being the only ones that have made media contact,
this is true in the CNN sense.  However, you may wish to peruse some back
issues of the Economist and Far Eastern Economic Review for some more
sketchy details on the others.  Admittedly, this requires one to move
beyond a more cursory analysis of the events as reported in the
Herald/NYT/WP, but well worth the effort.  I would note also that the
Economist's position resembles yours to a great degree, though they are
more willing to acknowledge the possibility of any perceived embracing of
the Taliban as an exercise in Realpolitik, regardless of our differences
with Iran.  I believe it was in the second October issue, but that is as
precise as I can be, I'm afraid.

One final thought (as I have exhausted my inventory on this subject): the
regional politics surrounding Afghanistan should not be subsumed into some
shopworn template of bipolarity, simply inserting Iran for USSR and
assuming U.S. policy moves accordingly.  The fact that the support for the
Mujaheddin in the 1980s resulted in some negative effects in the aftermath
is a lesson that I do not believe has been lost on U.S. policy makers.
That said, Iran and Pakistan both have their own hash to settle there, and
I would not assume that simply because the U.S. is on friendly terms with
Pakistan that we would support the latter in expanding its influence.
Indeed, the fish we have to fry with Islamabad requires that its leaders
put its own house in order in a number of ways, and this would in no way
be served by encouraging adventurism in Afghanistan or Kashmir (where,
coincidentally, one might find a lot of people who were in Afghanistan).

Subject: The Vendetta Against Boutros-Ghali

Does anyone here have any idea why John Deutch and the CIA signed
off on the current bizarre vendetta against Boutros-Ghali? Folks
here might want to read Jim Hoagland's take on the issue at:

http://washingtonpost.com:80/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-11/24/091L-112496-idx.html

The current situation reminds one very much of the sanctions
policies regarding Turkish-Iranian trade that we discussed here
earlier: in this instance, as in that one, the U.S. stands
totally alone in the world, in absurd isolation from all its most
important Western European allies.

One theory that has been floated on the net is that elements
within the U.S. government are obsessed to punish Boutros-Ghali
for his failure to conceal the UN report which found that Israel
deliberately massacred civilians at Qana during Operation Grapes
of Wrath. [1] Is that what this is all about? If not, then what
is motivating the vendetta?

The fact that the CIA didn't strongly recommend against this
foolish policy towards Boutros-Ghali is yet another indication of
an American intelligence community in serious decline. Eventually
the bill is going to come due for a long systematic string of bad
policy calls driven by motivations that most charitably could be
called murky--and it is going to be whopper.

LETTER TO THE TIMES RE BOUTROS -GHALI

by Ronald Bleier (rbleier@igc.apc.org)

NOTE: The following letter was emailed to the editor of the
Times. The editors have apparently decided not to print it.

November 15, 1996

To the Editor:

The Times editorial on the threatened U.S veto of a second
five year term for U.N. Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros
Ghali ("Choosing the World's Top Diplomat," Nov 14, 1996)
properly notes the firestorm at the U.N. over this issue
and Washington's political isolation due to its "assault"
on the U.N. leader.  However, the editorial, as well as
Clyde Haberman's article on the same topic ("Squeeze U.N.
And the City Feels the Pain," November 8, 1996), miss an
opportunity to inform readers as to the most likely reason
for the U.S. decision. In addition, the affair raises
troubling issues about the hijacking of U.S. domestic and
foreign policy.

Both Haberman (who quoted foreign diplomats as
characterizing the U.S. move as a "political mugging,")
and the Times editorial writer, cited concerns that the
Clinton Administration needed to "outflank the Republicans
who attack the U.N. for political reasons." But this cover
story is not very plausible. Nowhere is it made clear, for
example, how replacing one Secretary General with another
would affect perceived Republican unhappiness with the
U.N..

The Times came much closer to the real reason for the
"mugging" when it quoted Senator Paul Simon who came
out in support of a second term for Mr. Boutros Ghali
(Barbara Crossette ("White House Steps Up Effort To Deny
UN Chief a Second Term," November 7, 1996). The retiring
Democratic senator suggested that in addition to domestic
political reasons, another reason for the U.S. move might
be that Boutros-Boutros Ghali "has on rare occasions shown
independence from U.S. wishes."

Rare occasions indeed. In fact, there are indications that
the critical reason for the U.S. move was the decision
taken by Mr. Boutros Ghali in May 1996, to make public a
U.N. report that the Israeli shelling of a UN base at Qana
in Southern Lebanon was not accidental. The shelling occurred
as part of Israel's 16-day barrage of Lebanon in April
1996.

The shelling at Qana claimed the lives of over 100
civilians who had sought safety at the U.N. base from
Israeli attacks. Israel claimed the shelling was a mistake
but the U.N. investigation found that the evidence was
inconsistent with an accidental attack.

At the time, the U.S. did its best to intimidate the
Secretary General to keep him from publishing his own
report. According to a front page story in the Independent
by David Osborne in New York and Eric Silver in Jerusalem
("U.N. Storm as Israel Faces Indictment," May 9, 1996),
the U.S. showered the U.N. with calls from the U.S.
mission in New York to protest Mr. Ghali's decision to
publish the UN report. The Independent story cited a
"senior diplomat" who said that the calls were
"acrimonious"  to the point of including "four letter
words." In all likelihood, U.S. threats to block a second
term for the Secretary General were made at that time.

The incident is important not merely because of the damage
it does to the U.S. in the international community and in
Muslim and African countries especially.  It also raises
troubling issues about the power of special interest
lobbies to work against larger U.S. international and
domestic interests.

The power of the pro-Israeli lobby should be seen in the
context of the power of other special interest lobbies
such as the anti-Castro lobby which seem more and more
able in recent years to direct U .S. policy-making to their
own ends.

"Water-cooler gossip" is not an intelligence term! "patronizing" remarks

I agree--this list is one of the most useful discussion
forums in cyberspace because of its freedom from
flaming. I hope the tradition continues.

The best way to weaken the presentation of an argument
is to lapse into personal flaming.

Subject: McCoy Article

The article in question is about six pages; I have edited to what I think
are the "juicy" parts in keeping with what I think are the interests of
this group.

BEGIN EDIT:

"In Asia, Battling Warlords" from the October 1996 Foreign Service Journal

How can the surge of Asian heroin over the past five years be explained?
The answer lies in heroin's little understood character as a commodity.

After three drug wars under [3 U.S. presidents], global opium production
rose from 1,000 tons in 1970 to more than 4,000 tons in 1990, due, in
part, to suppression itself.  Like all crops, heroin obeys the laws of
supply and demand.  If an operation by the United Nations or DEA reduces
supply in one area, say Turkey or Thailand, and global demand stays
constant, then the world opium price must rise.

The advent of the Cold War brought major changes to Asia's opium trade.
Under communism, China eradicated opium smoking, suddenly eliminating the
globe's major producer and consumer.  Responding to international
pressures, Southeast Asia abolished legal opium sales between 1950 and
1961, creating a sudden demand for illicit opiates.  To meet this demand,
the region's harvest grew rapidly and the Golden Triangle soon became the
world's largest illicit producer.

Over the next 40 years, the CIA mounted covert operations in these remote,
rugged mountains by recruiting tribal leaders as resistance fighters, many
of whom used their powerful American ally to become drug lords.

[A]t the height of the Vietnam War, [Chinese Nationalists in Burma
stranded after the Communist's victory] and local warlords opened seven
laboratories in the Golden Triangle to supply U.S. soldiers fighting in
South Vietnam.  According to a later White H ouse survey, 34 percent of
U.S. troops in Vietnam were addicted.  If this figure is accurate, there
were 80,000 heroin-addicted U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam, far more than
the 68,000 in America.

President Nixon inadvertently created a new market for Golden triangle
heroin by declaring a "war on drugs" in the Mediterranean.  Acting on
reports that Turkey's poppy fields and Marseilles' heroin laboratories
supplied 80 percent of America's demand, Ni xon pressed these allies for
action.  By 1973-74, Turkey had eradicated all opium production and France
closed its heroin labs in Marseilles.

Ironically, Nixon's triumph rested on the premise that Turkey, which
produced just 7 percent of the world's illicit supply, was an isolated
opium producer that could be eliminated through a strong enforcement
effort.  Responding to the market stimulus of Turkish eradication, the
Chinese criminal syndicates of Southeast Asia began exporting surplus
heroin to America, in effect following the GIs home.  By early 1975,
Southeast Asia's share of the U.S. heroin market had doubled to 22
percent.

Concerned about rising Southeast Asian heroin seizures, the Nixon
administration dispatched a team of 30 DEA agents to Bangkok from 1973-74
to cut the flow.  Armed with a $12 million anti-drug war chest, the DEA
began making substantial seizures of U.S.-b ound heroin - meeting a de
fact customs shield against drug By the end of 1975, Southeast Asia's
share of the U.S. market had dropped to only 8 percent exports to America.
But the DEA had not eradicated opium cultivation in Burma or closed heroin
refine ries in Thailand.  It had simply deflected these exports to other
markets in Europe and Australia, thereby expanding world demand.

The end of the Cold War also accelerated the spread of Opium in Central
Asia.  To compensate for the loss of U.S. covert aid, Afghan guerrillas
have increased their poppy cultivation.  Poppy cultivation and heroin
refining are spreading form Afghanistan i nto neighboring states that were
once part of the Soviet Union.  Over time, Central Asia may become a vast
opium reservoir on the roof of the world, producing limitless quantities
of low-cost heroin for markets across the globe.

This . . . raises some questions about the nature of the global drug trade
and the policy we have adopted to combat it.  For the past 15 years, the
ultimate logic of the drug war has been supply reduction -- eradication at
the source in Asia and the Ande s, interdiction on the high seas, and
seizures from dealers on the streets.  As the warlords of Central and
Southeast Asia produce ever larger opium harvests, a rising tide of heroin
may render any attempt at a supply-side solution unworkable.

END EDIT

In sum, my take on this is that if indeed the problem is one of such basic
supply and demand, then blaming the CIA for the problem or espousing "just
say no" as the solution simplifies to insignificance the true scope of
"drug economics" and does nothing to help us come to grips with the
issue.

While I wouldn't rule out the Qana incident as one factor (though let us
remember where those Hizbollah weapons were set up -- hardly excuplates
Israel but hardly makes Hizbollah the aggreived party), I think the USG
problems with Boutros go back at least to Somalia.  In addition, there may
be some more rather mundane administrative issues in question as well,
though at this writing I'd be hard pressed to name them.  I do believe,
however, they are one reason why we have been holding back on our "dues."

If the Israeli thesis holds, though, I would expect Simon to be adamantly
_against_ Boutros.  Isn't Simon named in Paul Findley's book (They Dare to
Speak Out) as a major recipient of AIPAC money?  It seems odd that if
AIPAC is indeed so strong and pervasive in its influence, that they would
not have called Simon and told him where to stand on this issue.

There is strong evidence that Israel deliberately
targeted for slaughter women, children and babies in
the Qana affair. It is also a fact that the governments
of Israel and the U.S. tried to censor this evidence,
and became extremely angry when Boutros-Ghali wouldn't
go along with the attempted cover-up.

Israel's policies in Lebanon overall since Begin's and
Sharon's invasion have been a disaster for both Israel
and the U.S. Qana was just the latest mess in a long
series of messes that began with "Peace for Galilee."

Are you defending the American policy on Boutros-Ghali
as being reasonable or a credit to the intelligence of
the American intelligence community?

Here is the defense of the policy in the Forward for
November 22, 1996:

--- BEGIN ---

Any time America stands absolutely alone in the United
Nations--with not even one member of the Security
Council coming to its support--you can bet America is
in the right. It's a lead pipe cinch. Not even one
country is standing with President Clinton on his
decision to veto Boutros Boutos-Ghali's bid for a
second term as secretary-general. So we're inclined to
support the Clinton administration, no further
questions asked. It believes that Mr. Boutros-Ghali has
lost the confidence of the Congress, which must approve
the $1.2 billion in back dues that America owes the
U.N., which the Clinton administration want to pay.

--- END ---

Brilliant stuff, huh? The measure of the soundness of a
policy is the degree to which it isolates you from the
rest of the world.

Any nation which succumbs to this bizarre mentality is
not going to survive as a nation for very long. The
American intelligence community is ruining its
reputation by going along with this poor excuse at
thinking. If Israel wants to follow this
self-destructive path, fine--let Israelis make their
own bed; the U.S. should not follow, or pay for the bad
judgement of Israelis and Israeli supporters.

"Mr. Boutros-Ghali has lost the confidence of the
Congress": precisely who in the Congress and for what
reasons?

>> Democratic senator suggested that in addition to domestic
>> political reasons, another reason for the U.S. move might
>> be that Boutros-Boutros Ghali "has on rare occasions shown
>> independence from U.S. wishes."
>
>If the Israeli thesis holds, though, I would expect Simon to be adamantly
>_against_ Boutros.  Isn't Simon named in Paul Findley's book (They Dare to

Hasn't Simon decided to retire? If so, he is no longer
dependent on any political interests to win
re-elections--he is free to speak his mind honestly, as
he did in the matter of Boutros-Ghali.

Jack Kemp is also deeply beholden to the Israeli
lobby--this didn't stop him from expressing opinions
about Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam that
profoundly outraged that lobby. Eventually everyone
seems to come into apocalyptic confrontation with the
lobby on one issue or another--it seems to be
unavoidable. Yitzhak Rabin's disagreements with one
faction of the lobby got him murdered.

I am not particularly a strong defender of
Boutros-Ghali--in fact, I am not inclined to pay him
much notice at all. What does capture my notice,
however, is a pattern of policy-making that is
repeatedly putting America in conflict with its closest
Western European allies. That is a peculiar pattern
indeed, and one which requires analysis and
explanation.

RMC:

   I would remind Mr. Birdsey that the title of McCoy's second book
on the topic of CIA and the Drug traffic is, "The politics of Heroin:
CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Traffic."

   Mr. Birdsey edited McCoy's article and draws a rather unbelievable
conclusion re the role of the CIA or lack of it in development of the
world drug trade.  He, inter alia, implies the drug traffic in the Golden
Crescent only developed significantly after the cessation of CIA support
to its elements there. The below indicates that during the eighties -- when
the CIA was supporting the war, that the traffic was huge. (I do not have
the cited McCoy article  but I will be attending a conference tomorrow
(11/26/96) with Professor McCoy; Jack A. Blum, former chief investigative
reporter for the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that investgated
contra-drug running in 1989; and, others knowledgeable on the subject
where I hope to acquire more information on this topic.

Subject: Patrick Knowlton's Lawsuit Against the FBI

Would any intelligence professionals (or
non-professionals, for that matter) care to evaluate
the information in the following transcript?

--- BEGIN ---

Patrick J. Knowlton and his attorney John Clarke on
the Bob Grant Show
Wednesday November 13, 1996

Grant: [...] He was the first witness arriving on the
scene before the police, the version of what he saw
that night contradicts that of the police.  He
recently filed suit against the government for $1.5
million alleging obstruction of justice by FBI agents.
We'll be talking to him on the telephone in a little
over one hour from now.  For some reason, every now
and then, I'd get a card or I'd get a letter from
someone saying, "Why are you afraid to get Patrick
Knowlton on your program."  I'm not afraid of him, not
at all,  but he was not ready to come on until today,
so you keep listening."

[Over an hour  later.  After a problem with initial
connection:]

Grant: [ ...] we will try to reestablish contact [...]
with Patrick Knowlton who arrived at Fort Marcy Park
about an hour after [sic] Vince Foster's body was
found.  Mr. Knowlton who lives just eight blocks from
the White House alleges there was a conspiracy to
obstruct justice with regard to the investigation of
Foster's death and, Mr. Knowlton, we have you back on
the line.  You were driving home from your job at a
construction site in Maryland when you got caught in
traffic and had to stop at the park to urinate.

Knowlton:  That's correct, as embarrassing as it
sounds, that's correct.  But please let me get one
thing straight, I came from Maryland back to the
District of Columbia and then left the District of
Columbia towards Virginia so I didn't leave Maryland
directly for Virginia, I came to the District first.

Grant:  Okay, so let's establish very clearly that you
just happened to stumble on to this: you weren't
looking for anything.

Knowlton: Absolutely not.  I went into the park to find
 a tree, actually, and I ended up coming across a brown
Honda with Arkansas plates that was parked right next
to the footpath going into Fort Marcy Park, the park
itself.  About four spaces down to the right hand side
was parked, back then, a bluish gray Japanese car and
as I pulled up, I noticed that the brown car with the
Arkansas plates, there was no one seated in it.  To the
right as I got up closer I noticed there was someone in
the bluish gray car  so I just naturally pulled closer
to the brown car.  As I parked the car, I looked to my
right, the guy in the bluish gray car lowered his
window and gave me this very uneasy kind of stare.  It
was a little fierce looking like I was interfering with
something he had going on so that sort of made me a
little nervous.  But nature called so I got out of the
car and walked around the brown Honda with the Arkansas
plates and I heard the car door open, this guy's car
door open so I sort of stopped thinking maybe he was
going to mug me or ask me for money.  I wasn't really
sure because he seemed so suspect. I stood looking at
the sign for a minute, minute and a half, and I looked
back over my shoulder and I saw the man was just
leaning on the roof of his car, standing outside it and
just staring at me so I waited nearly 30 seconds, I
just jotted up into the woods to the left in the
opposite direction in which Vince Foster's body was
found.  On my way back down which was about two minutes
later, I heard the car door close so I wasn't sure if
this guy was in his car, out of his car, like I say he
acted very suspicious so my awareness was heightened
and I approached the parking lot looking to hear where
this guy was, thinking maybe to cross between my car
and the brown car with Arkansas plates, something like
that.  I walked right toward driver's door of this
brown Honda with Arkansas plates as I did I noticed the
contents inside the vehicle.  Now there was a dark suit
jacket draped over a driver's seat, a briefcase on the
passenger's seat, in the back there was two wine
coolers.  I walked back around, got into my car, I
looked back over to my right  to where his car was
parked, the man had his window down, he was continuing
to give me this stare. I just started my car and got
out of there, that was pretty much it.

The following evening  when I heard on the news that
Vince Foster was dead, was found in the park the day
before at six o'clock, I realized that I had been there
and  I thought "God I saw Vince Foster's car and the
briefcase and all that" so I called my girlfriend and
asked her if I should call the Park Police and get
involved.  She said "Well yeah, you should, but, you
know, first take some notes."  So I took some notes
about what I had observed and I called the Park Police.
I talked with some woman for about ten minutes and then
she told me she was the wrong person to talk to and
told me she'd have someone call me back at 6:00 or 6:30
in the morning. Well the next morning, nobody called me
and I had to leave about 7:30, I was going to work a
little bit later that day.  So at 7:30,  I called back
the Park Police, I talked to Sergeant Rolla and relayed
the same message, the same story to him and that was
it, until nine months later I was contacted by the FBI,
 Robert Fiske independent counsel. Agent Larry Monroe
called me and asked me if I would mind coming in to
talk to him about what I  had observed at Fort Marcy
Park which I did.  I went in there.  Most of the
purpose of the conversation, which was  two and half
hours was about the vehicle I had seen--a little about
the man, but more about the vehicle.  Well, I told the
whole story once again  and what they really wanted me
to do ... they had some pictures of the car and they
wanted me to say "Yes, this is the car that I saw in
Fort Marcy Park." But the pictures of the car they were
showing me was not the car that I had seen there from
Arkansas and after that I had a second interview, I
went over to the [?] Laboratories at the FBI, pulled
out color panels that matched the exact color of the
car I had seen at Fort Marcy Park, ended up being color
panels from a 1983 and a 1984 Honda Accord .  At that
point one of the lab technicians that was there said to
this  Agent Larry Monroe. "Well geez, you know, how
many Arkansas cars could there be with this color
Honda?  Why don't you just run all those cars through
the DMV?"  And Agent Monroe turned to him and said very
curtly "Don't you worry. We're on top of this."  And he
dragged me out of the FBI office.  But before we go on
to say any more, the first interview with Agent Monroe
after he had made me go over this car  over and over
and over again.  When I was getting ready to leave, he
said to me, "Mr. Knowlton, I can tell you are a kind
man and the Foster family has suffered,  I can't tell
you not to, but I'm going to ask you not to go to the
press and tell them this story."

Grant: WHAT ??!!

Knowlton: Well, I didn't.  I believed I was doing the
right thing, by first of all telling them what I saw
and secondly by doing as they asked.  So I didn't go to
the press. And that is why nobody knows much about my
story until late, until October 22nd, actually October
14,  when Ambrose Evans-Prichard from the London Sunday
Telegraph contacted me and got this whole thing
rolling.  Do you have any questions before I go on or
...

Grant:  Well, you know this must be very frustrating
for you because you stumbled on the scene, you saw what
you saw, and there are people that want to discredit
you from the very beginning. Now,  I want to know about
the charge of tampering, that the FBI tampered with
your testimony? Tell us about that.

Knowlton: I'll let John Clarke tell you about that.

Clarke: Yeah Bob, after his story surfaced, after Mr.
Knowlton's story surfaced,  this journalist from the
London paper interviewed him and showed him the FBI
reports that he had not previously seen and Patrick
looked at them and said "That is not what I said, this
thing has a number of lies, very  important lies,  in
it."  So this journalist wrote a article in the London
Sunday Telegraph which is published  there on October
22, 1995, it was available in US newsstands on October
24, two days later, that's Tuesday October 24.  And
that same day, a subpoena was prepared  with Mr.
Knowlton's name on it to testify the following
Wednesday, November 1.  But they didn't serve it that
day, they didn't give him the subpoena.  They gave him
the subpoena on Thursday October 26 and beginning that
same day that he received the subpoena,  he was the
target of a well-orchestrated, overwhelming campaign of
harassment and intimidation perpetrated by not fewer
than 25 men on the streets of Washington. It's just a
absolutely bizarre story and we have, I have, consulted
with a number of experts, former intelligence people
and also people who are currently in the intelligence
community, and they said "Oh yeah, sure, we know all
about this tactic."

Grant: All right, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Knowlton, please
stay there gentlemen,  want to get right back to you
right here.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I hope you are
paying close attention  to the information being
provided by Mr. Knowlton and his attorney John Clarke.
Right here on the Bob Grant Show.

[traffic report and commercial messages]

Grant:  All right ladies and gentlemen I want you to
know Patrick J. Knowlton, he's about 41, 42 years old,
he's been self-employed for most of his adult life in
the construction industry. He's a stable individual. He
has lived in  Washington DC since he moved to that city
in 1990 from his native  Syracuse, NY.  He is, by the
way, a registered Democrat, he has no political agenda.
 It was on July 20, 1993, the day Vincent Foster died
that Patrick Knowlton was in Fort Marcy Park for five
minutes.  We have on the line Mr. Knowlton and his
attorney, John Clarke.  Now Mr. Clarke, the details are
absolutely fascinating but I want to get to the point
of  the problems that the FBI has given your client and
the  tampering charge. Where does this tampering charge
go from here.  And the  reason  I ask this question at
this time is:  the American people know so little, as a
matter of fact, I think they know nothing, about
Patrick J. Knowlton.   What is your reaction to that?

Clarke: Well Bob ,to briefly recap what happened,
they tried to get him, the FBI tried to get him, to
obtain an admission from him among other things that
the car that he saw parked in the same spot where
Vincent Foster's car was later found could have been
Mr. Foster's and the circumstances of Patrick pulling
in, he just happened to know what he saw and he
refused to say that it could have been the car they
were showing photographs of, it just couldn't have
been, it just wasn't.  So having failed to obtain that
admission they falsified the reports in a number of
ways.  One of the more significant ones is that they
said that Patrick identified this as a, quote, 1988 to
1989 Honda.  That is not correct, that is a lie. He
didn't.  In fact, we know that he picked out two car
color panels, both of which, of the same color, one a
1983, the other a 1984 Honda. So that's pretty clear.
And then what happened was the story surfaced in the
press, then he was subpoenaed and then he was harassed
on the streets of Washington and it's  just a bizarre
...

Grant:  What do you mean he was harassed on the streets
of Washington?

Clarke: Well, the first man--he was taking a walk, a
routine walk with his girlfriend.  The first man gave
him a lock-eyed stare from 20, 30 feet away and
continued to stare him down as they approached, as they
passed, and even after they passed. Five seconds later
the next man repeated the actions of the first man and
then about 20 seconds later was number three and this
went on and on, and on and on.  It's hard to describe
just how overwhelming this sort of thing is. But I will
tell you when they were on one side of Connecticut
Avenue in Washington, it's a six lane street at this
point, they crossed the six lanes to try to escape from
the sixth, seventh and eighth man who were following
them and staring at them. They got half way across the
intersection and there was the ninth man waiting on the
opposite street corner for them. That ninth man
repeated again this following and staring. This ninth
guy followed them for blocks at one point walking three
feet abreast of the two of them all the while
continuing to give this sort of mean stare right into
Patrick's eyes, totally  ignoring his girlfriend Cathy.
 Now as I was saying before the break, we have
consulted with a number of experts about this tactic
and they each have told us independently of one another
that they are familiar with the tactic and what it does
is that it sends the witness a message saying "You
messed up when you told that journalist that the FBI
falsified reports, now change your tune and don't say
it again and certainly don't say it when you are before
the Grand Jury."  And all of these experts, again,
independently of one another have told us that these
people who are guilty of this obstruction of justice
don't care whether or not the witness heeds that
warning;  they don't care whether or not he goes
forward and continues to tell the truth.  And  the
reason that they don't care is because nobody will
believe them  Every time Patrick Knowlton left his
apartment  during a three day period, there were men
out standing on the street corner, repeating this same
harassment technique.  And what it sounds like is that
he is a little bit unbalanced. I mean who's  going to
believe somebody who says there are strange men on
every street corner staring at him and that's exactly
what happened.  He was not believed.  He was
discredited.  And for the last year now we have been
fighting for his credibility.  He took a lie detector
test given by the chief polygraph examiner, former, for
the FBI, for nine years.  We sent him to a Harvard
educated psychiatrist, we collected affidavits of the
other witnesses--sworn statements-- and we put it
altogether in a big report and including the
photographs of two of these harassers.  And another
thing I might add,  [unclear] on the falsification of
the reports.  One of the things that Patrick saw in the
back of this Honda was two  wine coolers.  Now that was
not public information--the connection of wine coolers
to Vincent Foster--until 1994.  But Patrick-- it being
a sort of interesting story--he told his friends and
his family; he even told the story at a few cocktail
parties.  He told many, many people about what he saw
in the Honda.  We have their affidavits and they say:
"Yeah, Patrick Knowlton told me he saw wine coolers in
the back of his Honda."  Well their  wine cooler traces
found on Mr. Foster's body.  The first witness to
discover the body said there was a half empty wine
cooler at his feet, so we've got 'em.  He couldn't have
made this story up.

Grant: Mr. Clarke, when we return, I want to ascertain
where you go from here because I know that your client
did testify before the Whitewater Grand Jury, I believe
on Wednesday November 1rst, 1995.  And I want to know
what is next because  Kenneth Starr certainly has got
to pay attention to what your client has to say and if
he doesn't I will become even more suspicious.  We'll
get back to John H. Clarke and Patrick Knowlton in just
a moment.

[commercial break]

Grant: All right, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately,
we can't go into the detail I would like to  I do ask
you Mr. Clarke what we can expect because let me tell
you  I've talked to Mr. Prichard, I've talked to  Chris
Ruddy, I've talked to some other people and it's just
an outrage that this information is being suppressed.
How can you get this out to the people the way they
should know and how about any further appearances
before Mr. Starr's committee?

Knowlton:  Well I just want to say something about
yesterday's press conference.  We had CNN, CBS, NBC,
CBN, COX, Time Magazine, Washington Post, the New York
Times, LA Times. There were over 30 reporters there.
This story, this law suit, never made the national news
last night.  We don't know why.

Grant: Well, that's why I asked you the  question I did
because I know you had the press conference and I
looked all over my New York Times this morning and I
couldn't find one word written about it.

Clarke:  That's right, Bob.  It did go over the
Associated Press wire on Monday night.  Of course, not
the press conference, but the story and the law suit.
What we did  was we filed the law suit on October 25,
under seal of court, so as not to be public information
until after the Presidential election.  We thought that
would be another strike against us by way of fighting
for our credibility if we followed the election in
public.  So in any event, it was unsealed yesterday and
it alleges conspiracy to obstruct justice by harassing
a witness in an effort to get him to change his
testimony.

Grant: If it weren't for John Crudele, hardly anybody
in the tri-state area, in the New York area, would know
about the unsealing of the suit.

Knowlton: We thank John for that story.  Absolutely.

Clarke: In any event, you asked me  what happens next.
Well this case, that is the civil rights violation --

Grant: Oh, we've just been grabbed by the clock.
Thank-you gentlemen.

From:    MARK ADKINS <emerald@AZTEC.ASU.EDU>
Subject: Institutional Psychology and the Intelligence Community

Here's a copy of an essay I wrote about a year ago.  I believe it remains
fully relevant.

Mark Adkins (emerald@aztec.asu.edu)
----------------------------------------------------------

                           How Spooks Think


The relationship between the CIA and its largely rhetorical "oversight"
by congressional committees nominally responsible for this, is reminiscent
of the relationship between Charlie Brown and Lucy in the comic strip
Peanuts.  Every year Lucy holds a football for Charlie Brown to kick.
Every year she pulls it out from under him at the last moment and he
lands ignominiously on his back.  Yet Charlie Brown never learns.  He
is always ready to believe Lucy when she claims that she is a reformed
figure.

The history of the U.S. national security complex is a tapestry woven of
deception, illegality, and arrogant contempt for democracy by a small
group of smug and patronizing individuals who, operating under few
constraints of accountability yet funded by tax dollars, have substituted
their own personal visions of U.S. policy for what could and should be
a democratically determined agenda.  The CIA has been at the center of
this.

With few exceptions (the effective yet unnecessarily limited Church
Committee being foremost), Congress, and especially the would-be
spooks sitting on oversight committees, have behaved more like the
gullible Charlie Brown than the guardians of democratic values.
According to the mainstream media myth, the CIA is a reformed
organization.  In a public relations sense it is true that the CIA
has reformed itself.  But recent events, from CIA involvement in
right-wing Guatemalan death-squads, to its patronage of similar
elements in Haiti, have shown that this reform is only skin-deep.
The CIA continues to lie to Congress about these activities, and
Congress continues to demonstrate little deep and lasting skepticism.
The current CIA director, John Deutch, proved himself ideally suited
to the position by dutifully denying the exposure of U.S. military
personnel to low-levels of chemical warfare agents in the Persian
Gulf War during his previous Pentagon job as Deputy Secretary of
Defense.

Nor is the CIA above stoking the dying embers of the Cold War to
advance its parochial interests (whether to distract from its own
perennial scandals or to increase its budget priorities in these
changing times).  A recent New York Times article (reprinted in the
Nov. 25, 1995 Arizona Republic) reported that a "senior political
officer" at the Moscow Embassy, Thomas Graham, published a highly
critical appraisal of Russian political factions in the Russian daily
newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta which stated that "none of these clans
are devoted to democratic ideals, despite public assurances to the
contrary."

Astute readers will recall that the Covert Action Information Bulletin
published Graham's biography as a CIA officer operating under diplomatic
cover in issue No. 10 (August-Sept. 1980).  Graham's article, which
produced an international incident and strained U.S.-Russian relations,
was strangely in contravention of diplomatic protocol, and U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering was reported by the Times to have cleared
the article for publication, even though "it does not represent the
thinking of the government."  Furthermore, Graham refused to provide
the Times with a copy of text as written in English: this is consistent
with Executive Order 12333, which prohibits the CIA from "intentionally"
influencing the U.S. media.

This continues to be a chief means by which the CIA influences U.S.
domestic politics while maintaining plausible denial: arranging for the
publication of its propaganda in foreign newspapers in a way that may
attract the attention of the world press, in the hope that the story will
be picked up by American wire services for U.S. distribution.  The use of
cut-outs in the placement and reporting of this propaganda --
intermediaries who are may be genuinely ignorant of the clandestine
background -- makes exposure highly unlikely.  But in the event of such
exposure, the CIA can always maintain that it did not *intend* for the
story to reach domestic audiences.

In light of these recent events, I thought it would be a good idea to
put CIA practices into broader perspective.  In order to understand why
the CIA is probably an unreformable organization, it is necessary to
understand how its officers think; its institutional mentality.

There are several problems with this type of analysis.  The first is
that the CIA has had so much experience with public scandals and
public investigations, that they have finally learned the art of
spin-control.  Gone are the days of straight talk when CIA officers
spoke their minds in public.  The public didn't like what it heard.
The CIA learned a valuable lesson from this, but that lesson was not
that it should change its behavior; rather, the lesson CIA learned was
to tell the public what it wants to hear.  This has meant the development
of a sophisticated public relations machine in which words like
"democracy," and "accountability" are twirled like cotton candy.

Another problem in analyzing the CIA covert operations mentality is
the source for information.  When a left-leaning magazine exposes
CIA misbehavior, the know-nothings tend to dismiss it as liberal spin,
or worse.

So, first, you have to get your information from the days before the
expanded pre-publication review regulations and executive orders
passed in the 1980s, if you want to hear the big boys in all their
native glory.  Second, you have to find a source friendly to the
CIA.  I came across such a source in an article by CIA officer Miles
Copeland in the March 14, 1975 issue of National Review.  The article,
entitled "The Rockefeller Commission: Is There a CIA In Your Future?"
is written in the form of an open letter chastising Congress and the
CIA's media critics.  National Review is a respectable conservative
journal which until recently was edited by William F. Buckley.  Use of
such a source also helps insure that the spook is fairly representative
of his species, and not some right-wing ideologue off on a tangent,
though it's hard to tell the difference sometimes.

So, without further adieu, here is how a spook thinks, as revealed by
a mainstream representative of the CIA in days of less sophisticated
public relations:

1.  IT IS THE PATRIOTIC DUTY OF THE CIA TO LIE TO CONGRESS.  "My friends
in Langley insist that they are going to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, to the Rockefeller Commission
[investigating CIA misbehavior]...But almost all the Agency people I
talked to assured me unashamedly, almost proudly, 'Of course we are
going to lie to the congressional committees.'  They felt that as loyal
Americans they cannot do otherwise -- except in the unlikely event the
members of the committees can be held accountable for their leaks...
For the good of all of us, including the congressmen who must take the
blame for any leak, let us hope Bill Colby [then CIA Director] lies.
Our mutual friends at the Agency assure me that he will -- or that if
he doesn't he will be finished."

2.  CIVIL LIBERTARIANS AND OTHER CRITICS OF THE CIA ARE ENEMIES OF THE
STATE AND SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO STATE REPRESSION.  "Termites (the KGB's
name for politicians and editorialists who wittingly or unwittingly
serve its purpose) will make speeches and write newspaper articles
attacking us.  Maggots (the KGB's name for politicians and newspapermen
who have no strong political views but who know how to adapt their
utterances to the mood of the moment) will fall in behind...I think
bill Colby...will pull aside one or two [congressmen] whose integrity
is above question and explain the facts of life to them.  Then, I predict
the whole apparatus of the United States Government, including those
congressional committees, will turn its guns onto the 'termites'
and 'maggots' in our society who have accomplished for our enemies in
months what they, in their wildest dreams, couldn't have hoped to
accomplish in years -- all in the cause of preserving our civil
liberties.  Beware, I say, of those who fight to give us what we've
already got, or to protect us from dangers that exist only in their
rhetoric."

3.  THE CIA AND OTHERS MUST AND SHOULD COLLECT DOSSIERS ON MASSES OF
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN ORDER TO WEED OUT A FEW LAW-BREAKERS (EVEN THOUGH
THE CIA OSTENSIBLY HAS NO LAW ENFORCEMENT ROLE):  "There are those
problems incident to the need of the CIA to do some domestic
spying...with or without the FBI...Some years back a few well-placed
penetrations, preferably near the top, sufficed; now there are no
proper 'targets' to penetrate, only countless ephemeral, crudely
organized groups that dissolve and regroup so fast that penetrations
of them are next to impossible.  The new approach is 'community
surveillance,' necessarily involving the amassing of material on
literally thousands of persons.  The Orwellian connotations of this
phrase are unavoidable, but there is no escaping it -- except, that is,
by tolerating the escalation of terrorism."

4.  THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PERSONNEL FILES OF CIA EMPLOYEES
WHO HAVE ENTERED INTO VOLUNTARY, INFORMED CONTRACTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYER,
AND INTELLIGENCE FILES KEPT SECRETLY ON OTHER AMERICANS, AND THE REAL
DANGER TO CIVIL LIBERTIES IS AN INFORMED PRESS AND PUBLIC.  "There is
no good reason why the CIA should not keep files on American citizens,
provided the information is strictly for its own use...The danger to
civil liberties is not in the mere existence of files, but in the
possibility of their being leaked to those who would use them for
sensationalist purposes."

5.  PERJURY BEFORE CONGRESS, THE OVERTHROW OF DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED
GOVERNMENTS AND THE MURDER OF FOREIGN CITIZENS AND POLITICIANS, AS
WELL AS DOMESTIC POLITICAL REPRESSION AND PHARMACEUTICAL EXPERIMENTATION
ON OUR OWN CITIZENRY IS NO BIG DEAL.  THE CIA IS A MUCH MALIGNED HERO OF
AMERICAN SOCIETY, BESET WITH IRRATIONAL AND INEXPLICABLE ENEMIES WHO MAY
WELL BE PART OF A SINISTER CONSPIRACY.  "Any investigating group that
gets the full facts on CIA activities over the past few years [this was
written in 1975] is bound to conclude that there has been a lot of fuss
over nothing, that the few irregularities that may turn up aren't worth
spending twenty minutes on, and that its inquiries are within the wrong
frame of reference.  [The right frame, apparently, being 'maggots' and
'termites'.]  The real question is this: there are truly frightening
dangers confronting our country, and the CIA is the principle agency
capable of combatting them...Why then this mounting, ill-informed, and
vicious attack on the CIA?  It is as though in 1942 our statesmen and
newspaper editorialists had swung their guns from Hitler to Roosevelt
and Churchill.  The big question is: Why?  What is behind it all?"

6.  THE CONTENT OF NON-CIA WRITINGS IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT: THE IMPORTANT
THING IS TO RECONSTRUCT THEIR SECRET PURPOSE, A TASK WHICH IS PROPERLY
THE JOB OF THE CIA, THE ONLY SOURCE OF UNBIASED, OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS.
"Bear with me for a paragraph or two while I explain how a CIA analyst
goes about his examination of a speech, an official statement, a
newspaper editorial, a straight piece of reporting, or any kind of report
coming from a source not under the Agency's own disciplines.  First, he
reminds himself that no report is ever motivated by a mere desire to
convey information.  A 'government spokesman' issues statements,
however truthful they may be as far as they go, in order to achieve
purposes.  The CIA analyst therefore is less interested in their
content than in the purpose they were designed to serve.  [Copeland
then proceeds to attack then New York Times reporter Seymour Hersh,
comparing him to a drug addict.]  It is the job of the CIA analyst
to tone down all the adjectives and adverbs [but apparently not
nouns like 'termites' and 'maggots'], replace all the connotative
words with explicitly meaningful ones, make allowances for purpose
and bias, and arrive at a dog-bites-man view of the world, one more
in accord with the world as it really is."

See my response to Ralph McGehee.  McCoy is the probably the best source
on how the USG through the CIA subrdinated drup policy to larger political
goals (IMHO how in his last book, updated in 1991 I believe, he defines
complicity).  However, the article certainly mentions -- as I believe I
did even im my edited version -- that CIA used people who became "drug
lords" in Asia to achiee other policy goals in Vietnam and Afghanistan;
however, his main thrust is as he stated in the first paragraph of my
redacted version:  heroin's role as a commodity.  My only real comment on
that was that if we simply view the "drug problem" as the result of the
CIA, then we won't understand it and hence have little hopee of solving
it.  I think McCoy would probably agree with this.  Mr. McGehee can ask
him  of course at his conference.  My only caveat woyuld be that Mr.
McGehee not allow his admitted bias against the CIA (which he documents
quite fully, make no mistake) to cloud the larger message which I think
the article was trying to get across.  Ultimately, one should try to get a
copy of the article and make one's own decision.

I don't think anyone can deny "complicity" as Mr. McCoy defines it.  What
McCoy did, however, is emphasize that the problem is far larger than any
so-called "CIA Conspiracy" or other similar attempt to view the problem
solely as the CIA's responsibility.  As a DC area resident, you can
probably get hold of a copy of the article fairly easy.  I would suggest
that my redacted version hits the major points.

McCoy is the first one that I know of to write about this issue as one of
more straightforward economics.  For that reason, I found it extremely
interesting.  And since McCoy is the virtual poster boy for proving "CIA
complicity" in the drug trade (his arguments have been misused bny others
who wish to see CIA involvement extend to retail distribution in the
States), I thought his article interesting for the way it focused on drugs
as a macroeconomic problem, if you will. In sum, I am really not taking
issue with Mr. McGehee, though I am somewhat surprised that simply becasue
my post did not emphasize the CIA element (one MCoy does not emphasize in
his article; but perhaps they are two different issues), it is
characterized as defending the Agency.

Subject: A reminder in ethics...

Dear List Member:

The following is a reprint of guide lines every subscriber receives when
entering a subscription to Cloaks-and-Daggers.

There is often a fine line between "critique", or constructive criticism,
supported by facts, and a personal, emotionally motivated attack on the
"hand that feeds us"!

I would hope that this reprint stimulates discussions in the true "American
Spirit":


                         ANNOUNCEMENT
                         ============
  Cloaks-and-Daggers on Listserv@sjuvm.stjohns.edu      "Cloaks"
  A study of Intelligence.(Academic).

  The  purpose  of  this  list  is  to  bring  together  students  and
  professionals alike, both here and abroad,that share in the study of
  intelligence as perceived in today's rapid changing world. To  offer
  a  meeting  place  for retired personnel and to draw upon their vast
  reservoir of knowledge  in  a  subject  often  misunderstood  as  an
  occupation, or social institution.

  It would seek to offer a meeting place for the exchange of ideas and
  concepts; to analyze the effectiveness of intelligence gathering and
  to  differentiate  between  politically  oriented  intelligence  and
  profit motivated goals: Government  vs.   the  private  sector.   To
  discuss  the practical application of intelligence gathering as seen
  today vs.  the "yesteryear"....Is intelligence a new  concept?   One
  borne out of today's high tech world?

  To differentiate, in an open discussion, between the various forms  of
  intelligence  as  perceived  in  the  scientific world, as well in the
  world of information gathering and processing.   Within  that  context
  anything  is  welcome,  historical  data  concerning  Matta  Hari, for
  example,  as  well  as  modern  day  aspects  of  the  importance   of
  intelligence in a world shaken by terrorist and anarchists' activities
  that would do away with all forms of Government control and replace it
  with whatever personal agenda suits them best...

  WHAT  IS  OUR OBJECTIVE?  To promote a better understanding and social
  awareness of the concept "intelligence", and to offer our  respect  to
  the  men  and  women  who  serve(d).  (Period).  (Without reference to
  national purpose.)

  "Cloaks  and  Daggers"  is  a  moderated list, which means that only
  articles with a subject matter content - or  life  experience  -  as
  outlined  above will be posted!  This is only intended to assure the
  free flow of knowledge and information,(intelligence?),resulting  in
  a maximum educational benefit for all readers.

         FORMER CIA ALLY FACES CHARGES OF SMUGGLING DRUGS INTO U.S.
    _________________________________________________________________


         By JOSE DE CORDOBA
         Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

         November 22, 1996


         CARACAS, Venezuela -- A Miami grand jury indicted the former
    head of a Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored Venezuelan
    antidrug unit on charges he smuggled cocaine into the U.S., in a
    case that is likely to again raise questions about the CIA's role
    in drug enforcement.

         U.S. officials said Gen. Ramon Guillen was charged in a
    sealed indictment with conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the
    U.S. during a period in which he headed a special CIA-financed
    Venezuelan National Guard antinarcotics group. Law-enforcement
    officials familiar with the case say Gen. Guillen's unit shipped
    as much as 22 tons of cocaine into the U.S. He headed the unit
    between 1987 and 1991.

         The officials say that CIA agents working with Gen. Guillen
    approved the delivery of one and possibly two cocaine shipments
    totaling more than one ton, which were smuggled into the U.S. The
    officials say the shipments approved by the CIA were allowed to
    be sent under the premise that letting the drugs reach their
    destination in the U.S. without hindrance would enable the CIA to
    gather intelligence about drug-smuggling networks and strengthen
    the position of a key confidential informant within Colombia's
    drug cartels. The Drug Enforcement Administration opposed the
    plan, those officials say.

         U.S. law-enforcement officials say no CIA officials were
    charged in the indictment. A CIA spokesman declined to comment.
    But in a 1993 letter to the Miami Herald concerning the case, the
    agency wrote that "the CIA neither participated in nor condoned
    any illegal drug shipments into the American market."


    SNARE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS

         Gen. Guillen, interviewed at his home here, denied
    wrongdoing and said he worked closely with the CIA in devising a
    snare to catch drug traffickers. He says the strategy called for
    luring the late Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar into Venezuela
    and capturing him, but didn't include allowing shipments of
    cocaine to reach the U.S. without being stopped by law
    enforcement authorities.

         "The agreement with our informant was to have in Venezuela a
    place where they could store drugs and at the same time, we
    guaranteed the shipment of drugs where they wanted to place them,
    with the full knowledge of the CIA," says Gen. Guillen, now
    retired.

         The CIA's involvement in the drug war has come under fire in
    the past because the agency has relied on sources for
    intelligence that have later proved to be involved in
    trafficking, such as Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, former leader
    of Panama. More recently, the CIA endured criticism following a
    controversial series of articles in the San Jose Mercury News
    that charged the agency was involved in introducing crack cocaine
    to poor black neighborhoods in Los Angeles as part of a plan to
    finance Contra rebels fighting to topple the Marxist Sandinista
    regime in Nicaragua in the 1980s. Although numerous doubts have
    been raised about the validity of the accusations, they caused
    the agency an acute public-relations problem.

         "Up till the present, I have no evidence of a conspiracy of
    the CIA to be involved in drug trafficking, but I'm keeping my
    mind open," CIA Director John Deutch told an angry crowd mostly
    made up of African-Americans in Los Angeles last week.

         In 1994, the interim president of Venezuela ruled that Gen.
    Guillen and several fellow National Guard officers wouldn't stand
    trial on drug offenses.


    `I DEFEND THE CIA'

         Gen. Guillen, who appears to live modestly in a small home,
    stoutly maintains his innocence. During the period in question,
    he says, his unit sent about 4,100 pounds of cocaine to the U.S.
    But, he says, both the CIA and the DEA, which also maintained an
    agent at the National Guard facility, knew about them. "We always
    told U.S. authorities," he says.

         "Nothing could be done without their authorization," says
    Gen. Guillen, speaking of the CIA. "I defend the CIA. I believe
    the CIA did an excellent job."

         But U.S. officials familiar with the case say that U.S.
    law-enforcement agencies weren't notified of many deliveries that
    found their way to the street. The operation was uncovered when
    the U.S. Customs Service intercepted a shipment in 1991 and began
    an investigation.

         U.S. law-enforcement officials say no CIA officials were
    charged in the indictment. "They thought they were controlling
    the National Guard, but the National Guard was controlling them,"
    says one law-enforcement official familiar with the case. "We
    have found no intent to profit, no nothing, just stupidity."

         The Guillen affair came to light three years ago when the
    CIA, prompted by reports that CBS's "60 Minutes" news program was
    preparing an expose, said a joint CIA-DEA probe in 1991  had
    uncovered "instances of poor judgment and management" by some CIA
    officials, but no criminal acts. Subsequently, one CIA agent
    resigned while the Caracas station chief was called home and
    later retired.

         As part of the 1991 probe, Gen. Guillen testified for four
    days before a joint DEA-CIA inspector-general's investigation in
    Miami. According to a report from that investigation, Gen.
    Guillen "lost his composure and, when directly confronted
    concerning his involvement in the unauthorized and illegal
    shipment of cocaine to the U.S., confessed."

         But Gen. Guillen, who notes he testified without a lawyer
    present and says he was denied the use of his own interpreter at
    the session, contends he never confessed to anything. "It's all
    lies," he says.


    RETURNED TO VENEZUELA

         The "60 Minutes" report quoted DEA station chief Annabelle
    Grimm as saying she turned down the CIA's and the National
    Guard's requests to make "uncontrolled" cocaine deliveries --
    that arrived in the hands of users in the U.S. -- in order to
    make their undercover operations more credible. Then-DEA
    administrator Robert Bonner told "60 Minutes" the CIA
    subsequently made the same request to DEA administrators in
    Washington and were again turned down. "Apparently, it went
    forward anyway," Mr. Bonner said then.

         In 1993, Gen. Guillen was issued a subpoena to testify
    before the grand jury looking into the case. Gen. Guillen
    returned to Venezuela and says he was then unable to testify
    because of a Venezuelan order prohibiting his leaving the
    country.

         U.S. officials are doubtful that Gen. Guillen will ever
    stand trial in the U.S. The general himself says he can't even
    afford to hire an attorney to represent him in the U.S. and fears
    he may face more legal trouble in Venezuela. "Since any report
    that comes from the DEA has 150% credibility, I imagine you may
    be interviewing me behind bars next year," he says.

    Mr. Adkins' essay is cute, even clever, but not relevant now nor was it when
    he wrote it.  Perhaps more important, it is inaccurate.

    Statements like his "largely rhetorical 'Oversight'" indicate he is unaware
 of
    reality.  It would be interesting to know the basis for such a misguided
    inaccurate conclusion.  It is hard to believe that it was based on
 attendance
    at hearings or the reading of Congressional reports on the  matter.

    That Mr. Adkins is also out of touch with the reality of CIA life - personal
    and bureaucratic - is suggested by the following:

    "The history of the US national security complex is a tapestry woven of
    deception, illegality, and arrogant contempt for democracy by a small
    group of smug and patronizing individuals who, operating under few
    constraints of accountability yet funded by tax dollars, have substituted
    their own personal visions of US policy for what could and should be
    a democratically determined agenda.  The CIA has been at the center of
    this."

    Ignoring the traditional leftist cant, these thoughts are as much without
    truth as they are without sources and examples - what illegality?, which
 smug
    and patronizing individuals?, and few constraints?  Mr. Adkins, where have
 you
    been since the Church Committee era?

    Then one wonders what sources led Mr. Adkins to write that "According to the
    mainstream media myth, the CIA is a reformed organization."  That is
 certainly
    not the view I get from the 20 or so newspapers I monitor, the Internet
    commentary, or the TV shows I see.  Then he adds that the "CIA continues to
    lie to Congress..." about Haiti and Guatemala.  The probable source of
    assertion is suggested, though not documented, later in his piece when he
    cites the >> Covert Action Information Bulletin<<, a not unbiased purveyor
 of
    anti-CIA opinion.

    To comment on every error or distortion in the piece would be to do Mr.
    Adkins' homework for him.  One more will have to do.  It concerns Mr. Adkins
    comment that:

     "I thought it would be a good idea to put CIA practices into broader
    perspective.  In order to understand why the CIA is probably an unreformable
    organization, it is necessary to understand how its officers think; its
    institutional mentality."

    Then he cites an article by Miles Copeland, "CIA officer" [he was long
 retired
    by 1975] to make his point.  Poor choice, and just a little effort would
 have
    shown that to be the case.  Copeland was never one of the "big boys."  He
 was
    an unabashed maverick and he took great pleasure is making outlandish
    statements he knew would were inaccurate and would infuriate Congress. He
    acknowledged as much in his memoirs.  The suggestion that what he wrote
    represents Agency thinking, then or now, is as inaccurate as it is appealing
    to Mr. Adkins.  Incidentally, the publication review board policies have not
    changed or expanded and it would have made no difference to Copeland anyway.
    He took pleasure in pointing out in his memoirs and in person that he didn't
    submit the book for review.  Neither did Philip Agee, but that failure
 doesn't
    influence the facts and the errors in either case; they must be assessed
    independently.

    Before retiring from government service, I served with the CIA while a
    military intelligence officer and then joined the Agency.  For many, these
    facts mean - a priori - that my views are as distorted as I think Mr.
 Adkins'
    to be.  Of course I disagree, but I am willing to argue the toss.  The CIA
 was
    and is not perfect, but it was and is nothing like the monster Mr. Adkins
    attempts to portray.  Had he raised his points as questions for discussion,
 a
    very useful service would have been performed.  Presenting them as dogma
 makes
    life easy for the unthinking.  But it is also sad since the truth and the
    stimulating process of finding it, are avoided.  CIA bashing is easy and
    certainly popular, but the literature of intelligence, carefully pursued
 will
    not, in my judgment, lead the objective scholar to concur with the
 assertions
    Mr. Adkins puts forth.  A better understanding of what really goes on
 requires
    effort.  Start with John Ranelagh's "The Agency," Loch Johnson's "Secret
    Agencies," Kathryn Olmsted's "Challenging The Secret Government," Frank
    Smist's "Congress Oversees the United States Intelligence Community," or
 even
    Joel Koket's "Students and the Cold War."

John Ranelagh's book is more or less an official public history
of the CIA which attempts to put its activities in the best light.
Olmsted's book (University of North Carolina Press, 1996) is indeed
excellent, but its theses support my views and oppose yours, as I will
show below.  The same is true of Smist, to a lesser degree.

>Mr. Adkins' essay is cute, even clever, but not relevant now nor was it
>when he wrote it.  Perhaps more important, it is inaccurate.
>

>a misguided inaccurate conclusion.

A wide variety of open sources, but let's concentrate on some of
those in your list.  Olmsted brings together many of these.

  "Another political scientist, Frank Smist, Jr., argues that the
permanent committees have grown supportive of the intelligence community
and practice 'institutional' rather than 'investigative' oversight.
Institutional overseers defer to the executive branch and tend to
become advocates of the agencies they oversee, while investigative
overseers are aggressive and suspicious."  (Olmsted at p. 178, citing
Smist at p. 275)

  "Michael Harrington [D-Mass.], who led the effort to launch the House
investigation [during the mid '70s]...believes that Congress's message
to the agencies has been consistent, both before and after the
investigations: 'Engage in mischief but do it discretely.'"  (Olmsted,
ibid., citing a 1992 interview with Harrington.)

  "Some members of the Ford administration are also skeptical of the
long-term effects of the investigations.  'After seeing the some of
the things that went on in the Reagan administration,' says Phil
Buchen, President Ford's Counsel, 'I'm not sure the reform was lasting.'"
(Olmsted, ibid., citing a 1992 interview with Buchen)

  "Richard Helms [former CIA director], the man at the center of many
of the investigations, agrees that the inquiries did not result in many
changes.  And that, he thinks, is a good thing for the country.  'After
all, if you want these things done, they have to get done somehow.  And
the more strictures and pressures and so forth that are put on the people
doing it, the harder it is to do it,' he says.  Several scholars of the
intelligence community maintain that the congressional oversight
committees have had 'very limited impact' as John Prados has written."
(Olmsted, ibid., citing a 1992 interview with Helms; and citing Prados
and several others in footnote 53 on p. 233)

Even CIA apologist Ranelagh, describing the mid-1970s investigations
and reforms, characterized them as a gentleman's agreement between
Congress and the CIA:

  "If the Church Committee had been confronted by a CIA that said,
'Yes, we do engage in assassinating people down dark alleys and in
keeping people in 'safe' houses in 'spartan' conditions if they
do not tell us what we want to know -- what do you think presidents
have been authorizing for decades?' Frank Church would have been faced
with the problem of saying, 'Well, it has been alright for decades but
it isn't alright now.'  Instead, all Church had to do was hold the
Agency to its myth: everything was in the past; we do not need more
stringent controls to ensure that those operating in the name of the
American people act as anything but Americans or only in ways that
Americans act.  The trick was that Americans act like everybody
else, and implicitly, therefore, the CIA could too.  Church gave its
actions democratic sanction."  (Ranelagh, p. 599)

  "The big questions were never really addressed...Because these
questions were not tackled, a new understanding mushroomed in the
mid-1970s as the investigations wore on: there was a secret place
as long as it was not examined too closely.  It existed by implication
rather than by outright statement.  Specifics could be spotlighted,
but people were not willing to expand upon those specifics to the
general picture.  This was Frank Church's and William Colby's most
important contribution to American intelligence."  (Ranelagh, ibid.)

Please note that Olmsted also cites those with more sanguine views,
including Loch Johnson.  But it should be clear by now that there
is substantial scholarly concurrence with the more cynical view,
which I happen to share.  In her epilogue however, and elsewhere in
her book, Olmsted expresses her own views.  Her general theses are
summarized on the back cover of her book and elaborated elsewhere:

  "Many observers predicted that the investigations would lead to
far-reaching changes in the intelligence agencies.  Yet, as Kathryn
Olmsted shows, neither the media nor Congress pressed for reforms.
For all of its post-Watergate zeal, the press hesitated to break its
long tradition of deference in national security coverage.  Congress,
too, was unwilling to challenge the executive branch in national
security matters.  Reports of the demise of the executive branch
were greatly exaggerated, and the result of the 'year of intelligence'
was a return to the status quo."  (Olmsted, rear cover.)

  "Most policy makers decided to maintain American illusions by
keeping the public ignorant of secret operations.  They concluded
-- perhaps correctly -- that many Americans wanted to be kept in
ignorance...Richard Helms contends that this attitude reveals that
'we're basically a rather hypocritical nation; we like things to be
done, but we don't want to have the blood on our hands.'"  (Olmsted,
p. 188, and citing 1992 interview with Helms)

>Then one wonders what sources led Mr. Adkins to write that "According to
>the mainstream media myth, the CIA is a reformed organization."  That is
>certainly not the view I get from the 20 or so newspapers I monitor, the
>Internet commentary, or the TV shows I see.

Our perspectives differ profoundly.  I agree with Olmsted's thesis,
which is that the adversarial reputation of the press in national
security matters rests on the laurels of a handful of maverick reporters,
who had to fight to get their stories told (when they *were* told) and
who are often maligned at the time by their peers.  She also agrees that
the mainstream press has become even more timid since then, quoting for
example New York Times executive editor Abe Rosenthal, who declared that
if Seymore Hersh had submitted some of his famous mid-1970s stories five
years later, he would not have published them.  (Olmsted, p. 192, and
Chapter 8, "Unwelcome Truths", in general)

A more recent example which leaps to mind, not mentioned by Olmsted, was
the case of New York Times reporter Raymond Bonner, who was actually
forced from his job and widely vilified by his colleagues as a leftist
propagandist for his investigative stories on El Salvador, until
later Establishment revelations confirmed that he was right and that
the Reagan administration had been lying.

I continue to observe an "its all in the past" attitude in the coverage
of CIA and Pentagon scandals by the Washington Post, NY Times, and LA
Times, and a general willingness to deny what can be denied and to
downplay what can't be denied.  There are notable exceptions.

I agree that the CAIB (now Covert Action Quarterly) doesn't conceal
its point of view.  It can be an excellent source for obscure information
(though independent confirmation is always a good idea), but it doesn't
happen to be the source for the observations you object to.

The June 29, 1996 edition of the Washington Post carried a story you
must have missed.  Headlined: "Panel Confirms CIA Officials Knew of
Abuses, Agency Hid Actions of Guatemalan Contacts," the story reported
some of the findings of the Intelligence Oversight Board:

  "A presidential advisory panel disclosed yesterday that the CIA
employed multiple informants in the Guatemalan government and military
forces over the past decade who agency officials knew were involved in
assassinations, torture, kidnappings, and murders in that country.
  The Intelligence Oversight Board also concluded that CIA officials
wrongfully kept information about these crimes and other human rights
abuses by their paid Guatemalan informants from Congress, committing
a violation of U.S. law that continued until late 1994. . . The board
declined to accuse any individuals in the CIA...It blamed instead a
systematic failure by the agency to pay heed to the issue of human rights
in its foreign operations until 1994."

Incidentally, it should be noted that assassinations, torture,
kidnappings and murders are part of broader U.S. policy:

  "U.S. Army intelligence manuals used to train Latin American
military officers from 1982 to 1991 advocated executions, torture,
blackmail, false imprisonment, causing the arrest of the subject's
parents..."   (Associated Press September 21, 1996, and the Washington
Post, same date.)

Note that the major media had denied or ignored substantial independent
evidence for years; only when the Pentagon 'fessed up did it report
it as fact.  This story received very brief attention, downplayed
both the extent of the problem and the extent of official cognizance,
and left the public with the impression that this sort of thing is...all
in the past!  Covert Action Quarterly (formerly CAIB) published an
illuminating story a few years earlier, in its Fall 1993 issue
(pp. 15-19).

CIA also lied to Congress (and to others) in continuing to provide
as much as $5 million a year to the Guatemalan military after
President Bush suspended aid in the wake of the 1990 murder of
U.S. citizen and former Peace Corps worker Michael DeVine.  Secretary
of State Warren Christopher, ostensibly uninformed, appeared on
CBS' "Face the Nation" in 1995 to deny that any CIA money was being
sent to Guatemala.  Shortly after this, President Clinton was informed
by an "aide" that the opposite was true, and he suspended this secret
flow of CIA funds.  (April 4, 1995 Washington Post, and others)

Another recent case, referred to by senior lawmakers involved in
intelligence oversight as "a cooler Guatemala" involved a CIA
economic espionage operation against France, resulting in "the
suspension of virtually all its operations there," and threatening
the CIA's broader Western European operations when the enraged
French shared information on the CIA's economic espionage activities
with other European intelligence services, including the Germans
and the Italians.   "They [CIA] didn't tell us anything before the
operation blew," said one member of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, who declined to be identified.  "They only told us about
this at the time that it was hitting the papers."  (Los Angeles Times
story picked up by the Arizona Republic on October 13, 1995)

Since I've already practically written a book here, and since the
matter has received wide press attention, I will leave the matter of the
CIA's operations in Haiti for another occasion.

This is entirely inaccurate.  True, Copeland was retired.  But he
maintained contacts and friendships, formally and informally, with
current officers.  Recall his comments in the National Review article:

  "Almost all of the Agency people I talked to assured me unashamedly,
almost proudly, 'Of course we are going to lie to the congressional
committees.'  They felt as loyal Americans they cannot do otherwise."

Copeland, who was no small fry, also confirms this in his book, Without
Cloak Or Dagger, which, contrary to what you assert, characterizes
itself in perfectly respectable terms:

  "A presentation of credentials is in order.  How am I able to write
a balanced and accurate account?  [career details snipped]  From time
to time I have been called back to the Agency to review the systems
in the light of what the Agency's sophisticated counterespionage
controls have discovered about 'the other side's' occasional
penetrations and to recommend renovations.  Also, with the knowledge
and at least tacit approval of the CIA I have helped organize and
activate intelligence and counterintelligence systems for a number
of other governments.  In short, my knowledge of the business is
from the inside, and has been sufficiently across the board to
keep me from making the mistakes of those disgruntled CIA specialists
who left the Agency to write exposes."  (Copeland, ibid., p. 12)

>or expanded and it would have made no difference to Copeland anyway.

Agee, a self-proclaimed revolutionary communist, escaped review by going
to England to publish his book.  Copeland, a diehard CIA loyalist, did
claim (without any noticeable pleasure) that he failed to submit his
book for review, ostensibly for fear that, despite its innocuous
contents, it might be suppressed by a reviewer who feared that "he
might miss one potentially explosive sentence."  The fact that Copeland
was a good-buddy of the CIA, and that his book was published in 1974,
at a time before the CIA began to appreciate the need for more
sophisticated public relations and the increased controls necessary for
this, may have had something to do with the CIA's benevolent attitude.

Publication review board policies (and their enforcement!) did expand
substantially during the 1980s, as the Reagan administration became
ever more concerned about leaks and spin control in the executive
branch.  There were acrimonious debates between Congress and the
executive on this and related matters.  A good popular summary of
these issues can be found in Government Secrecy: Decisions Without
Democracy (People for the American Way, 1987).

All but the most diehard CIA apologists admit my characterization to
be accurate over a large portion of the CIA's history.  Where
they and I differ is in their supposition that this is all in the
past and not at all applicable to the "new CIA."  If you want
documentation, I suggest you start with the Church and Pike Committees'
reports and work your way through the classics (e.g., Thomas Powers'
"The Man Who Kept The Secrets," John Marks' partial history of CIA
behavioral control experiments "The Search for the Manchurian
Candidate," Frank Donner's "The Age of Surveillance", etc.); and
procede through the numerous government and private publications
documenting the Iran/Contra years and beyond.

<<<<<
WOULD I TELL A LIE?
Daniel Jeffreys

The CIA has long administered polygraph tests to root out unsuitable agents.
But an obsession wityh the sex lives of its women employees has led to a
welter of lawsuits and a crisis down at "The Farm"



"Sarah" began spying for the CIA in 1987.  We can't use her real name
because unauthorised contact between a CIA employee and the press is a
federal offence. Sarah thought that a position with the CIA would be her
dream job.  Fluent in five languages, she left university in Virginia
wanting to travel and meet interesting people. She was not disappointed: the
CIA sent her to more than a dozen countries in her first five years.

     Like all her colleagues, she took a pre-entry lie detector test.  The
CIA has always required new recruits to take the test in an attempt to weed
out anybody who might be concealing a dodgy past.  "I was a bit surprised by
the intimate nature of the questions," she says.  "I figured it was a
one-off deal and let it ride.  They asked me about my sex life.  Luckily I
didn't really have one at the time, so there was not much to say."

     That changed after 1995.  By then, Sarah had a boyfriend.  She also
found herself subject to more frequent tests.  After the embarrassment of
the Aldrich Ames scandal in 1994, when the CIA discovered that one of its
agents had sold America's most sensitive secrets undetected for almost 10
years, it was decided that all staff members of the agency must take a
polygraph test at least once every five years.

     Case officers -- the CIA's technical term for a spy -- must take the
test more frequently. Sarah, a case officer, found the inquisitors at "The
Farm", the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, persistently curious
about her private life. She describes her last polygraph, in July, as an
exercise in abuse and intimidation.  "They kept coming back to my sex life,"
she says.  "They asked how many times we have sex in a month, what kind of
sex we have, what kind of positions, what I was wearing.  How can I have a
normal sexual relationship now, knowing that whatever I do in bed I may be
asked to describe in detail to one of my superior officers?"

     In the last 18 months the CIA has lost case officers at a rate about 20
per cent above average, compared to the last 10 years.  A large portion of
these defections have been young members of staff, the master spies of
tomorrow.  It has become difficult to fill key positions, intelligence
gathering has been interrupted and morale is said to bc at critical levels.
The CIA has been told by the US Congress to increase its recruitment of
women by 30 per cent in each of the next five years. But allegations from
serving officers about the lie detector tests are having a marked negative
impact and CIA recruiters are finding it hard to meet their targets.

     "The polygraph test is undermining morale throughout the Agency," says
Michael Kelly, a former intelligence officer who is now an attorney
specialising in employee lawsuits against the CIA.  "Good people are leaving
rather than face an annual ritual of humiliation.  The lie detector tests
should be far more limited.  Officers should be asked if they have had
unauthorised contact with foreigners and if they have passed any classified
material through unauthorised channels.  If an officer's answers to these
show no signs of deception, that should be it. Instead they insist on
probing the most personal details, and that has made many officers angry."

     Case officer "Mary" is a good example.  On assignment in Turkey she
fell in love.  When it came to her polygraph test, officers took her through
a list of the most perverse sexual acts, asking her if she had ever
practised them with her new boyfriend.  "I felt there was a degree of sexual
harassment involved," she says.  "I think the interrogators got a kick out
of asking the questions.  My feeling was that it was no way to treat a
fellow professional.  With the prospect of similar tests at least every two
or three years, I decided to resign."

     The CIA's lie detector test relies on standard polygraph equipment.
For their test, case officers are led into a windowless room somewhere deep
inside "The Farm".  There is a large table with chairs on one side.  At the
head of the table is a solitary stool on which the officer sits.  According
to sources who have taken the test, the atmosphere is tense and formal.  A
technician applies a device like a blood pressure cuff to the officer's arm.
The device is wired to a machine that records temperature, pulse rate and
moisture on the skin's surface. ne officer will also have finger pads
applied to the left hand.  Thcre are more than 2,000 sweat pores on each
fingertip and the pads measure perspiration and the rate of electrical
current across the skin.  If either the cuff or the pads indicate rates of
tension above a certain level, the officer will fall under suspicion.  "So
imagine you've just been asked how many times you and your boyfriend had sex
last week," says Sarah.  "That's likely to make your heart rate rise a bit.
A normal person might perspire somewhat before answering."

     That's when the trouble starts.  According to Sarah, the interrogators
then zero in, asking repeated questions about sex and very little else.

     Nor are the problems associated with the CIA's lie detector confined to
women.  Many men are struggling to pass the new tests.  "The tests are
extremely fallible," says Dr Greig Veeder, a New York polygraph expert.
"Many states in the US, like Florida, will not permit lie detector evidence.
Liars have trouble with polygraphs, but so do people who tend to feel more
guilt, and those with greater doubts about their abilities."

     Michael Kelly agrees.  "People with strong religious backgrounds have
huge difficulties with the lie detector," he says. I always had trouble with
the drug section, even though I had nothing to feel guilty about."

     Kelly says he never took drugs at school or university, which left him
open to mockery from many of his acquaintances.  "That memory makes me sweat
whenever the subject of drugs comes up; it brings back the often vicious
teasing I went through.  That translated in the test to my seeming to lie
about drug use.  I cleared it all up with the Agency, but it was tough."

     Those difficulties have been amplified by a series of sex
discrimination and harassment suits against the Agency, some of which are
related to the use of polygraphs.  "There's a feeling the agency is still
locked into an atmosphere of espionage and deception," says Kelly, "whereas
in the post-cold war era the CIA's primary function should be intelligence
gathering.  There are too many senior officers who still think they're in a
macho fight to the finish.  If the Agency's recruitment difficulties
persist, the quality of information gathered by the CIA will continue to
diminish and that will be a problem, for the US and its allies."

     Senior case officer "Jane" agrees.  She has recently resigned from the
CIA, but requested a pseudonym because she is planning a discrimination
lawsuit against the Agency.  "I guess using a false name is also a habit,
from all those years of spying," she says, laughing. "I loved the job, but
eventually the new obsession with lie detection gave me an unacceptable choice."

     In 1995 Jane, on a posting in Asia, met a foreigner and they fell in
love.  When she reported the relationship, as required by CIA regulations,
she was subjected to repeated polygraphs of a most intimate nature.  "I
passed every one," she says.  "Whatever they asked, I was clean." Then Jane
decided she wanted to marry.  "The Agency told me my fiance must take a
polygraph.  He did, and he failed.  He's not an intelligence professional,
and I think he was just spooked."

     Jane was given a choice: dump the man or leave the Agency.  She chose
the man.  "I have plenty of marketable talents and I can survive without the
Clk" she says.  "The question is, can the CIA survive without me, and the
hundreds of people like me who think the senior officers have made
conditions intolerable because they can't risk another Aldrich Ames?"

Subject: Manuals and Guatemala . . .

I believe that in the WP article concerning the manuals at SOA, it stated
that the "torture and execution" chapters were not part of the official
curriculum, and indeed were only in those manuals at all by mistake.
While obviously embarrassing, this leads one to question the complete
accuracy of the Post quote that the " . . . manuals used to train torture
and execution" to the clientle there.  If memory serves, the WP also said
that the offending chapters were removed in 1991.

Subject: LSE Csrc Colloquium Dec 5: Information Warfare

LSE/CSRC Colloquium December 5th 1996

London School of Economics
Computer Security Research Centre

Public Colloquium Programme 1996-97

Time: Thursday December 5th 1996 at 1745 for 1800 hrs

Venue: Vera Anstey Room,  LSE Old Building, Houghton Street, WC2A 2AE

=====================================================================
Peter Sommer
Research Fellow

Information Warfare:
new threats or just a great marketing slogan?

The vision that is being promoted is of an "electronic Pearl Harbor",
an attack in cyberspace on the Global Information Infrastructure of
key telecommunications services and computers.  Could viruses and
trojans be employed by cyber-terrorists?  What is the truth about
cyber-espionage? What are the realities behind cyber-extortion?
Are there working weapons based on high energy radio frequencies
which specifically attack computers?

Or is information warfare simply a great advertising phrase, with
meanings that become increasingly elusive the closer you examine
the claims of its promoters?  Has it become the latest and best way
for  soon-to-be-redundant spooks and armed services officers to
make new claims on national budgets - and for computer and defence
companies to offer expensive solutions to problems that don't
really exist?

Peter Sommer will trace the history of the ideas behind information
warfare and lead the colloquium into making some balanced and
informed risk assessments.


====================================================================


The purpose of the CSRC colloquia is to allow practitioners and academics
the opportunity to examine current issues in information security at
greater depth than is possible within the confines of the regular
commercial conference.  Practitioners can consider long term trends and
review some of the newer ideas and analyses emerging from academic work.
Academics can discover new concerns emerging within the industry.

Meetings are held at the LSE in Central London on a number of Thursdays
between October and March and timed for the early evening to make it more
convenient for practitioners to attend.


Updated information available at http://csrc.lse.ac.uk/csrc/sem96a.htm


====================================================================


A small charge is made for non-members of the LSE and a season ticket,
giving admittance to all meetings is strongly recommended.
Attendance fee per meeting is 15;  a season ticket for all meetings is
120.

Subject: Letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee

I sent the following letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee in the
hope that perhaps now there will be a comprehensive investigation into a
decades old racket.


The Senate Intelligence Committee
Hart Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510

Gentlemen,


As a private citizen with no political agenda or
organization behind me, I have studied the illegal drug
industry for a number of years. As part of this study I have
written two papers, enclosed, which I think have information
which the Committee might find useful.

The basic problem of government involvement with
international illegal drug activity has a simple thesis and
a complicated connection with other criminal activity. The
simple thesis is that during the 1980's the logistics of
drug running required a stopover from Columbia to the United
States. Central America was that place. This made war, not
peace, the objective.

The complicated connection is that the drug running was
intertwined with illegal arms activities. In Los Angeles the
promotion of drugs and weapons was apparently parallel. The
other criminal activity, extra-judicial murder and torture
of one's opponents, also seems to have run hand in hand with
the other crimes. While some may have engaged in these
activities out of a distorted sense of patriotism, the basic
motive was greed.

Your Committee will face massive obstacles to getting to the
truth as the sums involved are staggering, the players have
great power, and both political parties have indicated a
propensity to stonewall any meaningful investigation.
Nevertheless, the future of a free people is at stake, so I
wish you well.

I have also enclosed a witness list. The deposition of any
or all of these people should prove enlightening.


                                                Sincerely,


                                                Joseph Canepa

To Joe Canepa et. al:

      To add to the witness list, historian John Newman has also been
doing some very important work in this area, and has been working with
Rep. Walters  on the issue. I saw him give a very important presentation
in Dallas last week, including a variety of recently-released DEA
documents.This is becoming a very well-documented scandal.

The only reason communists howl and shriek about so-called "right wing death
squads" is because the tactics work and cripple their organizations. By
definition, communists advocate the abrogation of all individual rights,
therefore they can lay claim to no individual rights themselves. I'm more
fascinated with "journalists" and "human rights" (as opposed to what?)
advocates who spin in circles and scream whenever communists are killed.

There are a few other folks besides "communists" who are a bit upset by the
systematic practice of extra-judicial murder. And at least one of the
reasons that folks are generally not too thrilled with this practice is that
there is too often a tendency to get the causality reversed, in that whoever
winds up dead is retroactively reclassified as a "communist" more or less
regardless of their pre-mort condition.

And as for the ends justifying the means [a proposition which in general I
don't have too much difficulty with, more or less], the US tossed lotsa
folks outta helicopters under the Phoenix program without materially
altering the final outcome in Vietnam, and it is far from evident that any
useful purpose was served by the "Dirty War" in Argentina.

I guess that at least part of the problem that some Americans have with the
whole "right wing death squad" approach to law&order is that it is lawless
and disorderly. This country has had far too much of this, including but
certainly not limited to the KKK [speaking as someone who would not have to
spend too much time poking around my family tree to find not-too-distant
relatives who at one time had robes readily at hand].

And so forth.....

While there are probably limits to our ability to impost Truth Justice And
The American Way on others, it is certainly within our power to avoid
imposing practices on others that are directly contrary to Truth Justice And
The American Way. And denying the right to exist to anyone that we choose to
label a "communist" is probably just a bit outside prevailing community
standards.

Well, I normally don't like to engage in ad hominem exchanges, but the "as
opposed to what?" would seem to include you. For your own sake I would
certainly hope that your characterization of yourself as "SFC" and "3rd
SFG(A)" is just something that you made up rather than your actual
affiliation, as I don't really imagine that one would have to get too far up
your chain of command before adequate adult supervision would realize that
your kind of loose talk is not exactly what the USG has in mind.

These right-wing death squads (why the quotation marks?), whether military
or paramilitary, are remarkably cavalier in their application of these
methods.  Most of the victims end up being non-combatants, and many
are not even communists.  They are students, labor activists, civil
libertarians, -- and their friends and relatives -- and others with a real
or perceived political philosophy left of center (or right).

But communists have rights too.  The laws and constitutions of all of
these countries do not make exceptions for those whose political
beliefs people disagree with.  For the military to take the law into
its own hands, arrest people extra-judicially, hold them incommunicado
on an army base for weeks or months, torture them and/or kill them,
is morally and legally wrong.

And if I were you, I'd be concerned about two things: (1) If there is no
difference between the way the communists treat their enemies, and
the way the government treats its enemies, if there is no democracy
or justice, then people will be much more receptive to the devil they
don't know, particularly when it offers things that the current
government does not; (2) Hope that you do not end up as a captured
adviser in a country whose military and intelligence officers you
have been training or advising to brutalize the population.

As for what rights communists respect or don't respect, I think it
depends largely upon the party.  At one end you have communists who are
little more than social democrats, and at the other you have groups
like the Shining Path which are as ruthless and as brutal as they
come (oh, did I forget the Khmer Rouge?)

Just remember that expediency is a two-edged sword, that power
corrupts, and that secrecy hides many abuses that even ardent
anti-communists would find monsterous.

No, but it did quote Pentagon officials who claimed that the material,
which was part of the manuals from 1982 to 1991 (as I stated) and was
distributed to thousands of Latin American officers, was the result of
a "bureaucratic oversight."  Absurd.  The language, although more
extreme and graphic, was similar to what was included in the Clandestine
Operations Manual for Central America which was given to the Contras.

Pentagon: Sorry folks, the chapters on murder, blackmail, false
imprisonment, and torture were included by mistake.  We don't
understand how it happened.  Nevertheless, there was no intent by
anyone to break the law or violate our public standards.

The Post story also mentioned that Pentagon officials had lied just
this year, prior to their later release, about the existence of
such instructions.

Subject: El Salvador: a case study of SOA methods

Regarding communists and their lack of respect for human rights, and
right-wing death squads and their lack of respect for these rights, the
case of El Salvador during the 1980s is instructive for those inclined
toward simplistic moralizing about communists, anti-communists, and
U.S. policy toward them.

The U.N. Truth Commission on El Salvador consisted of former president
of Colombia Belisario Betancur, former Venezuelan foreign minister
Reinaldo Figueroa Planchart, and U.S. law professor Thomas Buergenthal
-- hardly a bunch of communists -- together with a team of support
staff and advisors.  The Truth Commission examined human rights
violations in El Salvador during its civil war from 1980 to 1992.  The
Truth Commission attibuted 95 percent of the abuses reported to it to
the El Salvadoran military, security forces, and paramilitary
death-squads linked to them.

The Truth Commission found that the government forces (which the U.S.
supported and lied for) were responsible for massacres, killings,
torture, rape, and disappearances on a massive scale.  It concluded that
death squads linked to state structures became an instrument of terror
responsible for the systematic physical elimination of political
opponents.  It also found that only the government forces (not the
FMLN rebels) practiced kidnapping and torture on a systematic,
administrative basis.  [1]

Incidentally, the clandestine Secret Anticommunist Army, Ejercito
Secreto Anti-Communista, denounced the report (as did the governent
of El Salvador) and warned that its Justice Commission would "carry
out de facto justice...against those institutions or individuals
who want to harm El Salvador."

An aside: Roberto D'Aubuisson, leader of El Salvador's right-wing
death squads, was a graduate of the School of the Americas, the
Army school whose manuals advocated murder, torture, blackmail,
and the imprisonment of people's parents to secure their cooperation.

A case in point when this kind of lawless chaos rules:

 A supplier of woven goods to a friend of mine was a women's weaving
collective in Guatemala.  My friend had visited them many times and
their sole interest was weaving. Their only notion of politics was that
it was frightening. Many of them were missing husbands and children, and
were struggeling to fend for what families they had left.  All of them
were murdered.  They were not communists, they were mostly old women who
were actually beginning gain some recognition here as fine
craftspersons,  and to generate some money for their families.

 In the small town where this happened, there was of course jealousy, as
there always is in a small village when somebody begins to get ahead,
and because they were a CO-OPERATIVE, some ignorant brownshirts labeled
them as COMMUNISTS. This, of course was a license to murder them.

 Who is responsible?  I will never know, but it is a typical fall out
when morality is put aside for expediancy.

I agree with all the points you made, but consider
this:

There really was a global Marxist/Communist movement in
the 20th century. This movement collectively murdered
more than 100 million innocent civilians (according to
R. J. Rummel), abrogated the civil and human rights of
hundreds of millions, and utterly destroyed the
cultures and economies of the societies which it
conquered. Survey the remains of what was once the
Soviet Union.

This messianic movement expressed an ambition to
conquer the world, and was willing to use any
extra-legal or terrorist means in the book to
accomplish its ends.

How do democratic societies which respect individual
freedom and the rule of the law defend themselves
against movements which are hostile to and contemptuous
of those values?

Answer: it is extremely difficult. It is not likely
that you are going to come out of a struggle with an
enemy of that nature without violating some of your
most precious principles and being damaged yourself.

Frankly, I'm amazed that Western Europe and the U.S.
came out of this war as the victors without being in
worse shape, in terms of violations of human rights and
civil liberties. Matters could have been much worse.

One wonders about those who focus on the human rights
violations of the democratic West without taking into
account the global context in which these human rights
violations occurred. The human rights violations in the
Soviet Union, China and Cambodia (to name only three
Marxist regimes) vastly exceeded those in the
democratic West. We admittedly got our hands dirty in
preventing Communists from achieving their planetary
aims. Overall, however, we exercised remarkable
restraint in fighting an extremely dirty war, the terms
of which were established by the other side.

You know, I've engaged in many extended discussions and debates
with what might one call the leftist intelligentsia--the
ideological apologists for Marxist crimes around the world.

These are the kind of people who think that Joe McCarthy was a
more evil political criminal than Joseph Stalin. (McCarthy was
obnoxious and a threat to decency and civil liberties in American
life, but he did not murder 20 million innocent civilians.)

Folks who cannot discriminate between Joe McCarthy and Joe Stalin
are, in my opinion, beyond the pale. They are neither serious
historians nor moral philosophers. Their political advice is
worse than useless.

I'm sure you don't fit into this category, but it would be
reassuring if you demonstrated at least as much moral outrage
about the cold-blooded murder of 100 million innocent civilians
by Marxists in this century as you do about the crimes of the
Western democracies.

Your lack of balance on this matter so far I find curious. All
your moral passions and anger are directed at the American IC.
Why? The United States defeated the two most dangerous
totalitarian political movements in this century: Marxism and
Nazism. Can't you give us just a little credit for good deeds?

>The Comintern ended officially in 1943 and Stalin was known for his

>conquest.

I really think that I am not confusing anything with anything.
Various Marxist organizations and movements around the world
coordinated their activities with the aim of imposing the rule of
the Marxist intelligentsia over the entire planet. They used
deceit, subversion, propaganda, psychological warfare and
terrorism to accomplish their ends. Many recent works of
substantive and reputable scholarship have appeared, examining
secret documents within the former Soviet Union, that demonstrate
that the use of these nasty methods was systematic and pervasive.

Many leftists in the democratic West carry (or SHOULD carry) a
great burden of guilt and shame for their apologetics for Marxist
political crimes around the world. They have blood on their
hands. But many of them are still too arrogant to admit their
errors, despite the overwhelming evidence that they have been
attempting to minimize the crimes of perhaps the most monstrous
political enterprise in world history.

A few of them, however, are refreshingly honest about the
problem. Eugene Genovese is one:

excerpt=

(page=371)

     As a university professor, I teach, participate in
     professional associations, lecture on various campuses, give
     papers at scholarly conferences, and review books for
     national journals and local newspapers: in short, I get
     around. For many years I have lived in dread of having to
     answer The Question. Curiously, no one has asked it.

     At first I wondered if I had an ego problem. Did I feel
     bruised to learn that I was not important enough to be
     asked? Were not more visible and professionally celebrated
     chaps with similar backgrounds having to face the music?
     Apparently not. So far as I know, none of the others, whose
     number is legion, has been asked either.

     The Question: "What did you know, and when did you know it?"
     For at the age of fifteen I became a Communist, and,
     although expelled from the party in 1950 at age twenty, I
     remained a supporter of the international movement and of
     the Soviet Union until there was nothing left to support.
     Now, as anyone knows, in a noble effort to liberate the
     human race from violence and oppression we broke all records
     for mass slaughter, piling up tens of millions of corpses in
     less than three-quarters of a century. When the Asian
     figures are properly calculated, the aggregate to our credit
     may reach the seemingly incredible numbers widely claimed.
     Those who are big on multiculturalism might note that the
     great majority of our victims were nonwhite.

     Never having been much good at math, I shy away form
     quibbles over statistics. Still, all quibbles aside, we have
     a disquieting number of corpses to account for.

     Those of us who have preached the need to break eggs in
     order to make omelets might note the political complexion of
     some of the eggs. About twenty years ago, picking up on some
     passages in Roy Medvedev's Let History Judge, I wondered if
     Comrade Stalin had not killed more communists than were
     killed by all the bourgeois, imperialist, Fascist, and Nazi
     regimes put together. "It can't be true," said I. "Has
     Comrade Medvedev taken up serious drinking?" So I sat down
     to do some rough arithmetic. (You do not have to be good at
     math to do that much arithmetic.) Alas, Comrade Medvedev had
     not taken up serious drinking.

     Reflecting here on moral responsibility, I have referred to
     "we." For it has never occurred to me that the moral
     responsibility falls much less heavily on those of us on the
     American left than it fell on Comrade Stalin and those who
     replicated his feats in one country after another. And I am
     afraid that some of that moral responsibility falls on the
     "democratic socialists," "radical democrats," and other
     leftwingers who endlessly denounced Stalinism but could
     usually be counted on to support--"critically," of
     course--the essentials of our political line on world and
     national affairs.

(page=372)

     Especially amusing has been the spectacle of those who
     pronounced themselves anti-Stalinists and denounced the
     socialist countries at every turn and yet even today applaud
     each new revolution, although any damned fool has to know
     that most of them will end in the same place. For that
     matter, how could we have survived politically were it not
     for the countless liberals who, to one extent or another,
     supported us, apparently under the comforting delusion that
     we were social reformers in rather too much of a hurry--a
     delusion we ourselves never suffered from.

     There are liberals and liberals, and a distinction would
     have to be made in a more leisurely presentation. Even in
     academia there are indeed those who defend liberal
     principles tenaciously and honorably. But the countless
     opportunists and careerists who dominate the historical
     associations call themselves liberals as a matter of
     political convenience. They went with the McCarthyite flow
     in the 1950s and go with its left-wing variant today. In the
     unlikely prospect of a fascist or communist ascendancy
     tomorrow, they may be counted on to apply for party cards as
     soon as it looks like the smart move.

     Many of my old comrades and almost all of those ostensibly
     independent radicals and high-minded liberals remain
     unruffled. After all, did we not often protest against some
     outrage or other in the Soviet Union or China, signing an
     indignant petition or open letter? I know I did. And does
     not that change everything? I am afraid not, but I have
     nothing to offer as a critique other than that which may be
     found in Galatians 6:7.

     On May 11, 1992, having been invited by the right-wing
     American Enterprise Institute to reflect on the collapse of
     the socialist countries, I summoned up whatever capacity I
     have for dissembling in an effort to deflect the one
     question I did not want to answer. I did not want to answer
     it before a right-wing audience because I feared I would
     unleash my Sicilian temper and counterattack with the litany
     of the crimes of the imperialists and their insufferable
     apologists. I began:

        It is a great pleasure to be with you today, although,
        since I claim expertise only as a historian of the Old
        South, I speak on current issues with trepidation. I do
        hope that your invitation carries no sadistic
        intent--that you do not expect an autobiographical mea
        culpa. For while it is true that I have been a Marxist
        and a bitter-end supporter of the Soviet Union, I dislike
        autobiographies and admire the CIA's noble dictum, "Admit
        nothing, explain nothing, apologize for nothing.:

     The audience responded with good-natured laughter. Generally
     speaking, rightwingers are decidedly more courteous than we
     of the left and would not think of abusing their guests, as
     I probably would have abused them if challenged. They laid
     some tough questions on me during the discussion period, but
     not The Question.

     Recently, I remarked upon the corpses to a well-known
     left-wing journalist with whom my wife and I were having
     dinner. He looked disgusted: "You? You of all people are
     getting masochistic?" I reassured him as best I could. For,
     no, I am not getting masochistic in my old age. No, I am not
     about to cringe before rightwingers who supported numerous
     imperialist slaughters or social democrats whose responsible
     and moderate governments aided and abetted them. Yes, I do
     remember the glorious record of the bourgeoisie in the slave
     trade and the plantation colonies and the mass murders in
     Africa, Asia, and Latin America. I do recall that the
     Holocaust was not our doing. I still burn at the
     indifference with which virtually the whole American public
     received the reports of a quarter million Indonesian workers
     and peasants butchered in the 1960s, not in a civil war but
     in their beds. And I know the rest. No, I would not stand
     still for The Question from those people and would probably
     tell them what I have always told my classes, "Your side has
     had its mass murderers, and we have had ours."

     Perhaps knowledge of the record of imperialist atrocities
     leads our liberal colleagues to refuse to single us out by
     asking The Question. But I am afraid not. After all, they
     never stop asking southern whites about their crimes, real
     and imagined, against blacks. And let's face it: all the
     combined crimes of white southerners, at least if we
     restrict ourselves to the period since emancipation, would
     be worth no more than a footnote in a casebook that starred
     us.

     A few years ago, there was a successful effort to get the
     Organization of American Historians (OAH) to condemn
     apartheid in South Africa. In the OAH and other professional
     associations, Professor Wilborne Washburne resolutely
     opposed this politicization, and attempted to expose its
     hypocrisy by offering an amendment to condemn the
     "necklacing" of black South Africans, including children, by
     the militants of the African National Congress. (For those
     who have forgotten, "necklacing" was execution by burning
     the victims alive.) The ANC subsequently repudiated
     necklacing as not only wrong but barbarous. The OAH has yet
     to endorse that repudiation.

     I laughed. Those bloody South African whites did kill a lot
     of blacks and ought to answer for it, but throughout their
     whole history they probably never equaled the numbers we put
     up in one of our more spirited month's work. I laughed even
     harder when our liberal colleagues poured out their wrath on
     the ghastly racists in South Africa while they remained
     silent about the immeasurably greater slaughters occasioned
     by the periodic ethnic cleansing that is going on in black
     Africa and every other part of the globe. The New York Times
     recently announced that the death toll in the latest round
     of ethnic cleansing in Burundi has reached 150,000, with the
     fate of a half million or so refugees in doubt. The
     historical associations have not been heard from. Nor should
     anyone expect that they will....

     If we are to believe the worthies of the radical left, to
     pose The Question means to engage in a reactionary ploy to
     deflect attention from the oppression of women, gays, and
     other beleaguered minorities. Scholars in our own ranks have
     shown precious little interest in reflecting seriously on
     the collapse of the socialist countries we supported to the
     bitter end or on any personal responsibilities we might have
     for the occasional unpleasantness that led to so sad a
     denouement.

     And sad the denouement has been. For one might make a case
     of sorts to justify mass slaughters as the necessary price
     to be paid for a grand human liberation. Terrible as the
     sacrifices may have been, were they not justified by the
     beautiful world of equality, justice, and universal love we
     were creating for our children? During the communist
     revolution of 1919 in Hungary, Sigmund Freud startled his
     friends by announcing that he had become half a Bolshevik.
     One of his communist students explained that the revolution
     would mean oceans of blood out of which would come a just
     and humane society. Freud became half a Bolshevik: he
     declared his belief in every word of the first half.

     In retrospect Freud looks good and we not so good. Our
     justification began to look seedy when the grand liberation
     featured hideous political regimes under which no sane
     person would want to live. It became preposterous when our
     project ended in the ignominious collapse of the social
     system that was supposed to undergird a brave new world and
     justify the staggering sacrifice of human life.

     We easily forget the economic rationale that Marx taught us,
     namely, that socialism would have to provide unprecedented
     abundance if it were to sustain social liberation of any
     kind. With a few notable exceptions, leftists no longer find
     it fashionable to discuss economics at all beyond the now
     routine rejection of a "command economy" and some
     disingenuous mumbling about the necessity for markets. But
     where is there a serious attempt to determine the extent to
     which any socialism could function without a command economy
     or to show how a socialist economy could integrate markets?
     A few left-wing economists, most notably Louis Ferleger and
     Jay Mandle, tried to raise these questions long before the
     collapse of the socialist economies, but they were
     effectively shut out of the left-wing press and are still
     ignored. And we may doubt that the wry remark of Nancy
     Folbre and Samuel Bowles, two other respected left-wing
     economists, will cause a wrinkle: "Leftwing
     economists--among whom we count ourselves--have thus far
     failed to come up with a convincing alternative to
     capitalism." ...

     No one should be surprised that none of our leading
     historical associations have thought it intellectually
     challenging to devote sessions at their enormous annual
     meetings to frank discussions of the socialist debacle. We
     of the left are regularly invited to give papers on just
     about any subject except this one. We are not asked to
     assess the achievements as well as the disasters, the
     heroism as well as the crimes, and the lessons we ourselves
     have learned from a tragic experience. No one need be
     surprised that we have never been called upon to explain
     ourselves. The pezzonovanti of our profession have more
     important things on their minds. When they can take time
     away from their primary concern (the distribution of jobs,
     prizes, and other forms of patronage), they are immersed in
     grave condemnations of the appalling variations of human
     rights by Christopher Columbus. I know that it is in bad
     taste to laugh, but I laugh anyway. I would rather be judged
     boorish than seen throwing up.

The Soviet Union continued vigorously to support Marxist
movements all around the world long after 1943.

In any case, Stalin was not the main problem. The main problem
was the global political, social, ideological and propaganda
network that was agitating worldwide, frequently with the use of
extra-legal methods, to destroy democratic governments and
replace them with brutal dictatorships of the Marxist
intelligentsia. Stalin was just one element in an overall
movement which by any reasonable and objective standard was
criminal and a grave threat to civil liberties. The Cambodian
genocide was one of the most recent atrocities in a long line of
atrocities committed by Marxists. It is amazing how many American
leftists, who were supposedly driven by a concern for human
rights, remained in a state of denial about the Cambodian
situation long after all the facts were well-known. But that has
been their pattern throughout this century. They were equally
dishonest in denying the crimes of the Soviet Union in the
thirties.

The CIA was created primarily to deal with the problem of
Communism. Overall it did a good job--the West stopped Marxists
dead in their tracks, and the movement has collapsed.

Along the way the CIA performed some questionable deeds in
dealing with an aggressive movement of unparalleled nastiness.
That aspect of our history needs to be dealt with honestly.

The problem the CIA now faces is one of mission: with the
collapse of Communism, what is its primary purpose? There is a
faction in the American government that is trying to replace
Islam with Communism as the CIA's primary reason for existence. I
think that is an immense mistake, and a policy which, if
followed, will possibly lead to the ruination of the CIA and to
enormous setbacks and humiliations for the United States in the
global political arena. Unfortunately, John Deutch gives every
indication of being strongly influenced by this faction. Expect
the problems of the American IC and the American government to
mount in the coming months and years. If you start with bad
premises, you end with bad results.

I was not even born in 1950.

There may be some small and dwindling circle of "leftists" for whom this

There are an astonishing number of leftist traditions that have emerged over

direct experience with the competent organs of that state power].

Why? Do you deny that many leftists in the West
attempted to downplay and minimize the crimes committed
in the name of Marxism and socialism?

Both Paul Johnson and Richard Pipes have written
wonderfully on this subject. You might begin by reading
Paul Johnson's "Intellectuals" for the historical
background. The historical record is appalling.

Are you aware of the fact the New York Times in the
thirties suppressed news of mass murder in the Soviet
Union?

Most of these intellectuals were not explicitly
Communists or Marxists. But they apologized for
Communist and Marxist crimes.

The tradition continued well into the seventies, when
one could find many leftists trying to explain away the
mass murder in Cambodia.

Even now, the New York Times gives these crimes only
cursory attention. The Roy Medvedev book was discussed
on the front page of the Times, but there has been
damned little follow-up on the implications of his
statistics.

I don't believe that anyone accused you of being a
Communist, and your age is irrelevant.

Genovese has offered us some interesting insights into
the mindset of his colleagues in what could be called
the academic leftist establishment.

If you disagree with any of his observations, by all
means do so.

Again, none of this discussion has been directed at you
personally. In fact, I know nothing about your
political beliefs, and wouldn't presume to comment on
them.

Genovese has noticed, however, that many of his
colleagues have failed to come to terms with the
magnitude of the crimes committed in this century in
the name of social justice and leftist ideology. I
think he has put his finger on a legitimate and hot
issue. He is to be applauded for breaking ranks with
his fellow groupthinkers, and asking some tough
questions.

How many of these traditions also criticized Marxist
movements in Asia with equal vigor? The number of
victims of Marxism in China has been placed as high as
80 million.

Which of these leftist traditions spoke out with moral
fervor about the crimes that were being committed in
Asia in the name of leftist ideology? I can assure you
that many leftist groups in the Cambridge,
Massachusetts area gave whole-hearted supported to
Asian Marxist movements.

My politics are moderate libertarian, and I would
prefer to see a reduction in state power all around the
world, including in the U.S. Perhaps in some sense we
agree.

I have no problem with those who want to keep a close
eye on possible misdeeds of the American IC. In fact,
as you will notice, I have posted quite a few messages
about the Vince Foster case, which has the potential to
be one the biggest scandals in the history of the
American IC. (No one here has yet ventured to question
the credibility of Patrick Knowlton's report that the
FBI falsified his testimony and harassed him.)

But let's try to keep some perspective on misdeeds
within a global perspective.

The reports that have come out in the last few years
about the activities of the East German IC (STASI in
particular) are absolutely chilling. No misdeeds in the
democratic West begin to match them for their sublime
creepiness.

Good point.  Let me add also that not every leftist group (political or
armed) is "communist".  In El Salvador for example, the tiny Communist Party
was a fringe element even on the left.  This may be obvious to you, but
after reading the comments of SFC Steven Barry, I have to wonder if the
nuances of political affiliations and the philosophies that go with them
aren't lost on some.  There is also considerable variation in ethics,
strategy, and tactics even among parties and movements accurately labeled
as communist.

For example: the Communist Party of El Salvador actually supported
the government which took power in a coup in October 1979 -- as did the
U.S. government.  The communists pulled out of that government in December
1979 and joined the armed opposition because the government was still
arresting and shooting them; which, as Jonathan Kwitny notes, "isn't an
illogical reason for revolting, when you get right down to it."

Kwitny was a Wall Street Journal reporter for thirteen years at the
time he wrote his excellent book, Endless Enemies: The Making of an
Unfriendly World; How America's Worldwide Interventions Destroy
Democracy and Free Enterprise and Defeat Our Own Best Interests
(Congdon & Weed, 1984).  While a certain amount of water has passed
under the bridge since this book was published, it remains an
insightful analysis of U.S. policies during the Cold War and
beyond.

This is something of an overstatement: precisely the sort of Cold War
hype used to justify a war economy and domestic repression, as well
as the support of corporate imperialism in third world countries.
The Comintern ended officially in 1943 and Stalin was known for his
"communism in one country" policy, as opposed to the internationalist
line taken by Trotskyites.  You are confusing espionage and political
jockeying/manipulations with a monolithic organization devoted to world
conquest.  Military conquest by the Soviets was essentially limited
to what they grabbed during and at the end of WW II.  None of this is
to any way excuse, apologize, or downplay the brutal dictatorships
of the puppet regimes in the Soviet Bloc, or the crimes against
their people committed by the Soviets and their allies.

Many of the leftist movements in the third world were nationalist
in character, and to the extent that they turned to the Soviets it
was usually because we drove them to it with our hard line, which the
Soviets pragmatically exploited to their own advantage.  There were
legitimate reasons for these movements and legitimate local leaders,
and the notion that they were nothing more than strands of some
international spider web centered on the Kremlin is not only wrong,
it directly played into Soviet hands, causing us to treat these movements
as though they were mere extentions of Soviet power.

We also got our hands dirty in achieving our own political and economic
aims under the guise of fighting communism, both at home and abroad.
You're right about one thing though: it could have been worse.  We could
have knuckled under to government demands for ever more expedient
powers to fight the menace of "world communism."  The U.S. might very
well have ended up as a right-wing oligarchy or military dictatorship
modeled after the brutal regimes we supported in Latin America, the
Carribean, and Africa.  Because we didn't, the crimes of our national
security state had to be undertaken in secrecy and were somewhat
limited, at least domestically.

Subject: excerpts from CIA/Contras manual

While I don't have copies of the School of the Americas manuals
previously referenced, I do have an English translation of Psychological
Operations in Guerilla Warfare, a manual distributed by the CIA to the
Contras in Nicaragua.  Here is an excerpt from a section advising the
Contras what to do in the event that an innocent person refuses to join
their group of armed guerillas/terrorists:

  "If the target does not seem to be susceptible to voluntary recruitment,
meetings can be arranged which seem casual with the guerilla leaders or
with the political cadres (unknown by the target until that moment).
The meetings will be held so that 'other persons' know that the target
is attending them, whether they see him arrive at a particular house,
seated at the table in a particular bar or even seated on a park bench.
The target, then, is faced with the fact of his participation in the
insurrectional struggle and it will be indicated to him, also, that if he
fails to cooperate or carry out future orders, he will be exposed to
actions of reprisal by the police or soldiers of the regime.
  The notification of the police, denouncing a target who does not want
to join the guerillas, can be carried out easily, when it becomes
necessary, through a letter with false statements of citizens who
are not implicated in the movement."

In two sections headed "use of violence for propagandistic effects"
and "implicit and explicit terror," the manual advises how to
"neutralize" (i.e., kill) various targets, including judges, politicians,
and "individuals in tune with the regime," although it states that the
latter should be taken out of town "without damaging them publicly."

In another section, the manual describes how "professional criminals
will be hired to carry out specific, selective 'jobs'".

The manual also describes how to "assign specific tasks to others, in
order to create a 'martyr' for the cause."  One example given is
the infiltration of otherwise peaceful protest demonstrations by agents
provocateurs, who will commit acts of violence intended to provoke the
authorities "in order to bring about the death of one or more persons,
who would become the martyrs."


The U.S. State Department, in its reports on terrorism to Congress,
defines terrorism as "premeditated, politically motivated violence
perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or
clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience."
(Note that State's definition of "noncombatants" includes, in addition
to civilians, military personnel who at the time of the incident are
unarmed or not on duty.)  International terrorism is defined to mean
terrorism involving citizens or the territory of more than one country.
By its own definition then, the United States ought to be on its own
list of state sponsors of international terrorism.  Don't hold your
breath though.  Note that the State Department's definition excludes
the acts of governments, so that our decades of support for brutal
military dictatorships and quasi-democratic authoritarian regimes (the
provision of funds supporting repressive activities, intelligence,
advice, training, police equipment, arms, etc.) do not qualify, any more
than our own acts do.

Who are these mysterious, unnamed persons who cannot discriminate
between Joe McCarthy and Joe Stalin?  I've never met one.  Even the
hardcore neo-Leninists I've occasionally argued with on marxist
lists have no trouble making such a distinction.

If you're sure I don't fit into this category, why insinuate it
into your reply to me?

As for the victims of left-wing (as opposed to right-wing)
totalitarianism, whatever the figure, the reason I am criticizing
the American IC is that I am an American citizen and these are
the institutions of my country, which I feel obligated to educate
others about in the hope of, first, acknowledging the truth; and second,
changing them.  There is no need to attack the Soviet Union, China,
etc., because their crimes are well documented and a matter of
common knowledge and are virtually beyond dispute.  Does anyone
doubt that Stalin systematically arrested, tortured, imprisoned,
and murdered millions of political opponents?  No.  For me to
spend my time criticizing the crimes of Stalin, Mao, etc. would
be a pointless and gratuitous exercise.  The crimes of the American
IC (including the domestic security branch of the FBI) on the
other hand, are not generally acknowledged.  Most people are
ignorant and have been raised on a constant diet of self-serving
propaganda, which conditions them to respond to responsible critics as
though they were foreign agents.  I find this an offense to history, a
detriment to the building of solid and genuine democracy, and a potential
threat to the future.

Your slurs are inaccurate and offensive.  At no point have I apologized
for the "crimes of marxism."  You on the other hand seem to be
apologizing for the crimes of the American IC and the governments it
supported (and supports); crimes not only against genuine communists
but against the innocent victims falsely labeled as such in a cynical
attempt at political control.  These cannot and must not be justified by
pointing at the Soviet Union or China and saying "See?  Look how many
fewer people we killed."  I doubt whether those whose privacy was invaded,
whose careers were ended, whose families were broken up, whose political
and social movements were crushed or subverted, and who were imprisoned,
tortured, and killed, would find much distinction, at least in the
particular, between the methods of communists and the methods of
anti-communists.  There is of course a very great distinction in an
on-balance, general sense.

Many conservatives (and liberals) should carry a great burden of
guilt and shame for their apologetics for anti-communist political
crimes around the world, but they don't.  That's life.  People
see what they want to see and accuse others of hypocrisy.  As for
myself, I do not apologize for marxist political crimes and so have
nothing to feel ashamed about.  If daring to hold the American IC
to the magnifying glass constitutes treason, then I plead guilty.

The letter you present has all the hallmarks of propaganda.  This
is not surprising, and during the Cold War there was no shortage of
former communists (real and fictitious) ready to employ the same old
tactics in support of a new master.  This kind of personality is
attracted to extreme positions, is devoid of morality, and is
just as likely to be attracted to fascism as communism, given the
proper conditions.

The notion that Communism collapsed because of the CIA is simply
ludicrous.  The CIA -- really, the policy establishment it served --
did do a great deal to drive third world peoples into communist
hands and toward geopolitical alignment with the East, through its
support of brutal "anti-communist" regimes and through its refusal
to recognize the essentially independent and local nature of
nationalist movements, who had nowhere but Eastward to turn if
they wanted recognition, trade, superpower protection, etc.  The
overthrow of popularly elected governments, the support of military
dictatorships because they spout anti-communism or offer to continue
supporting our corporate interests in exchange for their corrupt cut
of the pie, and all the other counterproductive antics in the USG's
black bag of dirty tricks, only antagonized peoples with legitimate
movements and interests.

Communism collapsed because it was internally, fatally flawed,
economically and morally.  The CIA didn't even predict this collapse,
much less cause it.

I've already dealt with the balance of your reply elsewhere.  I
don't find the repetition of your arguments convincing.

Subject: intelligence in the service of myth and politics

In light our our recent discussion (see for example the comments of Wayne
McGuire), I thought the following excerpts might be of interest.  They
come from Ronald Kessler's book Inside The CIA (Simon & Schuster, 1992).
Kessler wrote the book with the authorized cooperation of active and
retired CIA personnel, and as you might guess takes a pro-CIA
perspective.  Nevertheless, it is an informative work.

In Chapter 13, "Trying to Cook the Books," Kessler deals with the
pressures brought by then CIA Director William Casey on his own
intelligence analysts, in an attempt to impose his political agenda on
U.S. policy:

START OF EXCERPT

  Casey was convinced that the Soviets were far more mendacious and
powerful than the U.S. government collectively thought.  In showing
that the Soviet Union was an "evil empire" he sought to outdo Ronald
Reagan...While Casey was generally pleased with the work of the
Directorate of Operations, he was not at all pleased with the work
of the Directorate of Intelligence.  To Casey, the analysts were a
bunch of liberals -- fuzzy-headed thinkers who did not know about the
hard realities of the world...
  . . .
  Casey tried [to push predetermined conclusions on his analysts], and
the result was a series of spats -- some public, some private -- that
created the appearance during Casey's tenure that the Agency's analytical
side was losing its integrity.
  It began on March 1, 1981, when the New York Times Magazine ran an
excerpt of Claire Sterling's book The Terror Network: the Secret War of
International Terrorism, which suggested that the Soviets were providing
the weapons, training, and sanctuary for terrorists as part of the
Soviet effort to undermine Western democracy.  The CIA had never said
anything like this.  Casey wanted the Agency's analysts to follow up
and discover if Sterling was right.  The CIA director had long
suspected that the Soviets were in control of world terrorism, using
thugs from all over the world as fronts for their own devious purposes.
  What came out in the form of a draft estimate was ambiguous and
not at all what Casey had wanted.  According to those involved in
preparing the estimate, the evidence available to the CIA at the time
did not support Casey's or Claire Sterling's views.
  "We would both go before a congressional committee.  Casey would say,
'They are responsible' and go back to work at noon and leave me to face
the committee in the afternoon.  I would try to erase what he said,
because I was trying to differentiate between Soviet support for
so-called national liberation struggles and actual direction of
terrorist activities," said David D. Whipple, later National
Intelligence Officer for terrorism.

END OF EXCERPT

Incidentally, I don't personally have any problem with calling the
Soviet Union an evil empire.  I think its oppression of its citizens
(and others) more than qualifies it for this appellation.  It's also
conceivable to me that they had hands on experience in the direction of
some terrorist activities.  We certainly did, both in our support for
tyrannical "anti-communist" regimes and for our own "national
liberation" movements, and I refuse to believe that the Soviets were
more pure in this regard.  Nevertheless, this is something entirely
different from the view of the world (and the roles of American and
Soviet intelligence services and policy makers) espoused by Wayne
McGuire and others.

Note also that the CIA's original, and in my opinion, only legitimate
mandate, was the collection and centralization of intelligence, not
covert action in the form of financial and technical support to
foreign political parties and foreign private organizations such as
business firms, universities, "right-thinking" media outlets;
covert propaganda, economic subversion (as in Nixon and Kissinger's
instructions to the CIA to "make the economy [of Chile] scream");
election rigging, assassination, coup plotting, covert assistance
and instruction to brutal authoritarian regimes "fighting communism"
(e.g., the Phoenix Program, the misnamed Office of Public Safety
programs, etc., etc., etc.); paramilitary and terrorist operations, etc.

Even the best internal CIA analysis, when kept classified from the public
or even from policy makers because it is politically or operationally
inconvenient, does little good.  Of course, it is useful as a record
to scholars who, decades later, are able to reconstruct the fabrications
upon which the national security establishment bases its manipulations
of the public and Congress; and which are used to justify far-reaching
powers, policies, and the secrecy necessary to carry out acts which a
majority of the American people would strongly disapprove of if they knew
about them and if they received the other side of the story.

Here's one last excerpt from Kessler's book.  Despite its historical
nature, it is entirely relevant to the operations of today and of the
future.  There is no reason to assume that future administrations cannot
share the same character flaws and political predilections of those past.

START OF 2nd EXCERPT

  "I remember once -- in the Lyndon Johnson period -- being asked by
[McGeorge] Bundy to have the CIA prepare an objective analysis of the
results of the U.S. Air Force bombing of North Vietnam," Dr. Ray S.
Cline, then the CIA's Deputy Director for Intelligence, said in his
book The CIA Under Reagan, Bush, & Casey..."A small group of analysts
went to work making such evaluations.  Over a period of time, their
work demonstrated that little progress was being made in slowing down
the North Vietnamese infiltration of the South."
  ...Ironically, the CIA, in classified reports, was saying exactly
what the antiwar demonstrators were saying on the streets of Washington.
[Well, not exactly: the moral criticisms were absent in the CIA
reports -- M.A.]  The analysts gnashed their teeth as President
Johnson turned a deaf ear to the warnings, preferring -- as did
President Nixon after him -- to believe that the Soviet Union was
behind the antiwar sentiment.
  "The trouble was the Johnson and Nixon administrations did not
really listen to intelligence," said Thomas Polgar, who was CIA
station chief in Vietnam from 1972 to 1975.  "They had their own
policies and preconceptions."

END of 2nd EXCERPT

Though I think this is a somewhat self-serving description of the
CIA's intelligence directorate, and understates the extent to which
politically motivated "intelligence" -- whether prepared by operational
types or professional analysts -- is used to support the political
expectations of a given administration, it makes a legitimate point which
should not be ignored.

Subject: Pt. 2: intelligence in support of myth and politics

In a previous message, "intelligence in support of myth and politics",
I gave some examples using the CIA under William Casey and Reagan/Bush,
taken from Ronald Kessler's book Inside The CIA.

I thought it would be amusing and instructive to give a mirror example
using the KGB under Andropov and Brezhnev.  The following is an
excerpt taken from KGB: The Inside Story, a book by Christopher Andrew
and Oleg Gordievsky:

START OF EXCERPT

  As so frequently before, the Center [KGB headquarters] discounted all
intelligence that ran counter to its conspiracy theories.  Some of the
most important of that intelligence came during the Prague Spring from
Washington, where the dynamic 34 year old head of the PR (political
intelligence) line, Oleg Danilovich Kalugin, gained access to what he
claimed were "absolutely reliable documents" proving that neither the
CIA, nor any other American agency, was prompting the political
changes in Czechoslovakia.  He reported that, on the contrary, the
Prague Spring had taken Washington largely by surprise.  His success
in the United States launched him on a career that, six years later,
was to make him the youngest general in the FCD.  But in 1968 his
reports were brushed aside.  On returning to Moscow, Kalugin was
"amazed" to discover that the Center had ordered that "my messages
should not be shown to anyone, and destroyed."  Instead, "The KGB
whipped up the fear that Czechoslovakia could fall victim to NATO
aggression or to a coup."  For all his sophistication, Andropov,
like all his predecessors as KGB chairman, was a conspiracy
theorist.  He told KGB Komsomol members in October 1968, two months
after the Soviet invasion, that the "shift of the correlation of
forces in favor of socialism" inevitably led to Western attempts
to undermine its successes:

    The enemy gives direct and indirect support to counterrevolutionary
    elements, engages in ideological sabotage, establishes all sorts of
    anti-Socialist, anti-Soviet and other hostile organizations and seeks
    to fan the flames of nationalism.  Graphic confirmation of this is
    offered by the events in Czechoslovakia, where that country's working
    people, supported by the fraternal international assistance of the
    peoples of the nations of the Socialist community, resolutely nipped
    in the bud an attempt by counterrevolutionaries to turn Czechoslovakia
    off the Socialist path.

  Evidence of the monitoring by Western intelligence services of the
reform process in Czechoslovakia was interpreted by Andropov as proof
of their role in promoting the Prague Spring.  On July 19, Pravda
published extracts from an alleged CIA plan for the "ideological
sabotage" of Czechoslovakia...

END OF EXCERPT

This last bit is somewhat reminiscent of the phony White Paper
entitled "Communist Interference in El Salvador" leaked to the New York
Times by the Reagan administration, which was also picked up by the
Washington Post.  This hoax purported to show "definitive evidence
of the clandestine military support given by the Soviet Union, Cuba,
and their Communist allies, to Marxist-Leninist guerillas now fighting
to overthrow the established government of El Salvador"; and purporting
to show that the rebellion in El Salvador was taken over by a unified,
Soviet run international communist network constituting a foreign, armed
aggression rather than a civil war.  It took months for the truth to
unravel, and by that time the damage had already been done and the Reagan
administration had long sinced occupied the press's attention with new
propaganda.

Subject: USG domestic propaganda: a documented case study

Few people know that the U.S. Government ran its own formal propaganda
apparatus -- aimed at domestic U.S. audiences (opinion and policy
makers and the public) -- during the 1980s.  This was run by a CIA front
operating out of the Department of State, called the Office of Public
Diplomacy for Latin America and the Carribean (S/LPD).

For example, I have a copy (obtained through the General Accounting
Office) of a memorandum from S/LPD's Johnathan S. Miller to Pat
Buchanan, then Assistant to the President and Director of Communications
for the White House, dated March 13, 1985.

This document describes "five illustrative examples of the Reich
'White Propaganda' operation".  For example:

 * Attached is a copy of an op-ed piece that ran two days ago in
   The Wall Street Journal.  Professor Guilmartin has been a consultant
   to our office and collaborated with our staff in the writing of
   this piece.  It is devastating in its analysis of the Nicaraguan
   arms build up.  Officially, this office had no role in its
   preparation.

 * Two op-ed pieces, one for the Washington Post and one for the New
   York Times, are being prepared for the signatures of opposition
   leaders Alphonso Rubello, Adolpho Callero, and Arturo Cruz.  These
   two op-ed pieces are being prepared by one of our consultants and
   will serve as a reply to the outrageous op-ed piece by Daniel
   Ortega in today's New York Times.

The memorandum finishes with an assurance that the paper trail will
be kept to a minimum:

   I will not attempt in the future to keep you posted on all
   activities since we have too many balls in the air at any one
   time and since the work of our operation is ensured by our office's
   keeping a low profile.  I merely wanted to give you a flavor of
   some of the activities that hit our office on any one day and ask
   that, as you formulate ideas and plans of attack, you give us a
   heads-up since our office has been created to handle the concerns
   that you have in getting the President's program for the freedom
   fighters enacted.


(Incidentally, if I were a tiny, impoverished Latin American country,
under threatened and actual attack by the United States and the CIA
supported Contras, I would probably be building my military up too.)

The GAO, in its legal opinion, dated September 30, 1987, addressed
to congressman Jack Brooks, then Chairman of the House Committee on
Government Operations, wrote: "We conclude that the described
activities are beyond the range of acceptable agency public information
activities because the articles prepared in whole or in part by S/LPD
staff as the ostensible position of persons not associated with
the government, and the media visits arranged by S/LPD, were misleading
as to their origin and reasonably constituted propaganda."

For more information on this matter, and on the S/LPD's role as a
CIA front, see Foreign Policy, No. 72, Fall 1988, and the article
by Robert Parry and Peter Kornbluh titled "Iran-Contra's Untold Story"
running on pp. 3-30.  The next issue, No. 73, Winter 1988-89, contains
a letter to the editor criticizing this story from Walter Raymond Jr.,
Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
(1983-87); a letter of response to this by authors Parry and Kornbluh; a
joint letter from half a dozen prominent congressional committee chairmen
which supports points made by Parry and Kornbluh; a letter from a
representative of Freedom House (mentioned in the original story); a
similar letter from the Puebla Institute; and a reply to these last
two by Parry and Kornbluh.  These run on pp. 171-185.

There is an additional exchange of letters by prominent and interested
parties in issue No. 75, Summer 1989, on pp. 189-192.

It all makes for fascinating reading.

The scope of these crimes is NOT common knowledge.
They've barely been discussed in the Western media.

Whenever I mention R. J. Rummel's statistics from
"Death by Government"--particularly the 100 million
plus figure regarding the civilian victims of Marxist
regimes--I encounter two responses: either total
disbelief or (invariably from the leftist side)
irritability and anger. The response of most leftists
to these grisly numbers is boringly predictable: they
are much more upset with the bearers of this monstrous
news than with the monsters who created it. This
behavioral pattern, which I've seen repeated again and
again, amply supports all the charges that Eugene
Genovese makes in his refreshing essay: many leftists
are appallingly insensitive to the horrors that have
been inflicted on the human race in this century in the
name of leftist ideology.

Oh, please. These crimes, which are trivial compared to
those committed by Marxists, have been given much wider
exposure in the mainstream American media than Marxist
crimes. Try doing a content analysis of The New York
Times for the last two decades, and calculate which
parties have come in for the greatest criticism: the
CIA, the FBI or Marxist regimes. The mass murder of
tens of millions by Marxists has been barely mentioned
in the Times, and then only grudgingly.

Markus Wolf was a leading figure in the Soviet police
state apparatus which massively violated the human
rights of hundreds of millions and sought to spread
this evil regime throughout the world. He should have
been treated by the American media with the same
ferocity with which we treat former Nazis. The New York
Times delved into none of these matters, but instead
attempted to help Wolf establish his new career in the
West as the author of a book of recipes. Wolf the
kindly chef.

>Your slurs are inaccurate and offensive.  At no point have I apologized
>for the "crimes of marxism."

My chief argument with you is your lack of historical
perspective: you give no signs of being a global
strategic thinker, with a broad view of overall
historical forces and trends.

You ignored completely my key argument: the CIA was
founded to deal with the global Communist threat. This
was a real threat, not an invented threat. Communists
murdered more than 100 million civilians in this
century, enslaved hundreds of millions of others, and
gave every indication that they intended to use
subversion and terrorism to spread their ideology and
tyranny to the entire world.

Communism was a nasty, destructive and aggressive
movement, and we got our hands dirty in fighting it. To
some degree, American democracy was damaged by the
national security state functions we devised to meet
the Communist threat. American democracy is probably
still healthy enough to repair that damage now that we
have defeated Communism.

I've been one of the strongest critics of the American
IC, and of Bill Casey in particular. But I do try to
keep track of the global environment in which the
American IC was forced to operate.

I'm curious: do you find America to be a particularly
oppressive society? One which denies you opportunities
to express yourself or to pursue your dreams?

If anything, Americans are unable to deal with the
degree of freedom we enjoy. The choices are
overwhelming.

Propaganda? The essay struck me as a pure instance of
anti-propaganda. Genovese is an ornery iconoclast who
is breaking ranks with the institutional left and his
fellow ideologues. That essay was a courageous and
independent exercise in tough-minded realism.

All the propaganda is coming from the parties he is
criticizing.

That essay is a wonderful litmus test: when people
react in an angry and irritable way to it, without
being able to offer a rational rebuttal of Genovese's
charges, they are proving Genovese's point.

Please demonstrate how the Genovese essay is
"propaganda." What misstatements does he make in it.

Not so cavalier; they have a pretty good idea who to go after.

The "non-combatants" referred to are the support apparatus inherent in any
insurgency. True, most are not card carrying communists. They don't have to
be. For the most part they are members of "foundations" and populist (aka
grass roots) organizations which are run (by communists) as front
organizations in support of the insurgency.

Universities in Central and South America have always been hotbeds of
"progressives" who provide the "intellectual" justification for socialism
and "students" who do the recruiting, agitating, and demonstrations for
social (they mean socialist) and economic (they mean expropriation of
property and redistribution of wealth) "justice."

Similarly, "labor activist" has always been a euphemism for Communist
agitator. There is a huge difference between workers negotiating hours and
wages, and "labor activists" who demand that some press man or floor sweeper
have a voice in how a company is run and the wealth is redistributed, or
that the business owner become a slave to satisfy the workers "needs."

As to "civil libertarians," that is a neat inversion of meaning. By any
traditional meaning "civil" meant dealing with property--as in "civil law"
(meaning property law,) and "civil rights" (meaning property rights.)
However, as they do with most other concrete definitions, communists invert
their meaning so that now, "civil rights," for example, means the
_abrogation_ of the individual's right to acquire, use, and dispose of
property as he sees fit, as well as the abrogation of his individual right
to associate with those whom he will voluntarily. Marxist "Civil
libertarians" demand rights for those who advocate expropriation of
property, while demanding that property owners acced to the expropriation.
The Catholic Church in Central and South America is a prime example. So is
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID,) as any
(former) property owner in El Salvador can tell you.

>But communists have rights too.  The laws and constitutions of all of

There is no right to expropriate property and individual wealth. One has the
right to talk about it. One does not have the right to practice it. A street
mugger abdicates _all_ his rights the moment he makes a conscious decision
to steal my wallet. If I shoot him down on the spot he has chosen his own
means of destruction. There is no difference between a street mugger and the
People's Democratic Front for (you-name-it.)

Communists are always the first to howl about their rights being violated,
while simultaneously openly advocating the abolition of all individual
rights. Their objection is that the government and the army use the same
methods against *them* they consciously use against anti-communists. Tough
break.

"Democracy and justice" are precisely the populist bromides of every
communist insurgency. To paraphrase V.I. Lenin, socialism cannot succeed
without universal sufferage. By what conceivable moral principle does a
landless peasant have a right to vote on how a property owner's land should
be divided up and parceled out? "Justice" in that case simply means that the
peasant gets his "equal share" of the expropriated loot.

They never followed my advise. My advise was always a) close down the Cuban,
Chinese, Russian, American, (and a host of other) embassies and deport their
staff and contract workers, b) close your nation's ports of entry to _all_
foreigners (especially NGOs, the UN, journalists and U.S. foundations and
social advocacy organizations) c) deport _all_ Maryknoll and Jesuit
"priests" and lay workers, d) deport all university professors who are
active in socialist causes, e) close the universities that "students" use as
safe havens (and prohibit their enrollment in other universities,) f) deport
all organized "labor activists," g) arm the peasants with military grade
weapons concurrent with the sale of "state" land (property ownership and the
private ownership of a select-fire military rifle are a powerful deterent to
socialism,) g) abolish universal sufferage and restrict the franchise to
property owners, h) adopt specie currency, private banking, and abolish the
central bank, and i) never--under any circumstances, ever--accept a "loan"
from the World Bank, or j) "help" from the U.S. State Department.

They thought the U.S. State Department and USAID officials had better
advice. They also lost their countries to the communists. I tried to tell
them, but they wouldn't listen.

>As for what rights communists respect or don't respect, I think it

The only difference between "social democrats" and outright Leninists or
Maoists is the time it takes to reach full-blown totalitarianism. You seem
to imply (please correct me if I'm wrong) that if a compromise can be
reached with communists--of whichever shade of red--then "somehow" socialism
wouldn't be *that* bad. Unless, of course, you're a businessman or property
owner with the government's gun against his head and some landless peasant's
finger on the trigger.

>Just remember that expediency is a two-edged sword, that power

I never suggested killing communists, and their overt supporters, was an
expediency: I believe it should be done in a deliberate, rational and
methodical manner, as a matter of policy.

Power only corrupts those who are immoral and corruptable to begin with.

I agree that secrecy hides abuses of power. That is why socialists so
cherish secrecy.

A moral (i.e. laissez faire capitalist) government would openly declare: "We
cannot, by right, prevent you from advocating socialism; but if you ever
attempt to put it into practice, we will deport you to a socialist
'paradise;' and if you use force of arms in an attempt to impose socialism
here, we will hunt you down and kill you."

Like the "nuns" in El Sal? Those four were FMLN messengers. The FMLN got the
message. You are correct though. Unless your own guys are rigidly controlled
they can get pretty sloppy. There is also the danger of copy-cat killings.
The commies are pretty good at that. They think nothing of killing
"liberals" and blaming it on the government; and the American press is
always available to spread the lie.

There is no conceivable way to "materially alter" the outcome of a war one
is, by official policy, prohibited from winning.

In contrast, the "Dirty War" disappeared a significant number of communists
and their overt supporters, the American press (who swooned in shock)
notwithstanding.

I agree on this point, to a point. Communists rely upon the government
playing by "the rules" while they reserve to themselves ends justifying
their means. There are only two options in that case; 1) compromise with the
communists and become a "social democracy" (the USDoS solution), or 2) kill
the communists and their active supporters. The USG has determined that the
second option is against the rules. I have always questioned the motive
behind, and the apologists for, option one.

However, under normal circumstances, when a government tightly controls the
exercise of option two it is usually immediately effective, resulting in
screams of indignation and demands for investigations from "liberals" in the
U.S.. The Argies were pretty good at it. The Sals were just sloppy.

<snip>

"Communist" is not an arbitrary lable. Actually, communists are pretty easy
to identify, and are quite bold in their acclamations. They're easy to round
up and kill. It's their supporters, advocates, and appologists who deserve
the most attention.

Many are simply "liberals" who, on the whole, are uninteresting, because
they will advocate anything that is anti-capitalist, possessing themselves
no conception of what it takes to create wealth, or the individual merit
such creation warrants. The "progressives" are the one's who hold my
fascination. They _know_ what they are doing is destroying good (capitalism)
_because_ it is good. They're simply afraid to suffer the logical
consequences of their advocacy, and shreik the loudest when they do.

My post was not ad hominem; I simply stated a truth, i.e., that active

Don't you find it the least bit curious that communists can slaughter
millions and the press and academia yawn and tsk, but if some "labor
activist" in El Sal, or a "lawyer" in Guat is bumped-off, that same
crowd has apoplectic fits? Personally, and professionally, I find that
fascinating.

The term "human rights" is an absurdity. Only humans _have_ rights to begin
with and then only as individuals. One gains no rights by being a member of
some group. The term "human rights" has always been a Marxist construct.
Such "human rights" include the "right" to food, housing, jobs, education, a
minimum wage, ad nauseam. Such "rights" are blatantly coercive and can only
be claimed at the point of a gun; which, after all, is the expressed intent
behind the phrase "From each according to his ability, to each according to
his needs."

My signature was not a characterization, it was a statement of fact. You are

have avoided the
gee-the-commies-are-people-too-and-wouldn't-it-be-nice-if-we-all-got-along
lobotomy they so willingly submitted to.

You are also correct that my "loose talk" is not what the USG has in mind.
To everybody's horror I actually try to win wars I am told to fight. It
finally dawned on me that winning is against the rules if the enemy are
communists. The USG, through their proxies in the State Department and
USAID, openly promotes socialism overseas. USG has to smuggle it into the
U.S. under perky slogans, business "regulations," anti-capitalism
"legislation," and "human rights" NGOs.

I would have to disagree with you strongly.

Many historians have noted the remarkable similarities
between religious fundamentalism and Communism. Marxism
is, in fact, a quasi-religious cult, which appeals
powerfully to secularists with a fundamentalist
psychology and the need to submerge their personalities
in a rigid dogma which supposedly explains everything.

One often sees Christian fundamentalists who claim that
this or that Christian sect or denomination is not
really Christian. Marxists who claim that, say,
Trotsky, Lenin, Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot were not really
Marxists are the secular equivalent of these religious
fundamentalists. There is no greater fanatic that
someone who demonizes his or her closest ideological
cohorts over minute differences of dogma.

Paul Johnson in "Intellectuals" and other books has
pointed out that Karl Marx was not only verbally and
psychologically violent, but that he supported the most
violent revolutionary movements of this time. Marx had
an utter disregard for fundamental democratic
principles. He was a true fanatic.

Lenin was Marx's most influential interpreter (he
played the role of Paul to Marx's Christ, if you will).
The leading recent scholarship on these matters has
concluded that Lenin (and Trotsky as well, for that
matter) were as vicious as Stalin. (You should check
out David Remnick's excellent recent essay on this
issue in The New Yorker.) The crimes of Marxism are not
an aberration, but the inexorable expression of its
deepest nature.

Marxism consistently breeds and attracts monsters. The
fact that Marxism hasn't been as thoroughly ostracized
as Nazism in the West suggests that much more in the
way of public education is required about the real
history of Marxism.

Marxism has motivated many more murders than even
Nazism in this century, and yet remarkably you will
still find many Western academics who will attempt to
defend Marxism.

Michael,

I'm worried that we are going to get sidetracked by an
argument about Marxism, and lose sight of the purpose
of this list, which is to discuss intelligence matters.

My only purpose in bringing up "The Crimes of Marxism"
thread was to provide some historical context for the
questions that have been raised about the behavior of
the intelligence communities of the Western democracies
since World War II. The Western democratic world was
confronted with the problem of confronting a highly
malevolent, murderous and aggressive political ideology
and movement with global ambitions. How do you wage a
defensive war with an evil movement like this without
compromising your own democratic principles? Anyone who
thinks there are any easy answers to this question
hasn't thought very deeply about intelligence matters
or history in general.

With regard to the character of Karl Marx, following
are my reading notes from the chapter in Paul Johnson's
"Intellectuals" which discuss this issue. I've read
much more on the subject, but I especially like this
chapter since Johnson manages to crystallize
wonderfully the essentials of Marx's repellant
personality.

I also strongly recommend that you read the David
Remnick essay in The New Yorker which appeared a few
weeks ago. (I don't have the issue at hand, and forget

Perhaps you will find these numbers to be useful:

.newspaper article

author=Bill Keller
title=Major Soviet Paper Says 20 Million Died As Victims of Stalin
newspaper=The New York Times
date=February 4, 1989
pages=1, 4

body=

        A Soviet weekly newspaper today published the most
        detailed accounting of Stalin's victims yet presented to
        a mass audience here, indicating that about 20 million
        died in labor camps, forced collectivization, famine and
        executions.

        The estimates, by the historian Roy Medvedev, were
        printed in the weekly tabloid Argumenti i Fakti, a
        newspaper with a circulation of more than 20 million.

        The estimated number of deaths is about equal to the
        number of Soviet soldiers and civilians believed killed
        in World War II.

        Mr. Medvedev's grim arithmetic was reported in a less
        detailed version last November in Moscow News, a
        limited-circulation weekly, which sells about 200,000
        copies in Russian, but today's article marked the first
        time the numbers have been disclosed to a nationwide
        audience.

        In all, Mr. Medvedev calculated about 40 million victims
        of Stalin's repressions, including those arrested, driven
        from their land or blacklisted.

        Although the bookkeeping of Stalin's terror is an inexact
        and contentious science, Mr. Medvedev's estimates are
        generally in line with Western calculations that have
        long been disparaged by more official Soviet historians.

        "It's important that they published it, although the
        numbers themselves are horrible," Mr. Medvedev said in an
        interview tonight.  "Those numbers include my father."

        Mr. Medvedev said he had no special access to official
        archives, but relied on his own compilations of material
        over the years and recent publications in the Soviet
        press.

        Under a headline proclaiming "The Number of Victims of
        Stalinism is About 40 Million People," in a terse,
        question-and-answer format, Mr. Medvedev cited the human
        cost of Stalin's leadership year by year, leaving it to
        the reader to complete the arithmetic.

        Mr. Medvedev's accounting included these victims:

        --One million imprisoned or exiled from 1927 to 1929,
        falsely accused of being saboteurs or members of
        opposition parties.

        --Nine million to 11 million of the more prosperous
        peasants driven from their lands and another two million
        to three million arrested or exiled in the early 1930's
        campaign of forced farm collectivization.  Many of these
        were believed to have been killed.

        --Six million to seven million killed in the punitive
        famine inflicted on peasants in 1932 and 1933.

        --One million exiled from Moscow and Leningrad in 1935
        for belonging to families of former nobility, merchants,
        capitalists and officials.

        --About one million executed in the "great terror" of
        1937-38, and another four million to six million sent to
        forced labor camps from which most, including Mr.
        Medvedev's father, did not return.

        --Two million to three million sent to camps for
        violating absurdly strict labor laws imposed in 1940.

        --At least 10 million to 12 million "repressed" in World
        War II, including millions of Soviet-Germans and other
        ethnic minorities forcibly relocated.

        --More than one million arrested on political grounds
        from 1946 to Stalin's death in 1953.

        Mr. Medvedev acknowledged in Argumenti i Fakti, and
        repeated tonight, that many periods of repression will
        never be fully measured because records have been lost or
        never existed.

Michael,

Can you provide some examples of successful and humane
Marxist governments?

Frankly, the examples of the practice of
*self-proclaimed* Marxists in Russia, Eastern Europe,
China, Cuba, Cambodia and North Korea have provided
sufficient empirical evidence for me that Marxism
doesn't work in the real world. I really doubt that the
world can afford any more social experiments of this
kind by academics who think they are going to get it
right this time around, despite all the egregious
failures of their enthusiastic predecessors. Marxism
should have been decisively crushed by the civilized
world after it murdered its first 20 million civilians
decades ago.

Actually, Winston Churchill wanted to invade Russia and
hang the leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution back in
the second decade of this century. Imagine how much
misery the world would have been spared if Churchill
had done the right thing. Russia today might be a
successful industrial and democratic nation, rather
than a bankrupt junkyard overrun by criminals.

Mr. Pike's above paragraph is what is known as an "argument from
intimidation." Such an argument is intended to forestall debate and extort
my aqcuiescence to Mr. Pike's unstated position. The specific tactic used in
this case is to impeach my character in order to impeach my argument without
debate. I am expected to respond "I didn't mean it!"

I do mean it.

Mr. Pike protests that he abhors ad hominem arguments, then proceeds to
posit an ad hominem dismissal of ideas he disagrees with. Mr. Pike further
appeals to the logical fallacy of *ad verecundiam.* Mr. Pike's unique spin
on that logical fallacy is that he appeals to his own authority as well as
illegitimate authority.

My active duty SF status is easy enough to check out for anybody who cares
to. However, Mr. Pike need'nt worry too much; soon the Army will be filled
with public "educated" PC zombies.

Subject: Re: Academic Discussion (Steve Barry/John Pike)

Steve, I certainly admire your self-restraint. I was amazed to see John's
diatribe. It is not suasive, not interesting (except as an insight into how
the rest of his traffic may reflect his mindset), and not conducive to
anyone's further understanding of anything except the thermal disturbance
between  John's ears.

I happen to believe that there is an interesting possibility that, in light
of the history of our species (which is still blessed with rather large
canine teeth), a significant number of us will actively envy those who have
more (wealth? property? food? name it...) than we do, and will stretch the
golden rule in seeking ways to level the field. Momentarily, at least.

In extreme cases, we have labor movements (not all) that put employers out
of business, 'proletarian' or 'Marxist'  or 'reform'  leaders (not all, but
I am tempted to say almost all) who after ten minutes in office behave like
particularly arrogant 18th-century aristocrats, and franchised voters in
open political systems like ours (not all, but a great many when the
population is a very large number)  who, owning nothing, have no respect for
ownership,  or that which they do not own, or any owner.

Because these behavioral paradoxes are doubtless fundamental (I believe, on
the evidence and on intuition) to any social system of highly aggressive and
reflective mammals like us (and I don't know of any others) I consider it
rather shallow at best to refuse the constant exploration of all sides of
important issues.

I admit it's nice for anyone, though, to manipulate the environment so all
inputs confirm his current beliefs.

I am aware and I assume others in this forum are that around the world many
university systems allow students to spend many years in residence pursuing
degrees; this is an ordinary situation in Europe and has of course been
abused both by kids who 'need to find themselves' and people who use the
schools as convenient harbors while pursuing more sinister activities.
Closing such schools is a bit much; changing the rules to eliminate the
abuses is not...but it isn't simple either.

Closing the ports is also a bit much but restricting immigration is not, as
long as immigration is not seen as a right, especially by those who just
'feel sorry' for others or for themselves. That way lies self-destruction.

By the way, I'm new to this group. I've kept some of the traffic but not a
lot. Much of it seems more suited to a good newsroom somewhere; I thought it
might contain more on the subject of intel means and methods vis-a-vis
strategic national defense  - and even a few of THOSE human paradoxes (about
which I *have* seen some interesting conversation.)

Anyway, keep on protecting me and John, Steve. I don't know about him, but
some of my best friends are seals!

Made it as far as the beginning of the fifth paragraph in this piece, at

Subject: Re: Limiting Mail/Listserv Status.

Dear List Member:

As promissed, I am forwarding additional information concerning listserv
problems that I reported earlier.

I think if our members on this list confine themselves to posting ONE
article per day, rather than 5 or 6, and, if in addition evryone restricts
himself/herself to the discussion of intelligence matters, we should not
be affected by any current listserv problems.

You should also note that subscribers that are currently on "review" -
about 25 - your post is forwarded to the list on a time available basis.
Listserv gives me about 48 hours to respond to such posts before deleting
them. Meaning that if I am away from the computer for a weekend, your post
will get lost in the mail...

One sure way to get off "review" is to follow our guide lines with respect
to signature, unnecessary chit-chat, and, ofcourse, personal issues that
belong in private mail addressed to a private address.

If you have problems with the list, contact me, and not the list, please.

I deeply appreciate the commitment to the list of the vast majority of list
members. It's a pleasure to read your contributions; to share in your
concerns and aspirations with respect to intelligence matters.


Thanks for your cooperation!

As I mentioned before, much important scholarship has
been released to the world in recent years based on
access to secret Soviet archives about Soviet
activities in the West in this century. Much more of
this information will come to light and be analyzed in
the coming years.

The archives suggest that some of the most "paranoid"
suspicions of Western anti-Communists about Soviet
activities in the West were well-justified. The Soviets
subverted or attempted to subvert many supposedly
respectable or mainstream leftist groups in the U.S.
and other Western countries.

I hope Mark Adkins and John Pike read some of this
scholarship while they continue to construct their
mental models of 20th century political history. Many
supposedly respected or moderate leftist organizations
were tainted by their open or secret associations with
Communists.

>Marxism is a cosmic joke played on a large group of people who thought the

Actually, Marxism was primarily a device in which the
least productive sector of the human race--the
priesthoods of sterile ideology--could achieve the
maximum scope to satisfy its greed for wealth and lust
for power. Marxist regimes have been dominated by those
whom Paul Johnson has referred to as
"intellectuals"--these are people who can produce
little in the way of productive goods or services, but
who have a glib facility with words and vague concepts.
Karl Marx himself is the very archetype of the breed:
all talk and no do; mountains of words and dogma, no
real creative activity.

The Soviet Union was driven into the ground by a greedy
and parasitic class of people (the nomenklatura) with a
slick rap and a complete incapacity to produce anything
of value for society.

Bottom line: we needed a CIA, a NATO and all the other
alphabet organizations to deal with this problem while
it was a potent threat to the world. If the Communists
hadn't been met with steel in Europe and other regions
of the world, they might well have done to the entire
world what they did to Russia and Eastern Europe.

I'm glad to see that my posts stimulated discussion.  There can however
be too much of a good thing.  After a one day hiatus, I logged in to
find that my mailbox contained 45 letters, most of them from this

Mr. Barry:

      At least the disclaimer is good news.
      You are wrong about the media ignoring communist massacres. Perhaps
you missed the articles (and major feature film) about the killing fields
of Cambodia.  Or the negative picture of post-revolutionary Bolshevism in
the movie "Reds," to cite a few examples.

The Soviets, like the U.S., kept abreast of many movements and tried
where possible to influence them.  I think the key word in the paragraph
above is "attempted".  In nearly all cases where a legitimate, indigenous
mass movement existed, Soviet "active measures" had very little effect
in changing attitudes and behaviors.  The nuclear disarmament movement
for example was not some creation of the Kremlin, but was the result of
real concerns among a large segment of American and European populations.
The fact that it may have suited the Soviets at some time or in some
sense -- because they imagined it represented an opportunity for advancing
their political motives -- does not mean that they created it; and the
fact that they infiltrated it does not mean that they controlled it.  The
same is true for the anti-apartheid movement, the civil rights movement,
the labor movement, and others.

Conservatives are prone to a logical fallacy whereby coincident
interests plus Soviet piggybacking equals subversion.  Many in the KGB
were as subject to this delusion as their American counterparts were,
though for obviously different reasons: the Soviets wanted to believe
that they had influence because they wanted to believe in their own
success; the conservative wing of the American IC wanted to believe
this because it was a powerful psychological tool (both within and
outside the intelligence community) to attack social movements whose
politics or goals they found offensive.  Any analysis of Soviet
archives will require great objectivity and caution before conclusions
are drawn.

Intellectuals dominate all societies, regardless of their political
structure, with the possible exception of primitive agricultural
societies.  Even feudal, monarchic agricultural societies have their
court advisers, most of whom, as representatives of the educated,
cultured class, were intellectuals.  American society is driven
by intellectuals, if by intellectuals you mean the purveyors of
information for social and political purposes.  Who do you think
advises presidents, congressmen, and (through the media) the public?
University graduates who think for a living.  Public and private
policy is not determined by plebiscite; it is shaped by the
knowledge class (i.e., intellectuals) and offerred to the public
for ratification or rejection.  To broadly label intellectuals as
unproductive simply because they don't sow crops or hammer anvils
is a mistake reminiscent of Mao's great leap backward.

You have got to be kidding.  The crimes of Communist regimes have been
the bread and butter of not only the elite media, not only the general
media, but of American popular culture throughout most of the Cold War,
beginning with the execution of the Czar.  The purges, the gulags, the
secret police, the iron curtain, and every other repressive, murderous,
or subversive aspect of Leninism and Maoism have been so commonplace
in American media, except perhaps for the most recent generation, that
I have a difficult time understanding how anyone over the voting age
could assert otherwise.  I'm not complaining about this: merely noting
it as a fact.

Subject: postscript on Soviet subversion

[Note: thread was "Re: Defining moment..."]

To my most recent comments, I wanted to add this: even in cases where
members of the American Communist Party held leadership positions in
unions or were prominent activists in the labor movement, this is
scarcely the same thing as Soviet subversion.  First, most American
Communists were not reporting to the KGB.  Second, what evidence is
there that these individuals ever accomplished anything more than
effective labor organizing of American workers?  It's one thing for
Communist activists (known or unknown) to rally workers on behalf of
their own self-interests; it is quite another to conclude that this
represented some sort of control of these workers by the Soviet
government, so that, on command, the mass of workers would turn into
some sort of rabid vanguard obediently sabotaging the nation's
commercial activities.  If Communist labor activists became involved
in part because of some vague hope that some day workers would
appreciate their help and be converted to communism, and if they
worked honestly and diligently in their labor organizing in order
to make a good impression, this does not equate with Soviet control
of organized labor (e.g., CIO).

This is one of the recent works on Soviet espionage
that I was referring to--it made a great impact on my
mind when I read it earlier this year.

I wonder if those who continue to dismiss the scope and
intensity of Soviet espionage and subversion have made
any effort to acquaint themselves with the facts, or
whether they are systematically filtering and
distorting the world through their political ideology.

There are many juicy threads in the Marxism debate that
could be pursued, but I am going to try to restrain
myself in the interests of keeping the list on track.

My basic point is this: the Western democracies were
forced by *real*, not imagined, Marxist threats to beef
up their intelligence and security systems, and in some
cases to violate their own democratic principles. Those
occasional violations of principle did not ever come
close to matching the deep, systematic and relentless
violation of human and civil rights that was practiced
by Marxist regimes around the world.

I've been detecting a whiff of the moral equivalency
argument in some of the recent posts. Only the most
militant of extreme leftists believe that the Western
democracies and the totalitarian regimes of the right
and left were morally equivalent in this century.

Whenever you see someone expressing much more moral
outrage about the crimes of the Western democracies
than the crimes of Marxist dictatorships in the Soviet
Union and China, you've got to wonder about his or her
real political agenda. In many cases in the past I've
discovered that the advocates of these views were in
fact Marxists or quasi-Marxists. Despite the fact that
Marxists in this century have murdered many more
innocent civilians than even Nazis, you will find many
people who still cling on the utopian dreams of
Marxism. They simply can't let go.

I saw this reviewed in the New York Times some time back.  I took a look at
it to decide whether I wanted to buy the hardcover.  I decided that it was
old news and that I could safely afford to spend my money on something
other than this slim volume.

Did anyone not know that CP-USA received substantial funding from the
Soviets?  Did anyone not know that there were contacts between high level
CP-USA officials and the Soviets?  Did anyone not know that a tiny fraction
of CP-USA members were involved in espionage activities, at least before
Soviet intelligence adopted a policy of non-recruitment when it became
clear that it was riddled with informers?

This doesn't address my comments.  Most American Communists in the labor
movement were workers and labor activists, not spies; and most workers
and labor activists were not Communists.  The fact that a handful of
cells were set up for covert activities does not indicate that the CIO
or the labor movement was under Soviet control, nor does it indicate
that union workers were pawns of the Communists, ready and willing to
sabotage America at a critical moment should the order be given.  Most
Communist labor activists, despite their ideology and pie-in-the-sky
dreams and their contempt for "short sighted" trade unionism, ended up
advancing bread and butter union interests and nothing more.

The book is not "old news": it provides a wealth of
important new information about Soviet espionage and
political activities in the U.S.. Much more important
new information of this type will be coming to light in
the coming years, as researchers continue to study the
Soviet archives. I strongly recommend that you take the
trouble to read the book.

You are knocking down a straw man, at least in regard
to my statements so far.

From the standpoint of the Western democracies, they
were dealing with a ruthless and aggressive force that
had already murdered many millions of innocent people,
obliterated all civil rights wherever it had triumphed,
and was working night and day to subvert and overthrow
every remaining non-Marxist government in the world.

The Western democracies, in light of history and the
facts, would have had to have been out of their minds
not to take the strongest possible defensive measures
against this threat. Totalitarian movements do not need
to control directly the rank-and-file of the societies
they take over; all they need to do is gain control of
key elements of the leadership.

Anyone who claims to value human rights would have
advocated going farther than taking defensive measures
against Communist aggression: an aggressive attack on
Communist regimes everywhere certainly would have been
morally justified, in order to free the captive
populations and prevent further mass murder.

I, for one, will examine all your continued attacks on
the American intelligence community in a new light. You
seem determined to put the worst possible spin on
American activities, and the best possible spin on
Communist activities. You are willing to give the
Communists every benefit of the doubt, and Americans
none. Apparently you've got an agenda and are on a spin
mission.

Of course this has been the attitude of the radical
left in the West for many decades now. Any student of
20th century politics will be quite familiar with the
syndrome.

I've been up front and honest about my politics, Mark:
I'm a moderate libertarian; I am deeply skeptical and
suspicious of all governments and all government power.
What is the political framework or philosophy which
explains the quality of your single-minded and
white-hot rage against the American intelligence
community? Where are you coming from politically?

Subject: A Tech Support Tale...

A little Xmas tale for all of you !

Eric Hausmann is a Computer Technician and Co-Sysop for two Florida
BBSes. He welcomes commentary and submissions at < TekTales@aol.com >
Here is one of his latest tales:

"Before being bought, SuperMac would routinely and randomly record a
certain number of technical support calls, to keep tabs on customer
satisfaction. By wild 'luck,' they managed to catch the following
conversation on tape.

On a day like any other, a SuperMac technical support representative got
a call from some middle level official from the government of Trinidad.
The fellow spoke English very well and calmly described the problem.

It seemed there was a coup attempt in progress at that moment. The
national armory for the city, however, was kept in the same building as
the Legislature--and there was a combination lock on the door to the
armory. Of the people in the capitol city that day, only the Chief of the
Capitol Guard and the Chief Armorer knew the combination to the lock, and
they had already been killed.

The officer of the government of Trinidad began to describe the problem.
The combination to the lock was stored in a file on a Macintosh--but the
file had been encrypted with the SuperMac security product called
Sentinel. "Is there any chance" the beleaguered official asked, "...that
there is a 'back door' to the application, so that we can get the
combination, open the armory door and defend the Capitol Building and the
legitimately elected government of Trinidad against the insurgents?"

All the while, throughout the official's calm inquiries, there is the
sound of gunfire in the background. The SuperMac support representative
put the Trinidad official on hold. A phone call to the phone company
verified that the origin of the call was, in fact,
Trinidad. Meanwhile, there was this mad scramble to see if anybody knew
of any 'back doors' in Super Mac's Sentinel program.

As it turned out, Sentinel uses DES to encrypt the files, and there was
no known back door. The tech representative reluctantly confessed to the
customer that, aside from trying to guess the password, there was no way
through Sentinel--and that they'd be better off trying to physically
destroy the lock.

The official was very polite, thanked the SuperMac technician for the
effort, and hung up. That night, the legitimate government of Trinidad
fell. One of the BBC reporters mentioned that the casualties seemed
heaviest in the capitol, where for some reason, there
seemed to be little return fire from the government forces.

Subject: Topic Issues...

Dear List Member:

This should serve as a friendly reminder to our U.S. membership that our
topic on this list is matters related to intelligence. "Communism",
""crimes"" committed against the poor communists, etc.. are not among these
topics.

Further, it is well worth noting that opinions expressed do not necessarily
reflect opinions of all list members. Though the very nature of the list
topic suggests - and welcomes - controversy, it would be foolhardy to believe
that this list, which is largely composed of men and women that served and,
in some instances, bled for our Country - and the free world - would offer a
fertile ground for a personal agenda; or merely to ventilate pent up
aggressions.

An analysis of the effectiveness - or lack thereof - of intelligence
gathering, however, is appropriate.




Thanks for your understanding.

This fact was widely known and continuously publicized by large numbers of
anti-Communist individuals, publications and organizations throughout the
1920s through 1970s. Significantly, academe pooh-poohed the significance,
and the press launched a full-court smear campaign against anybody who
brought up the issue.

Do you mean like CIO official Walter Reuther who, during a "training"
session in the Soviet Union wrote back to his friends, "Carry on the fight
for a Soviet America;" and who, in 1961, demanded of the Justice Department
that the military's anti-communism training be muzzled, and that
anti-Communist organizations be placed on the Attorney General's "Subversive
Organizations" list in order to provide a "balanced list?"

The issue you have identified by protesting that "labor activists" were not
card carrying CPUSA members is that _lack_ of CPUSA membership was their
protection from (justified) surviellance. Was CIO "under Soviet control?"
No; it didn't have to be. It was under Soviet _influence_. That means its
leadership were trusted.

Subject: Sudan - A New Paramilitary Op

        Justifying the Sudan Paramilitary Operation

   A Washington Post editorial argues that the United States'
contribution is to ignore the United Nations and the opinion of
other nations in the area to conduct paramilitary operations against
Sudan. All the while the U.S. remains at a discreet distance from the
action. With five countries involved -- the U.S., Sudan, Uganda,
Eritrea and Uganda (and probably also Israel), how soon before
this CIA paramilitary operation expands and encompasses many
more nations. How long does it take for the Islamic nations to
recognize this "discreet distance" war against a fellow
Islamic State?

   The Washington Post editorial states that Sudan is second
only to Iran in international terrorism. The United Nations and
other African countries are incompetent to deal with this rogue
state.  It is the United States contribution to have accepted
the implications of the U.N.'s weak stance -- Clinton Administration
is now funneling arms to Sudan's three neighbors, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Uganda, to help defend themselves and to support the Sudanese opposition
 -- if not unseat the regime, then to contain it. By remaining at a
discreet remove from the front-line action, Washington can hope to shield
itself against charges of being anti-Islam and pro-intervention
and yet still make a difference. Washington Post 12/4/96 A24.

   Information from CIABASE indicates that there may be a long

Subject: values, beliefs, and effects on intelligence policy

My basic point is this: the American intelligence community and the
policy makers they served used the real espionage activities of hostile
intelligence services as an excuse to justify their immoral, often illegal
and unconstitutional persecution of political and social movements and
individuals who were no threat to national security and in most cases were
not even Communist, merely because they found their values offensive or
a threat to established interests.  This abrogation of the law and the
Constitution was systematic and institutionally enforced, not because it
was forced upon them by the Soviet Union, but because they never held
those values in their hearts: they considered themselves to be above the
law and acted accordingly, and hid behind secrecy and propaganda because
they knew that the overwhelming majority of the American people would not
approve if properly and fully informed.  The rank and file, almost without
exception, went along: whether from personal convictions or selfish
fear of losing their jobs or ruining their careers, the result was the
same as in other quasi-military organizations; orders were given and
orders were carried out.

Decades later, the revisionists and apologists carry the day.  People
see movies like Mississippi Burning and imagine that the FBI was the
hero of the civil rights movement, when in fact the FBI bugged the
home, offices, and hotel rooms of Martin Luther King, kept him under
constant surveillance, and used the transcripts in an attempt to
blackmail him, and when that didn't work, to smear him through leaks
to the press.  In one instance the FBI sent him an anonymous letter
accompanied by bugging transcripts of extra-marital sexual activities,
just before he was due to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which
suggested that the only way out was to commit suicide.  See for
example Athan Theoharis, ed., "From the Secret Files of J. Edgar
Hoover" (pp. 93 ff.), which collects reproductions of secret FBI
memos.

Everything and anything could be justified by the claim that if hostile
foreign Communist governments did it we should too.  At home we casually
spied on people, broke up their homes, marriages, careers, sometimes
resulting in suicides or homicides; sabotaged political and
social movements; conducted drug, radiation, psychosurgical, and
deprivation experiments upon innocent and unwitting citizens, both
in terminal experiments and in ways that mentally or physically
crippled the victims for life (e.g., administration of brain altering
chemicals like BZ, LSD, etc., to people who had no idea what
was going on); we framed people, with or without the use of agents
provocateurs; we committed murders.  The extent of these activities
were small in comparison to those taking place in Communist dictatorships
only because our form of government and free media provided some protection
of our liberties -- a protection which was constantly under threat as
these agencies sought to expand their powers and label anyone who
opposed this as subversive.  Abroad, in the right-wing military
dictatorships we supported for their anti-communism and their support
of our corporate interests, these limitations vanished.  The wholesale
kidnapping, imprisonment, torture, and execution of all manner of
political and non-political opponents occurred under the painfully
obvious pretence of keeping the world safe for democracy -- as if
military dictatorships had a vested interest in democracy!

The psychological elements common to many traditionalists in the American
IC are infact precisely as I illustrated in my essay, and are practiced
even while their reality is vigorously denied.

For example, we have a chain of reasoning which runs something like this:

Communists regardless of locality and period are at heart bloodthirsty
maniacs who would recreate the worst excesses of Stalinism; marxists
are indistinguishable from Communists; marxists have no more variation
among themselves than do Communists; all socialists are marxists; left
liberals are crypto-socialists; individuals who express outrage
about the abuses of power and the hypocrisies of their own governments
or of elements of those governments are either marxists or are
"quasi-marxists", unless their political pedigree is unimpeachable, in
which case they are the unwitting stooges of marxists.  Furthermore,
social and political movements which have been penetrated by Communists
(as, conveniently, nearly all have) are controlled by Communists, and
all Communists are controlled by the Soviet Union, regardless of locality
or period.  There is no difference between Communist parties in the
1930s and 1940s, and essentially nationalist independence and liberation
groups like Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in the 1970s and
1980s, or other nationalist movements seeking social and economic justice
for the impoverished masses and who looked elsewhere for assistance
when we wouldn't give it, whether because of our own racism or our own
corporate interests (e.g., United Fruit, Anglo-American Petroleum, etc.).

Communists force us to "act against our principles" in committing
well-meaning acts of deceit and illegality, which are justified because
we know the truth and we have the ability to define for the public what
its best interests are; the persecution of vocal and persistent critics
of the U.S. government or elements of it such as its intelligence
agencies -- its sword and shield -- is justified because the enemy is
himself unscrupulous and these critics, being marxists or quasi-marxists,
are the enemy; therefore, surveillance, propaganda, harassment, and other
countertactics are justified, regardless of the law or the absence of
criminal acts or demonstrable criminal intent, because we know the truth
but can't prove it because the enemy is crafty; under these circumstances,
criticism is actually a form of hostile action akin to physical acts of
violence, or perhaps worse, because they undermine authority in ways that
violence would not.

I neither expressed nor implied such a claim.  I agree that this would
be an absurd proposition.

Subject: Deutch pays the price of disobedience

No doubt the readers of this list have already heard the news that
President Clinton has nominated National Security Adviser Anthony Lake
to be the new CIA Director.  The Los Angeles Times did report something
else of interest.

The L.A. Times article mentioned that current director Deutch, who
came to the CIA from his No. 2 post in the Pentagon, had hope to succeed
Defense Secretary William Perry, who will actually be replaced by
retiring Senator William Cohen (R-Maine).

The reason cited by the Times' sources is that "Deutch's hopes for
that promotion were dashed this fall when he angered the White House
by telling Congress during public testimony that Saddam Hussein was
better off than he was four years ago.  One source says that a 'chill
went through the West Wing of the White House' after Deutch's testimony."

If true, what does this suggest about the continuing character of the
relationship between White House political needs and the performance and
conclusions of the intelligence community, or even of high level public
servants outside this community?  Will ambitious bureaucrats take a cue
from this episode, tailoring future intelligence reports to suit this
and future administrations?

bibiWATCH
December 2, 1996
Number 23

--- BEGIN ---

Bibi's Russian Connection - Continued

                In last week's edition of BibiWATCH, we
                raised a number of questions about
                Netanyahu's connections to the reputed
                Russian Mafia don and international
                arms dealer, Grigory Lushansky
                (pictured to the left).

                Even though the story dropped from the
                mainstream media within a day or two,
                we attempted to follow through on some
                of the details.

In the middle of the week, the Knesset debated the
alleged meeting in what Yediot Ahronot reporter Gabi
Meron described as a "stormy" session. Communications
Minister Limor Livnat said that the secret report
contained material which came from "an interested
party" and that the police decided not to investigate
further. Other Likud MKs blasted the Opposition for
raising the whole matter. Meanwhile, a Knesset
committee is scheduled to discuss the matter possibly
as early as this week.

According to the report in Yediot Ahronot, the source
of the police report linking Netanyahu to the Russian
Mafia was a document originating in the CIA and the
Russian state intelligence service.

Meanwhile, BibiWATCH has obtained a copy of a letter
sent by Meretz leader Yosi Sarid to the Minister of
Internal Security, Avigdor Kahalani.

According to Sarid's letter, Kahalani testified before
the Knesset's committee on immigration and absorption
on Tuesday, 19 November, 4 days before former Internal
Security Minister Moshe Shahal went public with the
allegations. Kahalani's testimony contradicted that of
Shahal.

Sarid went on to inform Kahalani in his letter that the
document which discusses the Netanyahu-Lushansky
meeting is dated 18 June 1995, comes from the central
headquarters of the police, the investigations
department, intelligence division, is classified "Top
Secret" and its number is 02-03402-4762. This report,
according to Sarid, settles the question of whether
"Shahal was dreaming a dream" or whether the meeting
really took place.

Sarid does not say in his letter what the content of
the police report is. Nor does he say how he obtained
the report.

In a telephone interview with BibiWATCH yesterday
morning, Sarid said that investigations would continue
-- but that further information was needed. When asked
to be more specific, he told this writer that this was
a matter not to be discussed over the telephone.

In an email query to Natan Sharansky's Israel b'Aliya
party, we wrote the following:

In last week's edition [of BibiWATCH], we raised a
number of questions relating to Prime Minister
Netanyahu's alleged meeting with Grigory Lushansky, who
is reputed to be a figure in organized crime.

As Mr. Sharansky's name was mentioned repeatedly in
the story, I was curious to know if he would care to
comment or issue a statement clarifying the
relationship between Lushansky and your party. If Mr.
Sharansky has already issued such a statement, I'd
appreciate it very much if you could sent it to me by
email or fax.

We have received no answer so far from Mr. Sharansky or
his party.

BibiWATCH is going to continue following this story to
the end. We believe that if the allegations are true,
and Netanyahu met with Lushansky, it means that the
fears expressed by the international intelligence
community that organized crime was trying to buy
influence in Israeli politics have been realized. There
is only one subject that could have been on the agenda
of such a meeting, and it wasn't chopped liver. If
Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to put an end to this
embarrassing episode, he will have to come forward and
come clean.

Meanwhile, we'll be WATCHing.

                        of Lushansky donating several
                        million dollars to the Likud
                        election coffers. According to
                        police sources, Lushansky was
                        looking for a way to buy
                        influence in Israeli politics,
                        and Netanyahu seemed the best
                        approach. It is possible that
                        the Russian godfather made
                        Netanyahu "an offer he could
                        not refuse". We do not know
                        what Lushansky asked in
                        exchange for his generosity.

                        The source of the story, which
                        broke on Saturday morning, is
                        first of all Labor MK Moshe
                        Shahal, the former internal
                        security minister, who learned
                        about the Netanyahu-Lushansky
                        meeting from internal police
                        intelligence reports. The
                        meeting took place either in
                        the Knesset or in Netanyahu's
                        home. Very high ranking
                        officials in the police and
                        other former ministers in the
                        government have been confirming
                        the story to journalists ever
                        since.

                        Shahal has not explained why he
                        did not act on the report when
                        it first crossed his desk.

                        It now appears that the basis
                        of the original police report
                        may have been intelligence
                        supplied by foreign sources,
                        possibly American, who are
                        keeping a close watch on the
                        activities of organized crime
                        in Russia. (Copies of the
                        secret police report were
                        supplied to Israel's General
                        Security Service, the Mossad,
                        and -- through Interpol -- to
                        police departments around the
                        world.) Western and Eastern
                        European intelligence sources
                        had fingered Lushansky as
                        someone seeking influence in
                        Israeli and Russian politics.
                        Lushansky was apparently
                        involved in efforts to
                        influence the Yeltsin campaign
                        for the Russian presidency as
                        well. There have also been
                        reports that Lushansky tried to
                        buy influence in the Clinton
                        White House as well. (He'd have
                        to take a number there.)

                        In its coverage of the case,
                        the rightist Jerusalem Post
                        called Lushansky an "alleged
                        Russian gangster" but revealed
                        no details of his business. On
                        the other hand, Yosi Melman,
                        writing in Ha'aretz, filled us
                        in with some more details of a
                        man who may be a leading figure
                        in the Russian Cosa Nostra:

                             Lushansky appears to be an
                             owner of the largest
                             Russian plane in the
                             world, an Antonov 124,
                             which was used to
                             transport missiles from
                             North Korea to Iran.

                             He is reputed to have
                             close links to the Russian
                             intelligence community,
                             and allegedly helped
                             transfer KGB funds out of
                             Russia into foreign banks.
                             The Jerusalem Post itself
                             reports that Lushansky was
                             a "senior KGB officer" in
                             the 1970s and "employs at
                             least one person who was
                             in a senior position in
                             Soviet intelligence".

                             According to reports, the
                             British and Hong Kong
                             governments have refused
                             admission to Lushansky
                             because of his Mafia
                             connections.

                        The Jerusalem Post mentioned
                        that Lushansky's name does not
                        appear on the Israeli police
                        list of 33 Russian Mafia crime
                        bosses. But Israel Television's
                        crime reporter Uri Cohen
                        Aharonov revealed on Saturday
                        night that high ranking police
                        officers now say -- on the
                        record -- that the list is out
                        of date and needs to be
                        reviewed.

                        Three years ago, Lushansky
                        received Israeli citizenship
                        and maintains a residence in
                        Tel Aviv's luxurious Opera
                        apartments, though most of his
                        business is conducted in
                        Austria.

                        Sharansky admits to meeting
                        several times with Lushansky,
                        but Netanyahu's office has
                        issued stringent denials of
                        Bibi's presence at any of these
                        meetings. Sharansky's
                        spokesman, Roman Polonsky, also
                        denies that Lushansky funnelled
                        Mafia money into the Russian
                        immigrant party which Sharansky
                        heads. Sharansky does not say
                        what he and Lushansky spoke
                        about at their meetings.

                        The case raises several
                        interesting questions:

                             What was Grisha Lushansky
                             seeking in exchange for
                             the millions of dollars he
                             was offering the Likud?

                             Did the Likud take the
                             money?

                             What has Netanyahu done
                             since coming to power that
                             has helped Lushansky's
                             "business interests"?

                             Was Sharansky's highly
                             successful campaign for
                             the Knesset funded in part
                             by Iranian arms sales?

                             Has Netanyahu ordered an
                             official cover up by the
                             police?

                             What does the
                             international intelligence
                             community, including
                             Interpol and especially
                             the CIA, know about Bibi's
                             links to the Russian Mafia
                             and ex-KGB?

                        The Israeli Opposition has been
                        strangely polite about the
                        whole affair. Perhaps this is
                        because of Shahal's own unusual
                        behavior in not acting on the
                        information when he received,
                        nearly 18 months ago. The head
                        of Labor's faction in the
                        Knesset, Ra'anan Cohen, has
                        called for a meeting of a
                        Knesset committee to discuss
                        the affair. Meretz leader Yosi
                        Sarid has also called for a
                        Knesset inquiry. Shahal has
                        compared the case to Watergate,
                        stressing that Internal
                        Security Minister Kahalani is
                        playing the same role as
                        Nixon's aides in covering up a
                        major scandal.

                        The Opposition must hit much
                        harder and take this case as
                        far as it will go. This
                        includes demanding an
                        investigation by the State
                        Controller, open hearings in
                        the Knesset, and the
                        involvement of the state
                        prosecutor and the police. It
                        may even be necessary to create
                        an official state commission of
                        inquiry to conduct an
                        independent investigation.

                        In any event, the evidence as
                        it now stands -- backed up by
                        high ranking officers in the
                        Israeli Police and two former
                        Government ministers -- is that
                        Bibi Netanyahu may be Israel's
                        first Prime Minister owned
                        lock, stock and barrel by
                        organized crime.

  1. Deutch pays the price of disobedience

i would hope that people in their positions (i.e. cabinet/career policy)
realize that their job is to tell all of the truth and nothing but to their
boss and then present a united front backing his decisions based on their
honest and truthful factual/best guess input.  i would hope that their own
ideals don't become their personal agenda for their personal gain.  i would
hope not, my life and our freedom depends on it.  noticing all the hoping
and how i and my comrades in arms have been let down in the past it is a sad
state of affairs.

  1. CIA & the New Worl Order

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date:    Mon, 9 Dec 1996 12:13:53 -0800
From:    Ralph McGehee <rmcgehee@IGC.APC.ORG>
Subject: CIA & the New Worl Order

   "Western intervention in the affairs of other civilizations is
    probably the single most dangerous source of instability and
    potential global conflict in a multi-civilizational world."

   A book review in the New York Times Book Review of, THE CLASH OF
CIVILIZATIONS AND THE REMAKING OF THE WORLD ORDER, by Samuel Huntington
[one of the fiercest hawks re Vietnam] says the war of ideologies and
interests was over. The war of cultures -- Western, Eastern Orthodox,
Latin America, Islamic, Japanese, Chinese, Hindu and (possibly) African,
had begun. He said Jews lined up with Judeo-Christian heritage of the West.
These were the real actors to now watch. Realist analysts of international
affairs had neglected these deeply buried religious allegiances during
the Cold War. Now, "Western intervention in the affairs of other civilizations
is probably the single most dangerous source of instability and potential
global conflict in a multi-civilizational world." Western intervention is
also useless -- problems, for example, between Islam and Orthodoxy aren't
susceptible to Western mediation (differences have existed for centuries).
"Core states [must] abstain from intervention in conflicts in other
civilizations." Huntington's argument that the West should stop intervening
in civilizational conflicts it doesn't understand makes a powerful claim
that internationalists cannot easily ignore. End of review excerpts.

   If Huntington's arguments are adopted them the reasons for the CIA's
covert operations cease. This of course will be vigorously resisted
by the CIA's Operations Directorate that will continue to justify
itself on the basis of its [extremely biased and flawed] perceptions
of the world -- many consciously or subconsciously manufactured to
ensure the DO's continued existence.

   Re misunderstanding other cultures -- Robert McNamara in his book,
IN RETROSPECT, noted the failures of intelligence about Vietnam: We
misjudged the North Vietnamese, the Viet Cong, and exaggerated the dangers
to the United States; we totally misjudged the political forces in South
Vietnam; we underestimated the power of nationalism; and, we had a profound
ignorance of history, culture, and politics of the people in Southeast Asia.

   Now the terribly flawed Central Intelligence Agency has jumped with
both feet into further situations it does not understand. The CIA has,
inter alia, declared a new holy crusade on Islamic Fundamentalism,
calling it the more explosive and evocative "International Terrorism."
The CIA directs paramilitary operations against Iraq, Libya, and Sudan.
(The former Director of the CIA, Robert Gates said the CIA picks on the
weaker Islamic countries to avoid the consequences of attacking the more
powerful nations.)

   The CIA probably runs political action operations of one degree or
another in the remaining Islamic states, particularly Iran and Syria.
It also uses its surrogate, the National Endowment for Democracy, to
conduct political action operations in about 90 countries from Africa to
Latin America.  The potential consequences of all this interventionism
could be devastating.  But we can be assured of one thing, the CIA
will never understand what is happening.

   I cannot think of more powerful arguments for the abolishment of
the covert action operations of the CIA than those presented by the
current state of the world, the nearly fifty years experiences of
the CIA's misunderstanding of world events while exacerbating situations
with its covert operations based on those misunderstandings.

   When you have a superhawk such as Samuel Huntington recognizing the
danger of further CIA interventions we all should all give his
recommendations the most serious consideration.

Ralph:

         Maybe we should get back to the CIA as originally intended:
coordinator and analyst of intelligence. Period.
         Too often, covert priorities have distorted the quality of
intelligence.
         Abolishing the covert action section with reduce the level of
internationally  criminal activity by our government(not eliminate it, as
the Pentagon has covert action units as well, and there are probably
others), reduce the budget (something almost everyone currently in office
seems eager to do), and improve the quality of intelligence.
         Who knows what other positive side effects might ripple out from
these?

Subject: Sudan/CIA/Red Cross

          RED CROSS BEING USED BY CIA?

   Sudan, John Early, an American pilot - a four-year
veteran of the special forces in Vietnam, with a five-year tour
with the Rhodesian air force and 10,000 flight hours as a bush pilot
for the Red Cross in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda, led a red cross team
that was captured by a rebel group in Sudan. he and his co-pilot
were returning five of (CIA-backed rebel leader) Garang's
wounded rebels from a field hospital in northeast Kenya to
their base 60 miles northeast of Gorgial when ambushed and
captured. Congressman bill Richardson, a new Mexico democrat,
bribed the rebel leader to release the group. The group was
released and the Red Cross said it suspended its operations in
the Sudan after the three workers were captured. New York
Times 12/9/06 A1,6.

   This operation is similar to a long-term operation in
Pakistan and Afghanistan -- as noted below.

   USSR, Afghanistan, Pakistan,  81-92  The Regan Administration
linked up several countries in its efforts in Afghanistan --
England, Sweden, Germany and France.  The Swiss, had a viable
operation through the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC)
that had large hospitals for Afghans in Peshawar and Quetta. The
Swedish committee, ran a large medical aid program
inside Afghanistan and assistance projects in refugee camps.
Little aid at first but five years later, ninety percent of
funding came from U.S. through U.N. or USAID. CIA also funding.
covert military aid of CIA was public knowledge,
humanitarian aid was almost deep cover. distribution of humanitarian
aid and covert action of CIA frequently became so intertwined that
it was difficult to separate them. Gerald helman, former u.s. ambassador
to u.n. in Geneva coordinated worldwide humanitarian efforts working
more for CIA than state. he brought effort under umbrella of u.n.
French org medicin sans frontier (MSF - doctors without borders)
set up ops in Peshawar. England's Afghan aid had gvt funding in
addition to massive amounts from USAID. several people known
connected with MI6, later SIS, British Intel service. afghan aid
provided everything from medical to agricultural aid. Lohbeck, K.

The first thing that needs to be done with the CIA is flatly prohibit _any_
member of the Council on Foreign Relations from serving in it.

Second, restricting CIA to mere coordination and analysis presupposes some
other agency collecting the raw information and running the agents. (Which
agency would then, in turn, be pilloried for "abuses.") Information doesn't
just fall in your lap, and agents do not run themselves.

This is non-specific. How do "covert priorities," specifically, result in
who's "distortion" of what "quality of intelligence?"

You're going to have to explain "internationally criminal activity...." Do
you mean like KGB, DGI, STASI, etc.?

We do, there are, it won't. NSC covert ops are all controlled by CIA, who
write the doctrine, set the parameters, and coordinate the activities.

How, exactly?

From:    Joe Canepa <canepa@MERCURY.INTERPATH.COM>
Subject: Drugs, the CIA & the Money Trail

Alexander Cockburn wrote in the New York Press, December 4-10,
1996, a short article titled "Drugs and the CIA". He concluded
with:

"Consider General Manuel Noriega, notorious as a career CIA asset
and also a career drug smuggler. On November 22, as I mentioned
last week, came news that a Miami Grand Jury has now indicted
General Ramon Guillen Davlia, the former head of the CIA
sponsored anti-drug unit in Venezuela, for shipping 22 tons of
cocaine into the US between 1987 and 1991. US officials conceded
that at least some of these shipments were okayed by the CIA over
the objection of the DEA, allegedly to gather intelligence about
drug smuggling networks such as the Medellin cartel."

It strikes me as odd that the CIA even had an anti-drug unit, as
it would seem the jurisdiction should been with DEA, not CIA. Of
course, from its actions rather than its title, maybe the "anti"
nomenclature was inadvertent.

I don't have access to any information about the CIA's role in
this operation, or a CIA cutout's role, but I do have a
calculator.

22 tons of cocaine = 44,000 lbs.

At the street price of $14,000/lb,
the operation grossed $616,000,000.00!

Too much money for the Contras, who ended their war in 1989. Not
enough money, I guess, for the Lords of Greed.

I must ask therefore where did all this money go and to whom?

Is the whole IC under the thumb of the Lords of Cocaine?

Mel:

        In restricting the CIA to intelligence functions, I didn't
preclude active intelligence gathering, just the kind of covert
activities which go beyond intelligence gathering.
        The Bay of Pigs would be one example where the quality of
intelligence was distorted by the agency's desire to carry out an
operation, and there are plenty of other examples in the literature.
Under Casey, this was even more prevalent.
         By "internationally criminal activity," I mean activities which
violate international law, such as attempting to assassinate foreign
heads of state, intervening in the internal affairs of other states
(elections, coups, etc.), and so on.
         Yes, currently the CIA coordinates covert activity. I am
suggesting it should no longer do so.

Subject: Cocaine & the media

-- [ From: Ed Evanhoe * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --

Joe,

>>Alexander Cockburn wrote in the New York Press, December 4-10, 1996, a
short article titled "Drugs and the CIA". He concluded with:

"Consider General Manuel Noriega, notorious as a career CIA asset and also a
career drug smuggler. On November 22, as I mentioned last week, came news
that a Miami Grand Jury has now indicted General Ramon Guillen Davlia, the
former head of the CIA sponsored anti-drug unit in Venezuela, for shipping
22 tons of cocaine into the US between 1987 and 1991. US officials conceded
that at least some of these shipments were okayed by the CIA over the
objection of the DEA, allegedly to gather intelligence about drug smuggling
networks such as the Medellin cartel."<<

This paragraph is typical media sensationalizing  -- that is, based on some
fact but ignoring information that would detract from the articles impact.

Look at it closely sentence by sentence.

 "Consider General Manuel Noriega, notorious as a career CIA asset and also
a career drug smuggler."

Notice the use of the phrases "career CIA asset" and "career drug smuggler."
Evidence indicates that Noriega was on the CIA informant payroll and also
that he was into smuggling drugs.  By using the words "career,"  "CIA'" and
"drugs,"  Cockburn plants the idea that the CIA was behind Noreiga's drug
smuggling.  Also note that there is nothing in the rest of the paragraph
that ties Noriega to General Ramon Davila's drug smuggling.

"On November 22, as I mentioned last week, came news that a Miami Grand Jury
has now indicted General Ramon Guillen Davlia, the former head of the CIA
sponsored anti-drug unit in Venezuela, for shipping 22 tons of cocaine into
the US between 1987 and 1991."

True but several facts were left out.  The CIA furnished training for SOME
selected narcotics officers and did help meet the unit's payroll.  DEA was
also heavily involved in this effort.  However, by using the phrase "CIA
sponsored," the writer reinforces the idea the CIA was behind everything the
Venezuelan anti-drug unit did.

"US officials conceded that at least some of these shipments were okayed by
CIA over the objection of the DEA, allegedly to gather intelligence about
drug smuggling networks such as the Medellin Cartel."

True, but again facts were left out.  By mentioning 22 tons in the previous
sentence, the average reader generally will ignore the word "some" so is led
to believe the CIA okayed the shipment of the entire 22 tons.

Bottom line to this paragraph:  The CIA sponsors drug smuggling which in
fact is so much horse hockey, but the idea has been planted.  This is the
same Technique  Webb used in his San Jose Mercury story, "Dark Alliance."

>>It strikes me as odd that the CIA even had an anti-drug unit, as it would
seem the jurisdiction should been with DEA, not CIA. <<

There also are anti-drug units at the State Department, the Commerce
Department, the Transportation Department, Customs, etc., etc.  All overlap
or duplicate to one degree or another.  Typical government overkill.

>>Of course, from its actions rather than its title, maybe the "anti"
nomenclature was inadvertent.<<

Interesting conclusion.

>>I don't have access to any information about the CIA's role in this
operation, or a CIA cutout's role, but I do have a calculator.

22 tons of cocaine = 44,000 lbs.

At the street price of $14,000/lb,
the operation grossed $616,000,000.00!

Too much money for the Contras, who ended their war in 1989. Not enough
money, I guess, for the Lords of Greed.<<

Exactly where in this article did the the "contras" come into the picture?

>>I must ask therefore where did all this money go and to whom?<<

In case you have missed it, there is a major Vietnam-style war going on in
Colombia and along the Colombian-Venezuelan border.  There is also a brewing
revolution/coup d'etat brewing in Venezuela.  Information from Venezuela
indicates Davlia and some members of his anti-drug unit are closely tied to
Hugo Chavez Brito's (Commandante Chavez's) MBR-200 guerrilla organization
and to the FARC guerrilla's in Colombia.  It appears that some of the
profits from Davlia's drug smuggling went to both groups.  However, the
majority went into the Cali Cartel's pockets.  The rest went into the
pockets of the people along the smuggling route and the dealers in the
States.

>>Is the whole IC under the thumb of the Lords of Cocaine?<<

No.

   I agree in principle with what is said with a few exceptions
cited below.

   You note that we should get back to the CIA as originally
intended -- coordinator and analyst of intelligence.  This is
the general perception but the original legislation left a mile-wide
loophole -- to conduct such other activities as the (administration)
from time to time might require. From the creation of the CIA,
covert operations predominated -- the Church Committee investigation
of the mid-70s said that in the early days of the CIA more than
eighty percent of its budget was spent on covert operations -- 80%.
The remaining budget was for administration, development and intelligence.
Obviously the covert action dog wagged the intelligence tail.

   Although high-tech intelligence today captures a larger percentage
of its budget, covert action continues to overpower intelligence.
(CIABASE's two largest categories are "Intelligence Failures" and
"Intelligence-Policy" -- how intelligence is shaped or distorted by
policy considerations).

   To me the greatest disaster to the U.S. was the covert operation
to force the Vietnamese people to accept a U.S.-named government --
this sparked the Vietnam War and all that followed. The Agency sustained
the Vietnam War with a barrage of "Intelligence" that had nothing to
do with reality.

   We now see these rather massive efforts to create other "Vietnams"
in the Middle East. The CIA supports these efforts by creating, distorting
and writing intelligence to justify its interventionist covert policies.
The recent bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia was the consequence
of protecting the CIA's paramilitary operation in Iraq -- that ended(?)
in disaster. The Air Force flew from that base to enforce the "no-fly"
zone. Now we are considering military and covert operations to punish
Iran for the bombing -- the consequences are endless.

   I agree that there would be many positive benefits from abolishing
covert operations but this would not automatically improve intelligence.
The Intelligence Directorate (DDI) of the CIA is so bureaucratized and
frozen in the Cold War procedures and personnel, it cannot be saved.
I suggest creating a new analytic and intelligence organization and
trashing the CIA. (To be humane, personnel short of early-out or
retirement could be re-assigned to other government agencies
such as Commerce).

   In a sense a small, low-budget, relatively effective intelligence
organization exists, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence
and Research (INR). This could serve as a temporary solution or be
upgraded and/or removed from State.

   Creating a true intelligence structure is not difficult, given a
sincere effort.  We are awash in information and the ability to gather
intelligence and open-source information -- but nothing, in my admittedly
biased opinion, can be done to save the current CIA.

EXPOSING THE GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM by Nicky Hager

[See end]

IN THE LATE 1980S, IN A DECISION IT PROBABLY REGRETS, THE US PROMPTED NEW
ZEALAND TO JOIN A NEW AND HIGHLY SECRET GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM. HAGER'S
INVESTIGATION INTO IT AND HIS DISCOVERY OF THE ECHELON DICTIONARY HAS
REVEALED ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST, MOST CLOSELY HELD INTELLIGENCE
PROJECTS. THE SYSTEM ALLOWS SPY AGENCIES TO MONITOR MOST OF THE WORLD'S
TELEPHONE, E-MAIL, AND TELEX COMMUNICATIONS.

For 40 years, New Zealand's largest intelligence agency, the Government
Communications Security Bureau (GCSB)   the nation's equivalent of the US
National Security Agency (NSA)   had been helping its Western allies to spy
on countries throughout the Pacific region, without the knowledge of the
New Zealand public or many of its highest elected officials. What the NSA
did not know is that by the late 1980s, various intelligence staff had
decided these activities had been too secret for too long, and were
providing me with interviews and documents exposing New Zealand's
intelligence activities. Eventually, more than 50 people who work or have
worked in intelligence and related fields agreed to be interviewed.

The activities they described made it possible to document, from the South
Pacific, some alliance-wide systems and projects which have been kept
secret elsewhere. Of these, by far the most important is ECHELON.

Designed and coordinated by NSA, the ECHELON system is used to intercept
ordinary e-mail, fax, telex, and telephone communications carried over the
world's telecommunications networks. Unlike many of the electronic spy
systems developed during the Cold War, ECHELON is designed primarily for
non-military targets: governments, organizations, businesses, and
individuals in virtually every country. It potentially affects every person
communicating between (and sometimes within) countries anywhere in the
world.

It is, of course, not a new idea that intelligence organizations tap into
e-mail and other public telecommunications networks. What was new in the
material leaked by the New Zealand intelligence staff was precise
information on where the spying is done, how the system works, its
capabilities and shortcomings, and many details such as the codenames.

The ECHELON system is not designed to eavesdrop on a particular
individual's e-mail or fax link. Rather, the system works by
indiscriminately intercepting very large quantities of communications and
using computers to identify and extract messages of interest from the mass
of unwanted ones. A chain of secret interception facilities has been
established around the world to tap into all the major components of the
international telecommunications networks. Some monitor communications
satellites, others land-based communications networks, and others radio
communications. ECHELON links together all these facilities, providing the
US and its allies with the ability to intercept a large proportion of the
communications on the planet.

The computers at each station in the ECHELON network automatically search
through the millions of messages intercepted for ones containing
pre-programmed keywords. Keywords include all the names, localities,
subjects, and so on that might be mentioned. Every word of every message
intercepted at each station gets automatically searched   whether or not a
specific telephone number or e-mail address is on the list.

The thousands of simultaneous messages are read in "real time" as they pour
into the station, hour after hour, day after day, as the computer finds
intelligence needles in telecommunications haystacks.

SOMEONE IS LISTENING The computers in stations around the globe are known,
within the network, as the ECHELON Dictionaries. Computers that can
automatically search through traffic for keywords have existed since at
least the 1970s, but the ECHELON system was designed by NSA to interconnect
all these computers and allow the stations to function as components of an
integrated whole. The NSA and GCSB are bound together under the five-nation
UKUSA signals intelligence agreement. The other three partners   all with
equally obscure names are the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)
in Britain, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) in Canada, and
the Defense Signals Directorate (DSD) in Australia.

The alliance, which grew from cooperative efforts during World War II to
intercept radio transmissions, was formalized into the UKUSA agreement in
1948 and aimed primarily against the USSR. The five UKUSA agencies are
today the largest intelligence organizations in their respective countries.
With much of the world's business occurring by fax, e-mail, and phone,
spying on these communications receives the bulk of intelligence resources.
For decades before the introduction of the ECHELON system, the UKUSA allies
did intelligence collection operations for each other, but each agency
usually processed and analyzed the intercept from its own stations.

Under ECHELON, a particular station's Dictionary computer contains not only
its parent agency's chosen keywords, but also has lists entered in for
other agencies. In New Zealand's satellite interception station at Waihopai
(in the South Island), for example, the computer has separate search lists
for the NSA, GCHQ, DSD, and CSE in addition to its own. Whenever the
Dictionary encounters a message containing one of the agencies' keywords,
it automatically picks it and sends it directly to the headquarters of the
agency concerned. No one in New Zealand screens, or even sees, the
intelligence collected by the New Zealand station for the foreign agencies.
Thus, the stations of the junior UKUSA allies function for the NSA no
differently than if they were overtly NSA-run bases located on their soil.

The first component of the ECHELON network are stations specifically
targeted on the international telecommunications satellites (Intelsats)
used by the telephone companies of most countries. A ring of Intelsats is
positioned around the world, stationary above the equator, each serving as
a relay station for tens of thousands of simultaneous phone calls, fax, and
e-mail. Five UKUSA  stations have been established to intercept the
communications carried by the Intelsats.

The British GCHQ station is located at the top of high cliffs above the sea
at Morwenstow in Cornwall. Satellite dishes beside sprawling operations
buildings point toward Intelsats above the Atlantic, Europe, and, inclined
almost to the horizon, the Indian Ocean. An NSA station at Sugar Grove,
located 250 kilometers southwest of Washington, DC, in the mountains of
West Virginia, covers Atlantic Intelsats transmitting down toward North and
South America. Another NSA station is in Washington State, 200 kilometers
southwest of Seattle, inside the Army's Yakima Firing Center. Its satellite
dishes point out toward the Pacific Intelsats and to the east. *1

The job of intercepting Pacific Intelsat communications that cannot be
intercepted at Yakima went to New Zealand and Australia. Their South
Pacific location helps to ensure global interception. New Zealand provides
the station at Waihopai and Australia supplies the Geraldton station in
West Australia (which targets both Pacific and Indian Ocean Intelsats). *2

Each of the five stations' Dictionary computers has a codename to
distinguish it from others in the network. The Yakima station, for
instance, located in desert country between the Saddle Mountains and
Rattlesnake Hills, has the COWBOY Dictionary, while the Waihopai station
has the FLINTLOCK Dictionary. These codenames are recorded at the beginning
of every intercepted message, before it is transmitted around the ECHELON
network, allowing analysts to recognize at which station the interception
occurred.

New Zealand intelligence staff has been closely involved with the NSA's
Yakima station since 1981, when NSA pushed the GCSB to contribute to a
project targeting Japanese embassy communications. Since then, all five
UKUSA agencies have been responsible for monitoring diplomatic cables from
all Japanese posts within the same segments of the globe they are assigned
for general UKUSA monitoring.3 Until New Zealand's integration into ECHELON
with the opening of the Waihopai station in 1989, its share of the Japanese
communications was intercepted at Yakima and sent unprocessed to the GCSB
headquarters in Wellington for decryption, translation, and writing into
UKUSA-format intelligence reports (the NSA provides the codebreaking
programs).

"COMMUNICATION" THROUGH SATELLITES The next component of the ECHELON system
intercepts a range of satellite communications not carried by Intelsat.In
addition to the UKUSA stations targeting Intelsat satellites, there are
another five or more stations homing in on Russian and other regional
communications satellites. These stations are Menwith Hill in northern
England; Shoal Bay, outside Darwin in northern Australia (which targets
Indonesian satellites); Leitrim, just south of Ottawa in Canada (which
appears to intercept Latin American satellites); Bad Aibling in Germany;
and Misawa in northern Japan.

A group of  facilities that tap directly into land-based telecommunications
systems is the final element of the ECHELON system. Besides satellite and
radio, the other main method of transmitting large quantities of public,
business, and government communications is a combination of water cables
under the oceans and microwave networks over land. Heavy cables, laid
across seabeds between countries, account for much of the world's
international communications. After they come out of the water and join
land-based microwave networks they are very vulnerable to interception. The
microwave networks are made up of chains of microwave towers relaying
messages from hilltop to hilltop (always in line of sight) across the
countryside. These networks shunt large quantities of communications across
a country. Interception of them gives access to international undersea
communications (once they surface) and to international communication trunk
lines across continents. They are also an obvious target for large-scale
interception of domestic communications.

Because the facilities required to intercept radio and satellite
communications use large aerials and dishes that are difficult to hide for
too long, that network is reasonably well documented. But all that is
required to intercept land-based communication networks is a building
situated along the microwave route or a hidden cable running underground
from the legitimate network into some anonymous building, possibly far
removed. Although it sounds technically very difficult, microwave
interception from space by United States spy satellites also occurs.4 The
worldwide network of facilities to intercept these communications is
largely undocumented, and because New Zealand's GCSB does not participate
in this type of interception, my inside sources could not help either.

NO ONE IS SAFE FROM A MICROWAVE A 1994 expos of the Canadian UKUSA agency,
Spyworld, co-authored by one of its former staff, Mike Frost, gave the
first insights into how a lot of foreign microwave interception is done
(see p. 18). It described UKUSA "embassy collection" operations, where
sophisticated receivers and processors are secretly transported to their
countries' overseas embassies in diplomatic bags and used to monitor
various communications in foreign capitals. *5

Since most countries' microwave networks converge on the capital city,
embassy buildings can be an ideal site. Protected by diplomatic privilege,
they allow interception in the heart of the target country. *6 The Canadian
embassy collection was requested by the NSA to fill gaps in the American
and British embassy collection operations, which were still occurring in
many capitals around the world when Frost left the CSE in 1990. Separate
sources in Australia have revealed that the DSD also engages in embassy
collection. *7 On the territory of UKUSA nations, the interception of
land-based telecommunications appears to be done at special secret
intelligence facilities. The US, UK, and Canada are geographically well
placed to intercept the large amounts of the world's communications that
cross their territories.

The only public reference to the Dictionary system anywhere in the world
was in relation to one of these facilities, run by the GCHQ in central
London. In 1991, a former British GCHQ official spoke anonymously to
Granada Television's World in Action about the agency's abuses of power. He
told the program about an anonymous red brick building at 8 Palmer Street
where GCHQ secretly intercepts every telex which passes into, out of, or
through London, feeding them into powerful computers with a program known
as "Dictionary." The operation, he explained, is staffed by carefully
vetted British Telecom people: "It's nothing to do with national security.
It's because it's not legal to take every single telex. And they take
everything: the embassies, all the business deals, even the birthday
greetings, they take everything. They feed it into the Dictionary." *8 What
the documentary did not reveal is that Dictionary is not just a British
system; it is UKUSA-wide.

Similarly, British researcher Duncan Campbell has described how the US
Menwith Hill station in Britain taps directly into the British Telecom
microwave network, which has actually been designed with several major
microwave links converging on an isolated tower connected underground into
the station.9

The NSA Menwith Hill station, with 22 satellite terminals and more than 4.9
acres of buildings, is undoubtedly the largest and most powerful in the
UKUSA network. Located in northern England, several thousand kilometers
from the Persian Gulf, it was awarded the NSA's "Station of the Year" prize
for 1991 after its role in the Gulf War. Menwith Hill assists in the
interception of microwave communications in another way as well, by serving
as a ground station for US electronic spy satellites. These intercept
microwave trunk lines and short range communications such as military
radios and walkie talkies. Other ground stations where the satellites'
information is fed into the global network are Pine Gap, run by the CIA
near Alice Springs in central Australia and the Bad Aibling station in
Germany. *10 Among them, the various stations and operations making up the
ECHELON network tap into all the main components of the world's
telecommunications networks. All of them, including a separate network of
stations that intercepts long distance radio communications, have their own
Dictionary computers connected into ECHELON.

In the early 1990s, opponents of the Menwith Hill station obtained large
quantities of internal documents from the facility. Among the papers was a
reference to an NSA computer system called Platform. The integration of all
the UKUSA station computers into ECHELON probably occurred with the
introduction of this system in the early 1980s. James Bamford wrote at that
time about a new worldwide NSA computer network codenamed Platform "which
will tie together 52 separate computer systems used throughout the world.
Focal point, or `host environment,' for the massive network will be the NSA
headquarters at Fort Meade. Among those included in Platform will be the
British SIGINT organization, GCHQ." *11

LOOKING IN THE DICTIONARY The Dictionary computers are connected via highly
encrypted UKUSA communications that link back to computer data bases in the
five agency headquarters. This is where all the intercepted messages
selected by the Dictionaries end up. Each morning the specially
"indoctrinated" signals intelligence analysts in Washington,
Ottawa,Cheltenham, Canberra, and Wellington log on at their computer
terminals and enter the Dictionary system. After keying in their security
passwords, they reach a directory that lists the different categories of
intercept available in the data bases, each with a four-digit code. For
instance, 1911 might be Japanese diplomatic cables from Latin America
(handled by the Canadian CSE), 3848 might be political communications from
and about Nigeria, and 8182 might be any messages about distribution of
encryption technology.

They select their subject category, get a "search result" showing how many
messages have been caught in the ECHELON net on that subject, and then the
day's work begins. Analysts scroll through screen after screen of
intercepted faxes, e-mail messages, etc. and, whenever a message appears
worth reporting on, they select it from the rest to work on. If it is not
in English, it is translated and then written into the standard format of
intelligence reports produced anywhere within the UKUSA network   either in
entirety as a "report," or as a summary or "gist."

INFORMATION CONTROL A highly organized system has been developed to control
what is being searched for by each station and who can have access to it.
This is at the heart of ECHELON operations and works as follows.

The individual station's Dictionary computers do not simply have a long
list of keywords to search for. And they do not send all the information
into some huge database that participating agencies can dip into as they
wish. It is much more controlled.

The search lists are organized into the same categories, referred to by the
four digit numbers. Each agency decides its own categories according to its
responsibilities for producing intelligence for the network. For GCSB, this
means South Pacific governments, Japanese diplomatic, Russian Antarctic
activities, and so on.

The agency then works out about 10 to 50 keywords for selection in each
category. The keywords include such things as names of people, ships,
organizations, country names, and subject names. They also include the
known telex and fax numbers and Internet addresses of any individuals,
businesses, organizations, and government offices that are targets. These
are generally written as part of the message text and so are easily
recognized by the Dictionary computers.

The agencies also specify combinations of keywords to help sift out
communications of interest. For example, they might search for diplomatic
cables containing both the words "Santiago" and "aid," or cables containing
the word "Santiago" but not "consul" (to avoid the masses of routine
consular communications). It is these sets of words and numbers (and
combinations), under a particular category, that get placed in the
Dictionary computers. (Staff in the five agencies called Dictionary
Managers enter and update the keyword search lists for each agency.)

The whole system, devised by the NSA, has been adopted completely by the
other agencies. The Dictionary computers search through all the incoming
messages and, whenever they encounter one with any of the agencies'
keywords, they select it. At the same time, the computer automatically
notes technical details such as the time and place of interception on the
piece of intercept so that analysts reading it, in whichever agency it is
going to, know where it came from, and what it is. Finally, the computer
writes the four-digit code (for the category with the keywords in that
message) at the bottom of the message's text. This is important. It means
that when all the intercepted messages end up together in the database at
one of the agency headquarters, the messages on a particular subject can be
located again. Later, when the analyst using the Dictionary system selects
the four- digit code for the category he or she wants, the computer simply
searches through all the messages in the database for the ones which have
been tagged with that number.

This system is very effective for controlling which agencies can get what
from the global network because each agency only gets the intelligence out
of the ECHELON system from its own numbers. It does not have any access to
the raw intelligence coming out of the system to the other agencies. For
example, although most of the GCSB's intelligence production is primarily
to serve the UKUSA alliance, New Zealand does not have access to the whole
ECHELON network. The access it does have is strictly controlled. A New
Zealand intelligence officer explained: "The agencies can all apply for
numbers on each other's Dictionaries. The hardest to deal with are the
Americans. ... [There are] more hoops to jump through, unless it is in
their interest, in which case they'll do it for you."

There is only one agency which, by virtue of its size and role within the
alliance, will have access to the full potential of the ECHELON system
the agency that set it up. What is the system used for? Anyone listening to
official "discussion" of intelligence could be forgiven for thinking that,
since the end of the Cold War, the key targets of the massive UKUSA
intelligence machine are terrorism, weapons proliferation, and economic
intelligence. The idea that economic intelligence has become very
important, in particular, has been carefully cultivated by intelligence
agencies intent on preserving their post-Cold War budgets. It has become an
article of faith in much discussion of intelligence. However, I have found
no evidence that these are now the primary concerns of organizations such
as NSA.

QUICKER INTELLIGENCE,SAME MISSION A different story emerges after examining
very detailed information I have been given about the intelligence New
Zealand collects for the UKUSA allies and detailed descriptions of what is
in the yards-deep intelligence reports New Zealand receives from its four
allies each week. There is quite a lot of intelligence collected about
potential terrorists, and there is quite a lot of economic intelligence,
notably intensive monitoring of all the countries participating in GATT
negotiations. But by far, the main priorities of the intelligence alliance
continue to be political and military intelligence to assist the larger
allies to pursue their interests around the world. Anyone and anything the
particular governments are concerned about can become a target.

With capabilities so secret and so powerful, almost anything goes. For
example, in June 1992, a group of current "highly placed intelligence
operatives" from the British GCHQ spoke to the London Observer: "We feel we
can no longer remain silent regarding that which we regard to be gross
malpractice and negligence within the establishment in which we operate."
They gave as examples GCHQ interception of three charitable organizations,
including Amnesty International and Christian Aid. As the Observer
reported: "At any time GCHQ is able to home in on their communications for
a routine target request," the GCHQ source said. In the case of phone taps
the procedure is known as Mantis. With telexes it is called Mayfly. By
keying in a code relating to Third World aid, the source was able to
demonstrate telex "fixes" on the three organizations. "It is then possible
to key in a trigger word which enables us to home in on the telex
communications whenever that word appears," he said. "And we can read a
pre-determined number of characters either side of the keyword."12 Without
actually naming it, this was a fairly precise description of how the
ECHELON Dictionary system works. Again, what was not revealed in the
publicity was that this is a UKUSA-wide system. The design of ECHELON means
that the interception of these organizations could have occurred anywhere
in the network, at any station where the GCHQ had requested that the
four-digit code covering Third World aid be placed.

Note that these GCHQ officers mentioned that the system was being used for
telephone calls. In New Zealand, ECHELON is used only to intercept written
communications: fax, e-mail, and telex. The reason, according to
intelligence staff, is that the agency does not have the staff to analyze
large quantities of telephone conversations.

Mike Frost's expos of Canadian "embassy collection" operations described
the NSA computers they used, called Oratory, that can "listen" to telephone
calls and recognize when keywords are spoken. Just as we can recognize
words spoken in all the different tones and accents we encounter, so too,
according to Frost, can these computers. Telephone calls containing
keywords are automatically extracted from the masses of other calls and
recorded digitally on magnetic tapes for analysts back at agency
headquarters. However, high volume voice recognition computers will be
technically difficult to perfect, and my New Zealand-based sources could
not confirm that this capability exists. But, if or when it is perfected,
the implications would be immense. It would mean that the UKUSA agencies
could use machines to search through all the international telephone calls
in the world, in the same way that they do written messages. If this
equipment exists for use in embassy collection, it will presumably be used
in all the stations throughout the ECHELON network. It is yet to be
confirmed how extensively telephone communications are being targeted by
the ECHELON stations for the other agencies.

The easiest pickings for the ECHELON system are the individuals,
organizations,and governments that do not use encryption. In New Zealand's
area, for example, it has proved especially useful against already
vulnerable South Pacific nations which do not use any coding, even for
government communications (all these communications of New Zealand's
neighbors are supplied, unscreened, to its UKUSA allies). As a result of
the revelations in my book, there is currently a project under way in the
Pacific to promote and supply publicly available encryption software to
vulnerable organizations such as democracy movements in countries with
repressive governments. This is one practical way of curbing illegitimate
uses of the ECHELON capabilities.

One final comment. All the newspapers, commentators, and "well placed
sources" told the public that New Zealand was cut off from US intelligence
in the mid-1980s. That was entirely untrue. The intelligence supply to New
Zealand did not stop, and instead, the decade since has been a period of
increased integration of New Zealand into the US system. Virtually
everything   the equipment, manuals, ways of operating, jargon, codes, and
so on, used in the GCSB   continues to be imported entirely from the larger
allies (in practice, usually the NSA). As with the Australian and Canadian
agencies, most of the priorities continue to come from the US, too.

The main thing that protects these agencies from change is their secrecy.
On the day my book arrived in the book shops, without prior publicity,
there was an all-day meeting of the intelligence bureaucrats in the prime
minister's department trying to decide if they could prevent it from being
distributed. They eventually concluded, sensibly, that the political costs
were too high. It is understandable that they were so agitated.

Throughout my research, I have faced official denials or governments
refusing to comment on publicity about intelligence activities. Given the
pervasive atmosphere of secrecy and stonewalling, it is always hard for the
public to judge what is fact, what is speculation, and what is paranoia.
Thus, in uncovering New Zealand's role in the NSA-led alliance, my aim was
to provide so much detail about the operations   the technical systems, the
daily work of individual staff members, and even the rooms in which they
work inside intelligence facilities   that readers could feel confident
that they were getting close to the truth. I hope the information leaked by
intelligence staff in New Zealand about UKUSA and its systems such as
ECHELON  will help lead to change. n

---------------------------------------------------------------------

   I agree that there are competent, talented, dedicated individuals in
the CIA. My question is how does one identify them. The usual measuring
sticks such as fitness reports, promotion criteria and others are based on the
failed institutions and methods of the past. I should note that today
there is great discussion on promotion criteria for operations officers
who are nearly universally promoted based on how many agents they recruit --
resulting in many "paper" agents:

  Promotions in Directorate of Operations (DO) are closely tied to the
  number of agents CIA's 2,000 or so case officers recruit. Getting a
  recruit from a hard target - China, North Korea, Germany, Japan and
  Israel highly regarded by DO managers. Quantity counts more than quality -
  most station chiefs stress number of recruitments. "Paper recruitments
  keep the whole system greased."  Whole recruitment psychosis has dangerous
  consequences  because it promotes people who lie about what they recruited.
  Whole system encourages paper recruitments.  u.s. news & world report
  7/4/94 43-4

   When I was in the CIA some twenty years ago, all claimed that measuring
promotions on the basis of the number of recruitments was seriously flawed
and needed to be changed. Twenty years later the problem remains.

   Relying on the current leadership to cull out the deficient would probably
recreate the system. This is why I recommended abolishing the CIA and
starting anew.  If some independent board and long-range investigation
could be conducted that would start over and measure and select each individual
based on a detailed review and new criteria then such reform might
have a chance.  This in our political system; however, seems beyond
achievement.

   I also agree that using intelligence in the service of multinational
corporations will not change by simply creating a new agency. But forming
a more honorable and workable institution using detailed, well-defined
criteria might have more chance of success than trying to reform
this seriously flawed institution that for so long has worked for the
multinationals.

   I do not mean to imply that there is any reasonable chance of
abolishing the CIA and its problems -- only that such is sorely needed.

To answer Ed Evanhoe astute analysis of Cockburn's concluding paragraph, I
thought it might be fair to post Cockburns' entire article.

This follows.

As the proceeds of the drug smuggling, I would love to see an accounting.
My point is that some that money is going to somebody's pocket. The
notion that the contras or the anti-leftist in Columbia got the lion's
share is dubious. The profit from drug smuggling and the related arms
dealing is too great, when when looks at the efforts of the contras or the
others.

It would be interesting if someone would elaborate on Columbia with its
leftists, drug cartels and government and just who our people are for and
against.

For a sense of overview please just recall that those who permitted a
one year profit of 88 million dolars in heroin sales to our troops in
Vietnam are those who got promoted and called the shots in Central America
in the 80's. These guys love to portray themselves as strong
anti-communists but the truth may be that self-enrichment was the driving
force not ideology.

                        Drugs and the CIA

by Alexander Cockburn

Two Nicaraguans came to Congress last week and talked about drug
shipments and the CIA. It was one more installment in the ongoing
fracas raised by Gary Webb's three part story in the _San Jose
Mercury News_ last September. Such matters will air again in the
life of this Congress.

The House Banking Committee, chaired by Rep. Jim Leach, is
delving into possible shipments into Mena airport in Western
Arkansas during Bill Clinton's governorship.

Abundant investigations over the past decade have detailed the
CIA's role in drug smuggling through out Central America. Indeed
from the earliest days of the Central Intelligence Agency, there
have been a perfectly understandable alliance with drug
smugglers, whether in Sicily or Southeast Asia or Afghanistan.
The CIA needs local criminals for its purposes. Criminal
associations market drugs. Drug money is hard to trace. All these
are vital building blocks for an outfit like the CIA. The story
has been vividly and meticulously documented in such work as
Alfred McCoy's _The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia_.

In the case of Central America and specially Nicaragua, there has
been similar careful documentation about the Agency, before
Webb's series in the _Mercury News_. Among the relevant work
here: Brian Barger and Robert Parry's Associated Press piece
published in the _Washington Post_ on Dec. 25, 1985; Leslie
Cockburn's tv documentary and then book, _Out of Control_,
published in 1987, and Senator John Kerry's hearings in his
Foreign Relations subcomittee from 1987 to 1989 followed by tow
major reports.

Among the salient findings by these investigations:

*When the CIA followed President Carter's orders in 1979 and 1980
to subvert the infant Sandanista regime, it turned first to
Argentine military torturers to form the core of what became the
contra force, and also to Cuban exiles, who were involved in drug
smuggling.

*When Congress limited financial assistance to the contras to
"humanitarian aid", Reagan's operative-Oliver North-set up an
entity inside the State Dept. known as the Nicaraguan
Humanitarian Assistance Organization. This outfit lavishly funded
four companies to supply "humanitarian" assistance the contras.
Each of these companies were operated by known narco-traffickers.
the person in charge of this operation was Ambassador Robert
Dueling. Duemling told Leslie Cockburn on the record the names of
the four companies-Vortes, SETCO air, DIASCA, and Frigrificos de
Puntarenas-had been given to him by the CIA

*General Paul Gorman, head of the U.S. Army's Southern Command,
told the Kerry Committee that he was aware of rampant drug
running in Panama, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica. "If you
want to move arms or munitions in Latin America, the established
networks are owned by drug cartels. It has lent itself to the
purposes of terrorists, of saboteurs, of spies, insurgents and
subversions."

*Equally rich in detail is the work of Barry Seal, the DEA, and
CIA asset finally killed in Baton Rouge in 1986. Seal shuttled
guns for drugs, which were landed in Mena,AR. After his death,
the writer Roger Morris was able to inspect Seal's files, which
contained abundant evidence of his work with U.S. agencies.

In cooperation with Sally Denton, Morris wrote a long article on
Seal and Mena was scheduled for publication in the "Outlook"
section of the _Washington Post_ on Jan.29, 1985. Three days
before publication, Morris has written, the article was pulled
without explanation by Robert Kaiser, the managing editor of the
_Post_. Buried in the files of the Los Angeles Police Dept. was
yet more evidence of the links between the CIA, the contras and
crack. Search warrants issued for the drug raids in 1986 show
that a former police officer, Ronald Lister-at that time a
security consultant suspected of being part of a major crack
ring-possessed cocaine, AK47's, Uzis and Nicaraguan contra
training films and field manuels. Lister later told investigators
that he "he had dealings in South America and worked with the
CIA"

A DEA agent, Celerino Castillo, came forward in September to tell
how he came across much evidence of drug smuggling by contra
rebels on CIA funded arms flights while he was stationed in El
Salvador in the mid 1980s. "When I send my reports to my
superiors listing the dates and numbers of the drug flights,"
Castillo told the _Economist_ "I was told that they had approved
by the White House". Meanwhile three former DEA agents who worked
in Latin America in the 80's have filed suit against the CIA and
that they have been subject to continual harassment, because of
their direct knowledge of the CIA's direct role in drug
smuggling.

Joe,

>>To answer Ed Evanhoe astute analysis of Cockburn's concluding paragraph, I

Thanks for the entire article.

>>As the proceeds of the drug smuggling, I would love to see an accounting.
My point is that some that money is going to somebody's pocket. The notion
that the contras or the anti-leftist in Columbia got the lion's share is
dubious. The profit from drug smuggling and the related arms dealing is too
great, when when looks at the efforts of the contras or the others.<<

I, too, would like to have an accurate accounting but this is highly
unlikely. <g> Based on incomplete information, it appears the lion's share
went to the drug cartel.  However, substantial amounts went to those along
the drug routes, including the FARC, ELN, MBR-200 who took their cut as the
contraband passed through areas under their control.

>>It would be interesting if someone would elaborate on Columbia with its
leftists, drug cartels and government and just who our people are for and
against.<<

In Colombia, there are several antigovernment groups; the main two being the
FARC and the ELN.  Both have ties with Cuba, PRC and North Korea and their
political doctrine is communist based;  the FARC being the more fanatic in
their dogma.  The FARC operates in rural areas while the ELN is entrenched
in the slums of the cities.  However, both conduct operations in both areas.

The drug cartels support and use both for their own ends; protecting drug
processing/storage sites and keeping the drug smuggling routes open.   Here
the cartels play a very deep game.  They want to keep Colombia's political
pot stirred up but they do not want the FARC or ELN (or a combination of
both) to gain control of the government so they also clandestinely support
the extreme right-wing "paramilitary" hit-squads who are conducting a
Colombian government condoned terror campaign against FARC/ELN guerrillas
and their supporters.

So far this year, paramilitary forces have killed over three hundred
suspected FARC/ELN guerrillas/supporters, quite often killing the wives and
children also.  In retaliation, the FARC/ELN does the same to
known/suspected paramilitaries.  Paramilitary operations have stepped up
dramatically in the past two months because of recent FARC successes
throughout the country.  While the central government claims the FARC/ELN
activities are not serious, the facts say otherwise.

The FARC controls (but does not hold) a good 60% of the countryside, mainly
in the south, west and east.  They collect taxes from people in the area
they control, set up roadblocks and force drivers going through their areas
to pay a toll to pass, kidnap and ransom individuals -- foreign and domestic
-- and extort money from companies and businesses operating in their areas.


Going back to last December, there was meeting in Manaus, Brazil, between
the FARC, ELN, MBR-200 and "Asian" arms dealers.  Indications are that a
deal was concluded because, starting in July of this year, North Korean-made
weapons and ammunition began appearing in the hands of all three  groups.
While most of this stuff was small arms,  NK-made SAM-7s and RPGs also
showed up.  The SAM-7s are the version modified for jungle use.

Starting in August of this year, the FARC changed its tactics and began
hitting Colombian government garrisons in the southern part of the country.
In one action, they wiped out a 120-man plus company, killing 54 and
capturing  over 60 government soldiers.  (This is the group that President
Samper is trying to get back by going along with the FARC's demands to
withdraw his soldiers from a 4000 plus square mile section of southern
Colombia.)

On our side, we have moved more special operations troops into Panama and
Iquitos,Peru.  (This is getting too long so will write more later.)

Ed Evanhoe, Intel. Ed., Behind-the-Lines Magazine, PO Box 916, Antlers, OK
74523, writing with regard to a posted Alexander Cockburn article in the
New York Press, December 4-10, 1996, entitled "Drugs and the CIA," made
some very relevant and perceptive comments.

I would only note that serious students of intelligence do not give
Cockburn much credence.  The problem is not, however, Mr. Evanhoe's
"typical media sensationalizing," but rather Cockburn's strong biases which
tend him toward the kind of deliberately misleading statements that Mr.
Evanhoe so astute takes apart.

Since he does not choose to self-advertise, readers should note that Ed
Evanhoe is the author of _Darkmoon:  Eighth Army Special Operations in the
Korean War_.  Annapolis, MD:  Naval Institute Press, 1995.  Crerar, writing
in _American Intelligence Journal_ 16.2/3, calls this "a good book" that
"fills a gap....  Much of what is intelligence related concerns the turf
politics between the then new CIA and the existing military structure."

Subject: Re: The Spy War in Bosnia

From: Norman Abjorensen
Subject: The Spy War in Biosnia

This is a genuine plea for information and/or theories.

Sarajevo has become what Vienna was in the immediate Post World War II period
with various powers jockeying for position.

Who, then, killed Nedzad Ugljen, second in  command of Bosnia's secret
intelligence service? He was a key figure in protecting witnesses for the Hague
war criminal trials, so there was a vested interest  in his elimination.

About the only Western media mention has been that of Mike O'Connor in the New
York Times of 15 October, page 8.

Ugljen was close to the Americans, but they were opposed to the service he
represented, especially when it was suggested there was an Iranian influenmce
there? Did the Croats do the dirty work? Was it just a gangland killing? Or was
another player seeking to enter the game?

The book by Nicky Hager is called
_Secret Power - New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network_

I was way excited to find this linked off of Pike's page
http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/sp/sp_c.htm

Covert Action Quarterly is selling the book.  CAQ hits!
they have some of their stuff at
http://mediafilter.org/caq/

The first two chapters are online!!  Looks like just the update i've needed
since Bamford's book that i found in the trash as a twelve year old
paperboy.
Anyone know if there is a second edition of _the Puzzle Palace_ in the
works?  I heard there was,  and wrote the publisher,  but got no response.

While i've got my mouth open,  I heard a single report that Saddam, despite
massive extensive damage to his fiber optic TCP/IP network,  could still
communicate with his commanders; just like the boys at RAND immagined when
they designed the protocols with nuclear survivable redundancy.    im
pretty voracious w/ my info consumption and was surprized i only heard one
report of this; anyone else have pointers or info?

  discusses Lake's possible role in the Iran-Bosnia arms tranfer
  and his polices to create "still further impediments to deployment
  of effective U.S. missile defenses."  op-ed discusses Lake's
  past ties to the extreme left and his campaign against the U.S.
  intelligence community. after he left the NSC in 1970 over his opposition
  to the Vietnam war he became involved with the Institute for Policy Studies
  -- "the mother of all radical left-wing activist organizations."
  in 1974, he helped form the Center for National Security Studies, that
  played a leading role in the counterculture's bid to hamstring, disrupt
  and/or dismantle the covert activities of Americann intelligence.

I just received some mail from Book-of-the-Month Club in which a book "Psychic
Warrior" by David Morehouse is featured.   Morehouse is billed as a prominent
 CIA
remote viewer whose psychic abilities became apparent after he was shot during
 an
Army training mission. What should I know about David Morehouse and his book?

Hi, if you are interested in Morehouse and the CIA's part in "Remote
Viewing", check out this site:  Remote Viewing Home Page at:
http://www.ameritel.net/lusers/rviewer/

I would love to hear others opinions on all of this?  There is/was
another group called Psi-tech (ex-Military Intelligence), that appeared
to be more of a psy-ops group or a bunch of Cold War goof-offs?  They
spent their time remote viewing *alien virgins* and other oddities
publicly?

Subject: Re: David Morehouse

I have read the book and found it's description of the program and the
Army's utilization fascinating.  As a former Army Intel officer who
first hand experienced the benefits of "Project Jedi" sponsored by
former General Stubblebine ( I qualified expert on GI issue .45 as a
result of the Army marksmanship training program) it's a real pleasure
to get Morehouse's perspective on other projects in this area.  The
information in large part parallels the presentation of the uses and
limitations of remote viewing which appeared on the Discovery Channel's
series "The Real X-Files".  For further information you may wish to
consult Lyn Buchannan's web site at
http://www.ameritel.net/lusers/rviewer/.  One interesting issue, note
that in his book Morehouse claims that DIA sponsored one last remote
viewing episode during Desert Storm which revealed  the Iraqi's used bio
and/or chem weapons against the coalition forces in the Gulf war under
the cover of the blazing oil fields of Kuwait.  In light of recent
testimony from the former CIA analyst that DOD had much evidence this is
another claim that I think adds further fuel to that debate.

Subject: Where is Bad Aibling

Can someone be so kind as to tell me just where the Bad Aibling Regional
SIGINT Operations Center is located?? As can be seen @

         http://www.fas.org/irp/overhead/badaib.htm

I know where the town of Bad Aibling is, and I know what the facility looks
like from the air, but between the general and the particular I don't quite
seem to know just where the facility is located relative to the town.

In the best of all possible worlds, some kind soul would take the map of the
town of Bad Aibling, < badaib_m.gif > and mark the location of this facility
and email the product to me.

I found the following URL on the newsgroup, alt.conspiracy.  It doesn't seem
to address David Morehouse directly, but it is concerned with the general
topic of governmental ESP research.  It might make a good starting point for
your research.

From:    DeeCeeDave

    The December issue of The Free American (freeamerican@etsc.net) has a
very interesting article on the cover-up of the exposure of U.S. troops to
chemical/biological agents in the Gulf War.  The article, originally
distributed by the New York Times News Service, is by Philip Shenon and it
deals with the allegations of two disaffected young former CIA analysts,
 Patrick and Robin Eddington.  Patrick has written a book descriptively
titled Gassed in the Gulf: An Insider's View of the DoD-CIA Cover-up of Gulf
War Syndrome.  The book can be ordered for $23.95 by calling 1-800-606-BOOK.

    The part that interested me most was only tangentially related to the
Gulf War cover-up.  In a description of how Mrs Eddington go involved with
the issue we find the following passage:

    "Immediately after the war, the Eddingtons prospered in their careers.
 In 1993, Mrs. Eddington was placed in a fellowship program that singles out
fast-rising women employees and offers experience in other agencies of the
government.

    "She found work on Capitol Hill in the offices of the Senate Banking
Committee, which was then led by Senator Donald W. Riegle, Jr., a Michigan
Democrat who was interested in the question of why so many gulf war veterans
were falling ill."

    Please note that Mrs. Eddington was a career employee of the CIA and she
"was placed" in the so-called "fellowship program,"  which landed her in this
nice Senate job, that is, in the legislative branch.

    Question.  Is this a fit place for a career CIA employee?  Is this legal?
 Was it known to her Senate employer, her co-workers, and everyone with whom
she dealt in the Senate that she was not really like the other Banking
Committee staffers, that her first loyalty lay with the organization for whom
she had signed her oath of secrecy, that is, the Central Intelligence Agency?
 Is this commonplace?  If it is not, why would the New York Times reporter
mention it so routinely?  How many of the staff members of the Congress are
really members of the CIA and what positions do they hold?  How were they
"placed" in those positions.  How about actual members of Congress?

Subject: ciadrugs] Re: Fwd: CIA Congress Penetration

Congressional investigations done in 1975-76 (Church and Pike
Committees) revealed that the CIA had personnel placed throughout the
government in postions ranging from switch board operators to the NSC.
What follows is an exerpt from a paper I did on the company which
touched on this aspect of the CIA's ongoing criminality.>>>


At about the same time the United States House of Representatives
established the House Select Committee on Intelligence chaired by New
York Democrat, Congressman Otis Pike. Reflecting the intelligence and
executive branch resistance to cooperating with this inquiry, the first
section of Pikes report begins with this sentence " If the Committee's
recent experience is any test, intelligence agencies that are to be
controlled by Congressional law making are, today, beyond lawmaker's
scrutiny." ( Village Voice 2-16-76 p70)

CHAOS, a CIA domestic investigation, is known to have operated from
l966-l973 and records disclosed by Congressional Investigators (see
congressional report leaked to Village Voice 2-16-76 p70, this report of
a committee chaired by Congressman Otis Pike was never officially
released to the public. Pike a popular Long Island Democrat, was
defeated for re election that year after being smeared as by opponents
as unamerican) indicate that, by l973, federal secret police surveiled
over seven thousand U.S. citizens, and one thousand domestic
organizations, while ( ibid 136) 28. intercepting over 28 million pieces
of mail. ibid

Among the practices the committee uncovered was the fact that the CIA
details agents and employees, overtly and covertly, throughout the
executive branches of government. It was revealed that the CIA had
placed a covert employee on the staff of the National Security Council.
Another covert operative worked on the Interagency Classification Review
Committee, an agency responsible for disemination of government
documents and rules on Freedom of Information Act requests,  many of
which concern the CIA. CIA employees were employed in positions ranging
from switchboard operators and secretaries to economist, chauffeurs, and
stenographers. They worked as administrators, scientists, couriers,
laborers and sky marshals.

It was disclosed that in addition to the White House, CIA personnel were
detailed to other agency's including "the Federal Executive Institute,
Cabinet Committee on Price Stability, White House Joint Committee on
Science, Office of Emergency Preparedness, the Department of Justice,
the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (DEA) the FAA, the Vice
Presidents office and the Commerce Department". The investigations by
these committees revealed that the intelligence branches of the Federal
government had penetrated an extraordinary number of significant policy
and opinion influencing institutions throughout the nation. Academia,
think tanks, government, and media were infiltrated by overt and covert
intelligence operatives whose allegiance and livelihood was dependent on
the intelligence apparatus. 29.

In view of the class based dominance of this society and the preeminence
of elite control, this spying of the federal police reflects a large
degree of either insecurity or institutionalized paranoia. The
totalitarian tactics employed is reflected by the scope, duration, and
magnitude of the police investigations of Americans in all walks of
life. Among the many citizens under varying degrees of scrutiny were
Supreme Court Justices Felix Frankfurter and William O. Douglas, former
first lady Elanor Roosevelt, and distinguished authors including Pearl
Buck, William Faulkner and Carl Sandberg. (Hoover) In addition to the
FBI,  information was also compiled by the CIA, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the State Department, and the intelligence
branches of the military services. ibid.

Subject: Pitts and The Future Of Espionage

Seasons Greetings from Munich. I am still on Digest but have not seen
much discussion of the Pitts Espionage Case here, or much anywhere for
that matter.  I found this recent Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty
analysis below very interesting and worthy of presentation to the List.
Regards to all.

Analysis From Washington: What's New And What's Not In World Of Spies
By Paul Goble

Washington, 23 December 1996 (RFE/RL) - Two events last week highlight
both what has changed and equally important what has not changed in the
shadowy world of international espionage.

The event pointing to change is certainly the more remarkable. On
Thursday, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said
that he was impressed by U.S. President Bill Clinton's choice of Anthony
Lake to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

In an interview published in the Moscow paper Komsomolskaya Pravda,
Vyacheslav Trubnikov said that this change at the helm of the CIA gave
him hope that the two spy agencies could establish "fruitful mutual
relations."

Trubnikov gave two reasons for his hopes: First, he suggested that he
and Lake shared a common approach to their work. Neither he nor the CIA
nominee believed in "standing out too much."

And second, the Russian spymaster said, the CIA and the SVR had "a lot
in common" -- including periods of difficulties in their respective
countries. What sets the two apart, Trubnikov claimed, is that the CIA
is now going through "a difficult period," but his SVR has already
completed a transition out of one.

To comprehend just how much of a break from past practice this statement
represents, one need only imagine how impossible such a statement would
have been ten years ago. No KGB chief would likely have been able to say
that in public, and any KGB chief who did would have been delivering the
kiss of death to the American nominee.

But if much has changed in the world of espionage since the end of the
Cold War, another event last week signaled how much has not. On
Wednesday, the United States government indicted a 13-year FBI
counterintelligence officer on charges that he had sold secrets to the
Russians.

The indictment of Earl Edwin Pitts follows on the heels of the arrest of
CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of espionage for Russia. And
both these cases reminded many of the notorious Aldrich Ames, a CIA
operative who had sold Moscow secrets for many years and who is now
serving a life sentence in a federal prison.

Many American commentators expressed surprise that Moscow should be
continuing its espionage effort against the United States now that the
Cold War is over. An editorial in Friday's New York Times, for example,
said "the intensity of espionage activity" by both Russia and the West
"seems out of proportion to the threat" posed by either side.

Such expressions of surprise reflect the impact of the changes like
those which made Trubnikov's virtual endorsement of Anthony Lake both
possible and unexceptionable.

But they betray a fundamental misunderstanding of both the Cold War and
the international community.

Spying by one country against another did not begin with the Cold War
nor end with its demise. Powers great and small have always sought to
find out more about their opponents both real and potential.

And Russia has been especially active in this regard. Former CIA
director Richard Helms pointed this out to the Washington Post last
Thursday when he noted that the Russians have always been interested in
spying and said "it will take much more than one little collapse of the
Soviet Union to expunge it from the Russian psyche."

But so too has the United States. Americans pride themselves on the
openness of their society and thus frequently are troubled by the
secrecy involved in espionage. But they and their leaders generally have
recognized that the United States cannot afford to be in the dark about
what other countries are planning.

Thus, despite the aura of cooperation between Russian spymasters and
American intelligence directors suggested by Trubnikov, espionage and
counterespionage between these two countries and among others as well
seems certain to continue.

Indeed, the growing sense that conflict and competition between Moscow
and Washington are things of the past may even increase the amount of
espionage by one side against the other as individuals in each country
decide that selling secrets to the other is somehow less treasonous than
it was in the past.

I forward the following for your information only. It looks like listserv
will be down again...


Have a happy New Year!

We don't spy on anyone - we just watch those that do...


I haven't been officially notified, but have confirmed with Operations
that all mainframe systems will be powered down Friday by 10:00 EST.
We don't have a trustworthy estimate of how long we will be down but
are hoping to be back by late Saturday afternoon.  Add in another 16
hours or so if the IBM chooses to blow another HDA.  I don't want to
deal with another extended period of instability because we get pushed
into areas that don't just involve delays, but bizarre interactions,
so the Official Policy is:  SJU won't be supporting mail posted after
early Friday morning until we are running reliably again.  Please
make it clear to your subscribers that anything they send in after
oh, about 9 Friday, is subject to being deleted without further warning.
Since I expect that there will be a large amount of traffic from the
clueless, I'm expecting to have to do some deletions by Sunday morning.

<font size=5><strong>QUESTIONS ARISE ABOUT AIRPORT CARGO SECURITY</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Investigators from the National Transporation Safety Board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to 
search for evidence to prove their suspicions -- that TWA Flight 800 was blown out of the sky by a bomb.<br>
The most popular theory continues to be that the Boeing 747 was destroyed by a bomb in the front cargo hold. 
All of the cargo records for Flight 800 have been turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration and, of 
course, investigators are checking out leads obtained from the records.<br>
<br>
The similarities to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, are eerie. The front nose 
section, containing the cockpit and part of the first-class section are known to have separated from the rest of 
the airliner by a catastrophic event.<br>
<br>
The responsibility for the security of cargo placed on flights falls upon the airlines. The responsibility is supposed 
to be the same as the airlines inspecting the bags of passengers. But, in reality, airlines actually rely upon 
shipping companies to vouch for the contents contained in the shipments. It appears, however, that, in turn, the 
shipping companies themselves rely upon the honesty of their frequent customers.<br>
<br>
Representing the freight companies, known as air forwarders, is the Air Forwarders Association. Its executive 
director, Jim Foster, said, &quot;It would be extremely difficult to inspect every package of every shipment manually. 
That means opening the shipment and comparing the contents to the packing list. It would not be something that 
people would be willing to pay for.&quot;<br>
<br>
In 1989, a presidential commission said that the casual oversight of cargo on passenger planes has been a 
concern for a number of years. The commission called the problem &quot;a huge gap in the security umbrella.&quot;<br>
<br>
In response to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, Congress in 1990 passed a law that was supposed to 
increase the standards of cargo security. But just recently, the General Accounting Office said that the 
enforcement of the new rules for mail and other cargo should be improved by the FAA.<br>
<br>
As far as it is known, the FAA has taken no action. The fact is, say many experts, thorough scrutiny of all air 
cargo is impossible. Given as an example is just New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport -- in 1994, 
1.4 million tons worth $86 billion was shipped out of that airport on cargo and passenger planes. That's just one 
major airport.<br>
<br>
Charlie LeBlanc, the operations manager of a Houston consulting firm, Air Security International, is also the 
former manager of cargo security with Continental Airlines. He said of airline cargo security today, &quot;I think it's a 
huge loophole.&quot; LeBlanc explained that commerical cargo on a Boeing 747 is usually placed in the front cargo 
hold. Passenger luggage is placed in the rear hold.<br>
<br>
Explaining how commercial shipments are handled by the air forwarders, Leblanc said, &quot;If somebody walks up 
to an airline cargo desk and says I want to ship this box to London, they will be questioned and their package 
would be opened and inspected and possibly held fro 48 hours. If I'm somebody that walks up and says, 'I'm 
with XYZ Company,' and that company has shipped with them in the past, those checks and balances would 
not take place nine times out of ten.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even if a possible terrorist wanted to go about his plot of placing a bomb inside a legitimate package, it would 
not be difficult. All he would have to do is establish credibility with a known shipper for a few months.<br>
<br>
Ken Jones is the director of operations with Air Cargo, Inc. A large, well-known company that handles ground 
shipping for airlines. Jones said, &quot;It's a pretty touchy situation to deal with, but everybody is mindful of the need 
for increased security. The question is, 'How do we go about doing something without economically crippling 
the industry?'&quot;<br>
<br>
As of right now, security for the nation's 1,200 to 1,500 air forwarders takes a two-prong approach. The FAA 
requires all of the freight shipping companies to submit a security plan. They are to certify that their employees 
have undergone criminal background checks. The FAA then provides the airlines with a list of approved air 
shipping companies.<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate, but there would appear to be a number of ways that this security system can be defeated. We 
will not even touch upon the U.S. Postal Service, here.<br>
<br>
ENN has been looking to see what the impact would be if U.S. airlines were to adopt the security approach of 
Israel's El Al Airlines. El Al's security program is acknowledged as the best in the world. But U.S. airline 
industry insiders say that El Al can accomplish their plan because they are, by American standards, a small 
airline. While security at U.S. airlines certainly can be improved, it appears that they may be unable to duplicate 
the same level of safeguards as the renowned Israeli airline.<br>

<TITLE>AOL Gold Trojan Horse Virus</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY> 
<H2>Information on the AOLGOLD Trojan Program</H2>
<P>
The AOLGOLD Trojan program was recently discovered on America Online (AOL).
 Notice about the Trojan has been circulated to all America Online subscribers.  Notice about the Trojan and a copy of the Trojan program were supplied to CIAC by Doug Bigelow, who is on the staff of America Online.
<P>

Apparently, an e-mail message is being circulated that contains an attached archive file named AOLGOLD.ZIP.  A README file that is in the archive describes it as a new and improved interface for the AOL online service.  Note that there is no such program as AOLGOLD.  Also, simply reading an e-mail message or even downloading an included file will not do damage to your machine.  You must execute (or run) the downloaded file to release the Trojan and have it cause damage.
<P>

If you unzip the archive, you get two files: INSTALL.EXE and README.TXT.  The README.TXT file again describes AOLGOLD as a new and improved interface to the AOL online service.  The INSTALL.EXE program is a self-extracting ZIP archive.  When you run the install program, it extracts 18 files onto your hard drive:
<P>

MACROS.DRV VIDEO.DRV INSTALL.BAT ADRIVE.RPT SUSPEND.DRV ANNOY.COM MACRO.COM SP-NET.COM SP-WIN.COM MEMBRINF.COM DEVICE.COM TEXTMAP.COM HOST.COM REP.COM EMS2EXT.SYS EMS.COM EMS.SYS README.TXT
<P>

The file list includes another README.TXT file. If you examine the new README.TXT file, it starts out with "Ever wanted the Powers of a Guide" and continues with some crude language.  The README.TXT file indicates that the included program is a guide program that can be used to kick other people off of AOL.
<P>
If you stop at this point and do nothing but examine the unzipped files with the TYPE command, your machine will not be damaged.  The following three files contain the Trojan program:
<BR>
MACROS.DRV VIDEO.DRV INSTALL.BAT
<P>
The rest of the files included in the archive appear to have been grabbed at random to simply fill up the archive and make it look official.
<HR>

<H4>ACTIONS</H4>
<P>
The Trojan program is started by running the INSTALL.BAT file.  The INSTALL.BAT file is a simple batch file that renames the VIDEO.DRV file to VIRUS.BAT and then runs it.  VIDEO.DRV is an amateurish DOS batch file that starts deleting the contents of several critical directories on your C: drive, including:
<P>

c:\
<BR>
c:\dos
<BR>
c:\windows
<BR>
c:\windows\system
<BR>
c:\qemm
<BR>
c:\stacker
<BR>
c:\norton
<P>

It also deletes the contents of several other directories, including those for several online services and games, such as:
<P>

c:\aol20
<BR>
c:\prodigy
<BR>
c:\aol25
<BR>
c:\mmp169
<BR>
c:\cserve
<BR>
c:\doom
<BR>
c:\wolf3d
<P>

When the batch file completes, it prints a crude message on the screen and attempts to run a program named DoomDay.EXE.  Bugs in the batch file prevent the DOOMDAY.EXE program from running.  Other bugs in the file cause it to delete itself if it is run from any drive but the C: drive.  The programming style and bugs in the batch file indicates that the Trojan writer appears to have little programming experience.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>RECOVERY:</H4>
<P>
<B>**WARNING** Do not copy any files onto your hard disk before trying to recover your hard drive.</B>
<P>

The files are deleted with the DOS del command, and can be recovered with the DOS undelete command.  The files are still on your disk, only the directory entries have been removed.  If you copy any new files onto your hard disk, they will likely be written over the deleted files, making it impossible to recover the deleted files.
<P>

If you have delete protection installed on your system, recovery will be relatively easy.  If not, the DOS undelete command can be used, but you will have to supply the first letter of each file name as it is recovered.  In many cases, you will probably want to restore the directories by reinstalling them from the original installation disks, but do that last.  You must recover any unreplaceable files first using undelete and then replace any others by copying or reinstalling them from the distribution disks.
<P>

<B>To recover the system:</B>
<P>

1. Boot the system with a clean, locked floppy containing the recovery program for the recovery files you have installed, or the DOS UNDELETE.EXE program if you do not have recovery files installed.
<P>

2. Type the VIRUS.BAT file to get a list of the directories the Trojan tried to delete. Ignore any directories that don't exist on your machine.
<P>

3. Run the recovery program and recover your files. You may have to help it find the recovery files, such as MIRROR, which will be in the root directory. You may have to recover the MIRROR file first and then use it to recover the other files.
<P>

If you are using only the DOS undelete command, type:

   undelete directory
<P>

where directory is the name of the directory to examine. To undelete the files in the dos directory, use:

   undelete c:\dos
<P>

The undelete program will present you with a list of deleted files with the first letter replaced with a question mark. Without delete protection, you will have to supply this letter in order to undelete the file.
<P>

4. After you have restored as many files as you want or can using the UNDELETE command, replace any others by reinstalling them using the original installation disks.

The Operations staff at America Online has released the following bulletin to their users:
<P>

<B>- --BEGIN MESSAGE--</B>
<BR>

Dear Member:
<BR>

As you know, we strive to keep you informed on various issues regarding online safety.
<BR>

We want to take this opportunity to remind you about potential computer viruses and Trojan horses and how to protect your computer.  First, a virus is a program that is designed to spread and usually attaches itself to a program with the goal of spreading to other computers.  A Trojan horse is a program that is intended to corrupt your computer but has to be activated before it can be executed.  For example, a Trojan horse can be distributed as an attached file to an email but the file has to be downloaded and executed before harm is done.
<P>

If you receive email from unknown senders with an attached file, it is a good rule of thumb not to download the files.  In addition, if you ever receive a file in email you believe could cause problems, please forward it immediately to TOSEMAIL1, and explain your concerns to our Terms of Service staff.
<P>

We have received recent inquiries regarding a Trojan horse that is sent as an attached file in an email message entitled "AOLGOLD" and "Install.exe". It is important to understand that no virus or Trojan horse can be passed along by simply reading email.  However, we strongly urge that if you receive email with an attached file with this name not to download it.
<P>

Due to the private nature of electronic mail, we cannot scan files in email for viruses as we do with files in public areas of the service.
<P>

We have never had an occurrence of a virus or Trojan horse being spread through simply reading email.  In order for one to spread to your computer, you would have to proactively select the attached file and download it to your hard drive.  It is therefore advisable never to download attached files from an unknown sender.
<P>

AOL incorporates virus protection throughout the service and scans all posted software, text, and sound files in public areas. We also offer our members the Virus Information Center on AOL where you'll find information about the latest virus or Trojan horse, along with updates to all the popular commercial, shareware, and freeware anti-virus tools.  Keyword: VIRUS.
<P>

Thank you for taking an active role in maintaining a safe online environment.
<P>

<B>Sincerely,  AOL Operations Staff</B>

<TITLE>Boza Virus Attacks Windows 95</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
For Immediate Release: 02/03/96
<P>
<H2>Windows 95 Virus-Boza Announced</H2>

 It would appear that an Austrailian "hacker" may have created the first computer virus specifically targeted at Microsoft's Windows 95 program, according to British researchers. The virus can corrupt executable programs, and potentially be spread to other computers.  It is allegedly the first virus that is written specifically for Windows 95.
<P>
   Although the virus doesn't appear to be well-written, "Boza will go down in history," according to the Associated Press (AP) and British anti-virus specialist Paul Ducklin.   Analysts have named the virus "Boza" after a Bulgarian liquor "so powerful that just looking at it will give you a headache," Ducklin said. Fortunately for Windows 95 users, the virus also does not appear particularly contagious, if proper precautions are taken.  The problem is vested in a sharing of software programs, which is already illegal (and certainly unwise) in most countries. To infect someone else's machine, they would have to be given an infected program, and they would have to run it. The program could then infect that host machine and begin to replicate.
<P>
   Ducklin said Boza is not generally being distributed on networks or among users' personal computers.  So far, it appears to be circulating mainly among anti-virus researchers. Software has reportedly already been developed to destroy it.  Computer analysts do not know who made the virus, although there may be a clue in one of the messages that Boza can display on computer screens: "VLAD Australia does it again with the world's first Win95 virus."  VLAD is thought by counter-virus analysts to be a Bulgarian-based international group of virus writers, who have previously developed several insidious and destructive pieces of computer code.
<P>
  Anti-virus investigators say that they are concerned that Microsoft released Windows 95 in August without any sort of anti-virus program that could detect and kill 32 bit viruses. Boza is allegedly written specifically to corrupt 32-bit programs, like Windows 95.  According to other press reports, Microsoft already had to fight an unconfirmed, but widely distributed, report that at least one version of Windows 95 came with a virus already on the installation diskettes. ERRI again reminds computer users to practice "safe computing"; back-up frequently, don't share copyrighted programs, and run a competent anti-virus program on a constant basis.

<H2>CIA DIRECTOR WARNS OF CYBERSPACE ATTACKS</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Deutch warned Congress on Tuesday that the United States faces a growing threat of cyberspace attacks against its computer networks by other nations and terrorist groups.  Deutch told a Senate Governmental Affairs hearing, "While the details are classified and cannot be discussed here, we have evidence that a number of countries around the world are developing the doctrine, strategies and tools to conduct information attacks." The director would not name the countries suspected.
<P>

Deutch told the senators, "International terrorist groups clearly have the capability to attack the information infrastructure of the United States, even if they use relatively simple means.  I am certainly prepared to predict some very large and uncomfortable incidents."  He said that intelligence and law enforcement agencies were "fully alerted" to the threat.
<P>

The director related how a large-scale attack could disrupt U.S. computer networks that could cripple the banking, business, communications, energy, military and transportation industries in the nation.  All of those industries are dependent on computers that could be (and are, in some cases) vulnerable to sabotage from "hackers" to being physically attacked with explosives. With such weapons as computer viruses transmitted through the internet, such cyber-attacks could shut down international commerce and fund transfers, damage computer systems that guide commercial air and/or rail traffic. cut electrical power, or even prevent the Pentagon from issuing orders to its forces in the field.
<P>

Deutch added, "Day-to-day operations of U.S. banking, energy distribution, air traffic control, emergency medical services, transportation and many other industries all depend on reliable telecommunications and an increasingly complex network of computers, information databases and computer driven control systems.  Virtually any 'bad actor' can acquire the hardware and software needed to attack some of our critical information based infrastructures."
<P>

Director Deutch said, "There is a highly classified intelligence estimate that focuses on foreign attacks on the public-switched telephone network system of this country."
<P>

One senator asked Deutch how he would compare the threat of computer attack to other threats such as nuclear, chemical and biological, the director answered, "I would say it was very, very close to the top."
<P>

The CIA director said that his agency and the U.S. Department of Defense plan to create an Information Warfare Technology Center to handle computer attacks at the National Security Agency (NSA).  He said that the U.S. government has been seeking cooperation from commercial computer users, but many have been reluctant to share their information.
<P>

Besides planning the computer-attack center, Deutch said that U.S. intelligence agencies, along with the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI were devoting more resources to the problem and were looking for evidence of foreign intent to attack U.S. computer systems.  The director said, "One effort looks for foreign sponsorship of U.S.-based computer-hacking activities as well as evidence of organized crime involvement."  The inter-agency critical infrastructure security group is scheduled to release a security threat assessment by 1 December 1996.

<p><font size=5><strong>GANGBANGERS INVADE CYBERSPACE</strong></font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Chicago, IL (ENN) -- As if law enforcement officers didn't already have enough to worry about, there is now a new 
hangout in cyberspace. It's for street gang members and gangbanger wannabes. Just what was needed -- a place for gang 
members to exchange ideas on how to improve drug sales, what's the best gun to use to shoot your business rivals and 
what's the best drugs to use in your spare time?<br>
<br>
All of that and even more can be found on the Glock3 Web site. This site is said to link members of street gangs from 
around the world, from 'Lil Shorty's Click in London to the Gangster Disciples in Chicago to the West Side Crips in 
Phoenix. Experts say that the site provides a virtual how-to-be a street gang member.<br>
<br>
The site was said to be created in early January by gangbangers in Detroit. In the first three months, it recorded about 
9,000 hits -- which is pretty respectable. After its internet service provider saw what was going on -- Glock3 was deleted 
from the service. In April, the enterprising gang members found a new internet provider ... in New Zealand.<br>
<br>
The Auckland internet provider has received complaints about the Web site, but the company feels its powerless to do 
anything about it. The operations manager for the provider said, &quot;We have no legal right to censor the content. We don't 
have the authority. The legislation hasn't caught up with the internet.&quot;<br>
<br>
An example of the type of individual that visits the Web site is a gang member who calls herself, &quot;GDLookin'&quot; She talks 
about her favorite music groups, partying in Mexico and smoking &quot;out&quot; on the Glock3 &quot;phat linkz&quot; page. She must be a real 
charmer. Other members have bragged about serving time for such offenses as: carjacking, carrying a concealed weapon, 
auto theft, assault and arson.<br>
<br>
Sergeant Mark Clark of the Scottsdale, Arizona, Police Department says that he is more concerned about Web sites 
showing how to make bombs then how to act and dress like a gangbanger.<br>
<br>
The Scottsdale Police Department has established its own Web site that is dedicated to fighting gangs. The new site offers 
gang statistics, phone numbers and tips for parents on keeping their kids out of gangs. Any questions can be directed to 
Sergeant Clark at his e-mail address of: spdganggood@net.com<br>
<br>
As a reminder, the Emergency Response and Research Institute's EMERGENCY BBS has a large library on information 
about Chicago street gangs. You can reach the EMERGENCY BBS at the number given at the end of the ENN DAILY 
REPORT or if you don't want to pay long distance fees -- you can reach the BBS through telnet from anywhere in the 
world.<br>
<br>
Clark said that there are not a large number of street gang members in Scottsdale. &quot;Half the gang population of Arizona 
lives in Phoenix,&quot; he said. &quot;And we're a part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the United States, there are at least 25,000 street gangs with an estimated membership of about 650,000 people. 
Gangbangers in the Southwest portion of the U.S. are said to be less organized than those on the East Coast, said Jim 
Ledy, a criminal-intelligence analyst for the Arizona Department of Public Safety.<br>
<br>
Captain David Gonzales, who heads up the Arizona DPS gang task force, said about gangs on the internet, &quot;Now it's in 
your home, your living room, your den. Street gangs are moving toward more of an organized crime stature.&quot; (Editor's 
Note: the captain needs to come to Chicago and see how organized they are.)<br>
<br>
Gonzales, who has been tracking gangbangers for almost ten years, added, &quot;Unfortunately, these guys can talk about 
anything they want and there's nothing law enforcement can do about it. It establishes a worldwide connection to gangs 
everywhere.&quot;<br>

<H3>INVASION OF THE CYBERPUNKS</H3>
<BR>
By Clark Staten
<P>
Chicago, IL - The modem lights blink as a screeching sound
signifies that the two computers have established a
connection.  Like thousands of other "data calls" that are
transmitted throughout the country each day, this call may be
an innocuous transfer of some numbers from one company's
spreadsheet to another.  But, then again, it also may be the
work of a member of the little known techno-underground . . . 
of a so-called "Cyberpunk".
<P>

Who or what is a "cyberpunk"?  He is typically in his late
teens or early 20's, extremely bright, is introverted, has
owned or worked with computers for several years, and
probably doesn't have much respect for what the
counter-culture calls "the establishment".  Many cyberpunks
are the best and brightest of the computer hacker
evolutionary chain.  Most spend much their time
"on-line" in the sightless and quiet "cyberspace world" of
datastreams, modems, and computer software.
<P>

The terms "cyberspace" and "cyberpunk" evolved from the world
of science fiction writers and stories.  Early in the 1980's,
a novel called "Neuromancer", written by William Gibson,
helped to shape the image of a cyberpunk.  Reportedly, he took
many of his themes from "underground rock-and-rollers" of the
punk-music scene and transferred the aggressiveness and
seditiousness to the use of computer technology.  The actual
term "cyberpunk" was reportedly coined by a short story
writer by the name of Bruce Bethke.
<P>

Many of today's cyberpunks were believed to be the better
educated and more radical "hackers" of the early 80's. In the
early days of "hacking", most practitioners did not intend to
cause damage to the computer systems that they invaded.
Early "hackers" were not generally considered
malicious. In fact, to be termed a "hacker" was originally
considered a compliment. In its earlier context, "hacker"
meant someone who could fashion a workable way to generate
effective computer code, often to solve difficult software
problems.
<P>

Most hackers say that they were simply exploring other
computers and trying to learn more about computers and
programming.  They point to the exaggerated costs of computer
hardware, software, and programming tools in the early
1980's, and most say that they just wanted to "borrow" some
information or programs.  The challenge, they say, was simply
to gain entrance into college, business, and government
computers and learn something others didn't know.
<P>

As time went on, the challenges became fewer, information
seemed more frightening, and some hackers began to develop a
very definite attitude toward the government and multi-
national corporations that they were invading.  Some
bored and talented hackers/programmers began to experiment
with writing computer code that caused various kinds of
real and imaginary malfunctions to occur, when executed.
These now infamous codes have come to be known as a computer
viruses.  Scores of these crippling or even destructive
viruses are written and unleashed on unsuspecting computer
users every year.
<P>

Others went in other directions, and used more sophisticated
methods of manipulating both the telephone systems and the
user interfaces of computers all over the world. Various
colors ( blue, black, etc.) of electronic boxes were built
for the purposes of "phone phreaking" or breaking into
regional phone networks and subverting them to provide for
many hours of free phone calls for the cyberpunks to explore
more distant computers.  Various strategies were developed
for dialing into and out of private companies to use their
telephone accounts free and to disguise the routes of the
actual connections that the cyberpunks used.
<P>

As the frequency of intrusion increased, and the more
aggressive "punks" began to experiment with stealing
corporate and military secrets, and planting evil "Logic
Bombs", "Worms", and "Trojan Horses" to cause computers to
self-destruct.  Federal law enforcement agencies were called
in to stop the trespasses.  In 1990, the FBI and Secret
Service undertook an operation called "SUNDEVIL". Raids were
conducted on private BBS's (Bulletin Board Systems) that
supported or even fostered the cyberpunk mystique and allowed
the "punks" collectively to communicate and share information
that would help others to break into new and different
computer systems.
<P>

A similar investigation and raid was conducted in the
Chicago, IL. area, in 1991.  Evidence had been collected by
federal officials that some segments of computer control code
that were used in the 911 emergency telephone system by
Southwestern and Illinois Bell had been compromised by
Illinois cyberpunks.  Confiscation of another BBS and a large
amount of computer software was undertaken in the Illinois
raid.  Questions of illegal entry, possession of copyrighted
material, and issues of proprietary license began to be heard
in federal court.  But, the arrests and seizures haven't
seemed to disrupt or discourage the new breed of hackers.
<P>

October, 1992 brought the report of an arrest of a 23 year
old Newark, NJ man, identified only as "Maverick" by press
reports.  "Maverick" reportedly was arrested in an
investigation involving disruption of the 911 telephone
service in the New York area.  Two other arrests are expected
soon of teenagers who may have also participated in the plot.
"Maverick" reportedly has been described by unofficial
sources as being a member of a cyberpunk group called the
`Legion of Doom'.  The "Legion" has been identified by
various law enforcement agencies as a prime source of illegal
information and activity.
<P>

Concurrently, Toronto, Canada police reportedly have arrested
a fifteen (15) year old boy who is charged with misdirecting
emergency medical service (EMS) crews and calling in false
medical calls by home computer modem.  More interesting, are
the charges that the youth routed his calls through telephone
exchanges in the United States to confuse telephone security
tracking systems. According to Toronto police sources, they
believe that the boy was also involved in a group of
cyberpunks, who were using 911 telephone systems as a
"prank".  Toronto police say that this prank could
potentially cost someone's life, if essential EMS crews were
duped into responding to false calls, while someone actually
needed medical care.
<P>

Not as ominous, but surely just as unlawful, was the recent
(Nov., 1992) arrest of three (3) teenagers in Brooksville,
FL.  The high school honor students have been accused of
making tens of thousands of dollars worth of long distance
phone calls.  Reportedly, the group had used a home computer
to tap into the private company's private branch exchanges
(PBXs) and Southeastern Bell telephone lines to correspond
and exchange computer information across the country.
According to press reports, a single company lost more than
$35,000 worth of phone calls.
<P>

Some science and computer writers seem to show a certain
commiseration with the cyberpunks, and even suggest that they
could be a positive force for resisting "global oppression of
the masses" by monitoring governments and multi-national
corporations and dispensing `politically incorrect' secrets
to the exposure of the media.  Others report the vast
capability of cyberpunks to cause the "electronic
destruction" of computer systems used for national defense,
banking, communications, nuclear power, transportation, and
other vital services.  At least one unidentified cyberpunk
has been quoted by as saying that, "with current level of
knowledge and the way computer networks are structured, we
have the capability to shut down everything . . . not just
locally...but globally".
<P>

Are cyberpunks a force for good or evil . . .  or merely an
extension of an emerging pop subculture that is using the
advanced, available, technology to express a point of view?
Fueled by movies such as THE TERMINATOR, ROBOCOP, and
BLADERUNNER, cyberpunks seem a natural futuristic
extension of the rebellion that is youth.  The major question
that is remaining is whether the cyberpunks will lead
us to freedom of expression and understanding . . . or,
possibly, to the destruction of the electronic society as we know it.

<H2>THE CYBER TERRORISTS ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

A fascinating story came out of London this past weekend that appears to have dire consequences.  Several financial institutions, such as banks, brokerage firms and other large corporations, have paid extortion money to sophisticated international "cyber terrorists." Huge sums of money have reportedly been paid to these criminals who have threatened to destroy computer systems and ... have proven that they can do it.
<P>

Companies in the United States have also fallen victim to these criminals.  A London Sunday Times investigation has learned that British and American law enforcement agencies are looking into forty known "attacks" on financial institutions in London and in New York since 1993.
<P>

Vast sums of money have been paid to the blackmailers who have proven their ability by using "information warfare" techniques that may have been learned in   military or government service.  The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which utilizes some of the most sophisticated computer systems in the world, has said that the criminals have penetrated computer systems by using what are called "logic bombs."  These are coded devices that can be detonated remotely.  They have also used electromagnetic pulses and "high emission radio frequency guns."  These M.O.'s do have a distinct military bent to them.
<P>

These blackmailers are anything but subtle in their methods. They have left encrypted threats at the highest security levels (root)  of the computer systems that they have attacked and have left messages such as: "Now do you believe we can destroy your computers?"
<P>

Authorities have been unable to stop the attacks.  It is highly suspected that some of the criminals are in the United States. Banks and other financial institutions have also not been very forthcoming with law enforcement investigators.  Many fail to even notify the police of the crime.  One security director of a London bank said, "They have given in to blackmail rather than risk a collapse in confidence in their security systems."
<P>

"We are aware of the extortion methods, but the banking community has ways of dealing with it and rarely reports to the police," said a senior police detective in London. Special investigative units have been set up in both the U.S. and in Europe.  But the financial institutions have closed ranks and have hindered the investigations of the cyber criminals.
<P>

In April, experts in the field of information warfare met in Brussels, Belgium. to discuss the threat.  There has also been a closed meeting with the British intelligence community.  And it is being reported that there was a secret seminar held in Washington, D.C. just this past weekend with the cyber terrorists as the main agenda topic.
<P>

The international investigation firm, Kroll Associates, confirmed last week they have been called in to assist some financial firms through the blackmailing schemes.  In New York City, a Kroll Associates spokesman said, "One of the problems we face is that the potential embarrasment from loss of face is very serious. The problem for law enforcement is that the crime is carried out globally, but law enforcement agencies stop at each frontier."
<P>

On Saturday, a spokesman for the Bank of England confirmed that his bank has come under attack by the cyber terrorists.  Scotland Yard has assigned a senior detective from its computer crime unit to take part in a European-wide operation that has been codenamed, "Lathe Gambit."

In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has three separate squads investigating computer extortion.  The U.S. Secret Service is also involved in computer crime.</A>)
<P>

The U.S. National Security Agency believes that there are four separate cyber terrorist gangs in operation.  As has been reported in this publication previously, there is evidence that at least one of the gangs is based in Russia.
<P>

These are four of the extortion cases that the NSA is reportedly taking a very hard look at:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- 6 January 1993.  A computer crash halted trading at a British brokerage house.  A L10 million pound ransom was paid into a Zurich, Switzerland, bank account.
<LI>-- 14 January 1993.  A British bank paid a ransom of L12.5 million pounds.
<LI>-- 29 January 1993.  L10 million pounds was paid by a British brokerage house in ransom after threats were made.
<LI>-- 17 March 1995.  A British defense firm paid a ransom of L10 million pounds.
</UL>
<P>
In each of the four above cases, the blackmailers threatened senior directors and demonstrated they could indeed crash the computer system.  Each of the four companies caved-in to the extortion demands within hours and wired the money to foreign bank accounts, from which the blackmailers removed the money within minutes of its arrival.
<P>

It is highly believed that the criminals gained their expertise in information warfare in the United States military.  The U.S. military has been known to develop "weapons" that can disable or destroy computer hardware.
<P>

This threat is very, very real and is very, very serious.  So far, the criminals have been satisfied in only gaining wealth. All of this sounds like something out of a thriller novel.  In Tom Clancy's last book -- "Debt Of Honor" -- cyber experts caused a major crash on the New York Stock Exchange.  It sounds like these real cyber terrorists could do that if they really wanted to do so.
<P>

Since it appears that at least some of these individuals may have been trained by  military agencies, do they have the expertise that could compromise Defense Department computers? Again, it sounds like they do.  For law enforcement agencies-- what would happen if the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer system were "hacked" or destroyed?
<P>

Everything, today, is run by computers and these individuals appear to have the ability to get into whatever they want. In the past, ENN has offered reports on general terrorism, the threat of nuclear, chemical and biological terrorism --"cyber terrorism" would appear to be on the same threat scale.  It's that serious.
<P>
<HR>
<B>For a further analysis, we offer the following from Mr. Winn Schwartau of Interpact, Inc., who is an expert in information warfare and security.  Mr. Schwartau is the author of the books entitled, "Information Warfare" and "Terminal Compromise."</B>
<P>
<H3>Class III Information Warfare: Has It Begun?</H3>

The June 2, 1996 Sunday Times from London front page headline reads: "City Surrenders to L400 million Gangs"
<P>

And HERF Guns, Electromagnetic Pulses and sophisticated logic bombs may be responsible.
<P>

At InfoWarCon II, Montreal Canada, I made reference to investigations I was conducting regarding concerted and organized attacks on up to 43 financial institutions in Europe and the US; an example of Class III Information Warfare.  This issue of London Sunday Times brings a glimpse of the story that will eventually be told.
<P>

The first attack in my files dates to January 6, 1993. A trading house in London  was blackmailed into paying L10million to unknown extortionists who demonstrated  they could crash the company's computers at will. The next incident in the Times  article is also in my files: January 14, 1993 where similar demonstrations and  demands were made for this time L12.5Million. And so is the next, January 29,  1993 and another L10Million siphoned off by the bad guys. According to my  figures and those in the Times article, hundreds of millions of pounds have been  paid ransom in what is clearly an example of Class III Information Warfare.
<P>

According to officials in Washington, Whitehall, London, City of London Police, the National Security Agency, Kroll Associates, Bank of  England and others (in  the article) the threats are credible. The attackers have the clear ability to bring trading and financial operations to a halt - exactly when they say they  will. "Banks, brokerage firms and investment houses in America have also  secretly paid ransom to prevent costly computer meltdowns and a collapse in the confidence among their customers," sources said in the article.
<P>

The article discussed the advanced information warfare techniques used by the perpetrators. "According to the American National Security Agency (NSA), they have penetrated computer systems using 'logic bombs' (coded devices that can be remotely detonated), electromagnetic pulses and 'high emission radio frequency guns' which blow a devastating electronic 'wind' through the computer systems."
[For a complete description of HERF Guns (coined by Schwartau
in 1990), see "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway," Thunders Mouth Press, 1994]
<P>

The perpetrators have also left encrypted messages, apparently bypassing the highest security levels of the systems, leaving messages such as "Now do you believe we can destroy your computers?" The NSA and other officials believe that four gangs are involved; probably one from the US and probably one from Russia.  But, because the crimes are international, national borders still prevail,  making investigation more difficult. Investigations and official inquiries have  been in progress for some time according to the article.
<P>

Now, for a few things you will not see in the article, but will hopefully [if I am lucky] come out in the near future. The number of attacks is way above 40.  They have been known about for almost three years, but only recently have people been willing to come out of the closet and discuss this highly sensitive issue with the media. Long briefs and analyses of these events have been submitted to  high level officials and select business persons for at least a year, but to no avail. [Security by obscurity reigns all too often.]  Banking is not the only industry that has been attacked and the attacks have been spread around Europe  as well as Australia.
<P>

As an industry many of us have said that the only way something will really be done is if we experience a Computer Chernobyl [Peter Neumann Phrase as I recall]  or as I first said in Congressional Testimony, "An Electronic Pearl Harbor." Are  these events the harbinger of strong reaction by the computer community at large? As  events unfold and more information is permitted to be disseminated over the next  few days and weeks, we will see.
<P>

We have essentially solved the issues of confidentiality and integrity. But, I have maintained that the real problem is going to be Denial of Service. These events are unfortunate, but clear examples of that reality.
<BR>
[End Mr. Schwartau's quoted comments]
<P>
A Bank of England official reportedly told reporters, "it is not the biggest issue in the banking market."  Hmmm...we're going to have to think about that. If our banking and defense systems are not secure...what is?

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>EMERGENCY SERVICE TECHNOLOGY</strong></font></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4>By: Clark Staten, EMT-Paramedic<br>
Past Chairman, National Society of EMS Administrators</font></font></p>
<p>The 90's have been described by some as the &quot;Information Age&quot;. Undoubtedly, the events of the past decade have 
changed the way in which we record, transfer, store, retrieve, and evaluate information. In large part, the advent of 
the personal computer (PC) has drastically affected the way we perceive and utilize information. It's introduction has 
opened new possibilities for personal, professional, and organizational growth and development. </p>
<p>During the past ten years, vast strides have been made in regard to emergency service administration and operations. 
More enlightened members of the emergency response community have discovered that there are many more 
effective and efficient ways to direct and analyze our function. Many forward-thinking emergency managers have 
adopted methods and practices developed in the private sector and created hybrid models for use in Fire, Police, 
and EMS departments. </p>
<p>In order to better understand the advances that have been made, and to explore the applications of the future, we 
need to review the history and capabilities of personal computers. In this retrospection, let's move backward in time 
and examine the technology and how it has changed the emergency services. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>THE 1970's AND BEFORE (THE PAST): </strong></font></font></p>
<p>One of the first computers was called ENIAC; it weighed thirty (30) tons, was two stories high, and covered more 
than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet of space. It was built and went into operation in 1946. It did amazing 
things for it's time. </p>
<p>It is probably not commonly known that the International Business Machine (IBM) Company did not introduce a 
desk-top personal computer until 1981. Several other desk-top computers had, however, been introduced by 
various other companies in the late 70's. Names that come to mind were Osborne, Apple, Tandy, Kaypro, Xerox, 
Victor, and Morrow. The late 1970's and early 1980s were a turbulent time in the development of PC's, as various 
manufacturers attempted to transfer known technology from &quot;Mainframes&quot; to small computer platforms. </p>
<p>The early PC's were vastly underpowered and slow, by today's standards. Many did not have hard disk drives, and 
other stored data on &quot;cassette-type&quot; tape drives. Extended or expanded memory were still a dream. Many small 
platforms actually had less than 640K of RAM (Random Access Memory), and yet users were amazed about the 
way that the 8086 and 8088 CPU (Central Processing Unit) machines performed (e.g. forerunners to 80286, 
80386, 80486 central processors of the 80's &amp; 90's). Color monitors were not in use and no one had ever heard of 
a &quot;Mouse&quot; pointing device. </p>
<p>Early users were thrilled that the &quot;micro-computer&quot; was finally on their desk. They no longer had to access or learn 
mainframe operating systems. They suddenly could control the input and output of data, rather than depending on a 
&quot;computer specialist&quot; in some other agency or department. The &quot;personal computer (PC) revolution&quot; had begun. </p>
<p>Early emergency service applications of computer power were primarily run on large mainframe type machines and 
were generally limited to personnel and inventory records. The advent of PC's changed the uses of computers in 
several areas of emergency operations. The earliest transferences of work probably occured in the administrative 
areas of police and fire departments. As in private industry, emergency service secretaries and record keepers 
quickly saw the capability and suitability of personal computers for inputting, storing, and retrieving of temporary 
data. </p>
<p>Another important task that was developed for the emergency computers was that of computer-aided-dispatching 
(C.A.D) of emergency equipment. So called &quot;system status management&quot; programs were developed that helped 
managers/dispatchers to effectively allocate resources, based on availability and public demand. Most were data 
&quot;input-intensive&quot; and required dispatchers to spend a great deal of time keypunching information into the database. </p>
<p>Communication, in general, were changed by digital and &quot;chip&quot; technology. Radio frequencies could be then be 
synthesized rather than crystal controlled. This ability caused far greater latitude and control of frequency changing 
capabilities and allowed radios to be smaller and have more features. With digital chip technology, a hand-held 
transciever or scanner could listen or transmit on as many as one-hundred frequencies. </p>
<p>All in all, the 1970's and early 80's saw tremendous advances in both technology and the use of it. However, it 
should be noted that during the 70's and early 80's, many emergency response agencies and personnel didn't avail 
themselves of the advances in computer technology. Whether it was the complexity of the process, or the mindset of 
the emergency community; most did not develop the skills or buy the equipment needed to apply the benefits of the 
vast technical advances that had taken place. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, all too many departments were mired in the traditions and practices of the past. Veteran fire and 
police officials did not understand the technology or it's uses. It was, therefore, easier to cling to the file cabinets, 
telegraph keys, and paperwork of the past than to accept the computer technology and young &quot;technocrats&quot; of the 
future. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>The 1980's &amp; 90's (THE PRESENT): </strong></font></font></p>
<p>Remember ENIAC from the past (see Pg.1)? It is interesting to note that the fact that a 1990's model laptop 
386/33Mz IBM Clone can add, subtract, and perform math functions at least fifty times faster than the earlier, 
gigantic, ENIAC. Current hardware is so sophisticated that it can cause millions of instructions to be instantaneously 
passed to various components within the computer in a matter of seconds. </p>
<p>At the risk of being accused of using a cliche' of today, the 1980's and 1990's have been &quot;awesome&quot; in terms of 
technical advances in personal computer technology. Probably, no one decade in history saw more or greater 
changes in our capability to develop and manage information than did the last one. </p>
<p>The desk-top computing machines became smaller, lighter, faster, and more graphically capable. The intricate DOS 
(Disk Operating System) command line systems of the past were replaced with various kinds of GUI's (Graphic 
User Interfaces....with MicroSoft's Windows being a typical example. Various kinds of &quot;mouse&quot; pointing devices 
became part of our computer vernacular. Computer Central Processing Units (CPUs) have come from a speed of 
4.77MHz in the late 70's to 50MHz in some current 1990's models (X10 increase in speed). </p>
<p>Advancements in computer software have kept pace with the development of hardware. New and complex software 
has been developed that will allow users to easily perform accounting, word processing, desk-top publishing, 
graphics, computer- aided-design, and many other functions. Demographics, population shifts, inventory control, 
equipment use data, nter-active training, and other types of analysis programs are benefiting the manager of today. 
By combining faster hardware with more sophisticated software, greater productivity has been demonstrated. 
Business and government have began to sit-up and take notice. </p>
<p>The emergency services have also benefited from this surge in the advancement of technology. Computer work 
terminals have been placed on Local Area Networks (LANS) in many fire/police/ems stations. Municipal response 
records are now frequently kept by entering data at the station terminal or even from a mobile terminal in a vehicle. 
Several police agencies have mobile cellular or radio links directly from a car to the NCIC (National Crime 
Information Center) or state computer mainframe system. </p>
<p>This networking arrangement the police with almost instantaneous information on &quot;wants and warrants&quot;, as well as 
providing a &quot;rap sheet&quot; of past offfense for the person entered into the system. A similar setup also allows 
paramedics to keep Mobile Intensive Care Reports, and firefighters to keep NFIRS (National Fire Information 
Report system). </p>
<p>Many emergency communication centers and hazardous materials units are reported to be carrying cellular 
technology and on- board computers that allow access to; water grid maps, addresses, phone numbers, chemical 
databases, MSDS sheet programs, occupancy databases, fire safety inspections and building preplans. Almost any 
database that can be accessed on a telephone land-line can be used, directly from the scene. This provides incident 
commanders with a vast amount of available information upon which to make better decisions. </p>
<p>Computer technology has also enabled the development of cellular telephone technology. Mobile telephones and 
pagers have had a tremendous impact on business and emergency response agencies. Current chip configurations for 
hand-held portable telephones make them light weight enough to be taken almost anywhere....including the scene of 
an emergency. With the added reliability and country-wide accessibility of these &quot;tiny&quot; transceivers, and the launching 
of several &quot;SAT-COM&quot; satellites, it would appear possible to communicate with anyone....anywhere. </p>
<p>Many emergency dispatch centers have installed computer work stations for each dispatcher. These work stations 
expidite and assist the decision-making process and maintain an ongoing list of available resources. In more 
sophisticated systems, Loran-C radio locaters uses satellite triangulation technology to locate vehicles and radio 
transmitters to within 100 ft. of their actual location on a computer generated city grid map. Personnel emergencies 
are immediately reported with the touch of a button, as well as the location of the distress signal. </p>
<p>More advanced systems also record and maintain a history of a given address/location for future reference. This 
history keeping capability provides a list of past occurances at a specific location. It could also be used to store and 
catagorize patients, past medical conditions, and medications. A criminal history of an individual or location could 
also be stored and generated. Many municipalities have found the practicality of sharing information between 
emergency agencies and several have joint communications centers that can access the same databases. 
Computer-Aided- Dispatch of the past has grown up. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>THE FUTURE: </strong></font></font></p>
<p>Future developments in the use of computers stagger the imagination. Someday soon, we will probably see computer 
terminals in the front of most Police, Fire, and EMS vehicles. These terminals will direct us to the scene of the 
emergency with digitalized street maps. The terminal will provide information about any incident that has occured at 
the location previously. It will give us pre-plans for hazardous materials or other dangerous situations. The terminal 
will generate response time and other pertinent reports that will track our progress and efficiency. </p>
<p>On-Board our &quot;vehicles of the future&quot; we will have computer controlled communication units with radio repeater 
capabilities. Each crew member will wear a comfortable, lightweight headset that will enable communication with 
each other, the dispatch center, the hospital, the city computer, a voice mail, and record keeping system. The radio 
systems will be multi-tasked and trunked, so that any department can communicate with any other... instantaneously. </p>
<p>Medical records will be obtained and stored by simply saying, &quot;Computer....Recorder on!&quot;. The computer will then 
constantly monitor Electrocardiogram reading, drug drips, and record any and all findings that the medics note. 
Further miniaturization will allow blood gas analysis and other blood studies to be done at the scene and almost 
instantly. Treatment protocals will be immediately available, either by radio link to a physician or direcrted by a 
computer library with an artificial intelligence &quot;expert system&quot;. </p>
<p>Computerization of &quot;CAT-SCAN&quot; type equipment, using sound waves or other electronic phenomena will give 
detailed analysis of the body and facilitate appropriate trauma and medical emergency treatment. Patient assessment 
data that is being gathered and recorded by the on-board vehicle computer will be instantly reviewable by the 
hospital that is going to recieve the patient. Diversions of ambulances will be computer determined and will 
automatically take into consideration the patient load and capability of each receiving facility. </p>
<p>Identification of an unidentified criminals will be accomplished by matching an &quot;on-scene&quot; computer generated video 
image of the suspect and database records of all known or suspected perpetrators. Fingerprints will also be obtained 
and matched by computer to verify an identification process. A complete history of the criminal, his methods of 
operation (M.O.), and current suspicions will be compared by the computer and analysis given to the police 
investigator for his/her action. Comparison &quot;mug-shots&quot; will be computer drawn at the scene and witnesses will then 
be able to identify any matching suspects in a timely manner. </p>
<p>Known criminals or mental patients that are &quot;on-the-streets&quot; could be electronically tagged with a emitter that could 
automatically be tracked by a computer. Electronic release programs could be expanded to include almost all 
non-violent offenders with the aid of computer surveillance. A computer record would constantly be recorded of the 
movement of these monitored individuals, and could be immediately reviewed in the event of suspicion. Security 
computers could automatically note any unusual movement or action on the part of any convicted criminal and 
activate an police alarm mode that would direct him/her to be detained by the nearest police unit or, (if necessary to 
prevent a violent act), &quot;shocked and disabled&quot; by a built-in &quot;taser-type&quot; device. While civil libertarians might balk at 
such a system, repeat offenses and offenders could become a thing of the past. </p>
<p>The same sort of locater devices could be used to insure firefighter/rescuer safety. A computer tracking device could 
identify an individual or unit at the scene of a large emergency and provide an ongoing monitoring of their location 
and consciousness. If the rescuer were to become incapacitated, or didn't move for a predetermined amount of time, 
am alarm would sound at the command post. This alarm could also be activated by pushing a portable radio button, 
or activating an emergency beacon manually. If radio contact could not be established, a search of the last known 
location of the individual could be undertaken immediately. </p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong></font></font></p>
<p>The effective uses of computers in the emergency services environment have just begun to be realized. Undoubtedly, 
many more applications and capabilities will be discovered and exploited during the coming years. Computer experts 
predict that many of the author's &quot;predictions of the future&quot; are closer than many of us might realize. Many, if not 
most of these ideas, can be expected to come into being (in some form) during the career of today's &quot;rookie&quot; police 
officer, firefighter, or EMT. </p>
<p>The capability and practicality of the emergency service computers of tommorow will be determined by the needs 
that are identified and developed.... today. It would appear to be the responsibility of those emergency responders 
that have some expertise or ability in this area to foster and facilitate the effective use of our future computer 
resources. </p>
<p>Without the imput and guidance of the &quot;computer pioneers&quot; of today, we can not achieve the maximum benefit for the 
emergency responders and citizens of tommorow. With that devotion and participation..... many lives can be saved, 
our jobs can be performed more effectively, and our world can become a happier, healthier, and safer place. </p>

<P>
The FBI's National Computer Crime Squad (NCCS) investigates violations of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. These crimes cross multiple state or international boundaries. Violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act include intrusions into government, financial, most medical, and Federal interest computers. Federal interest computers are defined by law as two or more computers involved in a criminal offense, which are located in different states.  Therefore, a commercial computer which is the victim of an intrusion coming from another state is a "Federal interest" computer.
<P>

<H3>COMPUTER CRIMES THE NCCS INVESTIGATES INCLUDE -</H3>

<UL>
<LI> * Intrusions of the Public Switched Network (the telephone company)
<LI> * Major computer network intrusions
<LI> * Network integrity violations
<LI> * Privacy violations
<LI> * Industrial espionage
<LI> * Pirated computer software
<LI> * Other crimes where the computer is a major factor in committing
          the criminal offense
</UL>
<P>

  
<H3>PROCEDURES THE COMPUTER USER SHOULD INSTITUTE BOTH PRIOR TO BECOMING A COMPUTER CRIME VICTIM AND AFTER A VIOLATION HAS OCCURRED INCLUDE -</H3>

<UL>
<LI>* Placing a login banner to ensure that unauthorized users are
        warned that they may be subject to monitoring.
<LI>* Turn audit trails on.
<LI>* Consider keystroke level monitoring if adequate banner is
     displayed.
<LI>* Request trap and tracing from your local telephone company.
<LI>* Consider installing caller identification.
<LI>* Make backups of damaged or altered files.
<LI>* Maintain old backups to show the status of the original.
<LI>* Designate one person to secure potential evidence
<LI>* Evidence can consist of tape backups and printouts. These should
    be initialed by the person obtaining the evidence. Evidence should
    be retained in a locked cabinet with access limited to one person.
<LI> * Keep a record of resources used to reestablish the system and
    locate the perpetrator.
</UL>
<P>
For notices to alert users to potential security problems and information on related subjects, contact the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at cert@cert.org or the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) at first-sec@first.org. The FIRST home page is at www.first.org/first.
<P>
<H3>ADDITIONAL ACTIONS AVAILABLE TO PROTECT THE COMPUTER USER INCLUDE -</H3>
<UL>
<LI>* Encryption of files.
<LI>* Encryption of transmissions.
<LI> * Use of one-time password generators.
<LI>* Use of Kerberos.
<LI>* Use of secure firewalls.
</UL>
<P>
The FBI's National Computer Crime Squad, located within the Washington Metropolitan Field Office, has national jurisdiction, and coordinates many of its investigations with FBI counterparts in foreign countries where a case shares mutual interest. The NCCS includes personnel who have:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>* Degrees in the computer sciences.
<LI>* Prior work experience in industry and academic institutions.
<LI> * Basic and advanced commercial training.
<LI>* Knowledge of basic data and telecommunications networks.

<TITLE>"Good Times" is a Hoax</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
For Immediate Release: 03/01/96
<P>
<U><H2>The AOL 'Good Times' Virus is a Hoax</H2></U>
Reports continue to surface from a variety of normally reputable sources in regard to a so-called "Good-Times" virus that is contained within e-mail sent through or originating from the America On-Line(tm)
computer service. The latest report (02/27/96) came from a Sheriff's Office in California and was distributed through a number of "police" channels on the Internet.  Besides police and military channels, the hoax has also reportedly proliferated among U.S. Dept. of Agriculture employees, and other reputable government offices. It appeared to be totally legitimate...<B>.it was not</B>.
<P>
Sadly, any number of reliable news sources and individuals have fallen for this rumor in the past, including the EmergencyNet News Service. Late in January, we received a copy of a message from an authentic "military souce" which explained the "virus" that was reportedly being spread by e-mail.   Stupidly, believing this previously reliable reporter, we "bit" and passed along the warning...creating quite a furor among several of our readers, who study such issues on an on-going and professional basis. They immediately, and thankfully, notified us of our error.
<P>
Even though we retracted the alert the next day and in one other subsequent story, the "cat was out of the bag".  Although our intent was honest, and our timeliness exemplary, our facts apparently left something to be desired.  We apologize for our error, stand chastised,  and vow to obtain "several" expert opinions before releasing further information about other potentially destructive viruses. If you read a "virus alert" here in the future, it will be based on at least three reliable sources.
<P>
It should be noted that Microsoft(tm) does acknowledge that there currently is a Word for Windows(tm) virus that can be spread by e-mail and that it runs a "macro" that can allow it to be become destructive. The release of that story admittedly contributed to our belief that the problem could have been transfered to other e-mail providers and systems. Experts have advised us that this method of infection of normal e-mail is not technically feasible at this time. It is confirmed that the "Good-Times" virus either doesn't exist, nor spread an infection . 
<P>
<B>REPEAT...the "Good Times" virus is a hoax, designed to waste your bandwidth and increase your insecurity!  PLEASE DO NOT spend any more time or effort spreading this rumor.... </B>

<H2>EmergencyNet Imitator Opens New Web Service</H2>
By Steve Macko, EmergencyNet News Managing Editor
<P>

The prestigious Chicago law firm of Mora and Baugh, Ltd. today announced that they have issued a legal challenge to the opening of a new emergency service website with a name and concept similar to that of ERRI and its EmergencyNet News Service.  According to Mr. Frank Nagorka, attorney for the Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute, Web Business Systems, Inc. of Farmingdale, NY (DBA EMERGENCYNET) has been issued a cease and desist notice for infringing on the intellectual property, name, and registered servicemark of the EmergencyNet News service.
<P>
According to a Nagorka, EMERGENCYNET/Web Business systems, Inc. was requested by fax and certified mail on February 13th, 1996 to discontinue the use of the "EmergencyNet" name prior to the opening of their site, and they had allegedly agreed to do so. The cause of action occurred on Feburary 15th, when their site went into full operation, using the "EmergencyNet" name and offering to provide services similar in nature to the already existing EmergencyNet News Service and the Emergency Response & Research Institute website....all while using the "EmergencyNet" name.
<P>
Clark Staten, Publisher of the EmergencyNet News Service, said that he is extremely disappointed that Mr. Rusty McCormick and the people at Web Business Systems, Inc. didn't keep their word and choose a new name for their site.  "We have spent almost five years and thousands of dollars developing name recognition for the concept of  EmergencyNet and our unique news service, and now it is just taken from us," Staten said.  "I'm afraid that the Web Business System's decision to use our name will lead to customer confusion and allow them to take advantage of our good reputation and past advertising efforts,", he continued.  "I wouldn't be half so upset, but we did advise them prior to their grand opening that they were using our name, and asked them to stop...and yet they still proceeded."
<P>
Mr. Nagorka said he has provided copies of the ERRI servicemark registrations (see picture below) and other correspondence to Web Business Systems, Inc. and is awaiting a formal reply before additional legal action is taken. He said that injunctive relief and monetary damages can be awarded when a party fails to heed a cease and desist request, with respect to a specific servicemark.
<P>
Staten concluded his comments by saying that he hopes that the issue can be settled quickly and amicably, with a mutually agreeable reaffirmation of ERRI's rights to the "EmergencyNet" name.  If not, Nagorka said that he is considering a number of legal options that are open to ERRI.

<p><font size=5><strong>RUSSIA'S CRUMBLING MILITARY </strong></font>...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
When the Chechen rebels battled Russian government troops for Grozny during the week of 6 August, they did more than 
give the Russians a bloody nose. Some descriptions of the battle said that the Russians were &quot;humiliated.&quot; The statistics 
seem to suggest that description to be true. Killed were 451 Russian troops. Another 1,264 were wounded. Many, many 
more were recorded as missing, but there are reports that many of those may have actually been soldiers who had 
deserted.<br>
<br>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin had handed the Chechen problem over to his national security chief Alexander Lebed. In a 
sense, Yeltsin threw the ball to Lebed to see if he could find a way out of the abyss that the Russian government has found 
itself in with the would-be breakaway region of Chechnya. Lebed has had some success in negotiating a settlement in the 
region, but has consistently been undercut by other military and political leaders in Moscow, as he conducted shuttle 
diplomacy between Grozny and Moscow.<br>
<br>
Some people wonder why has Russia fought so hard to keep this region that few had ever heard of before? The answer is 
quite simple ... it's oil. Black gold. What some Americans call, &quot;Texas tea.&quot; Chechnya has a large amount of oil and the 
Russians aren't just going to let that walk awayand leave it for others. They also have concerns about Moslem incursion 
into the former Soviet Union and the possible instability, in other republics, that allowing Chechnya to break away could 
cause<br>
<br>
Chechnya has become Alexander Lebed's top priority. But our study, here, is not the Chechen war. It's what has become 
of the Russian military. For decades following the second world war, the Soviet military machine was feared and 
respected. Military strength in Russia has been a very important fact for centuries; before and during communism. Leaders 
and members of the military were also held in high esteem. Today, the current Defense Minister, General Igor Rodionov, 
says of his own military, &quot;Our armed forces do not have a single regiment capable of launching a combat action or moving 
by rail or air at two or three hours' notice.&quot;<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>So, what happened? What happened to this once-respected military machine?</strong></font><br>
<br>
The only Russian military force that is still well-run is said to be the Strategic Rocket Force. They control and maintain the 
approximately 700 mobile and/or silo-based intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles. This force is described as operational 
and efficient. James Brusstar of the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Washington said, &quot;It's the one force that's 
gotten all the money it needs.&quot; But the Strategic Rocket Force is the only operational force that can be looked upon as 
being completely operationally ready. The rest of the military, the army, the navy and the air force would appear to have 
big, major problems.&quot;</p>
<p><font size=3><strong>Here is just a partial list of some of the woes of the Russian Military:</strong></font><br>
<br>
<strong>Military Equipment</strong>. What was once considered to be the former Soviet military-industrial complex has virtually been 
ground to a halt. Plants that once rolled out thousands of tanks are now standing idle. Russia has not completed the 
construction of one single warship since 1991. In 1995, they were trying to sell some uncompleted ships, including at least 
one aircraft carrier. Since 1995, the Air Force has received less than ten new aircraft. Even though the army has 
considerably less personnel today, they don't have enough uniforms to go around and civilian clothing has been permitted 
to be worn.<br>
<br>
<strong>Morale Of The Troops</strong>. It has been said that crime and corruption in the Russian military even exceeds what is 
happening in the civilian world. This area is not pretty. Officers are said to abuse each other and their troops. Border 
troops reportedly deal in narcotics. Air Force officers don't get paid. Tens of thousands of military personnel have second 
jobs. William Odom, the highly- respected former director of the U.S. National Security Agency and who is an expert on 
Russia at the Hudson Institute, said, &quot;If you issue an order, what happens is unpredictable.&quot; Is it any wonder when orders 
from Moscow to commanders in the Chechen theater were not carried out if those commanders didn't agree with the 
orders? This is no way to run a military.<br>
<br>
<strong>Training Of The Troops</strong>. The Russian Army does not hold exercises on the divisional or regimental level. Virtually every 
tank and infantry division is rated unfit for combat. Which in itself is astounding. Jet fighter pilots only receive ten percent as 
many training sorties as their Western counterparts. Another incredible example is that submarine commanders have to fill 
out their crews with sailors from surface vessels in order to go out on patrol.<br>
<br>
<strong>Military Budget</strong>. In 1996, Russia spent about $17 billion on defense. That is less than ten percent what the United States 
spends and about one third what Russian defense officials sought. Some military analysts say that Russia may actually be 
spending a bit more than the above figure -- but its still nowhere near what it used to be during the Soviet era.</p>
<hr>
<p>Andrei Piontkovsky of the Center for Strategic Studies in Moscow says that weak leadership, high-level infighting and 
Russia's uncertainty about its post-Cold War status are to blame to what has happened to its military. In July of this year, 
President Yeltsin replaced the unpopular Pavel Grachev as Defense Minister. In his place, he named General Igor 
Rodionov. It will be Rodionov's job to reform the military. Unfortunately, since Rodionov is near retirement age -- he may 
not have enough time to finish the massive job. Rodionov is no fool. He is said to be a long-term strategic thinker and is 
well-versed on Russian security issues. A purge of the Army's top ranks is said to be likely and at the top of Rodionov's 
list.<br>
<br>
He has a smaller military to deal with. Russian forces today are said to number at about 1.5 million troops. By comparison, 
the Soviet Union had 4.25 million troops in 1989. One important question is whether Russia will be able to go from a 
conscript military to an all-volunteer professional operation by the year 2000. There would be some doubt if that could be 
accomplished. Russia is unable to pay its personnel now. What are they going to offer to a potential recruit?<br>
<br>
Rodionov recently gave an interview and said that he would like Russia to have a professional military at about the 
personnel levels that the country has at this time. The armed forces will place special emphasis on nuclear weapons, 
mobility and high-tech equipment. A very good observation Rodionov made was that Russia is no longer a global power. It 
is now a regional power. It's main military doctrine will place emphasis on defense, as he said, &quot;To repel and contain a first 
strike.&quot; Rodionov did not name who he might consider enemies of Russia. Military experts suggest that Russia's main 
defensive concerns lay not with NATO expansion, but with China and its volatile southern border area -- these are the 
areas most likely that can be considered for any future conflict. The Russians, like the Americans and other major powers 
must also concern themselves with &quot;low-intensity conflicts&quot; and &quot;guerilla movements&quot;, which may be the source of terrorist 
attacks and increasing instability in the coming years.<br>
<br>
It may appear that we wish for the old days of the Russian military to return. But that's not true. What is sad, to a certain 
extent, is that an old, respected adversary has shrunken to thelevel that it has. It really is quite shocking. But it is also very 
dangerous. Russia still maintains a very powerful nuclear arsenal. It is still considered to be the one country that could 
destroy the U.S. or any other country with a nuclear strike. Because Russia has weakened its forces to such a dangerous 
level, it increases the prospect that should an enemy push too hard, Moscow would have to resort to nuclear weapons in 
order to prevail. That is very scary and it is very real.</p>

<H2>On Becoming a Techno-Nerd...</H2>
<P>
                  By Clark Staten, EMT-P I/C
<P>


Do you have a computer?  Do you have a mobile phone? A

digital watch?  A pager on your belt?  Do you subscribe to at

least three computer or electronics magazines?  Do you have a

VHF, UHF, CB, or Amateur Band Radio in your car?  Is the

"scanner" always on at your house?  If the answer is yes to a

majority of these questions....you are showing tendencies of

becoming a "Techno-Nerd".
<P>


You undoubtedly just asked yourself; "How can I be Nerd?".

"I played football, I have a wife/girlfriend, I drink

beer, I'm not scared of anything, I have a four-wheel drive

truck...and besides...I walk through walls before breakfast

at work...I can't be ANY KIND of a NERD...Can I ??"
<P>


Your author WAS SURE that I wasn't any kind of "NERD" until

recently.  Then I began to wonder about the about the fact

that I recently refused a date with a pretty blonde, so that

I could work on my computer at home.  I thought a second

longer, and again wondered what I was doing recently,

climbing on the peak of the dangerous roof of my house to

position an scanner antenna so that it was "just-right".

Then, on the way to work, my mobile phone and pager went off

at the same time.  I then had to stop and accept the fact

that it was possible that I had become a "Techno-Nerd".
<P>


It's true. "Techno-Nerds" are creeping into our everyday

lives.  Many of us MAY have even BECOME ONE.  Many of us have

recently begun looking for technological solutions to

problems that previously would have confused and confounded

us....and we are finding them. It truely is becoming an

"information age" and becoming a "Techno-Nerd" (at least to

some extent) is necessary to access the wonders of modern

communication and information systems.
<P>


Your author bought his first home computer (a 80286) about

five years ago, and his second one (A 80386) this year. The

first one languished on my work bench for several months

after being purchased, without being used.  After all, I had

a perfectly good 1970's model Ollivetti typewriter.  I then

bought a "cute" (but, proprietary) word-processor, when the

"writing bug" bit me.  Both of these crude implements had

served me well for several years.  I had written and

published several articles in fine magazines like this one

with them. I didn't need that "new-fangled" machine to

produce an article.  Besides, you had to learn all of those

"Disk Operating System (DOS)" commands and figure out how to

get the machine to do what it was supposed to do.  It seemed

to be... just too much trouble.
<P>
Then it was suggested that I re-write and expand upon an

article that I had written.  I laboriously wrote and re-wrote

the longer and longer piece...until I ran out of space on the

disk for the word processor. I took to typing and "cutting

and pasting" pieces of paper to each other and making

photocopies at the Post Office. Rewriting and rewriting, time

after time; that didn't work well either.  All of the time,

while I toiled with the scissors and glue, the computer sat

on my work bench and mocked me with a simple.... C:\.
<P>


It was then that the startling revelation hit me!  I could

MAKE that computer do this "cutting and pasting" for me.

After all, I had seen a T.V. program on Public Television

that showed people actually controlling the entire North

American Radar Air Defense (NORAD) system with a

computer....it should be able to help me write a story.  I

sat down at the dining room table and began to read the book

on the computer and it's DOS 3.0.  It was terribly

confusing....Megabytes, Hard drives, Floppy drives,

Controllers, Applications, Interrupts, Serial ports, Parallel

ports, and memory to remember.  None of this had anything to

do with writing the story, but now I was compelled to

dominate "the machine".  After all, that's all it

was...wasn't it?  A Machine....
<P>


What was the difference between disk space and memory?   It

seemed that I was always running out of one or the other.

What about communications ? The book said I could "hook-up" a

modem to my computer and "talk" (or type) to others and send

"files" through the telephone lines.  Was that possible? That

I could type an article, send it over the phone, and somebody

else could read it at the other end? The book said it could

be done.  The transformation was beginning.
<P>


Next week at the grocery store, I found a magazine rack with

several computer magazines on it.  The articles looked

interesting and they promised being able to do phenomenal

things with that "bunch of chips, transistors, and wiring"

that sat on my workbench.  I purchased a couple of magazines

and browsed through them while watching television with my

daughter.  Numerous ads promised that their software would do

almost anything that I desired.  There were ads for

accounting packages, word processing (my then current

interest), communications (so that's how you do it...with

software), databases, personal information managers (that

sounded interesting), memory managers, and even "adult

animated software.  Now, we were talking... XXX rated

computer files.
<P>

I then made my first trek to the friendly neighborhood

computer store.  I was like a "kid in a candy store". All of

those programs that I had read about were right there for me

to purchase; including a word processing program.  I read all

of the boxes and scanned all of the features. Many of them

looked to difficult for me.  Then I found just the right one.

(In fact, this article is being written on an upgraded

version of that original program.)  Then for good measure, I

bought several other programs that they had "ON SALE" as

discontinued, or had been opened, or whatever.  I rushed home

and began to "install" my new "wonders".
<P>


Soon my tiny 20 MB hard disk "groaned" under the weight of

numerous utility, communication, graphics, and other

miscellaneous programs that I had acquired.  After finding a

communications program that was almost workable, I discovered

the world of computer communications.  After numerous false-

starts, I was finally... "On-line" and soon downloaded about

a thousand other programs that I didn't need. But, It didn't

matter. I was MAKING the computer work.  And, yes....I did

get the article finished....it eventually became a book.
<P>


By then, I was "hooked".  The computer magazines began to

arrive at my house like clockwork.  Soon additional

advertisements and catalogs began to arrive for electronic

components, radios, software, antennas, and a multitude of

other "Techie" equipment.  Everyday, new and enticing

products were presented in the privacy and comfort of my own

home. Soon, I knew the United Parcel Service man by his first

name.
<P>


Then, it wasn't good enough to go answer the phone....I

either answered it with a handheld portable or let my

answering machine and computer do the talking. Booting up my

computer when I wasn't home would cause by "beeper" to go

off. Then, I HAD to have a car phone...after all, what if I

missed a call.  Besides, it was soon becoming the status

symbol of the late 80's and early 90's.  I began to

understand the differences between UNIX, OS/2 and DOS.  I

began to look down for my pocket pen protector.
<P>


Then it happened......
<P>


I became really crazed, and began to develop a plan to have

my computer answer the phone and share ideas and software

with others. It was called a "Bulletin Board Service (BBS)".

Now... I knew I was gone.  I suddenly had a terrible

inclination to wear white socks, tape my glasses, and carry a

holster and slide rule.  I must be "over the edge"...only

"Techno-Nerds" knew about such things, and I wasn't a

"Techie" or a "Nerd".... was I ?
<P>

The rest of my life seemed complicated, but fairly normal.

However, technology continued to intrude. The last straw

found me at a computer store buying the second computer that

I mentioned earlier. I had drooled over a "386" with extended

memory, as the BBS continued to take over my first computer

love.  It had finally happened....after much technical

discussion about the capabilities of the new system, the

purchase of my second computer was completed. I was thrilled

that I knew as much or more about computers as the salesman

that sold it to me.  It then dawned on me.  I defintely had

become a "Techno-Nerd".
<P>


Now that I have accepted it, the notion is not so bad. I am

now able to accomplish many tasks that I never would have

attempted before. My writing is now (most of the time)

improved by a "spell and grammer checker". I can manipulate

text and numbers to provide me with an effective accounting

and database system. Computer communications have allowed me

access to a wealth of information that helps me in my job and

at home.
<P>


I have discarded many non-productive programs that were of

little use to me. I've learned to use my computer equipment

for the betterment of myself and my family.  My daughter now

uses it for her school work.  My Bulletin Board has grown,

with additional phone lines, and I have made several new

friends while "on-line".  I am now teaching others about the

wonders of computers and enjoying the process. There is so

much that can be learned in the world and the computer allows

me an intelligent and rapid alternative to personal exploration.

I don't think I have really changed.........just grown.
<P>


I guess if somebody wants to call me a "Techno-Nerd"...
.....it's alright with me.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 13:00CDT </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Terrorism; We Can't let The 'Bad Guys' Win</strong></font><strong> </strong><br>
Editorial Opinion - By: Clark Staten, Publisher </p>
<p>Chicago, IL, August 14, 1996 (ENN) -- Terrorism investigations continue in Moriches, NY, Atlanta, GA, Dhahran, Saudi 
Arabia, and in several other spots throughout the world. The ugly specter of terrorism has finally come home to the 
consciousness of America. The facts would suggest that the threat of terrorism is multi-dimensional, both domestic and 
international, and comes from a variety of political and religious tangents. It is a assault on freedom and free nations by 
extremists, insurgents, shadow warriors, and the geo-politically impotent. It is a war of surrogate engagement involving 
attacks by the &quot;have nots&quot; against those they perceive as &quot;haves.&quot; </p>
<p>In order to understand this increasing more dangerous problem, let's briefly examine some of the players on this world 
stage and the motivating factors behind their dissatisfaction and murderous attacks: </p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, terrorism isn't just about the color of a person's skin, their religious beliefs, or their political 
ideology. It's about fanaticism ...extremists who take any reasonable belief to an absurd conclusion and then justify 
abnormal, and often dangerous, behavior in the furtherance of their convoluted beliefs. For example, most members of the 
Islamic faith aren't fanatics, nor violent, nor uncaring, nor do they resemble any of the other negative connotations that have 
been attributed to them. The real problem of Islamic Fundamentalism involves only a very small percentage of zealots, who 
have chosen to undertake violent acts, allegedly in the furtherance of their religion, when in fact, they commit these acts in 
contradiction of their faith. </p>
<p> Terrorism isn't about power in the conventional sense...rather, it may be about perceived powerlessness. It is a 
seemingly illogical response by individuals, groups, and even nation-states who feel minimized and relegated to a 
meaningless or inconsequential position in society. It would appear to be their dysfunctional way of responding to events 
and circumstances dictated by more conventional, mainstream, or majority events and thinking. It can be described as a 
small minority &quot;raging against the machine&quot; of organized religion, politics, government, or general societal norms. Terrorism 
is often spawned in overt repression, a lack of individual freedoms, or in an environment that lacks respect for minority 
viewpoints and individuals. </p>
<p>There would also appear to be strong elements of greed, avarice, and &quot;coveting of thy neighbors possessions&quot; in much 
of terrorism that is occurring today. In many recent low-intensity conflicts, the motivating factors have involved a problem 
as old as society itself. This geo-political/economic struggle has been occurring since the first caveman killed his neighbor in 
order to inhabit a &quot;better&quot; cave. The age-old story is one of the use of violence to obtain control of more and better 
possessions, be they a flock of sheep, natural resources, a country, or an entire region. </p>
<p>Finally, there are the anarchists, the sociopathic, and psychologically imbalanced, who are so angry and disillusioned 
with society and their own failures that they believe that the only solution is the complete destruction of all around them. 
They are the most unpredictable and difficult to combat, because they do not adhere to normal behavioral patterns or 
rationality. These are the mass murderers and suicide bombers of the world, people who attack school yards full of 
children with an AK-47 and blow up senior citizen centers, all in the name of whatever cause they have chosen. They will 
commit any and every atrocity in an attempt to cause fear and attain some sense of power. </p>
<p>Having reviewed a few of the motivations and circumstances relating to terrorism, the obvious question comes to mind. 
How do we combat this scourge and those that would perpetrate this viciousness on society? </p>
<p>First, and foremost, giving in to feelings of desperation and fear plays into the hands of terrorists. That is one of their 
primary objectives...to propagate mistrust of public agencies, institutions, religions, governments, and societal norms. They 
want to create an atmosphere that suggests that citizens can't be protected and provided for by existing governmental 
structures. They want unmitigated fear to undermine our confidence in those we elect or pay to serve and protect us. </p>
<p>Second, we should be aware that terrorists will use propaganda, misinformation, threats, intimidation, manipulation of 
the press, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and every other possible means to discredit the government and institutions 
of America and her allies. We must, collectively, therefore, maintain our belief in both our government and way of life. It is 
this unshakable belief in the &quot;goodness&quot; of our representative system and its inherent freedom that is our greatest strength. </p>
<p>Thirdly, one of the greatest hopes of terrorists is that a government will overreact to threats of terrorism or actual 
terrorist acts, and implement repressive and draconian measures in an attempt to thwart the threat. They are hopeful that 
government officials will diminish individual freedoms, conduct extensive surveillance campaigns, restrict the press and free 
speech, monitor and outlaw peaceful public gatherings, and eventually fight &quot;on the streets&quot; with demonstrators and 
defenders of these liberties. The &quot;bad guys&quot; know that historically such tactics often prompt further dissension and 
eventually cause chaos and an attempted overthrow of any government that undertakes &quot;heavy-handed&quot; and restrictive 
measures. Terrorists would like nothing better...they thrive on this chaos, mistrust, fear, and hatred. </p>
<p>Americans can combat this ploy by working to retain as many of the individual freedoms, provided in the U. S. 
Constitution, as are practically possible. It must be understood by all that our 200 year-old system of individual freedoms is 
our greatest strength and our greatest vulnerability. Any changes to these fundamental rights and privileges, afforded to 
citizens, should only be made with the understanding and concurrence of the governed. While certain changes may need to 
be made to minimize any threat to the security of the nation, it certainly should not be done at the expense of the personal 
freedoms that make this country worth defending. To do so, would mean that the terrorists have won...we can not let that 
happen. </p>

<P>
<H2>"Information Terrorist" Threatens Boston Herald; Investigation Ensues</H2>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent
<P>

Chicago, IL, March 6, 1996 (ENN) --The Boston Herald is under
attack.  According to the United Press International (UPI), a
hacker has threatened both the Boston Herald newspaper and
several Internet Service providers in the Boston area. According
to Jason Hatch, the system administrator of BerkshireNet in
Boston, the hacker, who uses the on-line name of "u4ea", has
threatened to "crash computer systems all over Boston."
<P>

The hacker in question has been called an "information
terrorist" by at least one computer security analyst familiar
with "u4ea's" exploits during the past year.  In an exclusive
interview with ENN, the analyst who prefers to remain anonymous,
said that the hacker has gained access to the root directories
and destroyed the file structures of machines at George Mason
University, the University of Arkansas, at a site in the
Netherlands, and possibly some U.S. government sites. It is
estimated that "u4ea" may have covertly entered more than 100
separate systems in the past year.
<P>

"u4ea", who is also known as "el8ite", "eliteone", "el8", and
"B1ff" in e-mail and on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels has
also allegedly been spreading "neo-nazi" and "white supremacist"
materials. He may be operating from Canada, and is believed to
be from 20-27 years old. Experts say that he may also be
connected with a university in some way.  Intelligence sources
tell ENN that he has been using a U.S. government system at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as at
least one jumping off point for his destructive work and racist
comments. 
<P>

Information from the "hacker community" indicates that "u4ea" is
a "phone phreaker" as well as a computer hacker and that he
often uses 800 numbers and other telephone switching and
electronic misdirection techniques to confuse those that would
search for him. He is known to use "password sniffers" and a
"spoof scheme" which allows him to appear to be a user other
than himself during illegal entries and e-mail exchanges. He is
also known to argue with and harass those that would disagree
with him.  Apparently he is not well liked by other "hackers"and
some even say that they would like to see him apprehended. And
lastly, according to one well respected researcher, "he is
damned dangerous...technically better than Kevin Mitnick...and
far more malicious."
<P>

To date, it does not appear that "u4ea" is motivated by either
money or specific ideological intent. At least one observer has
called him "manic-depressive" and "inconsistent in his
behavior." Although other motives are possible, including
allegations involving racist beliefs, one analyst told ENN that
he may be most motivated by publicity and a desire for
notoriety, particularly among the "hacker community". Some say
that what he really wants is "to be more famous than Kevin
Mitnick", who was recently arrested and imprisoned for breaking
into a number of computers.
<P>

In one of his most recent messages, "u4ea" allegedly taunted the
Federal Bureau of Investigation by saying that they had a
"better chance of finding Elvis (Presley) than the Mighty
u4ea...the FBI can't touch me."  Although the FBI will not
officially comment on what they say is an on-going
investigation, one agent told ENN that "e4ea" would be given the
"proper amount of attention...maybe in such a way that he won't
be pleased." 
<P>

Computer security investigators say that "u4ea" has also made
threats against those who would try to expose him, even to point
of threatening the family of a BerkshireNet employee, if they
went to the media with information about him.  Further, they
say, it is entirely possible that "u4ea" is capable of carrying
out these threats. One computer security analyst went so far as
to warn ENN that we or our computers could be "at serious risk"
for simply reporting this story.
<P> 

According to the UPI and Jason Hatch, "u4ea" signed off with a
cryptic message that "you have yet to see true electronic
terrorism...this is a promise."  From all the information
gathered so far, it would appear that this threat should be
taken seriously.
<P>
<HR>
(Late report: 03/11/96 - According to a reliable source at NYPD, an investigation has been begun in the New York City area regarding "u4ea".  Allegedly, someone using administrator Jason Hatch's (see above) e-mail account has been sending "anti-jewish" threats and other "white supremacist" materials to NYC residents in the past few days. An independent investigation is reportedly now underway by the NYPD Computer Crimes section.)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 12:30CST-03/11/96
<P>
<H2>ERRI Preliminary Report; Virtual Disaster Networks</H2>
By: Clark Staten, ERRI CEO</center>
<P>

Chicago, IL, March 11, 1996 --A little over one year ago, the
Emergency Response & Research Institute undertook an exploratory
examination of emergency service computer networks. This study
had a particular emphasis in regard to the use of networks and
the Internet, as it applies to disaster preparedness and
response situations. The results of this preliminary study are
outlined below.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Hypothesis:</B>
<P>
It is proposed that private and government computer networks and
the Internet could be used to exchange planning information,
transfer working information during disasters, coordinate mutual
aid, and obtain needed personnel and resources during a large
scale incident. Further, that this networking could begin with
one local system and grow proportionately to the size of any
disaster....up to and including a national or international
response.  By utilizing state of the art computer equipment and
networking tools, it is believed that better cooperation and
coordination can be achieved and lives saved. 
<P>
<HR> 
<B>Methodology:</B>
<P>
The study was begun by announcing it's intent and purpose
through a number of channels, including;
<P>

 Internet News Groups
<BR> 

 Commercial Computer Services (ie.Compuserve, etc) 
<BR>

 Emergency magazines and periodicals 
<BR>

 Via e-mail and U.S. Mail, to interested individuals and groups
<BR>

Comments, questions, suggestions and analysis of a concept
called a "virtual disaster network" were solicited from all
interested parties.
<P>
Next, a survey of currently available computer resources was
done via the Internet. Specifically related servers and services
were identified and cataloged in regard to their purpose and
utility, and potential for use in a larger network effort. Both
data/information collection sites and dissemination sites were
both identified during the course of this survey. A number of
individuals contributed a variety of information about different
sites and some pertinent data about the capabilities of the
personnel operating them.
<P>

A public attempt was made to gain an understanding of the
computer and networking capabilities of a number of large and
small emergency agencies, admittedly without much success.
Voluntary participation in such a survey didn't appear to be
viable, due to an apparent reluctance on the part of many public
agencies to participate. It is believed that many systems have
had some components that could allow interactively, but that
they have not voluntarily made such information public.  It is
also believed that some agencies may also have "links" with some
other agencies. 
<P>
<HR> 
<B>Preliminary Findings</B>
<P>
 Anecdotal reports suggest that the degree of computerization
varies greatly across the country and that little or no
standardization of equipment exists either within or between
agencies. Many agency communications centers contain only
proprietary hardware and software, designed to meet individual
system needs...with little consideration of any possibility of
inter-operability.
<P>
With the exception of the NCIC (National Crime Information
Center) and some other confidential/secure law enforcement
networks, little interactively presently exists. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can activate UHF, VHF, and
satellite radio nets and a limited number of portable computer
links to it's headquarters, in times of specific need.  No other
formal (government sponsored) Fire, EMS, or disaster networks
were identified that regularly facilitate an exchange of
intelligence, trends, solutions, or planning efforts between
systems.
<P>

 The a majority of primary links that currently exist between
differing emergency systems are informal and personal, rather
than formal or organizational. Very little vital information is
currently being shared between systems, except by individual
"computer literate" members of each department. It would appear
that very few emergency agencies currently have active Internet
connections, even on a dial-up basis. A better national survey
of these assets must be made before additional analysis can be
undertaken.
<P>

 Few, if any, emergency agencies have undertaken any dedicated
computer communication linkage between themselves and other
nearby (mutual aid) systems.  This deficit is particularly
evident in regard to relationships between differing kinds of
agencies. (i.e. few Fire/EMS agencies have any computer linkage
to any Police Agency) Fewer than twenty (20) systems were
identified, nation-wide, that had formal connections with other
agencies. 
<P>
 A primary consideration in most disaster situations is that
communications. Or rather, a primary disaster difficulty is
communicating on already overwhelmed radio, telephone, or
cellular communications frequencies. The problem is compounded
when an emergency manager begins to attempt to communicate
between agencies on differing frequencies and interact and
coordinate essential and simultaneous actions of field
personnel. It is believed that computer linkages, be they
permanent or virtual, may be a major answer to those problems,
so frequently encountered in large scale incidents.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
Based on the preliminary data that we have acquired in the past
year, it is respectfully suggested that a demonstration grant or
other major funding would be necessary to provide "seed-money"
for a test of this concept. Much of the money would be used for
establishing high through-put TCP/IP connections and the
connecting of Internet dedicated landlines in a specific area.
After "wiring" multiple agencies, at least one dedicated server
would be required for the purposes of storing and dissemination
of information, and real time communications.
<P>

On any system, in its simplest form, e-mail could be utilized
for the sharing of intelligence and planning information, and
the storing of reference documents. A World-Wide-Website could
also be added to the server to make accessing of pertinent
documents easy for participants. As the number of agencies
increased, the size of a disaster dictated, or the complexity of
operations increased, additional servers could be brought
on-line in an increasingly larger area. "Live data connections"
could be made with other dispatch centers and maintained for the
duration of an emergency.
<P>

Dispatch information, mutual aid requests, and requests for
logistics and materials would be sent by computer, rather than
phone or radio. As previously mentioned, laptop computers with
cellular modems, or dedicated UHF or 800Mhz data frequencies
could be used from the scene to transmit updates and make
requests. The utility of using dedicated radio frequencies for
data communications and use of the Internet has been
demonstrated by the U.S. Navy and other military organizations.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>

 In light of our preliminary data and review of this concept, we
believe that the idea of a "Virtual Disaster Network" is a most
viable alternative to the current state of the art in disaster
management. Additionally, this idea can be begun within
individual systems and between local agencies without major
costs, aside from the "hardware and connections necessary to
implement these new data communications channels. There are,
undoubtedly, some technical issues to be resolved, but none that
appear insurmountable. 
<P>
The primary difficulty that we anticipate in the implementation
of this idea involves overcoming a resistance on the part of
emergency service and communications managers to implement the
aforementioned data communications links. Some reluctance may
also be encountered within dispatch centers, as additional
computer skills and duties are required of dispatchers. Both
groups are familiar with and very oriented to the instantaneous
flow of information provided by voice/radio communications. A
period of re-learning may be necessary to facilitate computer
data exchanges, rather than simple voice transmissions.
<P>
 The Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI) has
committed itself to a continuing examination of this concept,
and a refinement of the applications, connections, and content
hereto. We would welcome comments, questions, suggestions, and
public comment in regard to the idea of further development of a
"Virtual Disaster Network". Our ultimate objective would be to
actually design and implement at least one working network of
smaller agencies, which could be replicated and installed at any
number of server sites throughout the country.  It could then
become an easy task to link servers sites into a national
network or even an international network of emergency and
disaster organizations.
<P>
<HR>
(Ed. note: It should be noted that all research funding for this project,
to date, has been privately provided by ERRI and it's
subsidiary, the EmergencyNet News Service.  It would appear that
the only feasible way to further test the utility and
capabilities of this concept would be to obtain outside funding
and technical support.  ERRI would welcome offers of sponsorship
or other support in order to continue these efforts.)

<H2>"Virtual Disaster Network" Study Begins</H2>
<P>

Chicago, IL, November 21 --The Chicago-based, Emergency Response & Research Institute(ERRI), today announced the formulation of an internal task-force to study a concept that could have far-reaching implications in disaster management.  The idea involves the use of a "virtual" computer network that could be immediately activated in the event of a catastrophic natural or man-made disaster.
<P>  
The size of the network could be determined by the size of the disaster.  It would utilize the Internet, federal government resources, private leased lines, and those contained within individual emergency agencies to form a "virtual net".  This network could formed at the time of the disaster, and grow in proportion to the needs of the locality affected by the emergency event. At the conclusion of the incident, the network could be quickly dismantled, until needed again.
<P>
It is anticipated that this idea could help to assist in obtaining supplies,emergency personnel, and equipment needed by a local area, that is "overwhelmed" by the magnitude of any disaster. Often, telephone and radio circuits quickly become congested and/or disrupted by disasters, while computer links may remain intact.  Additionally, the use of the Internet could allow rapid transmission of data to a variety of national and even international sites on a timely basis.  Requests for specific needs could be routed to a national database of resources, which could then assist in the dispatch of those supplies/equipment/personnel to the scene of a disaster.

<P>
Clark Staten, Executive Director of ERRI, said that the concept could be put in place within the United States at its onset, and then gradually expanded it to allow international cooperation and coordination of emergency events.  He said that, if such a network were in place, that appropriate aid could have been rushed to the Kobe earthquake within hours of the devastating disaster. Additionally, he said that ERRI is unaware of any sort of easily accessable "resource databank" that currently catalogs the location, qualifications, and availability of specialized rescue personnel and resources that might be needed in a major disaster.
<P>
Staten concluded by saying that ERRI would begin the planning process for such a project, and undertake funding of some of the preliminary research to assess the feasibility of the idea, but that external funding and support would become necessary to carry the concept to complete implementation.  Comments, questions, and suggestions about this study are welcomed.

Number G-10
<HR>

<B>PROBLEM: </B>    Word macro viruses are no longer an isolated threat, but they are     a significant hazard to the information on a computer.
<P>
<B>PLATFORM:</B>    Any platform that can run Microsoft Word 6.0 or later:
             Windows 3.1, WFW 3.11, Win 95, Windows NT, and Macintosh.
<P>
<HR>

<B>DAMAGE: </B>     Files can be deleted and may not be recoverable.
<P>
<B>SOLUTION:</B>    Scan all new Word documents before opening them in the same way     
             that you now scan all executable files before running them.        
             Install version 2 of the Microsoft macro virus detection 
             tool.
<P>
<HR>

<B>VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:</B>  The vulnerability of systems to this type of virus is high,
   because most users are not in the habit of scanning documents.
               Documents are much more mobile than executable files in an
               organization, passingfrom machine to machine as different
               people write or edit them.

       <B> CRITICAL</B> Information Concerning Winword Macro Viruses
<P>

CIAC has obtained information about six macro viruses currently in the 
wild, five of which infect Microsoft Word 6.0 documents, and one that infects 
an Excel worksheet. Two of these viruses are damaging. This bulletin 
describes these viruses:

<H3>What Are Macro Viruses?</H3>
- -----------------------
<P>

A macro virus is a piece of self-replicating code written in an
application's macro language. Many applications have macro capabilities
such as the automatic playback of keystrokes available in early 
versions of Lotus 1-2-3. The distinguishing factor which makes it possible to
create a virus with a macro is the existence of auto-execute macros in
the language. An auto-execute macro is one which is executed in 
response to some event and not in response to an explicit user command. Common
auto-execute events are opening a file, closing a file, and starting an
application. Once a macro is running, it can copy itself to other
documents, delete files, and create general havoc in a person's system.
These things occur without the user explicitly running the macro.
<P>

In Microsoft Word there are three types of hazardous, auto-executing
macros: auto-execute macros, auto-macros, and macros with command 
names. There is one auto-execute macro in Word named AutoExec. If a macro 
named AutoExec is in the "normal.dot" template or in a global template stored
in Word's startup directory, it is executed whenever Word is started.
The only way to disable the execution of AutoExec is to insert the flag
/m in the command line used to start Word.
<P>

The second type of dangerous macros are auto-macros.
<BR>

     Name         Runs when you
<BR>
     ------------------------------------
<BR>
     AutoNew      create a new document.
<BR>
     AutoOpen     open a document.
<BR>
     AutoClose    close a document.
<BR>
     AutoExit     quit Word.
<P>

The auto-macros can be disabled by executing the Word.Basic command
"DisableAutoMacros" in a macro. Note that the example in Word's online
help of executing this command in the command line when starting Word
does not work. The command must be executed in a macro. Auto-macros are
also disabled by holding down the shift key while opening a document.
<P>

The third type of dangerous macros are those named for an existing Word
command. If a macro in the global macro file or in an attached, active
template has the name of an existing Word command, the macro command
replaces the Word command. For example, if you create a macro named
FileSave in the "normal.dot" template, that macro is executed whenever
you choose the Save command on the File menu. There is no way to 
disable this feature.
<P>

Macro viruses spread by having one or more auto-execute macros in a
document. By opening or closing the document or using a replaced
command, you activate the virus macro. As soon as the macro is
activated, it copies itself and any other macros it needs to the global
macro file "normal.dot". After they are stored in normal.dot they are
available in all opened documents.
<P>

At this point, the macro viruses try to spread themselves to other
documents, usually by including an AutoClose macro that attaches the
virus macros to the document and saves it. The macro viruses that cause
damage contain a trigger that starts the damage routines and those
routines do the actual damage. The trigger is some event that the virus
writer has programmed his virus to watch for such as a date or the
number of days since the infection occurred.
<P>

An important point to make here is that Word documents (.DOC files) can
not contain macros, only Word templates (.DOT files) can contain 
macros. However, it is a relatively simple task to mask a template as a 
document by changing the file name extension from .DOT to .DOC.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>DMV (Word) Macro Virus</H4>
- ----------------------
<P>

The DMV (Demonstration Macro Virus) virus was originally described in
the paper "Document Macro Viruses" by Joel McNamara who conveniently
infected the document containing the paper with the virus so the reader
could experience it first hand. The virus itself is simply an example 
of how such a virus could be implemented and does not attempt to hide at
all. The virus is not harmful and is relatively simple to remove using
the Tools Macro command in Microsoft Word (See below). The virus
installs a single macro named AutoClose onto the "normal.dot" global
macro file. The AutoClose macro infects all new documents when they are
closed. The macro does no damage other than to spread itself. When the
macro runs, it displays numerous dialog boxes telling you what it is
doing, making it obvious if you are infected.
<P>


<H4>DMV (Excel) Macro Virus</H4>
-----------------------
<P>

The Excel version of the DMV macro virus works the same as the Word
version but uses the Visual Basic for Applications language built into
Excel. The Excel document contains a macro sheet which implements an
AutoClose macro. When you close the file, the macro is activated and
copies itself to Excel's global macro file. When other worksheets are
closed, the macro attaches itself to them as well.
<P>


<H4>Concept (Prank) Macro Virus</H4>
- ---------------------------
<P>

The Concept macro (alias Prank) is similar to the DMV macro virus in
that it is a demonstration that a macro virus can be created. A 
document infected with the Concept virus contains the macros:
<P>

          AAAZAO     AutoOpen
<BR>
          AAAZFS     Payload
<P>

When an infected file is opened, the AutoOpen macro is run and copies
the virus files to the global macro file. During the copying process it
changes the name of AAAZFS to FileSaveAs. Whenever a document is saved,
the FileSaveAs command copies the virus macros into it and saves it. 
The AAAZAO macro becomes the AutoOpen macro on the saved document file. The
Payload macro does nothing. The first time the macro runs a dialog box
appears with the single digit "1" contained in it.
<P>


<H4>Nuclear Macro Virus</H4>
- -------------------
<P>

A document infected with the Nuclear macro virus contains nine macros:
<P>

          AutoExec        AutoOpen        DropSuriv
<BR>
          FileExit        FilePrint       FilePrintDefault
<BR>
          FileSaveAs      InsertPayload   Payload
<P>

All of these are copied to the global macro file when an infected
document is opened. When any document is saved, the virus copies all 
the macros onto it and saves it. Printing a document during the last 5
seconds of any minute causes the following text to appear at the top of
the printed page:
<P>

"And finally I would like to say:"
<BR>

"STOP ALL FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC!"
<P>

After April 5th it attempts to delete your system files but fails
because of a bug in the virus. The virus also attempts to infect a
system with the Suriv binary virus, but fails again because of a bug.
<P>


<H4>Colors Macro Virus</H4>
------------------
<P>

A document infected with the Colors virus contains the following eight
macros:
<P>

          AutoClose        AutoExec        AutoOpen
<BR>
          FileExit         FileNew         FileSave
<BR>
          FileSaveAs       ToolsMacro
<P>

The virus changes many of the menu items to make it difficult to 
delete. For example, it effectively removes the Tools Macros command so you
can't list or delete the macros in a program with that command.
<P>

After being accessed 300 times, Colors activates and randomly changes
the system colors in the win.ini file making the screen look strange.
<P>


<H4>FormatC Macro Virus</H4>
-------------------
<P>

The FormatC macro virus consists of a single macro named AutoOpen.
Opening an infected document causes this macro to run and the macro
copies itself to the global macro file. If the viruses payload is
activated, it attempts to format the C: drive.
<P>

<B>WARNING:</B> the format command in most modern versions of DOS can be
reversed. If this virus strikes, get some knowledgeable help before
doing anything to your system. Don't do anything that might write
something on the hard drive until you get knowledgeable help. You may
need only boot from a floppy and run unformat to recover the whole
drive. What you do depends on what utility programs (Norton Utilities,
PCTools, and so forth) you have installed on your system.
<P>


<H4>Wordmacro/Hot</H4>
----------------
<P>

A new Word macro virus just appeared in the wild named Wordmacro/Hot 
and it is destructive. The Wordmacro/Hot virus attaches itself like the
others, adding macros to documents and to the "normal.dot" global macro
file. New documents are infected when they are saved. After about 14
days, the virus deletes the contents of any document as you open it and
does a save which effectively wipes out the document. It is unlikely
that you will be able to recover the contents of a file deleted in this
way unless you have Make Backup turned on. Don't start opening the
backup copies before cleaning the virus, because it will clear the
contents of every document you open while it is active.
<P>

An infected document contains the following macros:
<P>

   AutoOpen     DrawBringInFrOut     InsertPBreak     ToolsRepaginat
<P>

When the virus infects the Word program, these macros are copied to
"normal.dot" and renamed in the same order to:
<P>

   StartOfDoc   AutoOpen             InsertPageBreak  FileSave
<P>

The virus adds the item: "OLHot=nnnnn" to the winword.ini file where
nnnnn is a date 14 days in the future. The virus uses this date to
determine when it is going to trigger. The virus also checks for the
existence of the file: "c:\dos\ega5.cpi" and does not infect a machine
if the file exists. This was apparently a feature to protect the virus
writer.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Detecting A Macro Virus</H4>
-----------------------
<P>

Document files must now be treated in the same manner as executables in
terms of virus protection. If you don't know where a Word document has
been, scan it before opening it with Word. Most anti-virus scanners 
have been modified to detect macro viruses in Word documents, so use those
scanners to check any new documents that have been copied onto your
machine. For example, version 2.21 of the shareware version of F-Prot
detects all but the FormatC and Hot viruses.
<P>

Microsoft has released a new version of its macro virus protection
program (see below) that checks all Word documents as you open them and
tells you if they contain a macro or not. It can only detect the 
Concept virus by name, but any document with a macro attached should be
considered suspect.
<P>

You can use the Organizer dialog box (see below) to check for strange
macros attached to your documents. The Organizer can open a document in
the background (without running any attached macros) and let you see
what macros are attached to it. You can also use it to delete macros
from a document.
<P>

You can watch for virus activity when opening or saving a document, but
it is generally preferable to detect a virus before it gets installed.
If you have already opened a document that suspect has a virus, use the
Tools Macro command to see a list of the macros attached to Word. If 
you can't open the Macro dialog box, try the Organizer dialog box instead.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Protecting A System From Macro Viruses</H4>
----------------------------------
<P>

A feature of Microsoft's products is that automatic execution of auto-
macros and auto-execute macros is enabled by default. In fact, it is
difficult to turn off. This is a problem in protecting against macro
viruses.
<P>

Currently, the best protection is to install Microsoft's macro virus
protection template. The template is available directly from 
Microsoft's web site or from the CIAC archive. A description of the scanner is
available at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/mvtools/mvtools2.htm">Click here to go to Microsoft Tools</A>
<BR>http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/mvtool/mvtool2.htm
<P>

and the scanner itself is available at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/mvtools/mvtool20.exe">Get the scanner itself</A>
<BR>
http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/
              msword/download/mvtool/mvtool20.exe
<P>

If you don't find these files at microsoft.com, it could be that the
scanner has been revised again. In that case, connect to:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Go to the Microsoft Website</A>
<BR>
http://www.microsoft.com
<P>
and use the search command to search for "macro virus".
<P>

To install the macro virus protection, simply open the template file
with Word and follow the instructions. The macros automatically install
themselves in your global macro file (just like the virus). A protected
version of Word should have the following four macros are attached to
the "normal.dot" file:
<P>

        AutoExit     FileOpen     InstVer    ShellOpen
<P>

FileOpen calls ShellOpen whenever a document is opened. ShellOpen 
checks each newly opened document to see if it has any macros attached. If
there are macros in the document that is being opened, ShellOpen
displays a dialog box giving you the choice to open the document 
anyway, remove the macros and open it, or cancel the open command.
<P>

If, for some reason, you can't use Microsoft's protection macro, you 
can disable auto-macros. 
<BR>You have three options:
<P>

1. Disable the auto-macros.
<BR>
2. Disable the auto-macros and the auto-execute macro.
<BR>
3. Hold down Shift whenever you open a file to disable the AutoOpen
   macro.
<P>

To disable auto-macros, create the following macro named AutoExec in 
the global macro file (normal.dot).
<P>

MAIN
<BR>
   DisableAutoMacros 1
<BR>
   MsgBox "Auto-macros are disabled."
<BR>
End Sub
<P>

All auto-macros are disabled but a virus could still infect a system if
it is activated by a command that replaces a normal command.
<P>

To disable auto-macros and the auto-execute macro, create the following
macro in the global macro file (normal.dot) and name it
"DisableMyAutoMacros".
<P>

MAIN
<BR>
   DisableAutoMacros 1
<BR>
   MsgBox "Auto-macros are disabled."
<BR>
End Sub
<P>

In the Program Manager or the Explorer in Windows 95, select the Word
icon and choose the Properties command on the File menu. Add the
following switch to the command line for Word.
<P>

/mDisableMyAutoMacros
<P>

This command disables the AutoExec macro and runs the
DisableMyAutoMacros procedure when Word starts up. Again, this does not
disable macros with command names from replacing the commands. This 
also only works if you start Word by double clicking on the Word icon. If 
you start Word by double clicking on a document, it will not see the switch
and will not run the DisableMyAutoMacros procedure.
<P>

When you hold down the Shift key while opening or double clicking a
document, the AutoOpen macro is prevented from running. Other auto-
macros may still run so you must check for a virus before doing 
anything else.
<P>

<B>WARNING:</B> The three methods of disabling auto-macros and the 
auto-execute macro do not fully protect you from a virus. While they prevent the
auto-execute and auto-macro commands from running, they do not prevent
any macros named the same as commands from replacing those commands. 
Any virus that uses replaced commands to initiate an infection will not be
stopped. Only an external scanner or the Microsoft template will detect
a document containing macros before it is opened.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>Removing Macro Viruses</H4>
----------------------
<P>

If you have an anti-virus scanner which detects and removes a macro
virus, use it instead of trying to do it by hand. The scanner will
generally do the job and is much easier than removing the virus by 
hand.
<P>

If you have Microsoft's virus macro protection installed, it will give
you the option to remove any attached macros when you open the 
document. If you save the document with the same name, it will overwrite the
infected document.
<P>

If you don't have a scanner or the protection macro, you can use the
Organizer to find and remove macro viruses without infecting your
system. The first step is to start Word and open the Organizer dialog
box. There are two ways to open the Organizer: 
<P>
1. use the Tools Macro command and press the Organizer button; 
<P>
2. use the File Templates command and press the Organizer button. 
<BR>In the Organizer dialog box
click the macros tab,
<BR> click the Open File button, 
<BR>select the infected
document and click OK. 
<BR>Back in the Organizer dialog box, select all the
macros listed in the file and click the Delete button to remove them.
<BR>
Click the Close File button to close and save the file. The file can 
now be opened normally.
<P>

If you have just infected yourself by opening an infected document,
don't close the document or quit Word. If you close the infected file 
or quit Word, you run the risk of running another of the auto-execute
macros. See if you can get to the Organizer dialog box. Once in the
Organizer you can delete the virus macros from the infected document 
and from the "normal.dot" file. Save those files, quit Word and restart it.
You can then use the Organizer to check other documents for a virus
infection.
<P>

If you can't get to the Organizer, quit Word without saving anything,
find the "normal.dot" file and delete it. When you restart Word, it 
will create a new, empty "normal.dot" file. Note that you will also lose any
custom styles which were stored in the "normal.dot" file and will have
to redefine them.
<P>
<HR>


<H3>On The Macintosh</H3>
----------------
<P>

These macro viruses will run under Word 6 on the Macintosh, but most of
the file access capability used by the viruses to damage a system will
not work well. This is because file naming conventions on the Macintosh
are different from those on other systems. Since the damaging parts of
the viruses are written with a DOS-based file system in mind, it is
unlikely that they will work.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Macro Viruses and E-Mail Messages</H4>
--------------------------------
<P>

Many rumors have been circulated around the network about there being 
an e-mail message that destroys your system when you read it (Good Times).
This can not happen with the current batch of mail readers. While an
infected document could be attached to an e-mail message and would be
downloaded to your disk when you read the attached message, it will not
automatically be executed. As long as it has not been executed or read,
it can not infect your system with a virus. At this point, you should
scan it to make sure it is not infected.
<P>
<HR>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>
---------------------------
<P>

Macro viruses are here to stay and we must deal with them in the same
manner that we have had to deal with other viruses. If you don't know
where a file has been, don't use it in your computer until you scan it.
That is, if it is an executable, don't run it; if it is a document,
don't open it. It does not matter how you obtained the file, whether it
is a download from a BBS or web site, an attachment to an e-mail
message, or a shrink-wrapped package from a commercial developer, scan
them all. Even blank, preformatted disks are occasionally showing up
with viruses.
<P>

The second thing to do is to install the Microsoft macro virus
protection template to warn you if a document contains macros before 
you open it.
<P>

Keep in mind that while Microsoft products are being targeted by these
viruses, they are not the only products which have a macro capability
which could be exploited. Hopefully, in the next release of software
programs which include extensive macro capabilities, there will be an
easy way to disable macro execution and warn the user if documents
contain macros. This change will make the problem of macro viruses go
away very quickly.
