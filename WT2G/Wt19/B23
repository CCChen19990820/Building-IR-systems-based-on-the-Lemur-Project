<H2>Self-Corrections Welcome</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 2
<P>











Last week, the <I>New York Times</I> celebrated its one-hundredth anniversary under its current regime. To get it said, yet again: It is the greatest news institution in the history of the world, in the absence of which many of us would stumble about as if without arms or legs.
<P>
A truly fine aspect of the <i>Times</i> is its ever so careful writing into the record of corrections of its own bad moments. These, unhappily, are very bad moments. In the Thirties, Walter Duranty told the world that there was nothing whatever to worry about, never mind those reports about the starvation of the Kulaks by Josef Stalin. Abundant coverage, in later years, was given to those and other crimes of Stalin.
<P>
Two weeks ago, appropriately on its one-hundredth birthday, the <i>Times</I> gave us two self-corrections, in the Book Review and in the articles section. In the Book Review a remarkable review by Terry Teachout of Joan Mellen's biography, <I>Hellman and Hammett: The Legendary Passion of Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett</I>. Mr. Teachout is devastating in his exploration of Miss Hellman's lifelong infatuation with Soviet Communism.
<P>
Lillian Hellman's review of her own political career had been published in 1976, called <I>Scoundrel Time</I>. It was hailed on the front page of the <I>Times</I> Book Review as a work comparable to those of Thoreau and Emerson. Similar notice of it was taken in the <I>Washington Post</I>, and the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>. Only Hilton Kramer, then an art critic at the <I>Times</I>, demurred. Miss Hellman had presented herself as the soul of courage and resolution, the Joan of Arc of the McCarthy era. What she was was a lovesick child of Josef Stalin and an unpleasant human being.
<P>
The next week, in its Sunday magazine, the <I>Times</I> published photographs taken during the reign of Mao in China (by Li Zhen Sheng). They are mostly pictures of people being shot and tortured. The text is by Edward Gargan, Hong Kong bureau chief of the <I>Times</I>, who records that ``more than 50 million people starved to death in the vast famine [Mao] visited on his country in 1960 and 1961,'' and that was five years before the Cultural Revolution - ``ten years of madness, forced labor, exile, countless suicides, and millions of killings.''
<P>
We know all that, don't we? ``Throughout,'' the <I>Times</I>'s Mr. Gargan goes on, ``Mao was labeled a 'genius' for the cataclysm wrought in his name. And wave after wave of credulous American Sinologists and journalists wrote infatuated accounts of the Cultural Revolution, celebrating their perception of China's transformation.''
<P>
Who was the most celebrated figure in the <I>New York Times</I>'s journalistic hierarchy? Before, during, and after the Cultural Revolution? James Reston, of course. In 1971, writing from Tokyo after a visit to China (where his appendix was removed), Reston wrote, ``I'm a Scotch Calvinist. I believe in redemption of the human spirit and the improvement of man. Maybe it's because I believe that or I want to believe it that I was struck by the tremendous effort to bring out what is best in man, what makes them good, what makes them cooperate with one another and be considerate and not beastly to one another. They are trying that.''
<P>
Reston's eulogy disintegrated in the memory after such as Max Frankel and Abe Rosenthal descended on China. But it was the capstone of the pro-Mao sentiment in the <I>Times</I>, even as Herbert Matthews's tribute in 1961 was the high-water mark of the <I>Times</I>'s enthusiasm for Fidel Castro.
<P>
The <I>Times</I>'s historical corrections are done without acts of contrition. Rather like the thief who sends the money back in an anonymous package. Institutions have a difficult time apologizing for themselves. Vatican II was exceptional in this respect, when the Pope apologized for past acts of hostility to the Jews.
<P>
But it is different where individuals, not institutions, are the critical players. It is a pity that, before he died, Reston did not take any of a thousand opportunities to remark his own delusions. Garry Wills is very much alive and very quick to notice other people's moral/political indiscretions, in fact, sometimes quicker than the indiscretions. In his 34-page introduction he treated Lillian Hellman's book like a modern <I>Areopagitica</I>. Garry Wills's reading of history, as of 1977: ``A newly aggressive Truman had launched the Cold War in the spring of 1947, with his plan to 'rescue' Greece and Turkey . . . We had still a world to save, with just those plans -- from NATO to the Korean War.'' At the time, I observed, in <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B>, that Wills's introduction to Hellman might have been written in the Lenin Institute. Perhaps on his one-hundredth birthday, Garry Wills will show the courage of the <I>New York Times</I>.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>

Okay, we all know cigarettes are addictive. I mean, Tip smoked up a storm for years, and when she quit, well, she kind of got on the old replace-the-cigarette-with-a-Hostess-Ho-Ho train. At a certain point, I was thinking about a firmly worded offer: either a carton of Carlton Lights or a NordicTrack, but definitely one or the other.
<P>
But they're bad little cancer sticks, aren't they? I mean, it says so on the box.
<P>
On the other hand, of course -- and as you know, as a New Democrat, I think it's important to look at the other hand -- $72,000 in Democratic Party funds divided into six checks of $12,000 apiece to six swing states (say, for argument's sake, California, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New York) -- well, I mean, that's a positive, right? So while cigarettes are addictive, they're also beneficial.
<P>
As you know, Rusty, I'm very sensitive to the issue of hypocrisy. You remember how hard I fought to have an electric vice-presidential limousine -- and I only gave in when the Secret Service pointed out the problem, in an emergency, of a car that can only go 30 miles per hour for 11 minutes before it needs a recharge. Naturally, I'm all in favor of pointing out the differences between us and the Republicans -- especially these days, when they're harder to find. And tobacco policy seems a good place to start. After all, they got $97,000 in tobacco-lobby contributions last year, while we took in only $96,890.
<P>
But as I was helping George Stephanopoulos into his ``Buttman'' suit -- you've seen him in the news, I'm sure: a guy in tights and a cigarette costume waving at all the Dole rallies; boy, is George racking up the frequent-flyer miles! -- I suddenly thought that we may be pushing this issue too far.
<P>
I had just zipped on the filter headpiece and heard George's muffled ``How do I look?'' when the phone rang. It was Dad, calling from the farm.
<P>
``Son,'' he said, ``your mother and I just caught you on the news.'' 
<P>
``How did I look?'' I asked. I always like to get Dad's thoughts on my campaigning style. 
``Well, your mother thinks you look fat.''
<P> 
``Oh,'' I said.
<P> 
``But I've got a question for you. Just let me put down my julep.''
<P>
I heard the familiar sounds: the ice tinkling, the slippery noise of fingers on the outside of a glass, the thud of the drink hitting the coaster.
<P>
``Here's my question, boy. All those years growing up on a farm in Tennessee -- remember?'' 
<P>
``Sure, Dad. They're some of my fondest memories. Not that I didn't enjoy the years growing up in a hotel in Washington, D.C., of course -- but a Tennessee farm is a much better campaign backdrop.'' I laughed. Dad joined in with a few chuckles.
<P>
``Right you are, my boy. And do you remember what it was that we grew on that farm?''
<P>
``Mint?'' I asked, stymied.
``Well, yeah, mint. Of course mint. But come on, boy, we had thousands of acres -- your mother and I couldn't get through that many mint juleps in one planting season . . . Now, maybe, since I'm not working, but then -- no way.''
<P> 
``Then I'm stumped, Dad. What did we grow?'' 
<P>
``I'll give you a clue: it's leafy, highly addictive, and kids think it's cool.''
<P>
I went pale. ``Good heavens! Marijuana?'' I was shaking. This was the kind of thing that Dole's opposition-research people would love.
<P>
``No, silly,'' Dad said. ``We grew tobacco.'' 
<P>
``Dad! That's worse! We've been highlighting Bob Dole's ties to the cigarette industry.''
<P>
``Hello?'' Dad said. ``This is why I'm calling. Add it up, kiddo. St. Albans. Harvard. Your first campaign. Talk about tobacco money! Whoo boy!''
<P>
``Well, thanks for calling, Dad,'' I said. ``I'm going to have to think about this.''
<P>
``My advice, son, is when and if the press asks you about it, just tell 'em the truth: you didn't inhale!'' Dad giggled merrily and hung up.
<P>
I looked up from the phone in a daze. George was still in his ``Buttman'' costume, bouncing along the wall feeling for the door. ``Is everything okay at home?'' he asked in a barely audible muffle.
<P>
``Fine, fine,'' I said. I didn't want to disturb him.
<P>
``Well then,'' he said from under his filter, ``could you please show me to the door? It's getting awfully sweaty under here.''
<P>
I guided him out. Then I sat down at my desk and started to think. I needed some peace and quiet, some small moment of contemplation. What I needed, Rusty, was a cigarette.
<P>
I had a Snickers bar instead.

Hard to believe, but there it was: a Democrat standing on the House floor pointing at a chart showing how Republicans have reversed President Clinton's success at reducing the deficit. Odder still, he wasn't making it up. The budget resolution recently passed by congressional Republicans includes a spike in the deficit, which is projected to be larger both in 1997 and 1998 than this year. There are innocent explanations for the hiccup, chiefly that the deficit dipped lower than expected this year (perhaps as low as $130 billion). But for Republicans who have made actuarial decreases in the deficit their Holy Grail, it is embarrassing. More embarrassing still, when it seemed that the Energy - Water appropriations bill (the source of ample funding for New Mexico) would have to be cut, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) simply added $5 billion more to the overall budget. House Republicans went along, some openly exulting when extra money made its way into their districts. (The first effort by House freshmen to trim back the extra funding with a 1.9 per cent cut in the Interior appropriation bill won just 128 votes.) Some of this is understandable; these are politicians, after all, who have to win re-election. But higher deficits seem to be a dubious way to do it.

Many Americans who harbored doubts about the wisdom of anointing Colin Powell Vice President nevertheless hoped he would bring his dignified leadership into the political arena in some other capacity. These well-wishers have reason to be dismayed by the general's one recent foray into public policy. In a speech at Bowie State University, he announced his opposition to the California Civil Rights Initiative to repeal race and gender preferences. People of good will can, of course, take this position, but Powell refused to extend such courtesy to the other side. And he revealed himself to be woefully misinformed about the initiative. He thinks, for instance, that it would endanger outreach programs, whereas in fact it would affect only racially (or sexually) preferential outreach programs. Now Ward Connerly, the chairman of the CCRI campaign, has written, both in sorrow and in anger, a response to Powell. Connerly observes that Powell's best-selling book condemned preferential affirmative action, which is the only type of affirmative action that the CCRI would ban. Powell the author wrote that preferences stigmatize recipients, but Powell the speaker calls that argument ``nonsense.'' Writes Connerly, ``Frankly, I like the author better.'' Connerly calls Powell ``a genuine American hero,'' but Connerly himself has displayed uncommon courage in his principled campaign. It is a mark of Republican dishonor that Connerly has been left to fight this battle alone.

Arthur A. Coia, general president of the Laborers' Union of North America (LUNA), has contributed nearly $400,000 to the Democratic National Committee (thereby making the party's ``top ten'' list with plenty of room to spare), given in excess of $3 million to various Democratic politicians since 1993, loaned $100,000 to the Clinton inaugural committee, and sent one seriously expensive hand-made golf club to the President. Why the gifts? In 1994, the Justice Department drafted a 212-page complaint charging the union with racketeering and heavy ties to organized crime, and threatened to take the union under government control. But a closed-door meeting between Coia and the Justice Department resulted in a one-sided agreement leaving Coia in charge and with complete control of LUNA's reforms- not to be reviewed until 1998. Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee, plans to hold hearings on this sweetheart deal in the fall. Another FOB-SOB.

Dick Armey wants a flat tax. His major opponents may be not the class-warfare mavens of the Left but a decidedly upscale Beltway group: lobbyists. According to the House Majority Leader's report, the 67,000-man lobbying industry is the largest private-sector employer in D.C., accounting for one-sixth of the District's workforce. Plot the growth in the number of words in the tax code alongside growth in the number of lobbyists, and you'll see that both have more than tripled since 1964. That's no coincidence. Even in this era of spending cuts, nothing attracts special pleaders like the tax code. So how to jettison the tax code's bells and whistles? With 125 lobbyists for each congressman, a frontal assault won't work. We propose a special 0 per cent tax rate for lobbyists -- to be enacted when they agree not to obstruct flat-tax legislation for the rest of us.

Fuaziya Kasinga of Togo was granted political asylum in the United States on the grounds that the practice of female genital mutilation in Togo constitutes persecution. Genital mutilation is an appalling practice, but we need to distinguish between brutal societies and official oppression. If mutilation in their home countries entitles foreigners to asylum in the United States, then half the women of Africa and many in the Middle East could come here. What about girls caught in the prostitution industry of Southeast Asia? Untouchables and bonded laborers in India? To paraphrase John Quincy Adams, we are the friends of civilization everywhere, but the guarantors only of our own.

Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty give Central Europe and the former Soviet Union reliable news about the region. While the Soviet Empire is no more, freedom of the press in all these countries is precarious once again, with ex- and neo-Communists making their comeback and even Boris Yeltsin turning the Russian media into an organ of state power. A Washington conference on June 19, hosted by <B><I>NR</I></B>, the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom, and the Center for Security Policy -- and attended by Senators Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) and Joe Biden (D., Del.), Steve Forbes (former head of the Board for International Broadcasting), and Michael Zantovsky (former journalist and dissident, now Czech ambassador to the United States) -- concluded that the radios were still doing indispensable work. Yet Radio Free Europe's Hungarian service has been canceled for lack of funds, and unless another $1 million is found before September 30 the Czech service will be doomed as well. Congress, take note.

The largest American Protestant organization, the Southern Baptist Convention, has adopted a resolution calling for efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. Naturally this roiled the waters, occasioning outrage among some Jews. For such outrage there are understandable reasons: 1) efforts to convert Jews in centuries past often involved the sword rather than the word; 2) historically Christianity often demonized the Jew as an outsider or worse; and 3) the shadow of the Holocaust looms over all such matters. However, Christians from their side may decently answer that: 1) since they regard the doctrines of Christianity as true <I>and</I> universal, it would be a failure of <I>caritas</I>, without which life is as a tinkling cymbal, not to share them with all people; and 2) they do not see any reason to exclude their Jewish neighbors from the inclusive term ``all people.'' While overbearing attempts at evangelizing are spiritually disgraceful, the polite, considerate effort to share Christian claims with one's neighbors should threaten no one -- least of all, devout Jews.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>FEW</font> weeks ago I went back to see my old high school in Washington, D.C. In those days (I graduated in 1967) it was called Western High School, and was integrated <i>de facto</i> as well as <i>de jure</i>, with a roughly even balance of black and white students. The building, nearly a century old, was a little run down, and we had to scrape up money from our parents to keep the school newspaper going, but you could get an education there. We went to Harvard, Stanford, Tufts, the service academies, and other good schools. The middle-class white and black kids were in the same school activities, behaved equally badly at the same parties, and believed in the same government-issue Great Society politics. We all knew Marion Barry, then a local hustler on the rise who was just hitching a ride on the politics game.
<P>
Western is now the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. Much has been added, and much taken away. The most telling sign, I decided, were the clocks in the classrooms. They're the same clocks we had, and they've all stopped. The people in charge of the school have spent thousands of dollars on an elaborate closed-circuit TV system to tell the students about the week's special events, but didn't think some fraction of that should have been spent on teaching the kids to show up on time. And, indeed, the students wander around pretty aimlessly, I suppose waiting for the producers of <i>Fame II</i> to sign them up.
<p>
They're being cheated, of course, as they will find out after some very cruel lessons. So is everyone else living in the District of Columbia. The city, now in receivership for the second time in its history (the first occasion was in the 1870s), is a poster child for a 12-step program to kick Government Abuse.
<P>
A decade ago, D.C. seemed to be on the way to becoming, if not a state, then the political equal of the states. Now the city is being run by what is universally called the control board- formally, The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority. It is slowly attacking the most egregious fraud and mismanagement. Its charter is to balance the budget in the next three years. It may succeed, if the tax base doesn't shrink any faster than its present rate.
<P>
But while the control board may give comfort to the holders of D.C.'s $3.5 billion of bonded debt, it cannot revive the city. Only a restored civil society with a middle class anxious to defend its families and property can do that.
<P> 
Most of the people now living in Washington are welfare recipients, D.C. government workers, or criminals, and their dependents. They are all opposed to the reforms needed to save the city.
<P>
According to the most recent <I>Washington Post</I> poll, conducted between  May 16 and 19, Mayor Marion Barry has a ``good'' or ``excellent'' rating of 52 per cent. When asked if Barry was ``trying realistically to deal with the city's problems'' 70 per cent said he was. Not that there isn't some dissent: In an earlier Post poll, conducted in February, 60 per cent of D.C. residents said that Barry's proposed cutbacks in the unbelievably bloated city government are a ``bad idea.''
<P>
What can you say? Most of the people, white, black, or whatever, who don't take the majority line have left town. They don't want to pay the taxes for nonexistent services, and are appalled by the schools and terrified of the crime. In 1970 there were 757,000 residents; today there are 540,000.
<P>
Now if nature were to take its course, the place would soon crumble, be abandoned by its surviving inhabitants, and then be excavated by puzzled archaeologists some centuries hence. It has happened before. But D.C. was formed by the Federal Government, which is constitutionally committed to the place; it cannot strike camp as a private employer or property owner might.
<P>
Until now, under both Democratic and Republican Administrations and Congresses, the response to problems in the District has been to fund another program or two. But in the past year, a tectonic plate has shifted. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting D.C. Delegate to Congress and a member of the city's black political elite, has put forward a bill to cut federal taxes on residents' local income to a flat 15 per cent, with exemptions of $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for joint filers. Last year, District residents paid about $1.6 billion in federal taxes; Mrs. Norton's bill would cut that by an estimated $750 million. There is a precedent for this sort of tax break. Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico also have limited self-government and representation in Washington, and their residents pay no federal income taxes.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HERE</font> is a popular perception in the rest of the country that Washington is a nest of ill-gotten wealth and privilege. Privilege? Yes. Ill gotten? In many cases. But wealth? Last year, there were only 4,300-odd taxpayers in the District who earned $200,000 or more. What if their tax liability were to be cut by more than a third? Think some of their friends might move into town? As for the core middle class, there were only about 75,000 taxpayers in the District with family incomes between $30,000 and $75,000. If the better-off are the ones who might start new enterprises, the people in the middle are the ones who will harass the school board, the police, and the City Council into delivering real services.
<P>
To add to the lure, the Norton plan would retain the mortgage-interest deduction and the charitable deductions. The frosting: there would be no capital-gains tax on investments in D.C. by D.C. residents. The Norton bill would be the camel's nose in the tent for a national flat tax. And it would help transform the terms of debate in the black middle class, which now sees itself as dependent on government jobs and affirmative action.
<P>
Of course Mrs. Norton doesn't represent herself as a born-again conservative. ``I am a hard-core Democrat and a hard-core liberal,'' she says. She supports the National Education Association in its unbending opposition to a voucher program for the District's schools, and says of her proposal, ``I am not calling this a flat tax because that suggests it is not progressive. I am calling it a uniform tax.'' Whatever. She is realistic about the essential problem of the District. ``The D.C. government has an attitude. Nothing will work unless it is reformed agency by agency, which is where the waste is. The police need to be made more effective. The control board's plan to cut 10,000 jobs (about a quarter of the city payroll) is a good one.''
<P>
There are about 15,000 bills introduced in Congress every year, and only a small fraction see the light of day. The District is a pretty unpopular cause in Congress. Even when Democrats are in control, key legislation concerning the city tends to pass by narrow margins.
<P>
Even in this basically hostile climate, a surprisingly high level of support has built up for the D.C. flat tax. ``The Speaker is interested in it,'' says Mrs. Norton, ``and he's sent a memo to Bill Archer at Ways and Means asking how it can be moved along. Victor Fazio, the chair of the Democratic caucus, has become a co-sponsor.'' Before leaving the Senate, Bob Dole had offered to get the bill through the upper chamber if it passed the House- a good omen.
<P>
It is not, however, a lock. Republican House Members, particularly the newer ones, don't like to think about Washington, and tend to defer to the two or three people in the caucus who have the principal responsibility for D.C. affairs. Their support for a D.C. flat tax is conditioned on seeing reforms in the city government.
<P>
Tom Davis (R., Va.) is the chairman of the House District Affairs Committee. He is a freshman from neighboring Fairfax County, where he became head of the county government while working as an executive with a technology company. ``This city still has an entitlement/victim mentality,'' he sighs. ``And most of the crimes are being committed against the people who are fighting the changes we're trying to make in the justice system.'' For Davis's constituents, D.C. is a local issue, which tends to come down to its contribution to the region's crime rate. ``Every other jurisdiction is moving away from parole, because 60 per cent of crimes are committed by 3 per cent of the prisoners. But parole in D.C. is almost automatic, and Barry got a lot of support in the last election by making a play for the votes of offenders' families and friends.'' There are one and a half times as many prisoners now in the District's Lorton Reformatory as there are taxpayers in the $200,000-and-up group.
<P>
``At a minimum we want to see regulatory reform so that the city would have the welcome mat out for business,'' Davis says. ``The problem now is that the District's reputation is bringing down the whole region.''
<P>
In the end, Davis tends to support the bill. ``I think it's something we can do. But I want to see some other changes, not just in criminal justice, but in cutting waste and destructive regulations, along with some tax reform by the city.''
<P>
The flat tax would also need to have the support of James T. Walsh (R., N.Y.), a former phone-company executive who represents Syracuse. Walsh was the City Council president of Syracuse, and is able to make embarrassing comparisons with his home town. ``The city is only about three times the size of Syracuse, which has a budget of $330 million. Even if you triple that, and add in the corrections and social services the state provides in New York, you don't come anywhere near the $5 billion the District spends. In Syracuse the city council has a staff of 3. Here it's over 80. When they announce cuts in spending, those are only announcements.''
<P>
Walsh is a classic American can-do  type in a can't-do place, and he is not happy with his part-time home. ``Of course I leave my family at home in Syracuse. Why would I live here?'' Even so, he'll support the flat tax if certain conditions are met. ``I am willing to do this, but not for the heck of it. I want to see some behavioral changes here, including a balanced budget.''
<P>
We can't move the government to a less expensive facility in Plano, Texas, or Southfield, Michigan, or any of the other places corporate America has fled to in recent decades. D.C. needs a jump start, and the flat tax would do it. No, it's not entirely fair to reward the city before the rest of the country, but it could provide a testing ground for a tax-and-spend-less philosophy that could be <i>transplanted</i> to the rest of the country.

<H2>The Kemp Manifesto</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JUNE 21
<P>

The movements of Jack Kemp are always worth watching. For many years he was dismissed as a football jock who had stumbled onto Adam Smith and remained starstruck. But after a few terms in the House of Representatives he won grudging admiration, in part because of his comprehensive grasp of the economic scene, in part because of his rhetorical fluency. Ronald Reagan aside, it has been for many years Jack Kemp who has had the ability to ignite enthusiasm in those whom he addresses.
<P>
Kemp's political judgment, however, has never been very good. It is generally agreed by specialists that he could have defeated Governor Cuomo the second time around in 1986 and that if he had done so he'd have been perfectly placed to bid for the presidential nomination in 1988. He gave up his congressional seat to contend for the presidential nomination and, for reasons unknown and unknowable, left his legal residence in New York in favor of Maryland, where he lived while serving as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for President Bush. If he had stayed in New York he'd have been nominated for governor, would have defeated Mr. Cuomo, and would almost certainly be the candidate for President at the moment.
<P>
But his political prescriptions have always been sound, and this week he published in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> a manifesto of sorts. In it he made an unusual proposal.
<P>
But first, the launch. Mr. Kemp argues that the country is wearing itself out with the partisanship that is built into existing economic policies. This is likely to go on with the rough division we have got used to. The Democrats are associated with welfare, the Republicans with tax reform. They argue but without a common vocabulary, says Mr. Kemp. If what is desired is to provide for the underclass, the most painless way to do this is to encourage growth in the economy. That growth can't happen under our suffocating tax structure.
<P>
Mr. Kemp asks for a truce on the welfare front. Leave it alone. In return he asks for a solid, architectural reform in our tax policies. 
<P>
What is especially original in his concrete proposals is his assumption that the President of the United States is empowered himself to take two drastic courses of action.
<P>
The first is to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to index capital gains. The assumption is that indexation is a matter of purely clerical concern, that you should not need a congressional Act to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to do something as obvious as not to charge for spurious increases in the value of land or stock or other property.
<P>
But Mr. Kemp goes further. He would have the new President instruct the Treasury Secretary to ``stabilize the dollar value of the nation's gold reserves, say within a $30 band.'' Such action would ``reinstate the dollar/gold link'' that was broken in 1971 and that led to the worst inflation in the century.
<P>
If we reason backwards, we have a right to assume that if what Nixon did he had the authority to do, then to undo what Nixon did another President would have the authority to do.
<P> 
Mr. Kemp then says: Look now at what would happen. For every 1 per cent decrease in the interest rate, $50 billion is lopped off the annual burden of the national debt. With capital gains indexed, a flood of realism pours into the marketplace, affecting farms and apartments and portfolios. It is another question how high genuine capital gains should be taxed -- that would be a congressional decision.
<P>
And as for the tax code, the new President having used his own authority to take the two measures here outlined, let Congress proceed to work out a new system inspired by the flat-tax principle recommended by the Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that Jack Kemp headed up last year.
<P>
Here is a fresh view, filling the lungs with hope and excitement. Mr. Dole is uniquely in a position to act on the Kemp manifesto. He could, just to begin with, endorse the two major proposals for executive action. And, in a spirit of bipartisanship, he could say that he would suspend any call for reducing existing welfare measures, testing whether the fiscal reforms had the effect of diminishing the heavy weight of welfare on the budget. And Mr. Dole could make a second, equally exciting move by announcing that he intended to name Jack Kemp as vice-presidential candidate.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>

I was working late one night -- watching tapes of Christie Whitman's debates with Jim Florio (don't know why; just interested, I guess) -- and I lost track of time. I was heading out of the West Wing in the usual way when I suddenly remembered the most recent memo from the White House Office of Security, following the discovery of some Rose Law Firm billing records in the Book Room. ``From now on,'' the memo went, ``all White House personnel are hereby required to pass through the Book Room no fewer than three (3) times in any    twenty-four (24) hour period. For those staff unaware of the Book Room's location, it's up the back stairs, down the main corridor, through the small butler's door on the right, along the crawlspace, and through the door at the back of the closet. When entering and exiting, please take care not to disturb Mrs. Rodham Clinton.''
<P> 
Of course, I didn't need directions. But when I reached the door, I heard the faint tinkling of bells. And I could smell incense. So I knocked.
<P> 
A deep-voiced female called out: ``What undead spirit walks the earth? What lifeless vision knocks?''
<P> 
I cleared my throat. ``Um, it's me. Al Gore.''
<P> 
``Eleanor? Is it you?'' asked a familiar voice. ``Eleanor? The forces are against me, just as they were against you! The conservatives and the reactionaries don't understand. Help me, Eleanor!''
<P> 
I cleared my throat again. ``No, not 'Elean-Or.' 'Al Gore.''' 
<P>
A silence. Then the deep-voiced woman: ``Mr. Vice President, is it you?''
<P>
``Yep,'' I answered. 
<P>
``But your voice . . . it sounds so masculine. I could have sworn it was Eleanor Roosevelt's.''
<P>
 The door was unlocked by HRC. The Book Room was lit by six flickering candles. A large woman in a kaftan sat fanning a deck of cards.
<P>
``Okay, Al, you caught me,'' HRC said. ``I was trying to contact some voices from the other side. ``Please promise me that you won't tell a soul.''
 
``Well,'' I said, ``if you'd prefer to keep it quiet, I'll respect that. But I think you're missing a chance. The American people are very interested in spiritual experiences. In my book, I was very open about the time halfway through an Indian sweat lodge that I floated out of my body and back to Washington to talk to the statue of Lincoln. And no one thought I was weird.'' 
<P>
``Really?''
 <P>``Really,'' I said. ``Besides, the Book Room has been the site of so many unexplained phenomena, I don't think one little seance will upset people.''
<P> 
``Good point,'' she said. ``I mean, isn't it possible that some mischievous spirit . . . A poltergeist! What if a poltergeist put the billing records in this room?''
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``have you talked to a poltergeist tonight?'' 
<P>
``Nope,'' HRC answered. ``Just Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.''
<P>
I thought about this. I think it's safe to rule Gandhi out -- unfamiliarity with U.S. trial rules, for one thing; the fact that practical joking is essentially ``active'' and not ``passive,'' for another. And it didn't seem likely that the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt committed any funny business with the Rose Law Firm billing records. On the other hand, I wouldn't put it past her to request an FBI file or two -- she's from the old school, when they were awfully lax about stuff like that. Still -- who knows how many undead shades might be lurking around. (Nixon came immediately to mind.) 
<P>
``You know what, Al?'' HRC said. ``I will tell people about my seances. Maybe the American people will understand.'' She turned to the woman. ``Mrs. Houston, let's try another spirit.''
<P> 

``Do you mind if I sit in?'' I asked.
<P> 
Mrs. Houston peered at me. ``So often,'' she said, ``the presence of another strong life form disrupts the ability to contact the spirit realm.'' She looked deep into my eyes. ``Lucky for us,'' she went on, ``that won't be a problem here.''
<P>
We took our seats and held hands. Silence.
<P>
Then we heard faint footsteps. ``What apparition comes to haunt us?'' Mrs. Houston cried. 
<P>
From the shadows of the Book Room came an undead-sounding voice: ``Good evening.''
<P>
The three of us started. ``What horrifying vision is before us?'' Mrs. Houston cried.
<P>
``Um, it's me, Warren Christopher.'' And, indeed, it was. ``I was just on my way out.''
<P> 
He slipped out, but by that time, the spell was broken. I went home. But the image of HRC stuck in my mind. Rusty, so many people think of her as some kind of Lady Macbeth. But let me ask you: Did Lady Macbeth talk to ghosts?

When Bob Dole announced that he would not ``seek or accept a retreat'' from the anti-abortion plank in the Republican platform, but that he wanted to add a ``declaration of tolerance'' acknowledging differences of opinion among Republicans, he hit upon a compromise that satisfied nearly everyone. But he could not leave well enough alone. Most pro-lifers thought this declaration should appear in the platform's preamble: plenty of other planks inspire disagreement among Republicans, so why single out abortion? Dole campaign officials assured pro-lifers that their point was well taken. A few days later, Dole gratuitously remarked that the declaration should go in the abortion plank. Ralph Reed, Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan, et al. instantly promised a convention fight. Dole retaliated with a counterproductive attack on Gary Bauer. In less than a week, what had seemed a political masterstroke was transformed into a debacle. A convention fight over this issue would be the worst of all worlds. Viewers would be left scratching their heads as Dan Rather told them that intolerance had prevented Republicans from finding common ground. Ideally the issue should be resolved before then. Pro-choice Republicans must decide whether their aims are to raise money and get free publicity, or to help Bob Dole get elected by keeping the social conservatives on board. And Dole must force himself to engage this issue at the principled level it demands. Until he gets a grip, he and his party will continue to fumble.

When former Colorado governor Richard Lamm showed a willingness to be the presidential candidate of the Reform Party, speculation naturally focused on the willingness of Ross Perot, the Reform Party's proprietor, to let him. The more interesting question is what a Lamm candidacy would do to the dynamics of the race. ``America needs more than a new President,'' Lamm says. ``It needs a whole new political culture.'' He is a sort of Anti-Demagogue whose ideal political culture is a blunt fight about hard spending issues, primarily entitlements aimed at the elderly: ``There is something wrong with a society,'' Lamm likes to say, that spends 61 per cent of the federal budget on people over 65. Lamm was also the first prominent politician to speak out against unchecked immigration. Tax policy and cultural issues seem to be terrae incognitae, and his notorious remark that Americans have a ``duty to die'' would -- and should -- be often thrown at him. But a candidate of hard choices would be anathema to Bill Clinton, and a prod to Bob Dole not to look for votes in the mushy middle.

Republicans may be throwing away one of their best chances to pick up both a Senate seat and a good senator. Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee was set to wage a strong campaign for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. David Pryor, but Gov. Jim Guy Tucker's Whitewater conviction and resignation left him with more pressing duties. The best remaining candidate, by a large margin, is sophomore Rep. Tim Hutchinson. Hutchinson is an affable and principled conservative, and was a Contract with America Republican avant la lettre. He is hesitating because of internal Arkansas GOP maneuvers. Republican leaders, both nationally and in Arkansas, should do everything in their power to coax him to run.<p>

In his Princeton commencement address, President Clinton proposed giving families with a kid in college a two-year $1,500 tax credit and a $10,000 deduction. ``Our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal to all Americans as the first 12 are today,'' he said. This is a terrific political move and a terrible idea. It will be manna from Washington to hard-pressed middle-class parents facing huge college bills. But the United States already overinvests in higher education: thanks largely to liberal education policies, too many young Americans have to go to college to get a high-school education. The President's proposal would only briefly relieve anxiety over tuition, because federal aid generally causes tuition to rise. (A college that cuts tuition is throwing away millions of dollars in aid.) In addition, government funding tends to make universities less responsive to consumers. The Wall Street Journal had it right: The Clinton plan is  ``a jobs program for the political-correctness industry.''<p>

In re: Medicare's going from bad to worse. Look for some sort of ``bipartisan'' bailout, replete with price controls, Part B premium hikes, accounting gimmickry, and, if all else fails, a bogus reduction in estimated medical-cost inflation such as the Office of Management and Budget recently inserted into the 1997 budget. All this might buy us another five years. But come the next brush with insolvency, the demographic Indian Summer we've enjoyed since Medicare's inception will have turned to frost. In 2008 the first of 76 million baby-boomers start to retire. By 2040 one-quarter of the population will be 65 or older. We will confront what demographers call ``the aging of the aged,'' with the share of Americans aged 85 and older growing more than threefold, while those between 65 and 74 increase by a mere 80 per cent. By then the combined shortfall in Social Security and Medicare could reach 10 per cent of gross domestic product. A tax fix would be unthinkable: according to some estimates, a Clinton-sized tax hike would be needed every four years for the next fifty years. Long before then, however, the futility of nickel-and-dime reforms will also be obvious. Our prediction? Within 15 years Congress will change the very nature of Social Security and Medicare -- from open-ended entitlements to defined-contribution plans such as are common in the private sector. Retirees will decide where their retirement funds are invested. Baby-boomers will probably receive less money and services from Washington than today's politically well-protected elderly. But given the rewards of the marketplace, they will also have less need for them.

Perhaps you recall the Cato Parish (Shreveport) school system making the news a few months ago when the kiddies sent a 300-foot letter to Congress begging it not to ``decentralize'' the school-lunch program. Kiddies, said the kiddies, would starve by the millions if those mean-spirited Republicans had their way. The Cato school system is back in the news, locally -- the national media seem to have missed the story this time -- for having spent $6,000 on prime-rib dinners for school administrators, officials, and cafeteria workers: enough to feed 8,000 of those starving kiddies<p>

Mass-transit enthusiasts often extol the energy efficiency of buses and commuter trains, as compared with gas-guzzling cars. But according to estimates made by the Transportation Center at the University of California at Berkeley, automobiles are now, on average, more economical in the use of fuel than the mass-transit competition. Here are the numbers provided by Sharon Sarmiento in the Spring 1996 issue of Access magazine.

 BTU per
 Passenger Mile     Autos     Buses     Transit Rail
 1980               4,782     2,813        3,008
 1993               3,593     4,374        3,687

According to the Berkeley study, mass-transit authorities have been loading their vehicles with extra equipment (wheelchair lifts, larger air conditioners), thus increasing fuel consumption, at the same time that ridership has been falling. Miss Sarmiento asks: ``Should government now encourage people to use cars to save energy?''

In Renaissance Italy, a wayward duchess might be dispatched by a dagger thrust, a silken cord, a poisoned cup. In modern New York, where Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey Ross is the duchess, and the GOP political establishment (her sometime patrons) the assassins, the thing takes longer. To be sure, Mrs. Ross has her faults: she is a temperamental publicity hound with no experience in government. But would any catalogue of sins merit the thousand cuts she has gotten in the last few months? A state trooper driving her to an event was told over the phone, ``Don't make it on time''; she had no troopers at all for five weeks; she was initially denied a seat in the New York delegation to the San Diego convention; the Parks and Recreation Commissioner called up a radio talk show she was on to say she was ``creating a bad atmosphere''; her press secretary quit, saying the lieutenant governor had told her to lie; a former speechwriter called her behavior ``not sane.'' ``Did any ceremonial form of law/Doom her to not-being? Did a complete jury/Deliver her conviction up i' th' court?/Where shalt thou find this judgment registered/Unless in hell?'' ``I am Duchess of Malfi still.'' Exeunt omnes.<p>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE issue of <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B> dated February 12, 1996, gave the conclusion of the magazine that the time had come to revise our laws on drug trafficking. Seven writers contributed to the symposium. There were no differences among them on the primary findings. They were 1) that the famous drug war is not working; 2) that crime and suffering have greatly increased as a result of prohibition; 3) that we have seen, and are countenancing, a creeping attrition of authentic civil liberties; and 4) that the direction in which to head is legalization, whatever modifications in kind, speed, and variety commend themselves in study and practice.
<P>
The response from the magazine's readers is, in volume, second only to the response to the issue in 1991 given over to the exploration of anti-Semitism. We have had over four hundred communications, and the only civil way to introduce fragments from these letters, as we now do, is to apologize to their authors for our failure to acknowledge them individually. (One letter is approximately eight thousand words long and is marked, ``Not for publication in whole or in part.'') Four hundred letters addressed to the President of the United States, or even to a senator or congressman, would almost certainly be acknowledged, by using form letters A, B, and C. But even a letter so spare as to have been usable to all our correspondents would have broken our clerical bank. Add to this an indisposition to craft letters so diffuse as to fail to qualify as serious answers. (H. L.Mencken's formula was always to say, ``You may be right. Sincerely, HLM.'')
<P>
Readers are about evenly divided on the recommendations of <I><B>NR</B></I>. A heavy majority were grateful that <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B> had ventilated the subject extensively; all agree that the drug problem is acute, and no one disputes that the drug war is being lost. Those who oppose legalization are divided on what then to do, one half asking for harsher penalties, the other proposing different strategies. Inasmuch as the heavy majority of those who lean toward, or forthrightly advocate, legalization endorsed the findings and analyses of our own panel, they are given, to avoid repetition, less space in this summary. The analyses by Messrs. Buckley, Duke, McNamara, Nadelmann, Schmoke, Sweet, and Szasz are requoted here only when their recollection helps to achieve perspective in answering our critics.
<P>


1. <font size=+1>The Classic Prohibitionist View</font>
<P>
Prominence should be given to a long letter from our old friend and fellow warrior John A. Howard, founder of the Rockford Institute, now counselor to Rockford (which also publishes <I>Chronicles</I>). Commentary on his and subsequent letters is done by me -- WFB. What I say does not presume to be exactly what my colleagues would have said, but I have endeavored to avoid any disharmony with their views.
<P>
Mr. Howard says that he is surprised by the ``ignorance'' of the writers in respect of ``the large body of scientific research which contradicts their presuppositions and assertions. Bill Buckley denies any serious concern about the impact of cocaine and marijuana upon the millions of regular users because most of them continue their use 'without any observable distraction in their lives or careers.' Ethan Nadelmann asserts, 'Most people can use drugs without doing much harm to themselves or anyone else.' The other authors seem to assume the same benign character of drug use.''
<P> 
Mr. Howard goes on, ``An international colloquium on the human effects of cannabis consumption was held in Paris in 1992 under the auspices of the French National Academy of Medicine. Professor Henri Baylon, the President of the Academy, summarized the conclusions of the meeting as follows:
<P>
<blockquote>``'1. The toxicity of cannabis is well established, experimentally and clinically. The drug adversely affects the central nervous system, the lungs, and the immunity and reproductive functions.
<P>
``'2. Epidemiological studies have reported that the use of ``hard drugs'' rarely occurs among subjects who have never used cannabis.
<P>
``'3. Consequently, the participants in this colloquium rebut the distinction between ``soft'' and ``hard'' drugs.
<P>
``'4. The trivialization (``decriminalizaton'') of cannabis use, where it has occurred, has resulted in a considerable increase of its consumption and of its subsequent damaging effects.'''
</blockquote>
<P>
What I wrote (page 36): ``Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book, <I>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs</I>, and scholarly essay, 'Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster,' reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs. It is acknowledged that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another consumed, or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug. But the estimate authorized by the federal agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week. There are (again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana. From the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in their lives or careers.''
<br>
<br>
<p>
One wonders why Mr. Howard wastes his time (and ours) by his misreadings and irrelevancies. When the French National Academy of Medicine reports that cannabis is ``toxic'' in that it ``affects the central nervous system,'' it is telling us nothing that is not obvious. There is no other reason to use marijuana than that it affects the nervous system. And any inhalation of tar affects the lungs. If marijuana seriously affects the reproductive functions, one can only wonder at the success of the Woodstock generation in reproducing itself. To say that everyone who uses cocaine probably once used marijuana is correct and meaningless. Everyone who rapes probably once masturbated. Most excesses are progressive. To conclude that there is no distinction between soft and hard drugs is simply to ignore the discriminating capacity of our senses, to distinguish between the man who has taken a glass of beer and the man who has taken a half-dozen martinis.
<P>
And this, of course, is the key insight. Nothing the Academy says about cannabis or cocaine can't be said about alcohol, which the United States finally decriminalized after 13 ugly (and cheerless) years. It is especially curious that Mr. Howard failed to grapple with the point, given that the sentence in the NR issue immediately after the one he quoted above read: <I>``About such users</I> [i.e., occasional marijuana and indeed cocaine users] <I>one might say that they are the equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result.''</I>
<P>
And a factual point. Mr. Howard: ``Robert Sweet does urge the acceptance of 'the recommendations of President Nixon's commission on drug law to end the criminalization of marijuana.' That would seem to support his view, except it is flatly untrue. That commission recommended that marijuana remain contraband, subject to confiscation by law-enforcement officials.''
<P>
The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse (The ``Nixon Marijuana Commission'') found in 1972 that ``there is little proven danger of physical or psychological harm from the experimental or intermittent use'' of marijuana. On the question of law enforcement, the panel recommended a ``decriminalization'' of possession of marijuana for personal use on both the state and the federal levels. Specifically, it recommended that:
<P><blockquote>
`` -- Federal and state laws be changed to no longer make it a crime to possess marijuana for private use.
<P>
`` -- The distribution in private of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration or for insignificant amounts should no longer be an offense.
<P>
`` -- State laws should make the public use of marijuana a criminal offense punishable by a $100 fine. Under federal law, marijuana smoked in public would merely be subject to seizure.''</blockquote><P>
<br>
<br>

<hr width=50%>
<br>
<p>

Most of the letters received fall into one or another of the categories enumerated below.
<p>
2. <font size=+1>The Demands of the Natural Law</font>
<p>
<blockquote><I>``. . . in most arenas (the suicide business, abortion, others) you make reference to natural law, but in the isolated area of drug legalization you seem to discount the possibility of any higher guidance and use expediency as the rationale.''<p>
  -- Dr. T. P. Collins, Portsmouth, Virginia</I></blockquote>
<P>

No such thing was intended. But laws do not for the most part instruct us whether to engage in particular activities. Of the seven deadly sins (gluttony, avarice, sloth, pride, lust, envy, wrath) only two are also proscribed by statute law, and even they, only marginally. Jimmy Carter confessed to lust in his heart, but the policeman materializes only when lust activates aggression. Wrath is okay (in fact it is even encouraged, in times of war) except when it causes you to kill or maim innocents.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
3. <font size=+1>Personal Responsibility</font>
<P>
Much indignation is expressed over the tacit position of many anti-prohibitionists that the addicted class is free to become a public burden.
<p>
<blockquote><I>``Several years ago, our Congress chose to follow the leadership of American liberals by deciding that taking illegal drugs was a 'disease.' In reality, the use of drugs describes a behavior. . . . The result? The illegal drug-takers are 'rehabilitated' to the point where they no longer need to work to make their way in life; they simply hand the tab to the taxpayer.''<P>
  -- Jack W. Pace, Lincoln, Rhode Island</I></blockquote>
<P>

But surely it is not plausible that anyone well and persuasively instructed in the tortures of addiction would think to take up drugs merely as a means of effecting a personal welfare program? What several symposium contributors stressed was different, namely that the dollar spent on instruction and therapy effects a higher return than the dollar spent on detection, trial, and imprisonment.
<P>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
4. <font size=+1>Can Anyone Function With Drugs?</font>
<P>
Some viewers of the <I>Firing Line</I> programs aired in February featuring contributors to the <B><I>NR</I></B> drug symposium were astonished to hear (from Mr. Nadelmann and Dr. Szasz) that indeed some drug users can and do lead apparently normal lives.
<P>
<blockquote><I>``On Saturday morning, you sat there and countenanced the proposition that heroin was less dangerous than alcohol . . . Especially appalling was the suggestion that the addict could 'function' if he or she were freed from the problem of obtaining enough money to fund an illegal habit. The idea that an addict can function is almost as insane as the addict's substance abuse is insane. How do you define 'function'? Does it mean to lead a responsible, productive life? Does it mean simply to be able to feed and dress oneself? Does it mean to live and not be a threat to other people? How much self-reliance and safety do you include in your definition?''<P>  -- Louise H. Perret, Rye, New York</I></blockquote><P>

It is established that some people can ``function'' even after ingesting cocaine. Dr. Szasz has written on the matter in several of his books. He is arguing two positions. The first is that the ``abuse'' of drugs is a variable. Even as we know those who can tolerate five drinks, and those who can't tolerate one, it is evidently so with cocaine. This is hardly to recommend the use of it, since for the overwhelming majority it is immobilizing. Dr. Szasz makes the point that it is clinically incorrect to assume that everyone is equally affected. His other point is that to impose legal sanctions against someone merely because it is established that he has used the drug is an encroachment on human rights.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

5. <font size=+1>Is Drug Legalization Analogous To Choice in Abortion?</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I'm surprised no one has thought of the parallel between the legalization of drugs and the legalization of abortion. The same arguments . . . could easily be used to legalize drugs. Right to privacy, freedom to do what one wishes with one's body, even the threat that if abortion were illegal women would have to resort to the back-alley butcher. Just change this last one to read back-alley pusher and the two are identical.''<P>
  -- Frank F. Bellotti, Seattle, Washington</I></blockquote>
<p>

The parallel is of limited use, surely, inasmuch as opposition to abortion springs from the belief that there is an aggrieved party, with human rights.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

6. <font size=+1>Would Legalization Bring More Government?</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``Another almost certain consequence [of decriminalization] would be the creation of a Federal Drug Control bureaucracy that would make the current Drug War machine seem trivial. . . . Another worry concerning the legalization of drugs is its probable effect on the workplace. Today, we employers can fire drugged-up employees. But, with legalization, I can imagine that employers will be forced to continue the employment of worthless workers under the Americans with Disabilities Act.''<P>
  -- John F. Brinson, Allentown, Pennsylvania</I></blockquote><P>

Surely implausible? There was less government, in respect of alcohol, affecting individual lives after Prohibition than during it. Besides, it must by no means be taken for granted that all the contributors to <I><B>NR</B></I>'s symposium favor diminished social and economic sanctions, were legalization to come. It is not inconsistent to favor legalization alongside an intensification of these other sanctions.
<P>
The columnist Nicholas von Hoffman lists what society is in a position to do to make its point. The taking of drugs ought to be legislated as a civil offense. What then might a drug consumer expect? To begin with, everyone would have to submit to periodic blood testing.
<P>
``Anyone testing positive for drug use would be subject to the revocation of a huge army of privileges, ranging from temporary to permanent loss of driver's license, the revocation of one's license to practice law, operate a barber shop, work as an electrician, practice medicine or be a plumber, rent property, buy and sell securities. Civil penalties for drug use could also include cancellation of eligibility for every kind of government loan insurance, loss of eligibility for welfare, student grants in aid, subsidies, and government payments of any kind, large or small. Persons found selling drugs would be subject to cancellation of medical insurance, and Social Security, up to and including refused admission to hospitals or hospices. No criminal penalties, no long trials, no F. Lee Blundermouths, or Whirling Dershowitzes. Civil society, through quick, essentially unappealable administrative tribunals, would turn its back on such people for a greater or lesser period of time.''
<P>
The promulgation of the Hoffman Protocols would require some fiddling with the Constitution. But can it be said that Mr. Hoffman is soft on drugs, though he advocates legalization?
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

7. <font size=+1>The Federalist Implications</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``We tend to speak of the 'legalization' of drugs, when we really are referring to the repeal of national drug legislation. . . . Why should the conservative coalition split itself apart in arguments over whether 'government' ought [to] act aggressively against drug production and consumption, or adopt a libertarian unconcern and let the market proceed to do its work? The issue cuts too deeply. Where are we likely to find a better opportunity to educate the American people about federalism? The remanding of drug policy to the states would dramatically illustrate the futility and destructiveness of much meddlesome federal administration.''<P>
  -- Scott Rutledge, Richardson, Texas</I></blockquote><P>

State-bounded experiments lifting criminal sanctions against marijuana use have been attempted in a dozen states. But of course, drugs being light and unbulky, it would require an extraordinary mobilization of state constabulary to prevent border crossings. But yes, it would be prudent to repeal the federal law against marijuana use, leaving it to the states to define laws of their own. The distinguished neuroscientist Professor Michael Gazzaniga, writing in <B><I>NR</B></I> (February 5, 1990), advocated a federal drugstore in which drugs were clearly -- even dramatically -- labeled, detailing toxicity and possible/probable side effects. Such drugs would be available at a cost low enough to eliminate a black market.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

8. <font size=+1>How to Measure Social Unacceptability?</font>
<P>
Several correspondents see a difficulty in any proposition to the effect that general disobedience of a law, as with drug consumption in America, should lead to the law's abrogation.
<p>
<blockquote><I>``. . . The Buckley corollary seems to be that if the enforcement of a criminal law measured by an unspecified ratio of persons convicted of the crime to those engaged in the conduct criminalized is too low, then the conduct should be legalized. I would like to have your views on whether, for example, you believe laws making homicide criminal should be repealed if it became apparent that most homicides were unsolved.''<P>
  -- Walter S. Lewis, Princeville, Hawaii</I></blockquote><P>

The point is argumentatively interesting, but collapses under scrutiny. Many sometime laws withered away with the separation of church and state, and sluggish observance. Attendance at Sunday services was theoretically compulsory in some localities even after the Constitution was ratified. Such laws gradually disappeared, as also, almost two centuries later, laws against commerce on the Lord's Day. What looms is greater emphasis on the distinction between victimless crimes and other crimes. Laws against sodomy are de facto relics of another age, although they are still on the books in some states. Laws against suicide are formalistic, inasmuch as prosecution is, in the nature of the case, impossible.
<P>
To be sure, the term ``victimless'' is used glibly. Isn't a prostitute, even if she engages in her profession voluntarily, in some real sense a victim? The drug consumer can, by his habit, victimize his family, but then so can the wage earner who dissipates his salary at the race track. It is preposterous to argue that the drug consumer does no damage, but my colleagues in the symposium are agreed that the sum of human damage done by the drug laws is greater than would be done without them, and that the primary -- and sometimes only -- victim in the latter case would be the drug user. The murderer's victim is someone whose rights are theoretically guaranteed by the Constitution; and the promiscuity of homicide is, up to a point, evidence of the delinquency of law enforcers. There is no evidence, the contributors to the drug symposium are agreed, that increasing the severity of prison sentences, or the density of patrolmen on our frontiers, would so successfully interdict drug traffic as to make the war on drugs victorious.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
9. <font size=+1>Isn't It a Matter of Law Enforcement?</font>
<p>
On this point -- law enforcement -- many correspondents dwelled. Blame for the ineffectiveness of the drug laws is laid on the shoulders of politicians, judges, police officers, lawyers, jurors, educators, parents, and doctors.
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I do not believe that the drug war has been lost; it has not yet been fought. What we have had up to this point have been ploys designed by politicians to appease as many of the various segments of the voting public as possible. A law that is not vigorously enforced is no deterrent. It is not the existence of a law that is the deterrent, it is the enforcement of the law. . . .''<P>
  -- Howard R. Jeter, North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania</I></blockquote><P>

Arriving at a different conclusion, in our symposium, were Joseph McNamara, who has served as police chief in two major U.S. cities; Judge Robert Sweet of New York, who, called upon to implement the Rockefeller drug laws, has seen the tumbrils pass by, en route to twenty years' imprisonment; and Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, who has presided for nine years over the government of a drug-torn city. Federal money appropriated to prosecute drug traffic and drug use rose by 1,000 per cent between Nixon and Clinton. We have seen oscillations in drug use, especially a sharp diminution in cocaine consumption, but these have little bearing on the intensity of the drug war. It is for that reason that the panelists join in concluding that, this side of draconian punishment (flogging?) (hanging?) (public?), the drug war cannot claim victory.<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
10. <font size=+1>Where Do You Draw the Line?</font>
<blockquote><I>``. . . How do you make the decision which is which? You did not distinguish among drugs. Are there no drugs that should be banned, and if some should be, how is the line drawn?''
 <P> -- Francis S. Webster III, Austin, Texas</I></blockquote><P><br>

The text on the cover of the drug issue read, 
<p>
<blockquote>THE WAR ON DRUGS IS LOST
 <I><P><li>-- Kill It
 <P><li>-- Go for Legalization
<P><li>-- Free up Police, Courts
 <P><li>-- Reduce Crime</I></blockquote>
<P>

The panelists were not asked to draw the line. But in order to accomplish the stated objectives (free up police, courts; reduce crime), the profit from the merchandising of drugs would need to be all but abolished. This means, clearly, legal access to the most popular drug (marijuana) and the runner-up (cocaine). For most users, soft drugs are preferred over the most toxic, even as beer and wine are preferred over 200-proof alcohol. Crack cocaine is of course readily deduced as a (now) cheap byproduct of cocaine.
<P>
There is some evidence that crack cocaine can induce violent conduct. How, then, to handle the hypothetical buyer who enters a federal drugstore and asks for crack cocaine? Perhaps as was for so many years required in New Zealand of customers for beer -- that they consume it on the premises. . . . But on such specifics, the panelists were not questioned. Dr. Szasz is, on the subject, a libertarian absolute. My sense of it is that most of the others would move step by step provided the profit in drugs were hugely reduced. A beginning might be the legalization of marijuana.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
11. <font size=+1>Alcohol and Drugs</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``. . . you make the ludicrous mistake of comparing alcohol with drugs. With alcohol, you may have a hangover, but you will never experience a 'snapback' to full and complete intoxication. Take a visit to a drug hospital. You will see people wandering around like mind-numbed robots, oblivious to the world around them.''<P>
  -- Oliver A. Rockwog, La Puente, California</I></blockquote><p>

To compare drugs and alcohol is not to equate them. An analogy, by definition, marks similarities on the understanding that there are also dissimilarities. Marijuana, cocaine, and whisky are all psychotropic drugs. Of the three, only marijuana can't kill -- there is no record of death from overdose. Alcohol is responsible for an estimated 100,000 premature deaths every year. And alcohol is the most common wrecker of personal and professional lives, and by far the most common inducement to crime and mayhem. The damage done by drugs to the human body similarly varies. There are the cocaine-induced zombies, some of whom will never recover, and the alcoholics who suffer from more than a hangover because when they wake they turn again to the bottle.<P>
The primary distinction is that alcohol is a happy part of Western culture, and there is the presumptive case against introducing another species of psychotropic drug into that culture. But the panelists, in the issue under discussion, weren't arguing in favor of a supplementary drug. We were addressing the question: What do we do under present circumstances? -- having failed to stop drug traffic, and become progressively accustomed to privations caused by the endless war against drugs?
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
12. <font size=+1>Hard-Drug Users Are Criminals To Begin With</font>
<blockquote><I>``As a 22-year prosecutor in a small rural area, I believe I have a better view of the everyday criminal than does a big-city prosecutor. . . . Marijuana is a fairly harmless substance that could be legalized without any real effect on the crime problem in general. Marijuana is a substance whose effects on the lives of those who take it are similar to alcohol, and people who use it have the ability to be normally functioning members of society. . . .<P>
``On the level of everyday street crime, however, the drug laws are a major advantage to law enforcement. Most of the '50 per cent' of criminals in prison for drug offenses are not there because they are major dealers or dealers at all. They are there because they have a long history of criminality prior to being caught with drugs. Possession of drugs is both easy to prove and very inexpensive to prosecute. But when you send these people to prison, you prevent innumerable thefts and acts of violence. Only very rarely is violence by drug addicts directly related to drugs themselves.''<P>
  -- Fred Schroeder, Marysville, California</I></blockquote><P>

The point plays on a theme widely distracting. Some students of the drug question believe that drug traffic is, as here suggested, merely a convenient vehicle for criminal energies that will find another outlet should the profit in drugs come to an end. What percentage of the drug-related prison population falls into this category (Category #1) is of course unknown. But it is known that many non-criminally-inclined Americans have experimented with drugs (we have used the figure 70 million). Some of these, caught in the act, are in jail (Category #2). And then there are those who become addicted and, in order to satisfy their craving, engage in criminal activity they'd never have engaged in but for their addiction and the high price of drugs. They are in jail either because they were detected in theft, or because they were caught consuming or trafficking in drugs (Category #3). The argument that in order to expedite the imprisonment of Category #1 we should not object to the imprisonment of Categories #2 and #3 is not persuasive.<P><br>

<P>
<blockquote><I>``I saw what happened to promising young men and women in the late Sixties and Seventies when drugs were popularized. I had to raise four children under peer pressure . . . I saw the 'burnouts' and the dropouts. It would tear you to pieces. I saw friends of my sons go off to the University of Michigan clean and come back hopelessly on drugs. I saw families spending themselves into bankruptcy trying to dry them out.''<P>
  -- Lawrence E. Flora, Stuart, Florida</I></blockquote><P>

Who ``popularized'' drugs? An indulgent lifestyle. You write of the burnouts you have seen. How do you propose to diminish their number? They are there notwithstanding our war on drugs. What do you propose? Longer prison terms?

14. <font size=+1>It's Simple: It's Wrong</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I started using marijuana at age 14, speed at 15, mescaline and LSD at 16, THC at 17, cocaine at 18, and freebasing cocaine at 22. I know from first-hand experience what the use of illegal drugs can do. . . . I started doing drugs at age 14 and continued until I reached the age of 27, when I overdosed on cocaine. I believe that I am a better expert than any pundit who has ever read a paper, done a test, or contributed to any article. I know why drugs should never be legalized: to use drugs is wrong. Simple, isn't it? But that is where we must all begin to answer the question involved here.
<P>
``Drug use is wrong; to consciously ingest any substance for the purpose of changing or altering your mood is wrong. The effects of long-term drug use are clearly proven; to be involved in drug use while young affects the mind while growing up; it shapes the emotions of the pubescent who is going through the normal growing pains that all must go through, yet doesn't allow the teenager to view life through a normal viewpoint. I know. I have had to learn how to deal with people all over again since coming clean. It cannot be repeated enough:the use of drugs for the purpose of enjoyment is wrong.
<P>
``I know. I have done drugs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Washington, Vancouver, B.C., Hawaii, Guam, Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Mombasa Kenya, and Singapore. I have done drugs at Parris Island during boot camp; Cherry Point, North Carolina; Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; 29 Palms, California; on board the USS</I> LaMoore County, <I>USS</I> Okinawa, and <I>USS</I> Belleau Wood. <I>It's wrong.''<P>  -- Unsigned</I></blockquote><p>

We agree, it's wrong. And your experiences certainly document that the war against drugs has failed. . . . You were wise to leave Singapore. If caught, you would not have completed your itinerary. But we don't want to bring Singapore to America.

15. <font size=+1>The View from Abroad</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``As a career Foreign Service Officer, I have served in drug-producing countries and seen the disastrous effects our policy has on those nations and how it benefits our enemies. We have created new sources of funds for politicos and cops already disposed to corruption. We risk the lives of brave American agents in a fight in which our 'allies' have no interest and see, rightly, as our problem, not theirs. We have huge bureaucracies in the State Department, Pentagon, CIA, DEA, FBI, AID, and Justice and legions of Beltway bandits thriving on the 'war' and its programs, conferences, etc. But the drugs still come; prices still drop; availability still rises -- and the body count in our streets doesn't stop.

I have two sons who are alcoholics. One of my uncles and my older brother both drank themselves to death. I shudder to think of the additional tragedies we would have had to deal with if drugs were legal. Our laws against drug use are important, Mr. Buckley. May God help you to see that and to engage the enemies of right behavior.

<p>
<hr> 
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>

I'm enclosing your FBI file, which I promise I haven't so much as peeked at. A couple of the guys in Leon Panetta's office brought it by -- they're doing some late spring cleaning over there -- and they thought I'd better forward it to you.
<p>
So I guess it's good news, bad news. The good news is that you're cleared at ``all-access'' level, which means that if you and I are planning some day to meet for lunch in the White House Mess, and I'm not in my office, well, you can walk all over the building looking for me and no Marine is going to shoot you. The bad news is that your tax returns were forwarded to the IRS and it's not clear whether you've adequately reported foreign cash income. Apparently, the IRS will be in touch.
<p> 
What can I say? I'm sorry. The stack of files in the ``Al's Friends'' box inadvertently got mixed up with the ones in the ``Known Enemies'' box, and some low-level Army clerk ordered full FBI work-ups on all the names -- from Jim Baker and Tony Blankley right on down to you, Rusty -- and when the files came back, some of them inadvertently got put in the file box marked ``Political Ammo,'' which sat untouched until this spring, when the campaign team started poking around.
<p>
At which point, the whole thing becomes kind of funny, when you look at it the right way. See, all we wanted was the files on the Travel Office personnel. But, apparently, they were using an old list or something, and the whole kit and caboodle came over from the DOJ, and, well, we've been chuckling over this snafu for days, let me tell you.
<p>
The point is, the Travel Office was being run in a slapdash and haphazard way, but now it's run by us, so things are much better. Naturally, the press is having a field day with this. They don't see the humor in it, I guess. And of course, so much of the outcry is politically motivated.
<p>
It was a simple, honest mistake. We requested the FBI files, we received them, we mislaid them. You know, if I had a nickel for every important thing we've mislaid in this Administration . . . well, you know.
<p>
The problem is, this kind of silly event really plays into the Republicans' hands.
<p>
They're trying to run on the ``character'' issue, again, Rusty. I keep telling Bill not to worry, that I've got character enough for both of us, but the truth is, it might work.
<p>
I was talking to Tipper about this over breakfast.
<p> 
``Tipper,'' I said, ``I'm concerned that the Nixonesque overtones of the FBI file debacle -- ''
<p>
``Shhhhhh,'' she said, peering over a pile of pages. ``I'm trying to read.''
<p>
I was quiet for a moment. Then Tipper looked up.
<p>
 ``Guess,'' she said, ``how many unpaid parking tickets Liddy Dole had in 1985.'' 
<p>
``I'm sorry?''
<p>
``Go on. Guess.''
<p>
``Six?'' I said.
<p>
``Try eleven. That's pretty negligent, don't you think?''
<p>
``Tipper,'' I asked firmly, ``what are you reading?''
<p>
``Let's call it opposition research,'' she answered. ``I just wish that Christie Todd Whitman had done a stint for Reagan or Bush,'' she added.
<p>
``Tipper, I'm trying to share with you how I feel about the character issue. And right now, I feel very vulnerable.''
<p>
``Well, you should.''
<p>
``Tip?''
<p>
``Look, Al,'' she said, ``I was the one who said that '96 was the year you should be on the top of the ticket. I was the one who wanted to invite Susan Thomases over for a drink, dust her wine glass when she left, and send the prints to Ken Starr to compare with the ones he lifted from the Rose Law Firm billing records. I was the one who wanted to wear a wire during one of Hillary's 'stonewall-'em' tirades. Each time you said no.'' 
<p>
``You're darn right I did.''
<p>
But Tipper was on a roll. ``So now you come to me,'' she said, ``worrying about the character issue. Well, honey, the only way to combat the character issue is with a character issue of our own.''
<p>
``What does that mean?'' I asked.
<p>
``It means I have a lot of reading to do before these files are discovered by a White House Fellow cleaning out the dust bunnies in the Lincoln Bedroom the day after tomorrow.''
<p>
``What?''
<p>
``Al, don't worry about it. You're going to be late for your 'Corporate Responsibility Summit.'''
<p>
She was right. I gave her a peck on the cheek. Tipper always makes me feel better.
<p>

<H2>Higgonbotham-D'Amato-Hillary
</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 28
<P>


At graduation ceremonies at Wesleyan, retired Circuit Court Justice Leon Higginbotham closed by making two requests of the students -- that they should see always, and hear, the pleas of invisible people. He closed, ``I trust that you will never sign on to any contract with America that sanctions or promotes exclusion rather than inclusion of the weak, the poor, women, minorities, and persons of color.''
<p>
A week earlier, Senator Al D'Amato of New York anticipated the injunction of Mr. Higginbotham when (on the Don Imus program) he attacked Newt Gingrich and his policies. ``I think that we do a great disservice to ourselves if we think that people want a Republican Party that is perceived as exclusionary.''
<p>
How do non-invisible people evaluate this kind of thing? They begin by making preliminary distinctions. Judge Higginbotham is an all-time, never-say-die liberal. He has spoken mournfully and eloquently of a childhood and youth wrestling with segregation and prejudice. He distinguished himself at the Yale Law School, was appointed judge by President Kennedy, and seems to be forever committed to any public policies that he identifies as in the interest of black Americans. He actively criticized the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas, has appeared jointly with Anita Hill, and has testified in favor of continuing programs of affirmative action.
<p> 
So what does one conclude about his advice to graduating seniors at Wesleyan? That Judge Higginbotham really believes all that business about Republican disdain for the invisible man.
<p> 
Now Al D'Amato is something else, because he is an instructed conservative, who was launched in the Senate by the Conservative Party of New York. What he means to say, when breaking with Newt Gingrich, is that his sense of the political situation is that Gingrich and his programs are unpopular, and, under the circumstances, Al D'Amato retreats from positions he and his party have been associated with for years -- balanced budget, tax reduction, line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform, and the rest of it.
<p> 
Politicians are forever adjusting their positions to the direction of the wind, so why did Senator D'Amato make such a splash? Because the general view of Senator D'Amato is that, unlike Judge Higginbotham, his views are not fixed. Congressman Gingrich commented, ``I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things.'' That isn't true. Gingrich knows. 
<p>
And a third item over the weekend: we are made privy that the First Lady is thinking of adopting a child. Now even after making the greatest effort to understand her motivations, we must reluctantly pass over as primary an explosive appetite for more maternal experience. Mrs. Clinton chose, after the birth of her only child, not to have a second child; that, or else there were medical reasons for this; but no reason whatever to have kept her from adopting a child at any time during the past 16 years. There are good reasons for First Ladies to send their children home for the length of their husbands' tenure, not many for bringing more babies into the White House. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton is and has been for years one of the liveliest girls in town, distinguishing herself at law school and as a practicing lawyer and as wife of a governor and President, consumed by political life. So what are we to make of her sally?
<p>
That her advisors thought it useful, bringing attention as it does to the hearth-like nature of Bill and Hillary's real life, and incidentally blunting the nails of the nymphs who scratch away at her husband.
<p> 
Why do we fall for such things? What drives the wind that drives D'Amato? Why does Higginbotham really believe (he most certainly does believe it) that the GOP is the enemy of the invisible American?
<p>
Because of the GOP assault on school lunches. That's why! Higginbotham would cite that. Al D'Amato's constituents would cite that. Reduced school lunches are the stigmata of the Invisible American, broken by the wheel of Gingrich.
<p>
What exactly did Mr. Gingrich's Congress propose? The Democrats had scheduled a 5.2 per cent increase in school-lunch money.
<p>
The exclusionary Republicans proposed a 4 per cent increase.
<p> 
It is over such as this that Higginbotham weeps, D'Amato defects, and the Clinton family prospectively grows.

``Nauseating and appalling,'' ``political cowardice,'' ``completely cynical'' -- so gay spokesmen responded to President Clinton's announcement that he would sign the Defense of Marriage Act, if it should pass Congress. The move was an election-year triumph of short-term calculations over long-term goals. The Republican bill is in part a pre-emptive response to the gay lobby's Hawaiian gambit, allowing states to reject gay-marriage contracts entered into in other states. Clinton has long said he opposes same-sex marriage, and his gay supporters have agreed to disagree with him on the matter. But the bill also defines marriage, for the purposes of the Federal Government, as the union of one man and one woman, and thus denies federal tax, welfare, pension, health, immigration, and survivor's benefits to same-sex couples. Before the announcement, Marsha Scott, the President's liaison to gays, had been exploring ways of extending such benefits, without the rubric of marriage. Clinton's abandonment of her efforts is what provoked gay wrath. Gays should cheer up. If Clinton wins, helped by such fudges, he can resume the effort (perhaps with the help of a new bill) to give them everything but the name.

It is increasingly unlikely that Republicans will propose to eliminate race and gender preferences despite overwhelming public support for ending the group spoils system. GOP House leaders believe it's impossible to move the Dole - Canady bill over the objections of Gary Franks (R., Conn.), who is 50 per cent of the House black Republican caucus. Franks is satisfied with the Clinton Administration's review of federal affirmative action, endorsing its ``Mend it, don't end it'' line. The media can be counted on to put Republicans on the defensive by highlighting Franks's opposition. The counterweight to Franks would be enlisting Jack Kemp (who has yet to endorse the bill) and J. C. Watts (R., Okla.), who supports the bill's substance but questions its timing, to make the principled case on its behalf. Meanwhile, the Dole campaign is in full panic over the gender gap, and its pollsters are counseling their candidate to downplay his support for the California Civil Rights Initiative, which opponents plan to fight over its alleged devastating effects on women. The CCRI battle is both winnable and unavoidable, and its courageous supporters like Ward Connerly deserve the enthusiastic assistance of fellow Republicans. As Republicans complain about Clinton stealing their issues, it is disheartening to watch them throwing away one of their strongest.<p>

Call them slow learners, but the Clintonistas may finally have found the legislative strategy they had overlooked for three years: forging a majority alliance of Democrats and liberal Republicans. Consider the minimum wage. In mid May the House Republican leadership had chosen a course that seemed well suited to put the debate firmly on GOP terms. An exemption for small businesses -- aping Democratic language from 1989 -- would be included in the minimum-wage bill, making it impossible for the President to sign it and turning the debate into a contest between small business and Big Labor. Just one problem: fellow Republicans wouldn't go along. A stunning 43 of them defected on the small-business exemption. House Majority Leader Dick Armey commented privately before the vote that no more than ten Republicans from union districts had reason to defect; the rest would just be kowtowing to country-club friends. Meanwhile, the Senate is operating in a similar vein. Instead of shifting money from other areas to labor, health, and education -- which would require making some tough choices -- Senate Republicans, at the behest of ``budget hawk'' Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), simply added another $5 billion in discretionary spending to the budget (the vote was lopsided, 75 to 25). The Senate also looks to be cooking up a welfare/Medicaid bill so weak that it will get past liberal roadblock John Chafee (R., R.I.) and hence get a presidential signature. At this rate, the President will manage in the next few months to build a solid record of accomplishment, thanks to his most effective friends on the other side of the aisle.<p>

In Forbes magazine, Steve Hanke draws attention to a recent study by Peter Boone of the London School of Economics on the relationship between economic aid received by 97 countries and their economic growth. He found there wasn't any. The only discernible effect of the aid was to boost the size of recipient governments. Being channeled through governments, foreign aid generated more patronage powers at the expense of the productive sector. Despite the London School of Economics' reputation as a sheltered workshop for the Left, Boone is not alone: LSE has, in the person of the illustrious economist Peter Bauer, an honorable history of questioning the conventional wisdom on foreign aid.

The CNN/Time Virtual Election poll shows Browne at 23 per cent, followed by Dole (19 per cent), Clinton (18), Buchanan (17), John Hagelin (9), and Perot (5). That's fine.

When President Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were supping on ribs, meatloaf, steak, and barbecued chicken in Milwaukee, was there a metaphor there? As James K. Glassman reminds us in the Washington Post, Germany, with its generous retirement system, worker-training programs, and nationalized health care, was a model for Bill Clinton in 1992. Yet now Germany's manufacturing staggers under the burden of labor costs 50 per cent higher than ours. No wonder unemployment in Germany is 10.4 per cent (about twice ours), while its GDP is expected to grow this year by less than 1 per cent. Now Kohl is desperately trying to get Germany's welfare state and public spending under control; a wave of strikes hit the public sector after he declared a two-year wage freeze. President Clinton, meanwhile -- with such initiatives as pushing up the minimum wage -- continues to blunder toward the Eurosclerosis that Chancellor Kohl is struggling to escape.

Occasional NR contributor David Frum roiled Canadian politics last week by posting the banns for a marriage between Canada's two almost-conservative parties, Reform and the Progressive Conservatives. He brought together some sixty of their parliamentary and grass-roots members at a Winds of Change conference in Calgary that the media immediately dubbed a Unite-the-Right cabal. The media, for once, had a point. Canada's last election -- when the Liberals won a substantial victory over a Right divided between the imploding Tory government and the rising Reform Party -- illustrated that in a first-past-the-post electoral system, if the Right is split, the Left triumphs. So there was good reason for an engagement; but how did the happy couple take to each other? They had little difficulty in agreeing on a common economic and social program (lower and flatter taxation, a balanced budget, etc.) that most American conservatives could happily endorse. But they had to gloss over differences on certain key issues, notably abortion and Quebec. And there is a suspicion that the party leaders are either skeptical of an alliance (Reform's Preston Manning) or downright hostile to one (Jean Charest of the Tories). A united Right will emerge in any event: either because conservative voters switch gradually to one of the parties, or because the party leaders make it to the altar. But Pastor Frum's shotgun wedding would take less time.<p>

H. Douglas Anderson, a Seattle-area psychologist, has been fined $1,500 by a state examining board, put on one year's probation, and ordered to take a series of ethics courses for a ``breach of ethics'' that ``fell below professional standards.'' The crime? A patient had asked what he thought about her impending abortion. He told her that it would be wrong.

Christina Jeffrey, the former House Historian ousted after being falsely accused of having Nazi sympathies, has sued Reps. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Barney Frank (D., Mass.), who first made the charges, and Speaker Newt Gingrich, who failed to defend her, for slander and defamation of character. Gingrich sinned by omission and subsequently acknowledged the delinquency. But his Right Honorable colleagues have never apologized for defaming Professor Jeffrey before the world (in a more honorable age they would have been challenged to duels). Initially Mrs. Jeffrey sought nothing more than compensation for her out-of-pocket expenses and the correction of the public record. Mr. Gingrich having refused the first, she has been forced to take legal recourse. Her determination to set the record straight might serve us all eventually. Former Labor Secretary Ray Donovan famously asked, after a similar trip through the mill, where he could go to get his reputation back. Christina Jeffrey's lawsuit may caution those who would casually destroy others' reputations to be mindful of their own.

Russia is in a state of anarchy, with its reforms in shambles

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE afternoon light filtered through the linden and chestnut trees in the city park, and martial music played over loudspeakers attached to the branches as a large crowd waited in the humid heat for the beginning of a speech by Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist candidate for president.
<P>
After a day of campaigning in other parts of the pro-Communist Bryansk region 250 miles southwest of Moscow, near the border with Ukraine, Zyuganov had come to Klintsy, a dilapidated city of 70,000 full of weathered wooden houses and rusting five-story housing projects.
<P>
The mood of the crowd was both nervous and expectant. Virtually all the city's factories had been closed down and many people had gone for seven or eight months without pay. Klintsy was also in the heart of the Chernobyl radiation zone, and there had been no government payments for radiation exposure since February.
<P>
I asked a woman in a print dress if she was supporting Zyuganov.
<P>
``We will all vote for Zyuganov,'' she said, ``because we want someone to give us our lives back. There are only two factories in the city that are operating. All the others are dead. We want to be able to work. Only the businessmen are wealthy. Everyone else is unemployed and hungry.''
<P>
Others crowded around. ``The children in school have nothing to eat,'' said a middle-aged woman. ``In the fourth lesson in literature, my daughter fell into a coma. They said it was a sign of epilepsy but she is not the only one. The children are undernourished.''
<P>
``The pensioners have nothing to live on,'' said another woman. ``I worked for 41 years on the Boyevik collective farm. It's painful to work so hard and be left with nothing.''
<P>
``The pensioners at least get something,'' replied a man in a worker's cap. ``What about the workers? It's been seven months without pay.''
<P>
``Everyone's nerves are on edge,'' said another woman, ``We don't see any future.''
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>ITH only two weeks to go until the presidential elections, the scene in Klintsy is typical of much of Russia. The country is seething with discontent, and there is widespread fear of violence.
<P>
At the end of May, most public-opinion polls showed Yeltsin moving into the lead, but Russian polls have a tradition of inaccuracy, and at least one opinion poll showed Zyuganov with an overwhelming lead. At the same time, all the polls are almost certainly underestimating the appeal of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party.
<P>
The aggressiveness of the Communists, whose constituency includes pensioners, the poor, and others who feel cheated by the reforms carried out over the last five years, has inspired widespread fear. ``If Zyuganov is elected and tries to redistribute property,'' said Vyacheslav Golubtsov, a local newspaper editor in the pro-Communist Kostroma oblast, ``it will be extremely dangerous. Many of the banks belong to criminal groups who have no intention of giving up their property.''
<P>
Many of Russia's new businessmen have taken steps to send both their money and their families out of the country in the event of a Zyuganov victory. At the same time, however, many doubt that Yeltsin will surrender power no matter who wins the election. General Aleksandr Korzhakov, Yeltsin's chief of security and closest confidant, called in May for the postponement of the elections to preserve social peace. As one Yeltsin campaign aide put it, ``We would like to win the election legally. But if that is not possible, Yeltsin is making plans to make sure that he stays in power anyway.'' In any case, there is widespread fear that Yeltsin will falsify the results. According to Kremlin officials, about one-third of the voters will not go to the polls, and the Communists are mobilizing 200,000 poll-watchers to make sure the non-voters' votes are not cast by others.
<P>
The election, in many respects, will be a referendum on five years of reform which have changed Russia beyond recognition. In a country where there were long lines for bread, the stores are now full of goods. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, where twenty years ago a Volkswagen drew a crowd, the streets are choked with traffic and there are many late-model Western cars.
<P>
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that Russian voters will give a ringing endorsement of reform.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE direct reason that millions of people are likely to support totalitarian parties is that across the length and breadth of the country, people are not being paid. The situation in Klintsy is typical: paychecks are anywhere from three to eight months behind, and there have been delays in paying pensions, family subsidies, and even ``radiation'' subsidies for those affected by the accident at Chernobyl.
<P>
People are not being paid because there is no money in the government budget. Russia has one of the most confiscatory tax systems in the world, taxing profits at over 90 per cent, but this has not helped the government to collect money. Faced with the choice of breaking the law or going bankrupt, businessmen in Russia regularly do most of their business off the books. Officially, the government collects 70 per cent of the money it requires but, in reality, the figure is believed to be closer to 50 per cent.
<P>
Until 1994, workers in the state sector got paid anyway because the government simply printed money. This, however, led to an inflation rate of 25 to 30 per cent a month, and after Viktor Chernomyrdin became prime minister, the growth in the money supply was sharply reduced. The result was that the inflation rate fell to about 3 per cent a month, but the payment delays started to lengthen.
<P>
In March, Yeltsin announced that all the money owed to those who should have been paid out of the federal budget would be paid. In practice, payment has been uneven from one part of the country to another, and in any case it does not affect the workers in factories which have been privatized.
<P>
These workers are supposed be paid out of the profits of the enterprise, but many of the privatized enterprises have been unprofitable. And so the directors of these enterprises regularly turned to the regional authorities, who tended to help them pay their workers. With the tightening in monetary policies, however, these requests began to be refused. As a result, workers in the ``private'' sector have not benefited even from the halting measures taken to pay state employees.
<P>
Besides the inability of the government to support Russian industry, another reason why workers are not being paid is that in many instances, local officials and factory directors are depositing the payroll in commercial banks in order to collect several months' worth of interest. Depositing money at high interest is a new experience for many Russians, and a psychology has grown up according to which pay for workers is a low priority. As a result, even if a factory director or regional official receives money for salaries, the money will not necessarily be used for its intended purpose.
<P>
The consequences of the payment crisis have been grim. In provincial cities throughout the country children are undernourished and, in some cases, fainting from hunger. Chaos has been created in families, where workers have become dependent on their parents -- whose pensions are still being paid, albeit with delays -- or on their wives who are still receiving subsidies for their children. The life expectancy for men has fallen to 57 years, an all-time low for an industrial nation.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>T IS possible that even with the delays in paying salaries, the Russian people would have supported the reforms, but there is an atmosphere of moral degradation which drains people of the will to endure hardship. Its principal sources are knowledge of the reality of the privatization process and the growing domination of organized crime.
<P>
When the privatization of state industry began, workers were promised that they would be able to participate. But, this has not been the case. Recent years did nothing to lessen the difference in living conditions between ordinary citizens and members of the former Communist <I>nomenklatura</I>.
<P>
The years 1990 to 1992 were a period of transition for the <I>nomenklatura</I>, which was mesmerized by the opportunities that reform opened up for acquiring unearned wealth. The law on cooperatives made it possible for factory directors to attach commercial enterprises to their factories and, with the help of creative bookkeeping, divert vast amounts of state resources to private use. When prices were decontrolled in January 1992, these commercial ventures were already active and producing income that the factory directors could constantly reinvest.
<P>
For ordinary people, the situation was quite different. Everything they had was in their savings accounts, the value of which simply melted away in a few weeks of hyperinflation. As a result, by the time Russian enterprises were converted into joint stock companies and everyone was given a supposedly equal chance to own a share of Russian industry, the conditions were already grossly unequal. Workers had nothing but vouchers. These were issued to them for free, but most workers had to sell them under the pressure of sudden impoverishment. The directors and their close aides, at the same time, had vast sums of money which they could use to buy up shares, and they soon emerged as the factories' new owners.
<P>
At the same time as Russia was being treated to what became known as ``<I>nomenklatura</I> privatization,'' the country began to be taken over by organized crime, a development that also had its roots in the period of perestroika. The first private businesses in the Soviet Union were organized at a time when it was illegal to have private guards, and they quickly became the victims of gangs, which demanded a share of their income.
<P>
At first, the gangs restricted themselves to extorting money from the operators of stores and street kiosks, but as they accumulated vast wealth, the criminals went into business and eventually took over banks. The result is that in Russia today virtually all major commercial structures, not to mention the smaller ones, either pay tribute to or are controlled by the criminal world. This is one of the reasons why doing business in Russia is so dangerous. The result of the competitive struggle for markets is frequently that one of the competitors is killed. At the same time, many sources of financing are mafia controlled, and anyone who falls into debt must fear for his life, because Russian criminals will kill a businessman over a debt simply to terrorize others. One year, criminals killed six thousand Russian businessmen and raided over seven hundred company offices, yet there has been little serious effort to investigate the overwhelming majority of these crimes.
<P>
A sign of just how far the situation has gone was the fate of Ivan Kivelidi, the head of the Russian Business Roundtable, an association of private businessmen. As of last July, nine members of the organization's board of directors had been murdered in the previous two years. Kivelidi was well known for his criticism of the links between corrupt bureaucrats, the old <I>nomenklatura</I>, and organized crime. So, in July, he announced his intention to organize and finance resistance to criminal terror against private businessmen. On August 3, he and his secretary, Zara Ismailova, were taken to the hospital with signs of acute poisoning. On August 7, the Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that they were the victims of radiation poisoning, reportedly from cadmium.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HERE is a mood of resignation surrounding the elections. It is common to hear someone say that voters face a choice between the ``terrible'' (Yeltsin) and the ``unspeakably horrible'' (Zhirinovsky or Zyuganov), in which case, the obvious choice is the terrible.
<P>
As matters stand, there are four candidates who are expected to do well in the first round of voting: Yeltsin, Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, and Grigory Yavlinsky, the economist who co-authored the ``500 Days'' program for converting the Soviet Union into a market economy.
<P>
By all indications, Zyuganov has the support of pensioners, collective farmers, army officers who have not been paid, the indigent, and a large percentage of the workers who have not received their salaries. His strength is that he does not seem to have any serious competition for these voters, and their share of the final vote has been variously estimated at between 30 and 35 per cent. Their support could result in Zyuganov's coming in first in the first round of voting.
<P>
Yeltsin draws <I>his</I> support from young people, businessmen who enriched themselves during the period of reform, and Russians in all walks of life who want stability and do not want Zyuganov. Yeltsin's claims that a Communist victory could lead to civil war may be overdrawn, but they touch a responsive chord in people who want a quiet life, distrust the Communists, and are exhausted from decades of social transformations. Yeltsin is now expected to get 25 per cent of the vote, but polls, which may or may not be reliable, suggest his support is rising rapidly.
<P>
The third and most enigmatic candidate is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has performed better than expected in every election in which he has run. Zhirinovsky appeals to small businessmen, to Russian chauvinists, and to people living in border regions. He also appeals to those who see in him a man capable of taking decisive action to impose order. His voters often do not admit to pollsters that they intend to vote for him, which makes his share of the vote very difficult to predict. It could, however, be over 15 per cent.
<P>
This leaves Yavlinsky, who is popular with intellectuals and whose program calls for tax reform, job creation, and an immediate end to the war in Chechnya. Yavlinsky, aware that he is unlikely to win, has entered into negotiations with Yeltsin, but so far his asking price -- the post of prime minister -- has been too high. If, as expected, he runs, his vote is likely to be no more than 10 per cent, with the rest of the vote split among other candidates, including General Aleksandr Lebed and an eye surgeon, Svyatoslov Fyodorov.
<P>
Given this likely outcome of the first round of voting, the key to victory in a second round between Zyuganov and Yeltsin is the ability to win over the voters who went for the other candidates, particularly those who voted for Zhirinovsky and Yavlinsky. (The supporters of Lebed and Fyodorov are expected to vote for Yeltsin.)
<P>
Zhirinovsky has joined Yeltsin in warning that a victory for the Communists could lead to civil war, and he will certainly throw his support to Yeltsin in the second round if he does not make it to the second round himself. What cannot be predicted, however, is how many of Zhirinovsky's supporters would follow his advice. His voters are, by nature, oppositionist, and in the past they have been more drawn to the Communists than to Yeltsin despite the fact that Zhirinovsky has been a strong supporter of Yeltsin in the Russian parliament.
<P>
At the same time, it is also not clear whom Yavlinsky's voters will support in the second round. Many might support Yeltsin to head off a victory by the Communists, but anger with Yeltsin over corruption and the Chechen war, coupled with the belief that Yeltsin cannot be considered a democrat, may lead many of them to vote for ``none of the above.''
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE election June 16 will be the first presidential election in Russia's history as an independent state, and it may well be its most fateful. If the Communists win, nearly any of the measures that they have proposed -- from freezing prices on some items to redistributing privatized property -- have the potential for provoking either violence or economic collapse, in that way compelling new and more draconian coercive measures to keep a deteriorating situation under control.
<P>
If Yeltsin wins, however, it is not certain that violence can be avoided. Employing people without paying them is not a long-term solution for a modern economy, and the Yeltsin ``democrats'' no longer have the moral authority to institute far-reaching economic reforms. Eventually, many of the plants that produce products for which there is no demand will need to be closed, and adequate measures will have to be taken to provide for workers who are displaced. To do this, however, requires a state based on law and respect for individual dignity. This is what Yeltsin has not been able to provide.
<P>
What has happened under Yeltsin is that economic reform has been taken as an end in itself and a goal that justified any number of illegal and undemocratic practices. Under these conditions, the government has succeeded not only in unleashing the corrupt elements in a very fragile society but in discrediting for many the idea of reform itself.
<P>
Only a state based on law can start Russia on the path to a better future, but, on the basis of their records, this is something that neither Yeltsin nor Zyuganov can offer to the beleaguered Russian voter.

<p>
<hr> 
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>

I'm enclosing your FBI file, which I promise I haven't so much as peeked at. A couple of the guys in Leon Panetta's office brought it by -- they're doing some late spring cleaning over there -- and they thought I'd better forward it to you.
<p>
So I guess it's good news, bad news. The good news is that you're cleared at ``all-access'' level, which means that if you and I are planning some day to meet for lunch in the White House Mess, and I'm not in my office, well, you can walk all over the building looking for me and no Marine is going to shoot you. The bad news is that your tax returns were forwarded to the IRS and it's not clear whether you've adequately reported foreign cash income. Apparently, the IRS will be in touch.
<p> 
What can I say? I'm sorry. The stack of files in the ``Al's Friends'' box inadvertently got mixed up with the ones in the ``Known Enemies'' box, and some low-level Army clerk ordered full FBI work-ups on all the names -- from Jim Baker and Tony Blankley right on down to you, Rusty -- and when the files came back, some of them inadvertently got put in the file box marked ``Political Ammo,'' which sat untouched until this spring, when the campaign team started poking around.
<p>
At which point, the whole thing becomes kind of funny, when you look at it the right way. See, all we wanted was the files on the Travel Office personnel. But, apparently, they were using an old list or something, and the whole kit and caboodle came over from the DOJ, and, well, we've been chuckling over this snafu for days, let me tell you.
<p>
The point is, the Travel Office was being run in a slapdash and haphazard way, but now it's run by us, so things are much better. Naturally, the press is having a field day with this. They don't see the humor in it, I guess. And of course, so much of the outcry is politically motivated.
<p>
It was a simple, honest mistake. We requested the FBI files, we received them, we mislaid them. You know, if I had a nickel for every important thing we've mislaid in this Administration . . . well, you know.
<p>
The problem is, this kind of silly event really plays into the Republicans' hands.
<p>
They're trying to run on the ``character'' issue, again, Rusty. I keep telling Bill not to worry, that I've got character enough for both of us, but the truth is, it might work.
<p>
I was talking to Tipper about this over breakfast.
<p> 
``Tipper,'' I said, ``I'm concerned that the Nixonesque overtones of the FBI file debacle -- ''
<p>
``Shhhhhh,'' she said, peering over a pile of pages. ``I'm trying to read.''
<p>
I was quiet for a moment. Then Tipper looked up.
<p>
 ``Guess,'' she said, ``how many unpaid parking tickets Liddy Dole had in 1985.'' 
<p>
``I'm sorry?''
<p>
``Go on. Guess.''
<p>
``Six?'' I said.
<p>
``Try eleven. That's pretty negligent, don't you think?''
<p>
``Tipper,'' I asked firmly, ``what are you reading?''
<p>
``Let's call it opposition research,'' she answered. ``I just wish that Christie Todd Whitman had done a stint for Reagan or Bush,'' she added.
<p>
``Tipper, I'm trying to share with you how I feel about the character issue. And right now, I feel very vulnerable.''
<p>
``Well, you should.''
<p>
``Tip?''
<p>
``Look, Al,'' she said, ``I was the one who said that '96 was the year you should be on the top of the ticket. I was the one who wanted to invite Susan Thomases over for a drink, dust her wine glass when she left, and send the prints to Ken Starr to compare with the ones he lifted from the Rose Law Firm billing records. I was the one who wanted to wear a wire during one of Hillary's 'stonewall-'em' tirades. Each time you said no.'' 
<p>
``You're darn right I did.''
<p>
But Tipper was on a roll. ``So now you come to me,'' she said, ``worrying about the character issue. Well, honey, the only way to combat the character issue is with a character issue of our own.''
<p>
``What does that mean?'' I asked.
<p>
``It means I have a lot of reading to do before these files are discovered by a White House Fellow cleaning out the dust bunnies in the Lincoln Bedroom the day after tomorrow.''
<p>
``What?''
<p>
``Al, don't worry about it. You're going to be late for your 'Corporate Responsibility Summit.'''
<p>
She was right. I gave her a peck on the cheek. Tipper always makes me feel better.
<p>

<H2>Higgonbotham-D'Amato-Hillary
</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 28
<P>


At graduation ceremonies at Wesleyan, retired Circuit Court Justice Leon Higginbotham closed by making two requests of the students -- that they should see always, and hear, the pleas of invisible people. He closed, ``I trust that you will never sign on to any contract with America that sanctions or promotes exclusion rather than inclusion of the weak, the poor, women, minorities, and persons of color.''
<p>
A week earlier, Senator Al D'Amato of New York anticipated the injunction of Mr. Higginbotham when (on the Don Imus program) he attacked Newt Gingrich and his policies. ``I think that we do a great disservice to ourselves if we think that people want a Republican Party that is perceived as exclusionary.''
<p>
How do non-invisible people evaluate this kind of thing? They begin by making preliminary distinctions. Judge Higginbotham is an all-time, never-say-die liberal. He has spoken mournfully and eloquently of a childhood and youth wrestling with segregation and prejudice. He distinguished himself at the Yale Law School, was appointed judge by President Kennedy, and seems to be forever committed to any public policies that he identifies as in the interest of black Americans. He actively criticized the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas, has appeared jointly with Anita Hill, and has testified in favor of continuing programs of affirmative action.
<p> 
So what does one conclude about his advice to graduating seniors at Wesleyan? That Judge Higginbotham really believes all that business about Republican disdain for the invisible man.
<p> 
Now Al D'Amato is something else, because he is an instructed conservative, who was launched in the Senate by the Conservative Party of New York. What he means to say, when breaking with Newt Gingrich, is that his sense of the political situation is that Gingrich and his programs are unpopular, and, under the circumstances, Al D'Amato retreats from positions he and his party have been associated with for years -- balanced budget, tax reduction, line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform, and the rest of it.
<p> 
Politicians are forever adjusting their positions to the direction of the wind, so why did Senator D'Amato make such a splash? Because the general view of Senator D'Amato is that, unlike Judge Higginbotham, his views are not fixed. Congressman Gingrich commented, ``I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things.'' That isn't true. Gingrich knows. 
<p>
And a third item over the weekend: we are made privy that the First Lady is thinking of adopting a child. Now even after making the greatest effort to understand her motivations, we must reluctantly pass over as primary an explosive appetite for more maternal experience. Mrs. Clinton chose, after the birth of her only child, not to have a second child; that, or else there were medical reasons for this; but no reason whatever to have kept her from adopting a child at any time during the past 16 years. There are good reasons for First Ladies to send their children home for the length of their husbands' tenure, not many for bringing more babies into the White House. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton is and has been for years one of the liveliest girls in town, distinguishing herself at law school and as a practicing lawyer and as wife of a governor and President, consumed by political life. So what are we to make of her sally?
<p>
That her advisors thought it useful, bringing attention as it does to the hearth-like nature of Bill and Hillary's real life, and incidentally blunting the nails of the nymphs who scratch away at her husband.
<p> 
Why do we fall for such things? What drives the wind that drives D'Amato? Why does Higginbotham really believe (he most certainly does believe it) that the GOP is the enemy of the invisible American?
<p>
Because of the GOP assault on school lunches. That's why! Higginbotham would cite that. Al D'Amato's constituents would cite that. Reduced school lunches are the stigmata of the Invisible American, broken by the wheel of Gingrich.
<p>
What exactly did Mr. Gingrich's Congress propose? The Democrats had scheduled a 5.2 per cent increase in school-lunch money.
<p>
The exclusionary Republicans proposed a 4 per cent increase.
<p> 
It is over such as this that Higginbotham weeps, D'Amato defects, and the Clinton family prospectively grows.

<LI>District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry spent a week at a Maryland retreat to ``engage in a program of spiritual and physical renewal.'' He was not missed. During the Barry years, taxes soared while services plummeted (except insofar as patronage, divvied among the mayor's numerous supporters, was a service). Congress finally had to put the District's affairs under a financial control board. Barry, a recovering drug addict, said his vacation was necessary to prevent a relapse. More likely, the District's relapse into some honest government has been too stressful.

In the shadowy world of spin and furtive self-promotion that is the race to be Bob Dole's running-mate, Ohio Gov. George Voinovich has until recently been on the upswing. Voinovich is popular, Catholic, and from a state rich in electoral votes. Just one problem: he is lacking in conservative hormones. Voinovich recently confessed he just didn't understand why Republicans would try to repeal Clinton's gas-tax increase (``If the deficit is such a problem, how can you be arguing to reduce the gas tax . . . ?'') There's a lot Voinovich doesn't get: he recently proposed re-instating a one-cent tax on soft drinks even after Ohio voters had repealed it; he floated a gas-tax increase after his 1994 re-election; he defends racial preferences, and doggedly resists attempts to require a super-majority in the legislature for passing tax increases. Dole would do better to look to California, where both Attorney General Dan Lungren and Rep. Chris Cox are intelligent, energetic, and conservative. Go West, mature man.

What to make of Felix Rohatyn, long known as a zero-sum economics man and advocate of industrial policy? His lengthy paean to economic growth, published in the Wall Street Journal, could have been written by an RNC staffer. At 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent per year, economic growth is woefully inadequate. Cut capital-gains tax rates. Restrain entitlement growth. Balance the budget in order to satisfy financial markets. Do all this, says Mr. Rohatyn, and we'd tack one percentage point onto the national growth rate, add millions of new jobs, and halt the sickening decline of living standards for those at the bottom of income distribution. Election-year epiphanies are always a bit suspect. (We fully expect the Clinton administration to pre-empt Republican tax-cut efforts with a proposal of its own.) But Rohatyn's musings seem genuine. ``As a traditional Democrat,'' he wrote, ``I have always believed that freedom, fairness, and wealth, basic to modern democracy, required an essentially redistributionist philosophy . . . The experience of the last two decades . . . has very much shaken that view. Fairness does not require the redistribution of wealth; it requires the creation of wealth . . .'' Perhaps he is aware of what fellow Austrian Friedrich Hayek wrote in 1944: ``We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis . . . except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our part.''

As we write, O. J. Simpson is addressing the Oxford Union. The format calls for him to speak for ten minutes, then answer questions. The Union, in its 175 years, has sponsored guests who are conversant with the subject they address. Normally, they debate a proposition, but there were no invitations issued, as far as we know, to Marcia Clark or Christopher Darden, to argue the only subject on which Mr.Simpson is qualified to speak, namely how to kill a woman and her walking companion in Los Angeles, leave traces vivid enough to light up the Empire State Building, and appear two years later as a guest of the Oxford Union. The New York Post reporter advises that ``British police [at the airport] mounted a massive security operation at public expense to protect Simpson after his request that his bodyguards carry guns was turned down.'' On the subject of the usefulness of guns O. J. is also an expert. Proceeding without them can leave an awful mess.

``We're leaner, meaner, and going nowhere fast.'' Economists ``don't really know'' why. And it has been that way for more than two decades, says New York Times economic reporter Louis Uchitelle. Two decades? Well yes, economic growth over the past 25 years has averaged 2.5 per cent per annum, compared to 4.4 per cent for the prior quarter-century. (Had we maintained the earlier rate, per-capita income would be $10,000 higher today.) But economic stagnation is hardly, as Uchitelle claims, a poorly understood fact of modern life. After all, real GDP grew by one-third from the end of 1982 through 1989. The principal stimulus, most economists say, was the decline in marginal tax rates; letting taxpayers keep more of each added dollar gave them more reason to work and produce. But that wasn't all. This period also saw less government interference in business -- evidenced by a 50 per cent decline in the number of pages of federal regulations issued between 1981 and 1989. And a generally less expansive government: federal spending fell from 23.3 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 21.3 per cent in 1989. Since 1989 all these vectors have reversed. Private employers are feverishly downsizing and investing in new equipment. This strategy will eventually deliver a higher standard of living -- when the government lets it.

Gay-rights activists are about to consummate their Hawaiian gambit. This summer, state judge Kevin Chang is expected to hold, in the case of Baehr v. Lewin, that anti-sex-discrimination language in the state's constitution makes it illegal for Hawaii to refuse marriage licenses to gay couples. Under the ``full faith and credit'' clause of the Constitution, every other state in the Union might be forced to recognize gay marriages sanctioned by Hawaii. In a counter-gambit, Rep. Bob Barr (R., Ga.) and Sen. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) are pushing a marriage-defense bill that would free states from the requirement of honoring same-sex marriages sanctioned in other states, and that defines marriage, for the purposes of federal law, as union between a man and a woman. Not exactly radical stuff. President Clinton is already distancing himself from same-sex marriages. But the bill still puts him in a tight spot. Does he side with his cultural Left or with the vast majority of Americans? Clinton's partial-birth veto suggests the former, which should give voters yet another reason to sue for divorce in the fall.

The U.S. has nondiscriminatory (i.e., normal) trading relations with 150-odd countries, which go under the misleading name of ``most-favored-nation'' (MFN) status. Renewing MFN for China was controversial two years ago, when Tiananmen Square was fresh in people's minds. MFN is now up for renewal again, and is no less controversial this time; added to China's human-rights problems are its sales of nuclear material to various rogue states and its attempt to intimidate Taiwan. But denying MFN is a crude weapon; it would, among other things, devastate Hong Kong's economy. Bob Dole has committed himself to supporting the Administration in seeking renewal. Denying MFN, he says, ``would not free a single dissident, halt a single missile sale, prevent a single threat to Taiwan, or save a single innocent life.'' Quite right.

You know how some people study every syllable uttered by a maximum leader, to try to detect a wind in motion? What did you make of that reference by Franco to Don Juan? -- that he would be appointed successor? What did you make of that dangling participle in Ralph Reed's mention of abortion and the Republican plank? -- that a compromise was in order? Well, we are that way with the New York Times, the ideological Bureau of Weights and Measures. For forty years we've waited to hear the Times refer to somebody or something as ``ultra liberal.'' Not yet, but get this! In a book review last week, Dorothy Gallagher was permitted to get away with a reference to ``the Rosenberg case'' in the context of espionage activity. That is thunderous stuff, suggesting that indeed the Rosenbergs were guilty (they were of course, and everybody has known it for a generation, but the other side hasn't capitulated). More, the reviewer refers to the Institute of Pacific Relations, the snuggery in which Owen Lattimore operated, in a context that clearly suggests he was engaged in subversive activity. Remember Joe McCarthy? He said that Lattimore was his do-or-die case. Lattimore loyalists were as outspoken as the Hiss people. What we have seen is a cataclysmic move.

On the evening of May 12, St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York accommodated a Tridentine Mass, standard in Catholicism from the sixteenth-century Council of Trent until 1963, when Vatican II supplanted it with a new Mass, in the vernacular. Trent represented a largely successful effort to consolidate and regularize Catholic practice in the teeth of doctrinal gales blowing down from Germany and Geneva. Many today see the Latin Mass as a symbol of resistance to the corrosions of modern culture. In his solemn high Mass that morning John Cardinal O'Connor expressed surprise that the Tridentine Mass scheduled for that evening was being viewed by the press as a gesture of discontent within the Church. He professed to see it, rather, as an authorized, indeed normal, occurrence. Yet St. Patrick's has high visibility and, until now, no Tridentine Masses. The celebration was done by Alfons Cardinal Stickler, a visiting cardinal of curial rank. In the evening, Cardinal O'Connor termed it ``historic.'' Four thousand worshippers filled the cathedral. It is difficult to avoid the impression that some vectors may indeed be shifting, and that some of the faithful may be tiring of the John - Jane - Gyp English of the awful contemporary translations.

The Dartmouth Review is on a roll, under the editorship of James S. Panero, a sophomore, no less. The editorial writing is clear, clean, and bright. The rebellious flavor is sui generis sophomore, and can be just plain fun, as witness the latest fusillade at the expense of the arch-enemy, Mr. Freedman, president of Dartmouth. . . . A half-page ad. Collegium Dartmuthens/In Aqua Vitae Conditum A.D. 1770 (a huge wine barrel with roisterers on all sides). Then in huge boldface: ``How much would you contribute in exchange for James Freedman's resignation?/Please fill out this form, cut it out and mail it to: The Committee to Save Dartmouth, P.O. Box 5077, Hanover, N.H. 03755.'' Boys will be, and should be, boys. Crossing the fun-line, however, is a review of the tormented president's latest column. ``If I wrote this way on my class papers, I'd surely fail out of Dartmouth. I am curious now to speak to Freedman in person. I bet he talks with his eyes crossed, or drools . . .'' Icky stuff. And a pity, given the excellence on the whole.

WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>t their weekly meeting on April 22, Republican senators' legislative directors received their marching orders: they were to expect a cloture vote on immigration and then ``stall'' for the rest of the week. For many present, it was a low point in a month in which it had become painfully clear that despite having a majority in both houses of Congress, Republicans were unable to set the national agenda. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was ``listless and detached'' in meetings, recalls one Senate aide.
<P>
But that was before Sen. Phil Gramm and Speaker Newt Gingrich raised the issue of a 4.3-cent gas-tax cut. Dole started to demand that any increase in the minimum wage be linked to the cut and to labor-law reform. ``For the first time in a long time . . . Dole was aggressive and focused,'' says the aide. Dole wasn't the only one. Republicans were on the offensive again.
<P>
Even in a city where moods swing more frequently than the First Lady changes her hair style (not to mention her testimony), the effect of such a minor policy feint on the Republican psyche was remarkable. Together with the Clinton Administration's withdrawal of the nomination of the hapless Charles Stack for a federal judgeship, it was enough to pull many Republicans temporarily out of their funk. Yet the gas-tax initiative also highlights the small-mindedness of Republicans. They are prone to go in for measures that are piecemeal, reactive, and tactical.
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, defeatism has continued to plague the GOP. Some Republicans despair of the party's chances of holding onto Congress. Many more treat the Dole campaign as a grim joke. Highly visible spats within the party both result from this defeatism and cause it to deepen. Republicans are clashing over abortion, as usual, but also over campaign strategy, the role of Newt Gingrich, the proper response to organized labor's political resurgence, and the politics of the minimum wage. Participants in these sometimes unpleasant debates include almost every branch of the party: representatives and senators, state party chairmen and governors, conservatives and liberals. And that is the down side of the remarkable Republican success in 1993 - 94: Never before in a modern election has the GOP had to coordinate this many power centers. In 1988 House Minority Leader Bob Michel could have campaigned for Angela Davis and no one would have noticed; now many Republicans draw media attention. There are more Republican governors than at any time in recent memory -- and they are all over the lot ideologically.
<P>
This shows up most clearly on the abortion issue. Congressional Republicans' one unequivocal recent success was the partial-birth-abortion ban, which briefly isolated Clinton as an abortion-rights extremist. Moderate Republicans, however, could not tolerate this state of affairs, and so Governors Whitman, Weld, Wilson, and Pataki quickly diverted attention from President Clinton to intra-Republican squabbling. They announced their intention to lead a platform fight in San Diego. Whitman and Weld even defended Clinton's veto of the partial-birth ban.
<P>
This can perhaps best be understood as the political equivalent of a psychological disorder: Munchausen by proxy, a syndrome which leads sufferers to inflict illnesses on others in order to get attention for themselves. Gov. Whitman, one of the nation's most prominent Republicans, recently graced the cover of the New York Times Magazine under the plaintive headline, ``It's My Party, Too'' -- which certainly suggests a pathological need for attention.
<P>
It also reflects the fact that most abortion-rights Republicans know they can't win a fight at the convention. To judge by the states' delegate selections, the convention could well be dominated by committed social conservatives. Pro-lifers are a majority of even the Massachusetts delegation, much to Gov. Weld's consternation.
<P>
So instead of organizing at the grassroots, these Republicans take their grievances to the national media, which will always lend a sympathetic ear. If they stage a floor fight in San Diego and lose it, they can present the convention to elite opinionmakers as a replay of Houston 1992, thus strengthening their hand for 2000 in the event Dole loses in November. This sort of thing is nothing new. Says Don Devine, a veteran of the Reagan Administration and a prominent Dole supporter, ``I've been involved in Republican conventions for over twenty years, and every Republican convention brings out the 'shoot-the-wounded' Republicans. It's a disease outbreak we have to expect.'' But the weaker the candidate appears, the greater the likelihood that the disease will become an epidemic.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>hich is why Bob Dole's dramatic and wholly unpredicted decision to resign his Senate seat was exactly what the campaign needed. The World's Greatest Deliberative Body, with its individualistic members and arcane procedural traps, was working against bold revival strategies. ``Daschle and Kennedy are beating up on Dole right now, and Clinton has the luxury of sitting back and beating up on the whole process,'' a House aide observed last week. And maverick Republicans typically do some beating up of their own. Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) could, for instance, be the undoing of House Republicans' plan to send President Clinton another welfare and Medicaid reform bill. Chafee voted for reforms last year only as part of a historic, comprehensive balanced budget; he is unlikely to support meaningful reform in a stand-alone bill. Since Republicans have a one-vote majority on the Senate Finance Committee, his defection could kill the bill. ``I don't like any strategy that depends on John Chafee,'' says a conservative Senate leadership aide.
<P>
Dole will have to follow up his departure from the Senate with additional moves to reassert his leadership over the party. In the absence of adult leadership, the Republicans have been stealing a page from Lord of the Flies. They are picking on the most vulnerable among them -- and Newt Gingrich is Piggy, the rotund intellectual who gets felled by a rock. Surrounded by these squabbling children, Dole has been acting like a distant older brother. The Republican rank-and-filers who expect him to silence treasonous voices don't appreciate his aversion to conflict and controversy. ``His reputation [as a tough-guy] comes from a few stories newspapers play up, but conflict avoidance is how he really operates,'' explains a veteran Dole-watcher. (His father, Doran Dole, dealt with family conflicts in much the same way.) As majority leader, Dole has always found consensus by persuading and cajoling his colleagues -- not by twisting arms or knocking heads together.
<P>
Take his reaction to a recent foray by his crony Sen. Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.). D'Amato, who appears also to be afflicted with Munchausen by proxy, made waves by echoing liberal rhetoric to the effect that the Republican Congress had gone too far, threatening to inundate the nation with ``dirty drinking water.'' When challenged, D'Amato escalated, attacking Newt Gingrich and the GOP's ``philosophical ayatollahs'' (it wasn't clear which word he meant as an insult). Gov. Pataki joined the chorus, and even conservative Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.) complained about the House leadership's ``Southern, anti-union attitude that appeals to the mentality of hillbillies at revival meetings.'' A Republican senator summarizes the situation: ``Bob has a lot of friends who are hurting him.''
Not only did Dole make no effort to keep his friends in line; within a week of Sen. D'Amato's first attack on Gingrich, Dole had adopted a kinder, gentler version of it. At a dinner for the GOP's major donors on May 9, Dole said that Republicans may have scared some people by going too far, too fast. The Speaker, he said, has a lot of ideas, and ``some of them are even good.'' This return of the pre-primary-season Bob Dole, anxious to distance himself from Gingrich and the Contract with America, came at an odd time: the Republican Congress is in fact more popular than Dole himself.
<P>
If Dole now means to change course, he still has to move quickly. On some Beltway types' reckoning, the campaign has a roughly six-week window of opportunity during which it must devise its message, approach conservative groups with it, and set them to work. If that doesn't happen and conservatives are left out, more of them will start saying they have no stake in Dole's election and that they will work for lower-level conservative candidates.
<P>
And who will tell straying Republicans that they had better get back with the party line? In 1988, would-be mavericks feared James Baker; nobody really thinks Scott Reed will come back to haunt them. One solution to both these problems would be to place a recognized heavyweight like Haley Barbour in charge of the campaign. The appointment of the aggressive Republican National Committee chairman would help greatly with both the message and the presentation, causing defeatists to take a long second look at the campaign.
<P>
Those defeatists have been thick on the ground recently. Conspiracy-minded conservatives suspect that some of the Dole-bashers want to tear him down so that he will be forced to pick Colin Powell as his vice-presidential nominee in order to remain viable. But the likely conservative dominance of the convention makes the Dole campaign wary of offering the vice-presidential nomination to Powell. Those opposed to a self-described ``Rockefeller Republican'' on the ticket wouldn't have to wait until November to express displeasure; they could embarrass the campaign, or even defeat the nomination, in San Diego. Which would be just as well: a Powell pick would hardly invigorate the demoralized Republican base.
<P>
A more charitable explanation is that some conservatives have been trying to position themselves as best they can in case of a blowout Dole defeat. That is certainly what is going on in the Republican Congress. When staffers are told that the passage of their pet bill would help Clinton, they often shrug and say, He's going to be re-elected anyway, so we may as well get the best deal we can while he's renting our issues. That attitude is particularly pervasive among that subgroup of Hill staffers known in Washington shorthand as ``policy people,'' but plenty of congressmen will say the same thing off the record. ``It's every man for himself'' is a phrase we hear with tiresome regularity on the Hill these days.
<P>
One good reason for Republican congressmen to be nervous is that, if their leaders have developed a new grand strategy since the dissolution of the Contract, they have yet to disclose it. As noted above, it has been all reaction, not a bold new attack.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he rest of the panic is media-driven. One month the rap is that Republicans have gone too far, the next that they haven't done enough. The same Republicans go wobbly each time. All but the most steel-willed -- like House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Reps. Bob Walker (Pa.), John Boehner (Ohio), and Bob Livingston (La.) -- have lost the intellectual self-confidence needed to make the principled arguments against superficially popular proposals like boosting the minimum wage, or to take up new issues. They assume Clinton and the Democrats will be able to run rings around them in terms of tactics and public relations.
<P>
A disgusted Hill aide argues, ``It's like being a salesman and never going to customers because they don't think they'll be able to convince them. We have a lot of members who just do focus groups and polls but never go out there and make the arguments. They should find another way to make a living.'' Congressmen are coming into D.C. on Tuesdays and leaving on Thursdays, eager to spend time in their districts. 
<P>
Many conservative House members were outraged when they learned  that Gingrich had told moderate Rep. Chris Shays (R., Conn.) that if he wanted a vote on raising the minimum wage, he should get like-minded colleagues to sign a letter to the Speaker so that he could say he was forced to schedule one. In other words, his ``capitulation'' was orchestrated. When pressed on the issue by conservatives, Gingrich crassly defends a minimum-wage boost as ``an 80-20 issue'' (i.e., 80 per cent of the public favors it). The episode sheds light on the Speaker's leadership style and ideological malleability, and has allowed Dick Armey and Whip Tom DeLay to burnish their conservative credentials at the Speaker's expense. This leadership jockeying leads some on the Hill quietly to predict that Gingrich won't be Speaker next year even if the Republicans retain their majority. The lack of gratitude for his role in creating that majority in the first place is astonishing.
<P>
Rank-and-file Republicans cannot be expected to defer their intra-party battles until after the elections when highranking officials set a contrary example. The leadership that should be keeping them in line is part of the problem. Furthermore, as political analyst Stuart Rothenberg recently wrote, ``It's important to note that activists from both wings of the Republican Party share the blame'' for the recent fratricide. Conservatives and moderates also share problems that could be corrected if given some of the attention currently reserved for attacks on each other. All Republicans are too apt to complain about the lessons of the last year rather than absorbing them. For instance, they gripe about press bias and Clinton's demagoguery and duplicity. These are facts of life; complaining about them is pointless and can easily come across as whining (which is how some recent Gingrich remarks played).
<P>
Moreover, Republicans continue to suffer from communications problems going well beyond Bob Dole's rhetorical deficiencies. For the last year they have talked about means, legislative tools, while Clinton talked about ends; they rarely bothered to lay out the intellectual predicates for the policy changes they wished to enact. Too many congressmen still think they're in production rather than sales. Part of the solution is simply for Republicans to present their best face to the public. For example, Rep. Steve Largent (Okla.) should be joined by another Republican with star quality -- say, Sen. Fred Thompson (Tenn.) -- in pushing the Defense of Marriage Act. And for a party that sets so much store by federalism and civil society, Republicans are much too given to relying on the usual Beltway suspects, while underutilizing the wealth of talent outside the inner circle. On crime, for example, the public face of the GOP should not be Rep. Bob Barr (Ga.); it should be Charleston police chief Reuben Greenberg. On morals, ``Best Friends'' head Elaine Bennett, not her husband, Bill, should lead the way. On economics, it should be Godfather pizza exec Herman Cain, not professorial congressmen, expounding Republican views.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> real and lasting Republican recovery, however, will require more substantive steps. There is widespread agreement among Republicans that tax cuts must be an important part of the fall campaign. ``A broad-based, true-blue tax cut is the quickest way to the hearts and minds of the American people,'' says pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``A quick and easy tax cut signals all Americans that the Republican Party wants to give them immediate relief and long-term hope.''
<P>
A leading Democratic operative recently told the L. A. Times that it was imperative to avoid ``a debate in which the primary difference between us is they want to cut taxes and we don't.'' And -- the most hopeful thing we've heard in many a day -- the Dole campaign is actually considering a 15 per cent across-the-board cut in income taxes. But watch that word ``considering'': campaign advisors complain that nothing has been firmly decided. And indeed, by obsessing about the deficit over the last year, Republicans have painted themselves into a corner where many feel uncomfortable proposing major tax cuts. They will have to be ready to answer charges of hypocrisy if they adopt a tax-cutting strategy now.
<P>
Republicans still have time to recover their footing. In generic ballots (where respondents are asked whether they would rather vote for a Democrat or a Republican for Congress), the GOP has pulled even -- which is ahead of where they were at this time in 1994. Even at the presidential level, Clinton's lead in the polls is much narrower among ``likely voters'' than among registered voters (the more-often-cited figure). And Clinton has vulnerabilities on the economy and on foreign policy that have barely begun to be explored.
<P>
That doesn't mean the GOP should be complacent; indeed, those Republicans who aren't defeatists may be banking too much on the passage of time and the magic of a national convention to restore their fortunes. But it does mean that there's no reason for concern to take on the coloration of panic. The distribution of open seats in Congress continues to favor Republican candidates; and since candidate recruitment took place at a time when Republicans looked stronger, the GOP is fielding a higher-quality team than the Democrats are. The sheer magnitude of the Democrats' task in retaking Congress is being widely underestimated.
<P>
Many conservatives have little patience with those who moan that Congress could be lost in November but never do anything constructive to prevent that from happening. Gingrich recently told the Washington Times, ``If [Bill] Bennett thinks the party needs excitement and passion, then Bennett should go out and be exciting and passionate.'' Adds tax activist Grover Norquist, ``It's a sin for people to whine that nobody's articulating the message when they're not articulating the message themselves. This is not a monarchy -- we don't wait for Bob Dole.''
<P>
A Republican collapse is by no means inevitable. If Republicans are willing to stop blaming each other for a November rout and start working to avoid it, they can still not only hold their congressional majorities, but expand them and recapture the White House as well. But they can't wait till October.

Dear Rusty,

Rusty
<P>
I've got to be totally honest with you, Rusty: it's nice to be on the winning team. I haven't felt this confident about things since the night before Super Tuesday in 1988, and let me tell you, after the first couple of rocky years of the Clinton - Gore Administration, this feels nice. But, Rusty, I never knew how much fundraising we were in for. In the past few weeks, Tip and I have been out every night. If we're not at a dinner dance for the DNC, then we're at a black-tie fundraiser for the Clinton - Gore '96 campaign. 
<P>
As you would imagine, the cynical press has raised its collective eyebrow over our fundraising efforts, even going so far as to suggest that what we're doing is ``selling access,'' to which I reply, That's only a danger if you think the President is some kind of wishy-washy weather vane, who adopts the opinion of the last person he spoke to. And that pretty much ends that. We're doing what every political party has to do: we're holding a few simple fundraising events. 
<P>
I'm sitting here in the tub, enjoying a quiet moment before Tipper and I have to get dressed up for ``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Dinner for Very Special Over-One-Mil-a-Year People.'' Last year, if you remember, after the pretty dismal 1994 election, we had to cancel the VSOP Dinner; this year, we filled up the Capitol Hilton ballroom twice! Once for lunch (``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Lunch with a Powerful Bureaucrat of Your Choice'') and once for the VSOP Dinner. 
<P>
As if that wasn't enough, there are a lot more events this week: ``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Breakfast with the President of the United States,'' which was oversold the moment it was announced. That prompted Bill, very generously I may add, to offer to eat more than one breakfast a day, for, as he put it, ``as long as the party needs me to.'' So now we've got Breakfast I and Breakfast II, for ``Golden Juice'' level donors (over $150,000); Luncheon I and Luncheon II with me, Tip, Bill, and HRC for donors at the ``Welcome to the Club Sandwich'' level (over $200,000); and the VSOP Dinner for those at the ``Fatted Calf'' level (over $300,000 over and over again). 
<P>
And that's just Tuesday. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday we do it all over again. The sad part is, Tipper was feeling bloated after Luncheon I, so I had to caution her to pace herself. 
<P>
Next Monday, in what I think is a poignant tribute to the late Ron Brown, we're doing something he came up with. He called it the ``Businessman's Special,'' but we're calling it, in his honor, ``Victory 1996: A Very Special Tribute to Ron Brown.'' It's a simple buffet lunch with the Under-Secretary of your choice. Typically, what Ron liked most about the idea was the simplicity: ``Businessmen don't have a lot of time for the niceties. They don't want to talk to the guy at the top, they want to talk to the guy who makes the decisions,'' I can still hear him say. 
<P>
And when it came to making a decision about trade policy for China, we held a dinner called ``Victory 1996: MFN for China?'' and we were gratified by the response from Kodak, Lehman Brothers, Caterpillar, Citibank, Ford Motor Corp., Bechtel, Amoco, Goldman Sachs, Schering-Plough, PacTel, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Chase, American International Group, Boise Cascade . . . and that's just to name the CEOs at my table. Bill was at a table for two dozen CEOs, which was made manageable by the very Chinese touch of a Lazy Susan - type arrangement which allowed Bill to kind of spin around the table every few minutes to give every diner ``his money's worth,'' as Bill put it. 
<P>
What's great about our lead over Dole in the polls (21 per cent and climbing!) is that, first of all, Bill's starting to get the kind of numbers that I've been getting so there isn't any more of that awkwardness between us. And second, now that our team has the winning edge, everyone wants to be on it. 
<P>
Hazel O'Leary, our Secretary of Energy (who is an African-American, as if that made a difference) held a dinner last week called ``Victory 1996: A Dialogue on the Gas Tax.'' The great thing was that every ticket was bought by Chevron. 
<P>
Bob Rubin over at Treasury put together a nifty brunch called ``Victory 1996: Behind the Scenes at the IRS,'' which was oversold the moment the invitation appeared on the Bloomberg. He's offered to take it ``on the road,'' as he puts it. That ought to pay for some 30-second spots in the fall, huh? 
<P>
Of course, I don't want you to get the impression that it's all about money. It's about a lot of other things that I could name, but Tipper just called up that the limo is waiting, so I'd better go.

<H2>Gingrich-Thought

<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 7
<P>
These are hard times for Newt Gingrich, as everybody concedes. A month ago the story was out that House members in troubled seats were discouraging any prospect of a visit by the Speaker to endorse their candidacies. On Saturday, a left-oriented comedian, performing at the annual White House Correspondents dinner, enjoyed himself and a (very) few others by making jokes about every aspect of Gingrich's life, including his 13-year-old daughter's rites of puberty.
<P>
What is accepted as the Dick Morris formula is paying off. Clinton's instructions are to sound like a conservative/moderate in his speeches, while pursuing the left agenda as Chief Executive. He adroitly exploits the Republican ambiguists in the House and in the Senate. NR's Rich Lowry cites the debate over a welfare bill as an example. ``By the time Senate moderates are through with it, [the bill] could actually produce a presidential signature rather than a veto. What to do? 'Here's what we lay out for ourselves,' complains one Senate aide. 'If we pass it and he signs it -- we lose. If we pass it and he vetoes it -- we didn't get anything done. And if we don't pass it, he can't veto it -- but we're do-nothing. So, therefore, we lay out a scenario where whatever we do and whatever he does -- we lose.'''
<P>
Most conservative analysts are closing in on the matter of taxes. Mr. Gingrich is of course in favor of reduced taxation, but the accent he has placed on a balanced budget has got in the way of a political crusade on the subject. It is correct that there is danger in coming out for tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts. But it is also correct that Mr. Clinton has succeeded in framing any tax-cut proposal as an assault on the poor. And when Mr. Gingrich decided on military action and laid down his siege, he discovered that the leader of the besieged had the critical megaphone in hand, which he used repeatedly to criticize the army outside the moat, whose soldiers got colder, and hungrier, and lonelier as they struggled -- in the eyes of the American public -- to deny students and old folks access to the Statue of Liberty and the Library of Congress. 
<P>
The conviction is growing that the way to go is with a resounding call for tax cuts. When asked what spending cuts he would endorse, the typical Republican will come up with a favorite target or two, and then go vague. Even Pat Buchanan, campaigning for President in 1992, could not come up with recommended cuts of more than 1 per cent. That's the kind of thing that happens to people who engage in political life, even if their name is Ronald Reagan. That's the reason so much of the public is saying: Give us a tax cut -- and you figure out how and where to save the money. And at a more sophisticated level, there are those who are saying: Give us a tax cut with heavy emphasis on capital gains and please note the ensuing harvest. If Jack Kemp were omnipotent, he would cut taxes on productive activity and confidently predict that gross revenues would rise at least sufficient to make up the predicted revenue loss.
<P>
Newt Gingrich is overwhelmed by the political question. He has responsibilities not faced by opinion merchants. Thus on the minimum wage he makes his point, in order to stay on good terms with his philosophical network; but then capitulates, on the grounds that flesh-and-blood Americans who are running for re-election can't fight back against the charge that they would deny a worker a better wage than the current minimum. 
<P>
Even so, it isn't only sedentary Republicans who believe the time has come for Mr. Gingrich to return to the theoretical fastness. In the last analysis, the vitality of the conservative movement has got to depend on the communicability of truths. It is an untruth that the minimum wage helps the very poor, and the question then becomes, Is this one of the battles on which we should weigh in? There are two points of view on this, but a reduction in taxes is increasingly accepted as indispensable to philosophical prosperity, as well as political success. 
<P>
Newt Gingrich is greatly gifted. Maureen Dowd of the New York Times wrote over the weekend. ``Is he impressed with the way Dick Morris has refashioned Mr. Clinton's image as mature centrist?'' 
<P>
``Laurence Olivier plays many roles,'' Gingrich replied. ``If you stipulate somebody as a good actor, why should it surprise you when they act well? Is somebody who's always sincere ever sincere?'' You can't do better than to think your way through to such observations, or to phrase them that way. Newt Gingrich will be around for a good while, and that is welcome news.

The ease with which Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, and their troops buckled under pressure on the minimum wage betokens an emptiness at the center of the Republican Congressional agenda. For nearly two years the GOP has neglected the pocketbook concerns of average voters, talking instead about budget-balancing and Medicare-fixing that by some time in the next century might have reduced long-term interest rates enough to make it easier to re-finance your mortgage while the Medicare Trust Fund inches its way back into solvency -- according to the latest CBO Trust Fund report, of course. No wonder the minimum wage seems like a vivid issue by comparison. Meanwhile, on other economic issues, House Majority Leader Dick Armey is on the right track with a package -- now endorsed by Gingrich -- that is likely to include the $500-per-child tax credit (the GOP's lone recent stab at serious middle-class tax relief) and other measures to get the government's hands off people's take-home pay. Gingrich and Dole are on the right track, too, with their call for a repeal of Clinton's gas-tax increase. But as long as Republicans are tame about taxes Clinton will co-opt them; he already has his own package of tax credits and is making favorable noises about a gas-tax repeal. The GOP can reach for bolder stuff -- actual cuts in tax rates -- or run on empty all the way to November..

Boris Yeltsin let the cat out of the bag in a Kremlin news conference on April 21, with his running-mate Bill Clinton standing beside him. The issue was NATO enlargement. Beaming with pleasure, Yeltsin said it was not being pushed right now, that the delay was ``at our request,'' and that his friend Bill had ``promised this.'' Moreover, no new members were going to get into NATO without Russia's agreement, or without changes in the nature of NATO itself. Clinton squirmed, and tried to claim in response that nothing in U.S. policy had changed. That, indeed, is the problem. When NR Senior Editor Peter Rodman wrote last year (``On the Scene,'' December 25) that the Administration had assured Moscow that NATO enlargement wasn't going to happen any time soon, the official denials were hot and heavy. Apparently, no one told Boris -- then or now.<p>

Only 10 per cent of the nation's newspaper editors, according to a recent poll, think that President Clinton has ``a clear foreign policy''; a whopping 83 per cent think he just ``reacts to foreign events.'' Nevertheless, 64 per cent of the editors approve of the foreign-policy job Clinton is doing. By a margin of 42 - 34, they think Bob Dole would do an even better job, which may mean, extrapolating from their Clinton answers, that they think his foreign policy would be even less clear.<p>

Oops. That wasn't supposed to happen. At least not yet. Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is already spending more than it takes in -- $4.2 billion more in the first half of the fiscal year. Only last April the Administration had predicted a surplus. Those of you who pay (and pay, and pay, and pay) the Medicare tax are entitled to an explanation. Unfortunately, no one has come up with one: ``Hospital admissions of Medicare patients are rising more than can be explained by the number of beneficiaries . . .'' is the best a spokesman for the American Hospital Association can do. Both parties agree on the need for cuts. The hang-up is over philosophy. The Administration's plan calls for the same top-down price controls that have failed Medicare for thirty years, while Republicans want to give beneficiaries a choice between the current system, and a combination of private, high-deductible insurance, paid for by the government, and Medical Savings Accounts to help cover out-of-pocket expenses. Meanwhile, if we bumble along as at present, the Trust Fund will probably deplete its balance before the 2002 date usually forecast for that unpleasant event. And then the baby boomers start retiring.<p>

Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently credited the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with the decline in national workplace fatalities that has occurred since it was created in 1970. But two economists, Thomas J. Kniesner and John D. Leeth, in the latest issue of the Cato Institute journal Regulation, say that Reich is like the doctor who claims to have cured you when in fact you were recovering by yourself before he first saw you. Workplace accidents were declining just as steadily in the decades before OSHA went to work as since. ``It is hard to conclude,'' say Kniesner and Leeth, ``that OSHA passes even the minimum criterion for the establishment of any government program, namely, Is it effective?'' (One quibble for the economists: Since when was that a criterion for establishing government programs?)<p>

When Joe Conason of the New York Observer, a left-liberal, defended the Clintons on Whitewater, Alexander Cockburn of the New York Press, a Stalinist who despises liberals, wrote that Conason ``huffs and puffs like an elderly walrus.'' Conason called Cockburn ``incompetent and dishonest'' and a purveyor of ``lying bulls -- ,'' Cockburn called Conason a ``hack Democratic apologist for a couple of sleazeballs'' and a ``scream[ing] child,'' and so the two-party system came to New York journalism.<p>

When you raise the price of a good or service, the demand for it goes down. This, in a nutshell, is why most economists think that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea. It is estimated that a 90-cent increase (to $5.15 per hour) would eliminate 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999. David McIntosh, a leading House freshman from Indiana, has a better idea for helping low-income workers. He would allow minimum-wage-earning taxpayers to keep the federal taxes currently withheld from their paychecks. Employers would not see any increase in the cost of labor under the McIntosh plan, and so the demand for low-skilled labor would not fall. Low-income families would enjoy higher after-tax income than under the proposed minimum wage. Preliminary estimates put the cost of this tax cut at $8 to $10 billion annually -- equal to about 10 per cent of next year's welfare spending. The resulting tighter welfare system will increase the number of the disadvantaged looking for work; the McIntosh tax cut will make it easier for employers to hire them.<p>

When Darrell Cabey teamed up with some other toughs to bully five dollars out of Bernhard Goetz, he never could have imagined the heist would eventually earn him $43 million in a civil suit. But thanks to his radical attorney, a Bronx jury, and an inept defense, Cabey is nominally America's most successful mugger. Think what you will about Goetz's culpability (he may have fired more bullets at the men preying on him than necessary), that decision belonged to the criminal court, which acquitted him of all serious charges. The question of whether Cabey deserved indemnification for the injury he sustained is easy. The law prohibits felons from profiting from their crimes; Cabey was out to rob. Even if Goetz had thrown a grenade at Cabey, he wouldn't be entitled to a penny. To a criminal, gunshot wounds are an occupational hazard, like housemaid's knee. Fortunately, Goetz happens to be penniless, so Cabey will end up getting what he deserves -- once again.<p>

Francois Mitterrand admitted posthumously in his memoirs that the purpose of European integration was to ``obtain independence from America.'' No surprise here: Mitterrand declared years ago that he preferred countries you could reach by land -- which evidently meant that he liked the Soviet Union more than the United States. Although Mitterrand's attitude to NATO was sounder than that of his predecessors, he still believed Europe to be an entity with values distinct from, and threatened by, those of the Atlantic Community. American policymakers will blunder if they continue to think that all forms of European integration are necessarily in America's interest. As a senior German politician explained with candor last month, a European defense identity -- an idea Mitterrand long advocated precisely because it implies a reduced American component -- was a way of reassuring (i.e., appeasing) Moscow. He added that Russia should belong to a pan-European security structure, simply because Russia was ``in Europe,'' while the American presence was optional.  Anyone who thinks that way is guaranteed to repeat some unpleasant European history.<p>

As reported in New York magazine, some black students at Columbia Law School set out to do something about the problem of racist cab drivers: after videotaping cabbies who refused to pick them up, they would report the drivers to the city for $500 fines. However, the sting did not work as planned. When one student wore a Columbia sweatshirt, every cab picked him up and agreed to take him to whatever destination he named, even to the heart of Harlem. However, when he was joined by a classmate in a dark hat and lumberjack shirt, 14 out of 15 cabs zoomed past. Two conclusions: 1) Cab drivers don't mind picking up blacks per se. 2) Cab drivers do mind picking up young men dressed according to the sartorial standards of criminals. And for many youngish black men in New York, including law-abiding ones, it is the height of fashion to dress like a thug: low-slung jeans, hooded sweatshirts, etc. Giving new meaning to the phrase ``fashion victim,'' taxi drivers figure that you are what you wear. The minute the real criminals figure this out and start wearing Ivy League athletic clothes, it will become impossible to drive a cab in New York.<p>

Fox News has entered the Sunday-morning TV competition with a news/interview show of its own. Official Washington was wary, given the conservative field markings -- Roger Ailes heads the Fox news division, and Tony Snow, the show's host, was an editor at the Washington Times and a Bush speechwriter. But the first show on April 28 corralled a bipartisan line-up of Dick Gephardt, Pat Moynihan, John Kasich, Linda Chavez, and Robert Shrum, along with top Israeli official Uri Savir. The show was fair and lively, an auspicious debut. Good sailing.<p>

                4/29/96    12/31/97
Comex Spot      $392.40       ?

<I>Are we at a major market juncture? All the signs

<p>
<H3>by LAWRENCE KUDLOW

Mr. Kudlow, NR's former economics editor, is economic counsel at Laffer, Canto & Associates.<BR>
<HR  width=50%>
</CENTER>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>HAT a difference an era can make. When free-market entrepreneurial economics were revived during the Age of Reagan, and classical thinkers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Joseph Schumpeter replaced John Maynard Keynes, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Paul Samuelson, the American economy flourished on a grand scale.
<P>
From 1982 to 1995, the Dow Jones industrial average increased 300 per cent (adjusted for inflation), or 11 per cent per year. All told, a phenomenal performance. Along the way, roughly 100 million Americans who own stocks and bonds (through brokerage accounts, mutual funds, IRAs, and other retirement plans) saw their net worth go up by an extraordinary $10 trillion, a 176 per cent gain, which annualizes to 8.1 per cent. From this rising wealth base, the U.S. economy created 29 million new jobs and produced a whopping 43 per cent gain in real disposable income. No other G-7 industrial nation has come close to this performance. It's a fact. You can look it up.
<P>
During the prior Age of Inflation, which I mark as 1965 to 1982, Democratic and Republican Presidents alike practiced Keynesian fine-tuning, de-linked the dollar from gold, inflated the money supply, raised taxes, imposed wage and price controls, and maintained tight government regulation over key economic sectors such as banking, transportation, and energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. stock market <I>declined</I> by 67 per cent (adjusted for inflation), dropping by an average of 6.5 per cent per year.
<P>
Of course, in recent years Reagan's tax-cut policies have been compromised, first by George Bush and then by Bill Clinton. But the damage so far has been manageable, and the tide has not yet turned back out to sea. The top income-tax rate, which stood at 70 per cent during the Age of Inflation, is now holding at 40 per cent. The 28 per cent capital-gains tax rate is much lower than the 45 per cent during the 1970s. Corporate-income-tax rates are in the low 30s, compared to their hefty earlier perch of the mid 40s. The inflation rate in recent years has hovered near 2 per cent; it was 10 to 15 per cent during the last years of the Age of Inflation. Interest rates today run from roughly 5 to 7 per cent; they were 15 to 20 per cent 15 years ago.
<P>
Just as important, although Reagan himself has departed from the public square, his <I>spirit</I> lingers on, especially among the new generation of business leaders that was spawned during the Eighties. These men and women came to live by the Schumpeterian growth model of innovation and risk-taking. They started new businesses on a massive scale, they modernized business practices through downsizing and consolidation, and they instituted sophisticated financial-management techniques every step of the way. Their footprints are found throughout the economy, in computer tech, telephone tech, information processing, autos, utilities, transportation, steel, textiles, and electronics.
<P>
And they went global. For it was Reagan who first opened free trade in Latin and Central America, then negotiated throughout the Pacific Rim, including China, and it was Reagan's political economy that caused Soviet Communism to implode, thus re-opening Central and Eastern Europe, then South Asia, and even kindling hope in the Middle East. In short, American -- not German, not British, not Japanese, but American -- business has provided the leadership and cutting-edge management infrastructure for the worldwide spread of democratic capitalism.
<P>
All that said, there is however a growing sense, at least in stock-market circles, that the best of our story may have passed. In recent months the market has stalled, interest rates have again started to rise, and inflation risk is in the air. A year ago, buoyed by the Republican capture of both houses of Congress, many believed that 1995 would bring a new installment of Reagan's agenda: another round of pro-growth tax cuts, serious entitlement reform, more deregulation, and substantially smaller government.
<P>
Yet none of this came to pass. Speaker Gingrich showed himself to be a shrill, uncompromising, and unpopular figure, unable to grow into the job. As a unit, the House Republicans were obsessed with dreary numerical budget formulas and the politics of austerity and sacrifice. Gone was Reagan's message of optimism and growth. By early 1996 the Contract with America was dead in the water, and its underlying policy agenda of tax cuts, smaller government, and cultural reformation had been tattered and muddled.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>HAT'S more, politicians ranging from Pat Buchanan to Dick Gephardt have emphasized the darker side of the economic story. Real median family income, they have been pointing out, has slumped in recent years after recovering nicely during the 1980s. And Social Security and Medicare payroll-tax increases have eroded take-home pay.
<P>
Of course, when measured <I>properly</I>, the worker wage story over the past twenty years is quite a bit more respectable. Wage data exclude a sizable chunk of the modern worker's real compensation: health care, retirement, vacations, holidays, sick leave, and so on. When those generally untaxed benefits are added in per-worker annual income has been rising at a rate of 1.4 per cent. And, as the wealth numbers suggest, somebody has made good money. Even going back to the early 1970s, real per-capita consumption has averaged 1.7 per cent yearly increases.
<P>
Whatever the correct data, though, today's political reality reflects a cranky <I>attitude</I> of restlessness, irritability, and discontent among a major population segment. Many middle-income workers -- one might think of them as Reagan Democrats -- simply do not believe they have the financial resources to take care of their businesses or their families. In social and cultural terms the deck is stacked against them: racial quotas, illegal immigration, liberal courts, no-fault divorce, generation X dress codes, rampant welfarism, schools without prayer (or education), and government opposition to moral standards. To defend against moral slippage -- by putting their kids into private or parochial schools, for example -- middle-class folk need financial resources.
<P>
For this group, President Clinton's tired old big-government nostrums just won't work. Nostalgic for the social-insurance welfarism of Germany, France, and Sweden, Clintonites such as Robert Reich, Laura Tyson, Jeff Bingaman, and Byron Dorgan have come up with a program of higher minimum wages, more health care, more federal education money, more union power, more caps on executive pay, more community investment schemes financed by corporate pensions, and more limits on layoffs and restructuring.
<P>
Fact is, nearly everyone in America knows this stuff won't work. It never has. Just look at Europe, where a social-democratic model has maintained double-digit unemployment and blocked private job creation. More to the point, American politics has never favored class warfare or zero-sum economic pessimism. A few months ago a <I>Reader's Digest</I> poll showed that ``Americans in nearly every group -- across racial, economic, age, ideological, religious, educational, and sexual lines -- had the same median response: A family of four with an income of $200,000 should pay no more than 25 per cent in all its taxes combined.'' Polltaker Everett Ladd called it ``the single most extraordinary finding in the history of domestic-policy polling in the U.S. . . . America is probably the only country in the world where there are no significant differences by party or class in the 'ideal' fair tax.'' In other words, class warfare doesn't work.
<P>
But you cannot beat something with nothing. At this point, future economic policy and the stock market both stand at the crossroads. It is up to Senator Dole to renew and reinvigorate the optimistic economics of Ronald Reagan. This presidential election will not be fought over income inequality and redistribution, or over austere numerical balanced-budget plans, unless Republicans allow it to happen. And if they allow it to happen, they will lose.
<P>
To regain the political and economic high ground, the GOP should hark back to the 1993 gubernatorial campaign of underdog candidate Christine Todd Whitman. During the final weeks of her uphill quest, Mrs. Whitman hammered home one simple, clear message to the voters of New Jersey: ``You will spend your money more wisely than the government will.'' On this impeccable premise, her plan to slash income taxes across the board catapulted her to victory over incumbent Jim Florio, who had enacted the largest tax increase in New Jersey history. And it was Mrs. Whitman's plucky adherence to a bold economic growth plan that started the national Republican Party on the road to political resuscitation in the aftermath of George Bush's devastating defeat.
<P>
For Senator Dole, who campaigned hard for Mrs. Whitman, the lessons are very clear. Across-the-board income-tax cuts generate a powerful message of traditional family values because they show trust in ordinary people, who will spend their own money more wisely than government will. American families are more than willing to accept the risk and responsibility of making personal choices with regard to education (vouchers), health care (portability and medical savings accounts), and retirement (unlimited IRAs invested in private markets).
<P>
Add to the merits of personal responsibility the related demand for governmental accountability. Taxpayers insist that large-scale entitlements such as welfare and Medicaid be turned over to the states, where legislatures and governors will be more responsive to voter preferences than far-away Washington. People are increasingly convinced that generational welfare dependency, alcohol and drug addiction, family break-up, unlimited abortion on demand, and recidivist criminal pathologies are more closely related to soul-sickness than to the absence of material benefits. Ordinary people intuitively know that working together, through local churches, synagogues, schools, charities, fellowships, and self-help groups, is the only lasting solution to our nation's social and cultural problems.
<P>
Of course, across-the-board income-tax-rate relief is not only a values issue: it is also an <I>economics</I> issue because of the favorable impact on incentives. Tax credits are more manna from Washington, part of the old model that elites know best. Bill Clinton is at home with his own scheme for tax credits because it preserves the centrality of governmental planning, prioritizing, and allocation. The Clinton Administration simply does not trust the populace. Because of this, it will never agree to income-tax-rate cuts. Senator Dole, however, is in a position to -- and must -- acknowledge that those who work harder, save more, and are willing to invest must be rewarded through the incentive structure of lower marginal income-tax rates.
<P>
Today, a family-owned business that grosses $50,000 per year pays income tax at a 28 per cent rate and Social Security/Medicare payroll taxes at a 16 per cent rate. In most of the twenty largest population centers, state and local taxes take another 5 per cent. So, right off the top, the combined marginal tax rate takes away nearly 50 cents of every middle-class dollar earned. Senator Dole must champion the forgotten middle class with a bold across-the-board income-tax cut. Lower tax rates, higher tax-bracket thresholds, and a payroll tax deduction are far more powerful instruments of growth than government-given tax credits. After-tax take-home pay will go up; fresh incentives to earn, work, save, and invest will rejuvenate overall economic growth. And people will have much greater opportunity to form their own priorities, run their own businesses, and care for their own children.<P>
Income-tax relief can be seen as a down payment on future, more radical tax reform. Right now the Republican Party and the nation are split over which system would be better: a single flat-rate income tax or a national sales tax that replaces the income tax altogether. And after tax hikes in 1990 and 1993, a majority of taxpayers seem unwilling to give up large deductions for mortgages, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes in return for yet another politician's promise. Once the White House is returned to safe hands, presumably with a Republican Congress, there'll be plenty of time to thrash out the most workable plan.
<P>
Meanwhile, income-tax cuts will keep the focus on the individual. Right now the biggest tax burdens hit individuals, not businesses. The GOP is too quick to emphasize full depreciation expensing, or eliminating the capital-gains tax altogether, and not quick enough to address the combined burden of high payroll- and income-tax rates. On capital gains, for now, indexing would be just fine. But as Reagan understood full well, cutting income taxes is a populist issue, whereas cutting business taxes looks like and often is an elitist approach.
<P>
In Washington today economists are beginning to sense the middle-class public's growing desire for expanded economic growth. Thanks to back-to-back large-scale tax hikes in 1990 and 1993, this recovery cycle has produced yearly growth of less than 3 per cent, compared to a normal rate of better than 4 per cent. As a result, the nation has forgone nearly $2 trillion in income and nearly 6 million jobs.
<P>
But the solution is not to force the Federal Reserve into inflating the money supply. Already this year, fears of inflation have driven up interest rates. Investors are worried that government policies will shift toward easy money rather than tax cuts, lower budget spending, and deregulation. 
<P>
The Dole campaign should learn something else from Reagan's policy notebook: Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods, not by growth. If across-the-board income-tax-rate cuts, along with higher-bracket thresholds, freshen economic growth incentives to produce more goods and services, then the larger volume of output would render the existing money supply <I>less</I> inflationary. Of course, when Paul Krugman and Larry Summers briefly worked on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisors during Reagan's first term, they argued that tax cuts would increase inflation. They were dead wrong. Smart men, wrong theory. Reagan had the story right. Now, Dole must draw from Reagan, not the Washington economic establishment.
<P>
The populist approach resonates with voters. It worked for Reagan, Whitman, Engler, Thompson, Symington, and Pataki, and it will work for Dole. Real simple: He raised them, I'm going to cut them. Across the board. For everyone. I led the fight in 1993, losing by only a few votes. Please give me a chance to finish the fight and win the war. People will spend their money more wisely than government will. The economy can grow by 3 per cent or more, with a steady dollar and no inflation. And folks will be freer to set their own moral standards in communities across the nation. I am optimistic about the ability of individual men and women to make our nation grow and prosper, and to supply jobs, income, and financial power well into the next century.
<P>
PS.: The stock market will signal that this is a political winner well before the November election is held.

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>


As hard as I try, I can't seem to shake this feeling that we're headed for certain victory in November.
<P>
I'm trying not to be too cocky. I remember well the days in 1988 when The New Republic endorsed my bid for the Presidency, and I thought to myself, ``Hey, TNR is about as in touch as you can get. If they like me, then everybody likes me.'' So, obviously, I'm keeping a lid on the counting-chickens department. 
<P>
Still, it's nice to have a comfortable lead. We had originally planned to spend the spring and early summer with a kind of ``Plan A'' and ``Plan B'' approach -- ``Plan A'' being a lot of appearances by me on Brinkley, CNN, and Meet the Press reaffirming my complete faith in the integrity and honesty of Bill and HRC irrespective of the
grand-jury indictments; and ``Plan B'' being Tipper's hunger strike outside the Little Rock jailhouse until they released HRC and waived bail. 
<P>
But, as things turned out, we didn't need either plan, so now, with three months to go before the convention and $22 million to spend, we're kind of looking at each other and thinking, ``Now what?''
<P> 
So when Chris Dodd, one of Connecticut's senators, and the chairman of the party's Senate campaign, gave me a call last week, I took the bull by the horns. ``Chris,'' I said, ``you and I both know that victory in November is a foregone conclusion. But I've always thought that it's important to plan the move after the next move. So what do you and Tom have on the agenda come January 1997?''
<P> 
``Me and who?'' Chris asked.
<P> 
``Tom Daschle,'' I said. ``Senate Minority Leader, and, after November, the Majority Leader.''
<P> 
``Oh. Right. Tom. Tom,'' Chris said. ``Tom's a super guy. I just love him to death, don't you?''
<P> 
``I'm fond of him, sure,'' I said.
<P> 
``He's a great little soldier; loyal, steadfast, maybe not the most visionary guy, but hey, that's not what we need in a Minority Leader, is it?''
<P> 
I was getting a little impatient. ``Yes,'' I said, ``there's something to that, but Chris -- ''
<P> 
``But a majority leader -- whoa. That's a
different-type cat altogether, no?''
<P> 
``Chris,'' I said, ``I'd love to chat all day with you, but I've got a meeting in a few minutes, and I really want to talk about the future, okay?''
<P> 
``Mr. Vice President, that's all I think about.'' 
<P>
And with that, he dashed off to a floor vote, after promising to call me back. In the meantime, I dialed Dick Gephardt's office.
<P> 
``Speaker Gephardt's office,'' a voice answered.
<P> 
"Is Dick in?'' I asked, after identifying myself.
<P> 
``Please hold.'' 
Which I did. For almost twenty minutes. You know me, Rusty. I'm not a stickler for protocol. And I wasn't personally insulted to be kept on hold, I was insulted for the office of the Vice Presidency. Look, I know that Dick and I haven't always gotten along -- heck, we both wanted our party's nomination in 1988, and while some people have characterized him as a half-witted knee-jerk big-government-liberal lightbulb-faced albino, I've always admired his keen legislative skill. 
<P>
So when Dick finally got on the phone with a cheery ``How 'ya doing, Al?'' I let the jarring breach of protocol pass -- I'm usually called ``Mr. Vice President,'' after all.
<P>
``I'm fine, Dick. How are you?''
<P>
``Doing pretty well for a guy who's 'so far left, he's left America.'''
<P>
``Excuse me?''
<P>
``Presidential Debate, the Sunday before Super Tuesday, 1988.''
<P>
``Sorry?''
<P>
``That's what you called me.''
<P>
``Well I was hoping we could move past that. It was eight years ago, Dick. And as you know, I've always admired your keen legislative skill. In fact, that's what I'm calling about. November. I was just wondering what your plans might be, after we take back the House.''
<P>
``Plans? Oh, I've got plans. I've got a million.''
<P>
``Care to share any of them?''
<P>
``Let me summarize them: Remember how it was when you guys had Tom Foley around?''
<P>
``Sure do, Dick. He supported us to the hilt -- always ready to help our agenda.''
<P>
``Okay. Well now he spends his day representing the National Aerosol Packaged Cheese Spread Manufacturers Association. Get me?''
<P> 
``C'mon, Dick. We've got to think -- not just about '96, but about 2000 and 2004.''
<P>
``That, Al,'' he said, ``is all I think about.''
<P>
And with that, he dashed off to a floor vote.
<P>
It wasn't easy, but at least I got those two to start thinking about the future. After all, that's all I think about, too

<H2>Are the Germans Guilty?
</H2> </CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, APRIL 16
<P>
The new book that insists that the vast majority of the German people were exterminationist in word and deed (the title of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book is Hitler's Willing Executioners) is more merely than historically depressing. It is bad enough to be asked to believe that the huge majority of the German people were aware of Hitler's enterprise. It is horrifying to meditate on the question: How safe is it to assume, if that were so in 1938 - 45, that its equivalent isn't reposing in the minds and hearts of other cultures right now?
<P>
Professor Goldhagen's thesis will be disputed by other scholars, given that he is not everywhere furrowing fresh historical ground. His thesis is that the anti-Semitism of the Germans was so deeply rooted that they had no problem at all in going from what he calls the ``eliminationist'' stage (let us get rid of the Jews) to the ``exterminationist'' stage (let us get rid of them by slaughter).
<P>
There are, to say the least, some very rough edges in Mr. Goldhagen's thesis, among them that in describing the indifference to slaughter evidenced by the Germans when they conquered Poland he seems to be talking about an undifferentiated impulse to slaughter. It didn't seem to matter whether the victims were Jewish or non-Jewish, any more than it seemed to matter what was the attachment, religious or ethnic, of the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of East Europeans and Ukrainians murdered at both ends of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. If an entire population is inflamed with the lust to kill, how much does it matter who the victims are, except to those who wish to come up with a vague schematic handle for justifying an antagonism? At an academic level, researchers have written about those terrible years without concluding that the German people were empathic collaborators, let alone participants in genocide. At a personal level I am a friend of a German expatriate (he left Germany twenty years after Hitler) who even as a boy was given to sharing his father's necessarily concealed hatred of the Fuhrer. My friend's trade (in retail) keeps him in common touch and he reports -- frighteningly -- that he has encountered more anti-Semitism in America than ever he did in Germany. If this is so or even nearly so we have reason to question the most basic claims of civilization.
<P> 
It is a haunting question, and reduces to microcosmic measure. Mr. Goldhagen would have us believe that many, perhaps even a majority, of those killed in the years he writes about were killed by single bullets. Science came along with the extermination process, which could take care of hundreds at a time. But the support system even for extermination camps was extensive, hundreds and thousands of executioners, suppliers of lethal materials, barbed-wire manufacturers and installers.
<P>
But how widely was news of the enterprise known? The evidence is everywhere sobering. When Mao Tse-tung promulgated his Cultural Revolution he was able to count on the approving roar of the mob, which included sons and daughters of those proclaimed to be enemies of the people and therefore fit to die. In Cambodia they did have machine guns, but they did not depend on weapons of corporate death: there were enough individual peasant soldiers willing to kill one and one-half million of their brothers and sisters. In Rwanda - Burundi we think of tribal antagonism as generating the impulse to the killing of a half-million, but what is it that causes that tribal antagonism to go to genocidal extremes? Why does the Serb so despise the Muslim as to go to lengths one would never suppose a California Anglo would go to against a Hispanic?
<P>
Few of us have reviewed inflammatory anti-Semitic literature published in Germany during the twenty years before the Holocaust. But of course it exists, Hitler's own manifesto being of primary importance. There is anti-black (and anti-white) material published in America. We are all absolutely fatalistic about, if not acclimated to, episodic violence traceable to race and religion, but it is incomprehensible, if not inconceivable, that the kind of thing we have could develop into genocide. 
<P>
We have a considerable stake in hoping that Professor Goldhagen has himself committed sociological genocide. You cannot exaggerate the terrible implications of ethnic hostility. But if it is true that almost the entire German population actively contributed to what happened in mid-century, then no minority, anywhere, is safe.

Despite an all-out effort on his behalf by the Republican establishment, incumbent Rep. Greg Laughlin, a former Democrat, lost a primary runoff to Ron Paul in Texas's 14th District. Democrats hope that Laughlin's defeat will discourage other officeholders from defecting to the GOP (205 have done so since Bill Clinton's election). But in ex-Congressman Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party candidate for President in 1988, Laughlin faced a tough, well-known, and more conservative opponent. Laughlin is the least conservative congressional Democrat to switch parties so far; he has an anemic 58 lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, and his voting record proved more important to voters in this conservative district than his spanking new party label. So Mr. Laughlin's failure to make a convincing conversion is unlikely to dissuade desirable conservative Democrats from fleeing across the aisle. Democrats might even the score by tempting undesirable liberal Republicans to join their ranks. NR would happily provide the names of Republicans who have shown every sign they'd rather switch than fight.

Economic conservatives are right to like free trade. Pat Buchanan's conservatives-with-a-heart are right to worry about its impact on vulnerable Americans. In our last issue, David Frum proposed a sensible compromise (``Living with Nationalism,'' p. 22) that answers both concerns: stop mass unskilled immigration. Current mass immigration is virtually worthless to Americans in aggregate, causes serious displacement of native-born workers, and is not at all logically linked to economic growth. Current economic research supports Frum's political case. For example, an article in the May 1996 American Economic Review by George Borjas, Richard Freeman, and Larry Katz estimates that 30 to 40 per cent of the recent widening of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers is due to trade and immigration -- but that immigration is perhaps twice as significant as trade in the calculation. Helping the unskilled begins abroad -- by keeping the foreign unskilled there.

At least one factor in GOP's 1994 sweep is gone, never to return: the complacency of the other side. The AFL-CIO last month approved a special 15-cent-a-month assessment on its members to help fund a $35-million anti-Republican blitzkrieg this fall. For a foretaste of hypercharged union political activity, consider the special election to fill Bob Packwood's Senate seat last January, where a union field staff of forty, large-scale mailings, and massive independent expenditures on advertising tipped the race to liberal Ron Wyden. Labor -- and the feminists and environmentalists -- are ready to fight to the death to preserve their threatened federal status quo. Unless the Right creates a countervailing sense of urgency -- the kind it mustered when opposing President Clinton's tax increases and health plans -- it will be bulldozed right back into righteous opposition. Talking up ``divisive'' issues like tax cuts, affirmative action, immigration, and crime would be a first step. If Republicans feel guilty about hitting the hot buttons, soon-to-air AFL-CIO attack ads will be just the thing to help them get over it.

It used to be a scarlet letter A. Today it's V, for Votetally. Those rankings, by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, of congressional voting patterns seem to carry quite a stigma for sinners. Consider the shift in voting patterns uncovered in the latest NTU report: The ten congressmen ranked by Votetally as the biggest spenders of 1994 changed course dramatically in 1995; their rankings dropped by an average of 136. The second ten dropped by 76; the third by 72. All in all, declines occurred throughout the top third of the 1994 distribution -- a remarkable shift given the institutionally controlled nature of congressional floor votes. Members, chastened by that V on their foreheads, got religion. So why didn't more of the Contract pass? Look waaaay down at the bottom, at the most conservative penny-pinchers of 1994. They moved up by an average of 91 places in the 1995 rankings. The backsliding, NTU says, ``may reflect an attitude of complacency among those who thought they had done well in the [1994] study.'' A misapprehension, dispelled by the latest report, not to mention by the status of the Republican agenda.

In the aftermath of Oklahoma City, we discouraged our brethren in the media (to little effect) from portraying Timothy McVeigh as a man of the Right -- an only slightly more deranged cousin of Rush and Newt. With the arrest of Theodore Kaczynski, the suspected Unabomber, we similarly resist the temptation to link him to Kirkpatrick Sale or Al Gore. As David Gelernter, one of the bomber's victims and an NR contributing editor, wrote in Time: ``The tendency among some intellectuals and journalists to dignify with analysis the thinking of violent criminals has always struck me as low and contemptible. I couldn't care less what the man's views on technology are or what message he intended to deliver; the message I got was that in any society, no matter how rich, just, and free, you can rely on there being a certain number of evil cowards. I thank him for passing it along, but I knew that anyway.''

New York Gov. George Pataki has vowed to lead the fight against the Republican platform's pro-life plank in San Diego. He believes the issue has ``hurt the Republican Party'' and says, ``I think it is important that we make it plain that being against abortion is not the position of the Republican Party.'' This arguably places Gov. Pataki to the left, on this issue, of his predecessor, Mario Cuomo, who at least always maintained he was ``personally opposed.'' For the record, we would favor maintaining the anti-abortion stance even if it cost the party votes. But there is no credible evidence that it does. Polls show that among single-issue voters, pro-lifers outnumber pro-choicers by roughly 2 to 1. Pro-lifers would win any fair intra-party debate on the issue. But San Diego is not the proper place for one: it would turn into a circus ring-mastered not by Republicans but by the media. To fend off that possibility, Gov. Pataki's mentor, Sen. Al D'Amato, who claims to be pro-life, and Bob Dole, whose campaign D'Amato co-chairs, should point out to the governor the political obtuseness of his new position. While they're at it, they should keep an eye on Governors Weld and Whitman, who are also spoiling for a San Diego fight. By supporting President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth-abortion ban, these governors have shown that they are the spokesmen not for a major wing of the GOP, but for an extremist fringe. (Only 15 House Republicans voted against the ban.) Party leaders -- and journalists -- should treat them accordingly.

Even as Congress moved crabwise toward mild but welcome measures against illegal immigration, an incident in Southern California in which police chased and finally stopped a pickup truck carrying 23 illegals made the case for even sterner moves. Though everyone by now has probably seen the videotape of two white police officers beating two illegals while the other illegals fled into the bush, the issue is not really one of ``police brutality,'' much less ``racism.'' The truck had penetrated our porous border and led the police on a wild chase at 100 mph while its occupants flung garbage and metal objects at the pursuers. The videotape records 15 seconds. The chase lasted an hour. The driver of the truck is suing for $10 million, and might get it from the right jury. The fleeing illegals, no kidding, now have six-month residency permits. Thanks to the mass media's bias on immigration, the case has become a second Mylai. The ACLU has seized the opportunity to call for more affirmative-action quotas in police departments. But to most callers to California talk shows, and NR, these police officers are not villains but overworked and decent cops who were pushed too far. Their sins are trivial compared to their defense of their country and its laws.

NR has never before endorsed candidates in Italy. But if the Center - Right wins the national election on April 21, a contender for the premiership could well be Antonio Martino, former foreign minister, first-rate economist, and occasional contributor to NR. Italy's electoral system forces politicians, Left and Right, to form broad coalitions. The leftists, led by the renamed Communist Party, stand for continuing the old system of welfare and patronage for big business. The Right's most dynamic component is the southern-based National Alliance. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini, is the country's most popular politician, but he is simply too controversial for the premiership. No one expects that the Right's nominal leader, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, distracted by legal attacks on his media empire and allegations of tax evasion, would be more effective in a new stint as premier than he was in 1994. So, as the most effective spokesman for tax cuts and economic liberalization, Martino could well be the respectable compromise candidate for prime minister. If he won, Italy would instantly become the intellectual leader at gatherings of the G-7 group of heads of state of the industrialized world.

In response to a wave of rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon, Israel retaliated -- and upped the ante. Israel's troops swept into southern Lebanon to expand the buffer zone, and its planes and gunships destroyed sites in Beirut belonging to Hezbollah and other radical groups. It was the first big Israeli operation in Beirut since the early 1980s. The real culprit here is Syria, which sees periodically giving Hezbollah free rein as a cost-free way of pressuring the Israelis. By humiliating Lebanon (Syria's puppet), the Israelis have demonstrated that it's not so cost-free. With the May election coming, Shimon Peres could do no less.

``The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript,'' wrote T. S. Eliot, ``sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.'' So it is with the writers of the New York Times. To celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the Ochs - Sulzberger family's ownership of the paper, the New York Times Magazine surveyed the last century, and the resulting excerpts are depressing stuff: soft on tyrants (Herbert L. Matthews on Castro), laggard on freedom, but mostly dull and drab -- weather reports on the Zeitgeist, as far-sighted as a herd of manatees. The elite would have been better off going to church on Sunday. Or even brunch.

The first thing to say about seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff is that she was not a pilot. Nine years short of the minimum legal age to solo an airplane -- or for that matter to drive a car -- she was a passenger whom an indulgent flight instructor and father had permitted to manipulate controls so that she might appear to break some dubious record for youngsters flying cross-country. Reportedly, Jessica had recently been reading Hillary Clinton's It Takes a Village. In her case, a village might have done a better job of raising her than her two earnest, New Age parents. Her mother, Lisa Blair Hathaway, said she raised her children to be people of ``freedom and choice.'' She seems to have assigned absolute worth to these ideals without recognizing that they are prerogatives of adults who have taken life's buffetings; they must be earned. ``Children are fearless,'' she said. ``That's their natural state until adults ingrain fear in them.'' True enough. But she neglected the responsibility of parents to ingrain proper fear; an ordinate sense of one's limitations in the face of the world's dangers defines the mature mind. Miss Hathaway remembers Jessica as a little girl who had lived ``a full, wonderful, wonderful, exquisite life.'' It should have been a much longer one.

A weighty tome (417 pages) issued by the National Research Council deserves a lot more attention than it has gotten. Produced by a panel of twenty scientists, the report thoroughly debunks the ``natural is healthier'' theme that is in such vogue among regulators, activists, and elites generally. The report finds no basis for the notion that synthetic additives, pesticide residues, and byproducts of manufacturing are a significant cancer risk. On the contrary: ``It is the naturally occurring compounds in our diet, together with excess fat and calories, that have the greatest effect on cancer causation.'' The panel found ``no notable biological differences between synthetic and naturally occurring carcinogens.'' But because of the much greater quantity of natural carcinogens in the diet -- in cooked meats, cereals, spreads, fruits, vegetables -- they deserve the most attention. Seventy common, naturally occurring chemical constituents of food have both cancer-causing and cancer-fighting properties under different conditions and at different concentrations; disease defies simple notions of good and bad. Since most environmentalist health scares -- as well as the parallel illusion of the healthiness of the ``natural'' -- trace their ancestry to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, Dr. William M. London, in Priorities, the journal of the American Council on Science and Health, has suggested that such alarms be dubbed ``Carsonogenic.''

The California State Supreme Court has delivered itself of a theological finding. Mrs. Evelyn Smith, a Presbyterian landlady, has been sued by a man and a woman who wished to live together and who had at first lied about their marital status. When Mrs. Smith discovered that the couple was not, in fact, married, she said her religion would not permit her to rent them an apartment. The court ruled that Mrs. Smith had violated the couple's right to ``freedom from discrimination based on personal characteristics.'' No mention of Mrs. Smith's right not to be morally affronted in her own home. Marian Johnston, triumphant attorney for the unmarried pair (who have since split up), offered an illuminating interpretation of the decision: ``We're not precluding [Mrs. Smith] from exercising her religion. We're just saying she can't bring it with her into the business world.'' In the opinion of the highest court in the nation's largest state, religion must be reduced to an emasculated cultural habit with no relevance to the actual conduct of people's lives. We don't care what you believe, so long as it's nothing.

Having trouble understanding your college kid? Here's how to sort it out. A ``BUG'' is Bisexual Until Graduation and wants to sample the entire campus experience. ``GUGs'' and ``LUGs'' are, respectively, Gay and Lesbian Until Graduation, and on the fast track. ``Hets'' are straight but can't talk about it because it is uncool. ``Parents'' are people who want to hide in the garage and cry.

<I>Malaise and infighting are threatening

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HIS has been a winter of discontent for conservatives, one that left the high spirits of 1995 a frustrating memory. Budget defeats and infighting in the primaries have left them still more demoralized. Republicans in Congress fear taking on powerful but controversial issues such as official English and affirmative action. They ascribe to Bill Clinton and Dick Morris mythic powers of winning the public-relations battles that would ensue. And in some cases their defeatism extends to predictions that the GOP will lose its majority in the Congress.
<P>
At the grassroots, the Left is more energized than the Right for the elections. ``You can practically feel the malaise,'' says Amy Moritz, head of the National Center for Public Policy Research.
<P>
This mood is in part a byproduct of the political season, the dog-days between the primaries and the general-election campaign. Grover Norquist, the jovial strategist, argues that ever since ``the adrenalin rush in the first hundred days,'' conservatives have had been marking time. They should use the lull, he says, to build up their grass-roots organisations rather than grousing. 
<P>
Then, too, Beltway conservatives are still adjusting to majority status. Unrealistic expectations of a ``revolution'' after the 1994 elections set them up for disillusionment. A thin majority in the House and merely nominal control of the Senate ought to have led them to build the case for expanding their majorities by giving the public a preview of the tangible benefits they could expect from conservative governance. Instead they tried to govern immediately, believing that their triumph was historically inevitable and permanent. When Clinton declined to roll over as expected, says Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, ``Many conservatives, particularly the younger ones, discovered to their shock that the other side can shoot real bullets.'' As a result, the Congress has so far delivered for only one group: speed demons made happy by the repeal of the federal speed limit.
<P>
And those early defeats have made them gun-shy. Where they once had over-ambitious goals, they are now nervous of having any goals at all. Their inability to devise a sequel to the Contract with America that would command broad support from lawmakers is an ominous indicator of the present mood. ``If you don't have a goal, you won't have morale,'' says Miss Moritz. ``And we haven't had a goal other than taking Newt's orders for fifteen months.''
<P>
But if specific mistakes and the constraint of having Clinton in the White House were wholly responsible for the current malaise, conservatives could be optimistic. But they have a deeper anxiety: is their coalition cracking up, its internal disagreements no longer submerged by a common desire to topple the mighty empire of Liberaldom? Even on an issue as central as taxes, conservatives have not reached a consensus. After two years of debate, supply-siders still see the tax credit for children as a sop to the Christian Coalition, and social conservatives still see the capital-gains tax cut as a sop to Wall Street. In this and other debates, different sorts of conservatives are too often walled up in their respective ghettoes.
<P>
When they're not hurling incendiary charges at each other. Charges of racism and nativism, for instance, have been bandied about freely, and other charges typically used by liberals to smear conservatives en masse have been brought into intra-family debates. Such conduct ftyhr tjos jave jadee beem [be has provided grist for liberals' mills and eroded the collegiality that used to exist on the Right.
<P>
And as conservatives fought these Beltway battles, they were losing touch with the concerns of conservative voters in the boondocks. The two candidates who won the most votes, Dole and Pat Buchanan, were the very ones most disliked by the conservative intelligentsia. Conservatives were, at best, irrelevant to the presidential race. Yet they have been remarkably disinclined to reflect on their role in the debacle.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>OR debacle it was -- and, moreover, an unnecessary one. In 1988, the three conservative candidates won about a third of the primary votes; this time around, economic and social conservatives combined were pulling much closer to 50 per cent. The conditions were there for a united conservative coalition to win the nomination and the election. While it's too early to know how a Dole Administration would turn out, it's not too early for recriminations.
<P>
On paper the choice was an easy one: either make a conservative case for the front-runner, or coalesce around a candidate capable of stopping him. A thin slice of the conservative intelligentsia settled for Bob Dole early. The rest played with weak candidates or non-candidates. A number of prominent conservatives, many of them clustered around The Weekly Standard, flirted with Colin Powell and Newt Gingrich -- helping Dole freeze out his actual competition for crucial months. (By the time they moved to the Lamar Alexander camp, their influence in these matters had worn thin.) Other conservative notables such as Norquist and Paul Weyrich adopted an airy nonchalance about the outcome; some even suggested that it might not matter if Republicans won the White House so long as they held Congress.
<P>
And in the absence of a unifying candidate, the Reagan coalition split, with economic conservatives backing Steve Forbes and social conservatives going to Buchanan. The Forbes campaign was an attempt by the libertarian minority of the coalition to overpower the traditionalist majority through the sheer force of money and the support of a portion of the conservative elite (the Wall Street Journal's editorial page and The American Spectator blew kisses toward Forbes on a regular basis). The effort backfired, magnifying the influence of Buchanan, the least pro-market candidate, in early primaries.
<P>
Few conservative leaders backed Buchanan (though Gary Bauer, Phyllis Schlafly, Human Events, and others indulged his departures from free-market orthodoxy). But the Beltway Right inadvertently helped Buchanan to exploit fissures in the coalition by blithely ignoring the sentiments of social conservatives. A steady drumbeat from D.C. had signaled that social issues, notably abortion, had to be pushed to the back-burner. Washington conservatives' blind spot on the familial and moral principles that animate the grassroots caused them to underestimate Buchanan's political potential.
<P>
The upshot: social and economic conservatives signed a suicide pact. Not only did conservatives fail to control the nomination, they marginalized themselves as well. A fifth of primary voters listed taxation as their most important issue. An impressive plurality (39 per cent) of them backed Forbes even as he was soundedly defeated (with 12 per cent of the vote). Arguably, the effect of his campaign was to set back the cause of tax reform. Buchanan, meanwhile, did even better among dedicated pro-lifers than Forbes did among anti-taxers. When he was going strong, Buchanan simply isolated religious conservatives from the rest of the party. In the end, the man who won the primaries owes very little to either economic or social conservatives; except for Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson, they've mainly given him trouble.
<P>
Phil Gramm deserves a good portion of the blame for this debacle. In many ways the logical candidate of the coalition, he apparently assumed he was therefore its inevitable candidate. (In this respect, his campaign was eerily reminiscent of Kemp's in 1988.) Dole, ironically, did a better job of courting it. Gramm might have recovered from his early errors in a longer campaign. But although everyone talked about the speed of the primary process this year, nobody was really prepared for it. Even NR, which did the right thing in endorsing Phil Gramm, did so too late to do any good -- and that was before Iowa, let alone New Hampshire.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>ONSERVATIVES overestimated their power in the nominating process for the same reason Gramm erred. They confused electoral victories for conservative candidates over the last three decades with a deep and systematic belief in conservative ideas on the part of the voters. The conservative ``movement'' exists in the minds of a fairly small number of people; many who march with it have no deep understanding of its principles. (Nor, apparently, do its pundits.) While there may be an inchoate conservative majority in the country, it's not there just for the asking. That majority has to be continually converted, recruited, and given rousing song sheets. 
<P>
Conservatives ought to ponder the possibility that their current difficulties are symptomatic of an underlying disease, one whose debilitating effects may last beyond November regardless of the election results. Richard Vigilante saw the danger as early as 1985. Writing in NR's 30th anniversary issue, he warned that the conservative enterprise had become ``too large and too busy for philosophical reflection. If it does not find, or is not given, a clear, simple sense of what holds it together, it will split apart, ruptured by confusion and opportunism.'' Conservatives are not receiving that kind of intellectual sustenance, and are therefore increasingly adrift.
<P>
If conservatives are on intellectual autopilot, much of the explanation may lie in the culture of that network of thinkers, writers, and activists, (too) largely located in Washington and New York, whom one might designate collectively as ``conservative opinion leaders.'' They are, in short, an elite -- and they act like one. Too many conservatives are operating on a stale and derivative, even if largely accurate, orthodoxy. If popular concerns fit into that orthodoxy -- for instance, anti-tax sentiment -- they can respond readily enough, and win votes by doing so. Other anxieties -- notably, over the nation's cultural fragmentation -- just pass under their radar screen.
<P>
But the Right's strength since the Fifties has largely been built by diagnosing the grievances and anxieties of ordinary Americans and responding to them with real remedies. It is now losing touch with its base and its potential support. Thus conservatives are constantly being caught off guard by swings in the popular mood. (A case in point: the panic over ``worker anxiety'' after Pat Buchanan's showing in New Hampshire.) On occasion they have even tried to suppress discussion of the public's cultural anxieties. Instead of asking why so many grassroots conservatives opposed NAFTA, for instance, the Beltway elite simply told them they were being paranoid. A political movement in touch with its supporters can tell them when they're wrong; it can't tell them that they're not worried.
<P>
One Reaganite, herself a Beltway insider, decries ``the pernicious influence of the think-tank approach to life and politics. In the Seventies and Eighties, they did a terrific job of giving policy articulation to inchoate political resentments. But the policy articulation has now floated free of the political ground from which it originally sprang.'' The think tanks tend to reduce politics to a set of discrete policy areas without providing an overarching philosophy to link them.
<P>
Worse, conservative intellectuals seem unable to distinguish between their role and that of conservative politicians. They take care to keep their arguments safely within the confines of the politically ``possible'' while perhaps seeking to nudge those boundaries rightward. ``Too many people are writing op-eds which picture them in the campaign bull session or in the committee mark-up room,'' complains Lawrence Kudlow. As a result of this sort of positioning, conservative leaders lose sight both of first principles and of their own social base.
<P>
Meanwhile, the occasional mention on the Style page has gone to some of their heads. The immersion of many conservatives in the celebrity culture -- and particularly their willingness to caricature their ideas in order to make them sellable on television -- has been corrupting. With some honorable exceptions, they entertain viewers with their political movement and in the process are domesticated and rendered ineffectual. Blurring the line between politics and entertainment tends to make conservatives -- especially those in the Beltway -- seem cynical and frivolous.
<P>
Indeed, fin-de-siccle conservatism is increasingly concerned with matters of style, straining to make itself appear fashionable. Conservative chic often accompanies a tiresome triumphalism. The implication, notes Kudlow, is that ``we've won, we're cool, and you better join us'' -- as if the goal of conservatives were to replicate the smugness of a liberal Georgetown cocktail party. The result is not so much moral compromise, though it is sometimes that, as the political myopia that was evident during the primaries.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>G</FONT>IFTED and principled political leadership would go far to cure the conservative malaise. But no one since Reagan has emerged to provide a focal point for conservatives. Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett, icons to almost all conservatives just a few years ago, lacked the stomach to audition for the role. Instead, they have gone out of their way to annoy other conservatives; their remaining influence derives mostly from good press. Newt Gingrich, for his part, has proved unable to lead congressional Republicans and the conservative coalition simultaneously in the face of a hostile press. By default, then, Rush Limbaugh is the most visible conservative on the national scene. He is a force for common sense, but, wisely, he has declined to play a role for which he is not suited.
<P>
Conservatives cannot afford to wait for another Reagan to come along. Former NR publisher William Rusher says, ``I share the nostalgia. But the Lord does not always provide you with Ronald Reagans. We were badly spoiled and sometimes you have to do without.'' It is especially unbecoming for conservatives to complain that Bob Dole dispirits them when their own fecklessness did so much to ensure his nomination. One thoughtful observer of the Beltway Right expresses exasperation with the current conservative mood: ``All these people who are lamenting that we don't have a Reagan are betraying his legacy, which was a can-do spirit. If he were at these meetings he'd be asking how we could aggressively push forward, not kvetching that there's no Reagan.''
<P>
If Bob Dole is elected, it will make a difference whether the dominant faction of the party he leads is rudderless and confused, or vigorous and clear-headed. Tom Pauken, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, warns that if economic and social conservatives do not form a successful governing coalition in the next few years, ``You're going to see the splintering of our movement, you'll see conservatives start leaving the Republican Party, you'll see third- and fourth-party movements, you'll see a phenomenon in which people after a while just kind of bail out of the whole political system.''
<P>
Or conservatives could use the Dole interregnum to regroup, developing a higher degree of ideological self-consciousness and becoming accustomed to the political discipline of governing. They must simultaneously hold the conservative coalition together; keep the GOP anchored within a conservative, antistatist consensus while tackling new cultural and economic anxieties. A movement beset by inertia will be unable to accomplish any of these tasks. So far, however, conservatives don't seem to grasp that there's a problem.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
I have to be honest with you. Your last letter disturbed me. I don't think it was fair to call us ``too cocky by half.'' It just so happens that the American people are happy with what we've done and are eager to have us do more of it.
<P>
I could quote poll numbers and cite focus-group findings all day. But the truth is, we're going to win because we have a secret plan.
<P>
Okay, it's not a completely secret plan. I mean, I'm authorized to tell a few people. Tipper, for one, and you, and Joe Klein makes three . . . 
<P>
Here it is: for the next six months or so, Bill, HRC, Tipper, and I are pretty much going to live in California full time. Bill's taken a suite at the Sheraton Miramar in Santa Monica, Tip and I are looking at property up north, in Marin County, and HRC is going to kind of divide her time between San Diego and the Central Coast.
<P>
I wasn't sure about it at first. But Tipper convinced me.
<P>
``I don't know, Tip,'' I said. ``Won't the people in California see right through us?'' 
<P>
``What are you talking about?'' she asked. ``And don't stop packing.'' 
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``we've already ordered more B-1 bombers, we're talking about cracking down on illegal immigration, and now we're all going to move to the state and pretend it's all a coincidence?'' 
<P>
Tipper held a ``Heal the Bay'' T-shirt against me. ``Does this still fit?'' she asked. It did, so she tossed it into the duffel bag. 
<P>
``Look, Al,'' she said. ``What I know is we start with an electoral-vote deficit of about one hundred. And California has over half that.'' 
<P>
``Yes, but how dumb do you think the people in California are?'' 
<P>
``Um . . . If you lived in an area that periodically suffered devastating, property-destroying brush fires, would you keep rebuilding million-dollar houses there?''
<P>
``No.''
<P>
``Okay. Say you had a nice house on the beach. But every year, violent storms would wash it away, leaving you with nothing but a pile of driftwood and some sandbags. Would you, A) move; or B) build a new house in the same place?''
<P>
``A?'' 
<P>
``Good. Now say that you lived in an area in which, periodically, the earth shook violently for several seconds, leveling houses, freeways, bridges, destroying property, and killing people. What would you do?''
<P>
``Gosh, I'd move.'' 
<P>
``But what if you didn't?'' 
<P>
``Why wouldn't I? What am I, stupid?'' 
<P>
And then the light bulb went off above my head. I smiled at Tipper. 
<P>
I called Dad that afternoon to tell him the news. 
<P>
``Dad, Tipper and I are going to live in California for a while.'' 
<P>
``Wait a sec,'' he said. I could hear him picking up his highball. I could hear the ice tinkling in the glass as he sipped. 
<P>
``Is it November already? Did you guys lose?'' 
<P>
``No, Dad,'' I said as patiently as I could. ``We're just going out -- '' 
<P>
``Don't tell me. It's a must-win state and you're going to spread a little money around?'' 
<P>
``Well, I might quibble with your gloss, but -- ''
<P>
``Kiddo, let me give you a piece of advice. Wait a sec.'' I heard him pick up his highball, wipe the sweat off the glass, then take a big sip. ``Kiddo,'' he said, ``do you really think you're going to be able to make sense out of that state? They're the people who gave us Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown in the same year! They put shrimp on their pizza! They hire illegal aliens for a buck an hour to do the cleaning and the gardening and the odd-jobs around the house and then they complain that the illegals are ruining the state! The last time we Southerners had a deal like that we went to war to keep it!'' 
<P>
``Dad -- '' 
<P>
``And they keep building their damn houses on fault lines or tinder boxes or storm fronts.'' 
<P>
``Dad -- '' 
<P>
``You'll go out there, spread the money around, order some bombers and a missile-defense system or two, build more freeways, and do you know what those lunatics out there will do? They'll vote for the Libertarian -- or worse: they'll vote for that funny-looking guy with the big ears.'' 
<P>
``Prince Charles?'' 
<P>
``No! Then again, maybe -- they're weird out there.'' 
<P>
And with that, Dad hung up. Or maybe he put his drink down on the phone, I'm not sure. 
<P>
The point is, Rusty, we have a plan. Gotta go reset my watch!

<H2>Colin Powell, VP
</H2> </CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MARCH 29
<P>
Concerning the proposal: Colin Powell for Vice President, a few observations:
<P>
1. The primary qualification for a vice-presidential selection is: Will he substantially enhance the probability of the election of the presidential candidate?
<P>
On the matter of General Powell, the answer to that question, at this reading, is Yes. In fact, his name conjoined to that of Bob Dole makes up the only slate that would defeat Clinton - Gore. Granted, the popularity of General Powell would almost certainly diminish soon after he began to campaign. In part his high prestige rests on his reputation as an Olympian figure, undefiled by politics.
<P>
It was so with General Eisenhower in 1952. The New Leader magazine illustrated the sharp turn in public opinion the week after Eisenhower's first political address in his home state. The headline was ``IKE STOPPED AT ABILENE.'' It is not even safe to assume that Powell would sweep the black vote. The last estimate on this question, in October, was that he would carry 30 per cent of black Americans. But that is a critical swing, given that 95 per cent have gone Democratic over the years. And, true, the fact of a black on the national ticket would turn some white voters away. The awful social/ethnic division highlighted by the reaction to the O. J. Simpson verdict instructs us that there is a body of Americans not yet prepared to vote for a black candidate. As much is probably true of a Jewish candidate; as much was certainly true of a Catholic candidate up until JFK. 
<P>
2. The ideological objections to General Powell as Vice President are of an entirely different order from what they'd have been if he were running for President. A presidential candidate's position on such high-ignition questions as abortion and affirmative action matters substantially. The voters are asked to express their choice both politically and symbolically. If Bob Dole were flat-out in favor of abortion he would not win, either the nomination or the election. 
<P>
It is another thing when it is a vice-presidential candidate being considered. For one thing, by accepting the nomination, the vice-presidential candidate subordinates his position on divisive issues, deferring to the presidential candidate. It is simply inconceivable that nominee Powell could tour the country during the fall taking issue with Dole's position on abortion or for that matter any other important political question. The last time that happened was Andrew Jackson - John C. Calhoun. If the voter were deciding whom to vote for on the assumption that Dole would die or retire, it is hardly probable that on being sworn in, President Powell would reverse his predecessor's position on abortion. 
<P>
On the question of affirmative action, the Republican delegates in San Diego are going to realize that the direction the debate will take depends on two factors. The first is how the plebiscite that would forbid affirmative action fares in California. The second is how the Supreme Court, which is narrowly divided on the issue, swings. Affirmative action is an empirical failure and a philosophical disaster. Its destiny is not in the hands of the Republican nominee for Vice President. 
<P>
3. On the matter of Powell's designating himself as a ``Rockefeller Republican'' we are constrained to ask two questions. The first is, Did it substantially damage Gerald Ford when he named Rockefeller as Vice President in 1974? Evidence is not abundant that the selection was an abomination among Republicans of the day. And this was owing to two factors that have been lost in the mists of memory. The first is that although Rockefeller had been the embodiment of liberal Republicanism, he was always on the right side on foreign policy: the anti-Soviet side. A second is that the Rockefeller of the Seventies was, on domestic questions, a changed man. I was present at a small dinner party in 1972 when Governor Rockefeller raised his glass to Governor Reagan and said that he needed to admit that on most domestic issues, Reagan had been wiser than he. 
<P>
4. If Colin Powell accepts the nomination, nothing like the treachery suggested will have been done. In 1964 I urged candidate Goldwater to name ex-President Eisenhower as his running-mate. Quixotic stuff, but an early recognition that a presidential candidate wants a running-mate who will help him get to the White House, and it dazzles the imagination that anyone who cares about abortion or affirmative action would in effect endorse the re-election of Bill Clinton for the platonic satisfaction of a loyalty-test rejection of Colin Powell.

Who says Ross Perot is unpredictable? As soon as Bob  Dole wrapped up the nomination and the press needed something to write about, the Texan stepped into the vacuum with media-teasing talk of running for President again (but only, of course, if his supporters and hired political operatives around the country draft him). Perot represents the rot of American politics, a populism that is off the point (avoiding the gut-level issues that bother Americans), mindless (refusing to distinguish between the GOP Congress and President Clinton), and destructive (seeking, ultimately, to encourage cynicism among the voting public). After bringing the balanced budget to the fore in 1992, Perot stood idly by as Republicans banged their heads against a wall trying to enact one. Now, naturally, he attacks them for failing. The focus of Perot's 1996 campaign will be campaign-finance reform. So, naturally, he will spend $60 million of his own cash denouncing the role of money in politics. Enough people seem to be onto this act that Perot will be relegated this time around to single digits (where his support will be drawn in unpredictable proportions from Dole and Clinton). Then, this particular crazy aunt will finally be put back into the basement.

On March 28, the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment to the immigration-reform bill introduced by Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) to increase -- yes, increase -- legal immigration by more than 100,000. The amendment's supporters, including Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.), Paul Simon (D., Ill.), and Mike DeWine (R., Ohio), manipulated statistics to present their plan as a moderate reduction in family-preference and ``diversity'' immigration. But Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies points out that while the original Simpson bill would have cut total legal immigration to an estimated 600,000 a year during the first five years, and to just over 450,000 thereafter, the Kennedy - Abraham amendment would push legal immigration to more than 830,000 while reducing the share of visas for skilled workers from 20 per cent under the original bill to a maximum of 15.6 per cent. (Unused visas for skilled workers would be allocated to family-based immigrants, although the immigrationists tell us that there is a shortage of skill-based immigrants.) Kennedy, Abraham, Simon, DeWine, Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), and Russ Feingold (D., Wis.) voted for the amendment; Simpson, Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), Hank Brown (R., Colo.), and Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) voted nay. That makes the breakdown: Republicans, opposed; Democrats and Mugwumps, in favor.

In 1998, get ready for Tom Campbell, Republican senatorial nominee from California. At least that's what the moderate congressman was thinking when he hatched the idea of switching California's primaries from ``closed'' to ``open.'' Translation: Instead of only Republicans being permitted to vote for their party's nominee, Democrats can vote in the GOP primary too (and vice versa). The intention is to make it easier for moderates like Campbell -- who narrowly lost to conservative Bruce Herschensohn in a 1992 primary -- to draw the votes of Democrats and dilute the strength of conservatives. Bankrolled by the late David Packard, a Campbell backer, a ballot measure to open the primaries, effective in 1998, passed easily in late March. Both parties opposed it. But the battle was lost early on when ballot language was approved describing Proposition 198 in such goo-goo terms that voting against it seemed like opposing democracy itself. Now the parties have to figure out another way -- perhaps a law suit or a counter-initiative -- to preserve the integrity of their primaries. As for Campbell, there's nothing about his eager desire to win Democratic primary votes that a simple switch in registration wouldn't satisfy.

The Freemen, currently holed up near tiny Jordan, Montana, ran an elaborate check-fraud and counterfeiting operation that since late 1994 bilked businesses and the government of around $1.8 million. They held seminars on tax evasion and check fraud for other free spirits from across the nation. They set bounties on local officials and threatened their lives. And they did it all undisturbed by federal law enforcement. The Freemen are the Loony Right's answer to Rodney King. America's most famous drunk driver, you'll remember, has a free pass for life from an LAPD not eager to tangle with him again. The Freemen almost got similar treatment from the FBI and its director, Louis Freeh, rightly chastened by Waco and Ruby Ridge. Members of the Freemen had been indicted by a federal grand jury for offenses related to their creative financing back in May 1995. But the FBI didn't dare arrest them. It took the local county attorney begging for action, and a local farmer rounding up a 25-man posse to storm the group's stronghold, before the feds acted. Now that there is a siege on, the FBI is wise to heed the lessons of the past and take it slow. But a lesson can be learned too well. Mr. Freeh, it's OK to arrest nuts when they also happen to be crooks.

We're all free-traders now. Right? Wrong. Case in point, the latest G-7 conference on employment. Further liberalization of world trade, said Jacques Chirac, requires ``a few basic rules'' to be applied universally ``so as to guarantee the dignity of the working man, wherever in the world he may be.'' Translation: The onerous employment restrictions that make it nearly impossible to downsize in Europe, along with European-style entitlements (and their corollary -- high rates of unemployment and taxation), must be adopted in the U.S. and Japan. Chirac avers that different wage and employment laws would be ``less and less tolerated'' as international competition grows. We agree: left to itself, free trade will invariably shrink government in countries that have too much of it. But Robert Reich is supporting Chirac, and the International Labor Organization in demanding uniformity -- at Europe's levels. Perhaps someone should teach the Labor Secretary some French, as in, Vive la difference.

A cohort of GOP leaders, from Dole and Gingrich on down, appeared at a March 21 news conference to announce the Defend America Act of 1996. Its aim is to require the deployment by 2003 of an anti-missile defense for the United States. President Clinton, in thrall to outmoded strategic doctrines, vetoed a similar provision in the 1996 defense-authorization bill and has slowed down procurement of theater missile defenses as well. But the congressional leaders rightly cited the emerging missile threat not only from rogue states like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, but also from China: Gingrich quoted a Chinese official who recently boasted to a visiting American that Taiwan was vulnerable because the U.S. would never risk Los Angeles. Protecting this country and its forces and friends abroad is an obvious strategic priority -- a political priority, if the Democrats shirk it.

The National Association of Scholars has just issued a study called ``The Dissolution of General Education, 1914 - 1993,'' documenting the precipitous drop in mandatory coursework in American universities and colleges, particularly since the 1960s. This amounts to the loss of a common core of knowledge once deemed essential to a liberal education; college students can now remain intellectual freshmen for four years. In 1914, 98 per cent of elite schools required English composition; by 1993, the figure had dropped to 36 per cent, making way for the advent of remedial English comp, which is often merely a diet of ``free writing'' exercises. Courses in foreign languages were required by 90 per cent of top schools in 1964, by 66 per cent in 1993; courses in history, by 38 per cent in 1964, 12 per cent in 1993. The proportion requiring literature courses dropped from 57 per cent in 1914 to 14 per cent in 1993, mathematics courses, from 82 to 12 per cent. The study concludes that the well-structured general education has ``largely vanished,'' causing ``a purging from the curriculum of many of the required basic survey courses that used to familiarize students with the historical, cultural, political, and scientific foundations of their society.'' In this light, multiculturalism begins to make sense: it gives students the soothing feeling that what they don't know isn't worth knowing.

This week's new disease is hyperlexia. It means taking, quote, an ``unusual'' interest in letters and numbers, and learning to read and spell, quote, ``too soon.'' In other words, being a bright kid. This ``affliction'' has all the earmarks of being invented by public-school psychologists. Children who can read must be a nightmare in a lot of public schools. They make it difficult to dumb down the rest of the class at an orderly pace, and they're much smarter than the average member of the teachers' unions.

Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Nebraska, has put his flock on notice that they must choose between being Catholics in good standing and belonging to organizations that oppose Church teachings. The proscribed organizations include Planned Parenthood and the Hemlock Society, as might be expected, but also super-traditionalist groups that reject the Second Vatican Council as heretical. The media blazoned, ``Bishop Threatens to Excommunicate Dissenting Catholics.'' Another way of putting it is that Bishop Bruskewitz is doing his pastoral duty in alerting people to the fact that they have removed themselves from communion. He apparently believes that he who affirms A on Sunday cannot affirm not-A on Monday. Public, persistent, and knowing agitation against the teaching of the Church is not compatible with membership in it. That's not so difficult to grasp. While canon lawyers reportedly mull the legal niceties of the bishop's action, we believe that he has made a very good start that other church leaders (and not only Roman Catholic) might think about emulating.

Any kid can figure out how to get on the Internet, but the IRS, after spending $4 billion to modernize its 1960s-era computers, still has to truck taxpayers' records from one office to another on magnetic tapes. The Treasury Department acknowledges that the IRS modernization is ``badly off track,'' but has not called off plans to spend over $16 billion more. Still, if that's all it costs to keep the IRS primitive, it's a bargain.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>OR American liberals, Thomas Jefferson is the cultural hero par excellence, cherished for his positions on freedom of expression and on separation of Church and State and for his populistic rhetoric. (That this was a populism for whites only is a fact which American liberals have managed not to address.)
<P>
Of course Jefferson is a hero to many Americans apart from liberals, and his admirers include, as we now know, some white right-wing terrorists. On July 3, 1995, the Washington Post published Serge Kovaleski's profile of Terry Lynn Nichols, the second man charged in the Oklahoma City bombing. According to Kovaleski, Nichols read the works of Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine and was particularly inspired by Jefferson's maxim, ``The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.''
<P>
According to CNN News (January 31, 1996), the first suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh, was wearing a T-shirt carrying those same words at the time he was arrested while driving away from Oklahoma City. The CNN correspondent, Susan Candiotti, put a question about the T-shirt to McVeigh's lawyer, Stephen Jones. Jones replied: ``Well, if Thomas Jefferson said it, I don't think it would be incriminating at all.''
<P>
Jefferson did say it. He wrote those words in a letter to William Stevens Smith on November 13, 1787. Jefferson was writing from Paris, where he was Minister Plenipotentiary at the time, but the words do not imply any premonition of impending revolution in France. They are used in justification of Shays's Rebellion in Massachusetts. In the letter to Smith, the words, ``It is its natural manure,'' appear after ``blood of patriots and tyrants.''
<P>
Jefferson did not have the French Revolution in mind when he wrote those words. But as soon as that revolution began he wrote about it in the ``tree of liberty'' spirit, and set virtually no limits to the amount of blood the French Revolutionaries might legitimately shed in the cause of liberty -- ``Rather than it should have failed, I would have seen half the earth desolated.'' So Jefferson wrote in January 1793 after the news of the September massacres in Paris had reached America.
<P>
The concept of the bloodthirsty tree of liberty entered into the rhetoric of the French Revolution itself and specifically into the rhetoric of the Revolutionary Terror. The terrorist Bertrand Barcre used a variant of it in the peroration of his speech calling for the execution of Louis XVI: ``The tree of liberty, as an ancient author remarks, flourishes when it is watered with the blood of all varieties of tyrants.'' Macaulay, whose knowledge of classical literature was prodigious, did not believe in the existence of Barcre's ``ancient author'': ``In the course of our own small reading among the Greek and Latin writers, we have not happened to fall in with trees of liberty and watering-pots full of blood, nor can we, such is our ignorance of classical ambiguity, even imagine an Attic or Roman orator employing imagery of that sort'' (Edinburgh Review, April 1844).
<P>
We know (as Macaulay probably did not) that Thomas Jefferson had ``employed imagery of that sort'' five years before Barcre did and in the same city. Could the idea have reached Barcre from Jefferson? Conceivably. Barcre could not have known of Jefferson's letter of five years before to an American correspondent. But Jefferson had been in Paris for the Fall of the Bastille, which was accompanied and followed by a number of bloody episodes. Jefferson's dispatches and letters of the period reflect a sober appreciation of the efficiency of mob violence in a revolutionary situation. ``The decapitation of de Launay worked powerfully thro' the night on the whole aristocratical party [so that they realized] the absolute necessity that the king should give up everything to the States [General].'' Some of Jefferson's acquaintances in Paris (who mostly belonged, like La Rochefoucauld and Condorcet, to the Enlightenment section of the nobility) may well have been shocked by the bloodshed, and have said so to Jefferson. If so, he could well have comforted them with some version of the thought about the tree of liberty and its natural manure. The story could then have gone the rounds and eventually reached the ears which were most likely to be attracted by the characteristics of that tree.
<P>
In any case, the bloodthirsty tree remains part of the revolutionary and terrorist traditions in the twentieth century. In ``The Rose Tree'' -- the most ``revolutionary'' of the four poems W. B. Yeats wrote about the Easter Rising of 1916 -- the last stanza runs:
<P>
<blockquote>
``But where can we draw water,''<BR>
Said Pearse to Connolly,<BR>
``When all the wells are parched away?<BR>
O plain as plain can be<BR>
There's nothing but our own red blood<BR>
Can make a right Rose Tree.''
</blockquote>
<P>
Yeats was probably not aware of the Jeffersonian origins of his metaphor. But I have heard the Jeffersonian passage about the tree correctly quoted, and properly attributed, by people who were interested in legitimizing the terror offensive of the Provisional IRA, which began in 1971, was suspended in 1994, and again resumed in February of this year.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>L</FONT>IBERALISM and terrorism appear as opposing concepts. But they have something in common. Both belong to the large and heterogeneous family of the devotees of freedom. Freedom is the most powerful and the most ambiguous of abstract ideas. There are two main divisions within the massive ambiguities. There is freedom combined with order and limited by law. This is the freedom of England's Glorious Revolution and of the American Constitution. This is the ``manly, moral, regulated liberty'' which Burke defended in Reflections on the Revolution in France. This is the freedom of the mainstream liberal tradition in the English-speaking world. And it is also the freedom of the mainstream conservative tradition in the same world. In their philosophy of freedom, the common ground between the two traditions is more important than the differences. Edmund Burke belongs to both those traditions, and no one should seek to wrest him from one of them in order to monopolize him for the other.
<P>
Outside the zone of ordered freedom, now more or less coextensive with the Western world, the idea of freedom and the love of freedom take starker and more elemental forms. Freedom is thought of as the appurtenance and rightful heritage of a particular group of people defined by nationality, religion, language, ancestry, or territorial affiliation, and usually by some combination of several of these elements. Some other group or groups of people are felt to be denying freedom to us, who must have it. Freedom so understood is one of the most powerful of human motivating forces and the most destructive, impelling large numbers of people to risk their lives for it and to take the lives of others, the enemies of freedom. Serbs and Croats cut one another's throats, and all for freedom's sake.
<P>
When the Communist system collapsed in Europe, many Westerners were confident that freedom would take its place, and so it did. But in many parts of the former Soviet Union, the freedom that emerged was not freedom as understood in the West, but rather a conflict of freedoms: national and ethnic freedoms, at war with one another. Russians are making a brave effort to establish an ordered version of freedom, but that version is challenged by other versions.
<P>
Much of the world today breathes what Edmund Burke called ``the wild gas'' of liberty. Burke used that phrase about the French Revolution in the condition it was in in 1790, a year after the Fall of the Bastille, and two years before the advent of the Terror. The Whigs -- the ancestors of modern liberals -- believed that the French Revolution was over, having brought about the triumph of liberty. Burke was about to break with the Whigs, over that proposition. He wrote in Reflections:
<P>
``When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong principle at work; and this, for a while, is all I can know of it. The wild gas, the fixed air is plainly broke loose; but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a little subdued, till the liquor is cleared and until we see something deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably sure before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing that they have really received one. I should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had been combined with government, with public force, with the discipline and obedience of armies, with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue; with morality and religion; with the solidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and social manners. All these (in their way) are good things too, and, without them, liberty is not a benefit in itself, and is not likely to continue long. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they please. We ought to see what it will please them to do, before we risk congratulations, which may soon be turned into complaints.''
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT> REFERRED just now to the contrast between ``ordered liberty'' in the West, and passionate versions of liberty in the world outside. The contrast is obvious, but it is not clear cut. Within the West also there are passionate absolutist libertarians claiming inspiration from within the Western tradition, as in the cases of the persons arrested for the Oklahoma City bombing. And Western liberals are ill-prepared to cope with terrorism. This is a question of psychology, not of formal liberal doctrine. In the British tradition that doctrine was formulated most authoritatively by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty. Mill wrote: ``The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.'' The doctrine of ``self-protection'' would seem to authorize democratic societies to take such measures as may be necessary to defend the citizens against terrorist conspiracies, without defection from liberal principles. If the ordinary courts, and the ordinary criminal laws, are inadequate to protect the citizens from terrorism, then a liberal of the school of Mill could legislate, without a qualm of principle, for the introduction of internment without trial of persons whom the security authorities believe to be terrorists.
<P>
John Stuart Mill is the leading British liberal thinker. But a figure more representative of the British liberal tradition is the great liberal politician, William Ewart Gladstone. And Gladstone is the classic embodiment of the weakness of the English liberal mind in trying to cope with terrorism. Gladstone admitted that his whole attitude to Ireland was changed overnight by a single Irish terrorist act: the Fenian bombing of Clerkenwell Prison in 1867. That bomb convinced Gladstone that the Irish must be suffering from terrible grievances, which it was his duty to remove. ``My mission is to pacify Ireland,'' he declared. He tried to do this by a series of reforms, beginning with the disestablishment of the Irish (Anglican) Church in 1870.
<P>
The Irish terrorists were not interested in matters like Church disestablishment. But they were very interested in the effect which their Clerkenwell bomb had had on the mind of the leading British politician of the day. What Gladstone's reaction to that bomb taught them was that terrorism works. And that lesson is the most enduring legacy of Gladstonian liberalism. ``Violence is the only thing the British understand'' is the favorite maxim of Irish Republicans even today. Canary Wharf in 1996 is heir to Clerkenwell in 1867.
<P>
At the level of logic, the liberal mind is in the grip of a fallacy: that terrorism can be rooted out by concessions and compromise, without any need to resort to inconvenient and painful emergency measures, like internment. This is a fallacy, because the terrorist mind is absolutist and unappeasable. Irish terrorists want to destroy Northern Ireland, and will not voluntarily stop anywhere short of that. Arab terrorists want to destroy Israel, and will not voluntarily stop anywhere short of that. Both sets of terrorists are interested in concessions and efforts at compromise only as evidence that the bombings are moving the enemy in the right direction, however slowly.
<P>
Compromises are possible, of course, but only with terrorists who are willing to become ex-terrorists, like Michael Collins in the 1920s or Arafat now. But terrorism survived the compromises. In the current case, Israel surrendered territory to Arafat, hoping to get peace in exchange. But unreconstructed terrorists, ignoring Arafat, have been able to use the territory surrendered as a base for attacks on Israel.
<P>
To seek to end terrorism by compromise is a fallacy in logic, because it misrepresents the nature of the phenomenon with which it attempts to cope. But beneath the fallacy lies a powerful emotional force: guilt (exceptionally strong in Gladstone, for example). British Gladstonian liberals -- to be found today among both Tories and Labourites -- feel chronically guilty about Britain's past treatment of Ireland. Israeli doves -- the liberals of Israel -- feel guilty about Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs. In both cases, there are some reasons for guilt. Unfortunately, feelings of guilt are of no help in the struggle against terrorism. On the contrary, they are a resource which the terrorist knows he can exploit, and he does so with a savage satisfaction.
<P>
In some cases, but not in all, there are political initiatives that could isolate the terrorists, and perhaps eventually lead to their defeat. For Israel, peace with Syria is the best available option: to give back the Golan Heights, in exchange for which Syria would eliminate terrorism in Lebanon and dry up the sources of supply for terrorists in the Territories.
<P>
In Northern Ireland, unfortunately, no promising political option is within reach. There are two sets of private armies there, a Protestant one and a Catholic one. Efforts to appease one -- at present the Catholics -- do not appease it, and they risk arousing the latent violence of the other one. Efforts to make the realities of Northern Ireland conform to a Gladstonian agenda are doomed to failure. The best hope for Northern Ireland would be a co-ordination of security measures between London and Dublin, including the introduction of internment -- applied evenly to both sets of political-sectarian paramilitaries -- on both sides of the border. (Which worked during the Second World War and in 1957 - 1962.) At present British and Irish versions of liberalism (combining in Ireland with nationalism) inhibit that response. I fear that the necessary measures will not be taken until things get much worse. The IRA promises another 25 years of ``war.''
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>F THE terrorist threat increases in America, American liberals are likely to oppose any counter-measures which may be proposed against it. In doing so they will claim the sanction of Thomas Jefferson, whose protests against the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 are part of the charter of American liberalism. But I don't think American liberalism is strong enough, in itself, to inhibit counter-measures against terrorism. What might inhibit them is something different but cognate: the dislike among millions of Americans for the restraints and constraints of ``ordered freedom'' and a taste for the absolute stuff, straight out of the bottle: the version of the Jeffersonian tradition offered by McVeigh and Nichols. Most of the five million members of the National Rifle Association no doubt repudiate terrorist acts. But most of them would oppose any serious clampdown on terrorists who happened to be white, Christian, and conservative. So liberals protesting against an anti-terrorist clampdown would have some unaccustomed allies. If American terrorism ever acquires sustained momentum, it could be more dangerous than is today's terrorism in the Middle East and the British Isles.
<P>
Let me close with a pair of disquieting statistics. I have seen it estimated that there are between thirty and forty thousand armed men in the militia movement who regard themselves as either at war or on the verge of war with the Federal Government. The total active membership of the IRA is reckoned as between two and three thousand.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
We're tops in the polls, the economy looks solid, Perot might run, and no one's stepped on a land mine yet in Bosnia. So why am I so down? 
<P>
I started feeling not-totally-up at yesterday's campaign-strategy meeting. We've been having these monthly meetings for a year now, and it was just me, Bill, Dick Morris, and HRC. And with HRC in Bosnia, I thought it would be a cozy threesome -- a time when Bill, Dick, and I could start some long-range thinking about the next 12 years, when the country transitions from a Bill Clinton operating system to an Al Gore operating system.
<P>
But now that polls have started showing us 23 points ahead of Bob Dole, the room was packed. There was George Stephanopoulos, Mandy Grunwald, Mack McClarty, Vernon Jordan, Leon Panetta, the entire White House Fellows program, Joe Klein (for some reason), and some people I've never seen before. A large man in a blue windbreaker sat against the wall, eating doughnuts out of a carton. I walked up to him. ``You're a Secret Service agent, right?'' 
<P>
``Wrong.'' He reached into his pocket and handed me a card. ``AFL-CIO, campaign division. You gots a problem with me, you gots a problem with my boys on K Street. So what's it gonna be?'' 
<P>
``This is supposed to be a closed meeting,'' I said, as politely as possible. 
<P>
``So close it,'' he said, shrugging. He jerked a thumb at Stephanopoulos. ``Kick pretty boy out. But me, I paid 35 mil for this seat and I ain't givin' it up. So if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to my cruller.'' 
<P>
This was too much. We had made such great strides in the past few months keeping the meetings organized and efficient. It seemed like our poll numbers were encouraging the staff to slip back into old bad habits. I ducked out into the hallway to wait for Bill.
<P>
As he strode up, I stopped him. ``Bill,'' I said, ``I've got some bad news.'' 
<P>
He went pale and bit his lower lip. ``Oh my Lord,'' he quavered. ``It's Hillary, isn't it? She's been killed in a Serb mortar attack? Oh what a fool I was to allow her to go!'' 
<P>
``Bill!'' I said. ``Hillary didn't get killed in a mortar attack.'' 
<P>
``A Greek terrorist suicide bus bomb?'' 
<P>
``No,'' I said. 
<P>
``What, then?'' he asked, sighing. 
<P>
``I just wanted to warn you that the meeting is packed. We're starting to lose our discipline again. We're getting too complacent. This meeting has so many people, it could go on forever.''
<P>
Bill smiled. ``I know,'' he said. ``Isn't it cool?'' 
<P>
The meeting itself went not much better. Actually the AFL-CIO guy wasn't a problem. He never made a sound, except for some paper rustling and napkin dabbing. He and Bill argued briefly over who touched the honey-glazed first, but other than that, he wasn't there. 
<P>
But Stephanopoulos must have asked nine times if the time wasn't right for Bill to resubmit his health-care program, now that his poll numbers are above 50 per cent. Dick patiently explained nine times that the reason Bill's poll numbers were above 50 per cent was because people had forgotten about his health-care program, which, frankly, I dispute, since many portions of it -- the mental-health task force in particular -- enjoyed widespread support. 
<P>
Finally, the subject came around to the budget.
<P>
``I'm concerned,'' I said, ``that the budget plan may end up hurting more than helping us.'' 
<P>
``How so?'' Dick asked. 
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``I think the people are looking for leadership here, and I'm not sure that we're giving it to them.'' 
<P>
``We balance the budget in seven years, Mr. Vice President. What more do you want?'' 
<P>
``But we don't, really,'' I said. ``We don't make any real cuts for four years. All the cuts are made in the back three years.'' 
<P>
Bill chimed in. ``Al, with all due respect, those 'back three years' you're talking about -- hey, I plan to be in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as Dean of the Kennedy School, working on two things -- my memoirs as a two-termer, and some co-eds.'' 
<P>
``But I plan to be here, filling out my first term as your successor,'' I said. ``So why don't we take the long view, and spread the budget cuts evenly over the seven years?'' 
<P>
Bill looked out the window for a moment. He took a bite of his doughnut. ``You know,'' he said quietly, ``I'll bet George Bush said that same thing in this same room 12 years ago.'' 
<P>
And then he headed out of the meeting. So you can see why I'm depressed.

NEW YORK, MARCH 26
<P>
After months and months of negotiation, one American enterprise made a deal with the half-dozen most critical custodians of Soviet data. It would bring out 25 volumes, perhaps as many as 50, laying bare, so to speak, the minutes of the Communist era, 1917 - 1991. It wasn't the State Department that managed this, or the CIA, or the Library of Congress, let alone the National Endowment for the Humanities. It was Yale University Press. Jonathan Brent, its executive editor, made a deal that gave U.S. scholars the right to research and to publish the critical archives of the regime. Of the KGB, the military, the Presidium, the Central Committee, the foreign ministry. The terms? The Yale University Press is obliged to publish its volumes simultaneously in Russian, for distribution from Moscow.
<P>
Now this enterprise is a huge contribution to an understanding of the most important political phenomenon of the century, the rise and fall of the Communist international movement. The documents tell us not only about the workaday machinations of the largest totalitarian organization in history, but also about its actors. We have already from the Annals of Communism series a volume giving us the letters written by Stalin to Molotov, his most trusted subordinate -- arguably, his only trusted subordinate. They tell us things many of us more or less knew -- that Stalin was suspicious, ruthless, ironhanded -- but they do so with the finality of the holographic original. Labor problem out there? Stalin writes to his lieutenant, ``Definitely shoot two or three dozen wreckers from these apparaty [sic], including several dozen common cashiers.'' Volumes are scheduled, all of them edited under scrupulous scholarly supervision, that deal with the last days of the Romanovs. There will be volumes on Lenin's secret archive, the church, the people and the Bolsheviks, Soviet politics and repression, the diary of Georgi Dimitrov, the assassination of Sergei Kirov . . . ``What Saudi is to oil, these records are to twentieth-century history,'' Bruce Nelan wrote in Time magazine.
<P>
Now here is the problem. 
<P>
The parliamentary turmoil in Russia casts long shadows. The Russian Left has never liked the idea of disgorging all the secrets because they have the effect of eviscerating any trace of idealism in the Soviet experiment, at least in the hands of its generals. And the Russian Right doesn't like it because the firm hand of authoritarian government beckons to a society punchdrunk with liberalism and suffering now corruption, crime, inflation, and unemployment. The elections in June could very well result in a Communist victory. How long between such a development and a freeze of the agreement with Yale? It would not happen overnight, and there would be great pressure from the archival community within Russia to continue with the operation. The publications are of academic and historical interest to the United States. Their importance to Russia has to do with the country's future. And the volatility of the political situation justifies proceeding without delay. 
<P>
And the U.S. problem? Funds. The usual good soldiers have made contributions -- Olin, Smith Richardson, Bradley -- but, to date, less than $400,000 (out of $3 million needed) has been raised. The project is unique. If it were less than that we could say of it that it is ``the kind of thing'' the National Endowment for the Humanities was created to encourage. Why not? Why not the Ford Foundation? The Rockefeller Foundation? The MacArthur Fund?
<P>
The judgment of this observer is that we have here something on the order of a biblical narrative discrediting everything about the Soviet Union popularized by leftist fancy for two generations. The hero John Reed turns out to have been paid $1 million for his work as a Soviet agent. The labor-union movement was primarily an instrument of Soviet power. The independent ``progressive'' movements in the United States, France, Italy were Moscow operations. We have here a historical juggernaut capable of refashioning the trendy history in which so many American scholars were once ensnared; and they are not in the mood, many of them, to invite the coroner to certify to their naivete.
<P>
Imagine, just imagine the amount of money that would have flowed in if an early document had established that Alger Hiss was, through 1935 - 1945, a U.S. patriot, untempted by any ideological wind east of the New Deal. If such a document existed, the MacArthur types would have handed the Yale enterprise the keys to their treasuries. The National Endowment? You account for it. But if you have influence, use it to raise money for the Annals of Communism series of the Yale University Press, Executive Editor, Jonathan Brent, 302 Temple Street, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.

He came, he spent, he went. That is the Beltway wiseguy epitaph on the Steve Forbes campaign. But that shows you what wiseguys know. Mr. Forbes ran a campaign of good humor and principle, in the face of ruthless counterattacks from the Dole forces. Ultimately, he focused on a too-narrow range of issues. But his issues -- economic optimism and a populist approach to tax cuts -- will be essential to GOP victory in November. To make his case, he spent $25 million of his own money, which occasioned much hand-wringing. Another way to look at Forbes's campaign potlatch is that it costs that much to get neglected ideas through the fog of reporters' and politicians' indifference. (Pat Buchanan, the other high-profile outsider, profited from years of television and newspaper commentary.) A clever GOP establishment, having taken Mr. Forbes and Mr. Buchanan to the cleaners, would selectively steal their clothes.

Before the agony of last year's budget fight is fully over, along comes President Clinton's proposed 1997 budget. There's not much new: the same tepid tax cuts combined with lots of ``loophole closers''; the same bogus, unspecified spending cuts set to take effect sometime after Clinton has ended his second term; the same very real spending increases today (both spending and the deficit would go up in 1997). In short, the latest Clinton budget is as craven a political document as the eight ones that preceded it in the last 12 months. The first thing Republicans should do in response is: Get over it! It should be clear by now that Clinton isn't going to cut a deal, nor is he going to play straight with his numbers. So, there need be no more talk from Republicans of government shutdowns, of defaults, of CBO scoring, of saving Medicare, of balance in 2002. (We hope Newt Gingrich is kidding when he talks of making his troops vote on another massive balanced-budget plan this spring.) Instead, Republicans should put the remnants of the fight over 1996 spending behind them as quickly as possible, and declare victory: thanks to their series of tight continuing resolutions, the deficit will indeed decline steeply this year. Republicans should restrain 1997 spending with another tight CR (avoiding fights over budgetary details) and then change the subject. Any budget talk should focus on tax cuts to counteract the effects of the Clinton Crunch, and on widely popular proposals like the Balanced Budget Amendment. The President has gotten a free ride for a year because he has been the only one playing politics on the budget. Last year the Republicans couldn't beat him; now it's time to join him.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde is used to fighting attempts from the Left to water down crime bills. But when the House recently took up anti-terrorism legislation, it was conservative freshman Bob Barr (R., Ga.) -- cheered on by the National Rifle Association -- who led an effort to gut the bill, over the opposition of the likes of liberal Brooklyn Democrat Charles Schumer. What accounts for the strange turnabout? Hyde got part of the answer in the House cloakroom when one GOP colleague told him: ``I trust Hamas more than my own government.'' After Waco and Ruby Ridge, a radical distrust of federal law enforcement, reminiscent of the New Left, has infected parts of the Right. There is ample reason to distrust centralized police power, and any abuse of it must be exposed and punished promptly, which famously did not occur with Ruby Ridge or Waco. But limitless distrust offends against both good sense and good politics. Rep. Barr worked successfully to strip from the anti-terrorism bill provisions that would have, among other things, allowed the expedited deportation of aliens linked to terrorism and permitted the Federal Government to designate foreign groups as terrorist and outlaw U.S. fund-raising for them. Idaho conservative Rep. Helen Chenoweth went further, co-sponsoring an amendment to scuttle habeas-corpus reforms long sought by Republicans, lest they be wielded against those ``wrongfully prosecuted for exercising their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.'' Needless to say, the Clinton Administration was overjoyed with the newly soft-on- crime GOP. And it will be treated to more of the same until some House Republicans learn the difference between Hamas and the FBI.

To those who have been hoping there will be significant cuts in corporate welfare once Senator Ethanol steps down as Majority Leader, meet Senator Bilge-Pump. Trent Lott (Miss.), Mr. Dole's likely successor and the son of a shipyard pipefitter, is leading the effort to ram a ten-year extension of federal maritime subsidies through Congress. Although benefits to the shippers would be lower than in the past, the bill would still provide some $100 million annually in direct payments and continue to grant exclusive rights to $500 million in government contracts. Al Gore's government-waste committee recommended killing the subsidies in 1993, as did the House Budget Committee in 1994. Even the Pentagon, which once maintained that national security required a robust maritime industry, has backed off, citing the successful use of its own fleet and foreign firms during the Gulf War. By championing corporate welfare, Senator Lott lends credence to liberals who claim Congress is interested in slashing only the personal variety of welfare, and gives cover to Buchananites, who insist that government should spare domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. Tow the ten-year extension out into the Gulf of Mexico, and open the sea-cocks.

Is the era of strong economic growth over? Washington's latest buzz says so. Downsizing and global competition are not transitory phenomena. Neither is an aging population, and no one saves any more. History and circumstance, say the new pessimists, make the rising economic tide of the 1950s and 1960s unattainable in the 1990s. ``It might be good for our politics if some candidate acknowledged this,'' says Bill Kristol. Good for politics, maybe, but bad for economics. We refer the depressed reader to Peter Brimelow's ``It's the Taxes, Stupid,'' in the February 12 Forbes. Our economic funk, says Brimelow, is self-inflicted, by a government that extracts too much from its citizens. The evidence? Gerald Scully's econometric study of the entire period since World War II. Economic growth falters, Scully found, when the sum of federal, state, and local taxation exceeds 22.9 per cent of GDP -- a level breached forty years ago. Had taxes remained at that level, today's GDP would be twice as high as it is -- $15 trillion instead of $7.5 trillion. A typical family would have $100,000 more personal wealth. The kicker: Government would raise more revenue at the lower tax rate. And Bill Kristol would be peddling his (uncharacteristic) pessimism at a deep discount.

Just days after breaking ranks with other cigarette makers on a class-action suit aimed at the tobacco industry, the Liggett company agreed to compensate Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and West Virginia for smoking-related Medicaid spending. Other tobacco makers are undoubtedly thinking of following Liggett's example. Listen up, you tobacco executives: Government should reward you, not fine you. Consider the recent National Bureau of Economic Research study by W. Kip Vicusi. The medical costs attributable to smoking come to 55 cents per pack, according to Vicusi. But smokers defray most of that with the 53-cent-per-pack cigarette tax already in place. Extra sick-leave costs are negligible -- under 1 cent per pack -- while health-insurance premiums rise 14 cents for every pack smoked. Smoking-related fires add less than 2 cents per pack in social costs. On the other hand, because smokers die sooner, they spend less time in nursing homes, saving 23 cents per pack. They collect less in Social Security and private pensions, saving $1.19 a pack. On the other hand, smokers' premature deaths deprive the rest of us of taxes they would have paid had they lived out their full span -- about 40 cents per pack, in Vicusi's calculation. Net net, every pack consumed saves society 83 cents. That comes to $20 billion a year. So stay the course. And thank you for smoking.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>
IFTY years ago, on April 18, 1946, Jackie Robinson broke organized baseball's color barrier with a characteristic bang, homering and scoring four runs in his historic first game for the Brooklyn Dodgers' top farm team. This anniversary will no doubt unleash a wave of media meditations, since it combines the two national pastimes of the American male intellectual: denouncing racism and waxing nostalgic over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Spike Lee is preparing The Jackie Robinson Saga, and I'm sure Stephen Jay Gould will favor us with his thoughts.
<P>
Yet, beyond the obvious platitudes, baseball's long struggle over race can yield some surprising perspectives on our national predicament. The Robinson epic is generally lumped in with the 1954 Brown decision against segregated public schools and the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawing job discrimination. Yet two crucial differences stand out. 1) The integration of organized baseball preceded the civil-rights revolution, and in reality baseball helped make later reforms politically feasible by giving white Americans black heroes with whom to identify. 2) Government had almost nothing to do with this triumph of the competitive market. Baseball owners finally realized that the more they cared about the color of people's money, the less they could afford to care about the color of their skin.
<P>
It's ironic that the hallowed civil-rights revolution owed so much to something as seemingly trivial as pro sports. Yet, without this business of producing heroes for public consumption, whites might never have cared enough about blacks to be bothered by racial injustice. It's not the most noble trait of human nature, but we tend to be more outraged by minor slights to winners (note the endlessly recounted tales of the indignities Robinson endured) than by mass atrocities against downtrodden losers.
<P>
That competitive markets make irrational bigotry expensive -- not impossible, but costly -- was first formally demonstrated in 1957 by University of Chicago economist Gary Becker (the 1992 Nobel Laureate), and in the four decades since has barely gained a toehold in conventional thinking. Let me be clear: this idea does not pollyannaishly presume that white people (or any other people) are motivated by disinterested good will. It merely assumes that if forced to by competition, people will hire whoever makes them the most money. Don't forget, though, that we humans are always conniving to exempt ourselves from competition. The more we can insulate ourselves from the open market, the more painlessly we can then discriminate for kin and countrymen and against people we don't like. Baseball's often ugly history shows this clearly.
<P>
Back in the 1880s, when the term ``organized baseball'' reflected ambition more than reality, the general anarchy let a few dozen blacks play in integrated leagues. By the turn of the century, however, blacks had been utterly banished. Although liberal demonology would assume that the owners were the villains, the prime agitators for segregation were, as economic theory would predict, the white ballplayers. Cap Anson was the best known of the many white athletes who threatened strikes or violence against black rivals. The banning of blacks came up for a vote only once, in 1887 in the International League. Following many nasty anti-black demonstrations by white players, the owners of the six all-white teams outvoted the owners of the four mixed teams. Elsewhere, blacks were driven out by ``gentlemen's agreements.''
<P>
Why did all the owners, although often after some resistance, ultimately give in to rabble-rousing white players? Easing the slide into segregation was organized baseball's curious status as a sort of Portuguese man-of-war of economic entities -- in some ways an industry of independent competitors, in others a single enterprise. Baseball teams must agree upon how they will compete, and, while they're at it, it's always tempting to agree upon how they won't compete. Congress ratified organized baseball's collusive tendency in 1920 by exempting it from the Sherman Antitrust Act.
<P>
The team owners' ill-named ``gentlemen's agreement'' to discriminate against blacks closely resembles today's unspoken understanding among the presidents of another government-sanctioned cartel, our elite colleges, that they will all discriminate against whites and Asians. Both clubowners and college presidents chose to head off ugly incidents by pre-emptively caving in to racial activists. They then browbeat all their peers into closing ranks, lest a lone dissident spotlight their spinelessness.
<P>
When all teams colluded against blacks, each team could assure itself that it was no worse off competitively than if all hired blacks. Cartels often collapse quickly because of cheating, but it was easier to enforce a national ban on black ballplayers than on, say, black factory workers. A ballclub couldn't hide its black workers away inside the mill, but would have had to flaunt them on the road before hostile, even murderous crowds.
JACKIE ROBINSON'S vast (and deserved) fame tends to make us assume that blacks and whites never played together before April 1946. In truth, as the supply of black baseball talent exploded after World War I, the demand for it could not be contained either. There were of course the Negro Leagues. By the 1940s they were booming, and their All Star game frequently outdrew the white version. More forgotten are the many venues outside the South where blacks and whites increasingly played together. 1) Collegiate athletics had been haphazardly integrated for decades. At UCLA, for example, Robinson starred in baseball, football, basketball, track, tennis, golf, and swimming. 2) The California winter baseball league was integrated, though not its individual teams. 3) In the Caribbean winter leagues, race meant even less. Many teams had black and white American stars playing in the same lineups, with few problems. 4) In the mid Forties, a Mexican mogul raided both the Negro and the Major Leagues to stock his summer Mexican League's integrated teams. (Among 18 big-leaguers heading south after the 1945 season was Dodger catcher Mickey Owen. Whether this increased competition for whites encouraged the Dodgers' owner, Branch Rickey, to plunder the Negro Leagues is unknown, but it certainly didn't hurt.) 5) Semipro ball, which was hugely popular before TV, was surprisingly integrated. For instance, in 1935, Bismarck, North Dakota, fielded an awesome team, half white, half black, lead by the fabled pitcher Satchel Paige. Soon, practically every town in the Dakotas boasted ``semipros'' lured from the Negro Leagues. 6) Barnstorming was the chaotic epitome of Disorganized Baseball, requiring only two teams willing to play and a crowd willing to pay. In many Midwestern villages, the annual athletic highlight was the arrival of a Negro Leagues squad to play the local semipros. 7) Each October the black Satchel Paige All Stars and the white Dizzy Dean All Stars barnstormed the nation together. (Predictably, the blacks won a sizable majority of these games.) During World War II, Paige could claim to be the highest-paid player in all of baseball.
<P>
In the liberal world-view, discrimination stems from prejudice, from ignorance of the actual talents of blacks. In organized baseball, the opposite was true. White Major Leaguers freely admitted that many blacks could have taken white players' jobs. Yet, somehow, this enlightened perception failed to make the white pros into ardent integrationists. Meanwhile, a number of owners and managers tried to cheat on their gentlemen's agreement. For example, many historians claim that the Washington Senators quietly broke the color barrier in the late 1930s by playing Cubans dark enough to have been banned as Negroes if they had spoken English.
<P>
There was strikingly little correlation between the rectitude of the man and his urge to integrate baseball. For example, among managers the most creative was the choleric John J. McGraw, a ferocious scrapper who won ten pennants. In 1901 he almost succeeded in smuggling a light-skinned black second baseman onto his team as a full-blooded Cherokee named ``Chief Tokohama.'' During World War II huckster Bill Veeck tried to buy the dreadful Philadelphia Phillies and stock them with Negro Leagues stars. Like all direct challenges, though, this was rebuffed by the autocratic Commissioner of Baseball, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. After the Chicago Black Sox threw the 1919 World Series, the owners had restored faith in the game by appointing Landis, who was famed for his strict moral standards -- one of which was Segregation Forever. After the good Judge went to his reward in late 1944, the owners, hoping to lighten up, picked as Commissioner the Southern politician A. B. ``Happy'' Chandler. When Happy surprisingly indicated that he wouldn't veto black players, Branch Rickey set his plans in motion.
<P>
``Mahatma'' Rickey was as renowned as Landis for his righteousness (as Rickey tirelessly reminded his players while chiseling down their salaries). No one should look down upon Rickey, however; pursue his self-interest he certainly did, but with infinitely more intelligence and courage than his rival owners. (Today's elite colleges, for example, have yet to produce their own Branch Rickey, a school president brave enough to dump affirmative action.) Rickey chose Robinson because they had so much in common: both were Methodists who didn't smoke, drink, or chase women, and both were smart enough to know the historic importance of their undertaking. Most importantly, both were too competitive to back down.
<P>
Further undermining the naive presumption that breaking the color line was an act of progressive piety was the key role played by Rickey's favorite field manager, the little ferret Leo Durocher. Bonding the Mahatma and Leo the Lip was a shared passion for victory and money. During spring training in 1947, Rickey scheduled a series between the Dodgers and Robinson's minor-league team. He hoped that when the Dodger players saw Robinson's talents, they would demand his promotion. Instead, fearing for their jobs or those of their friends, they said nothing. But when some Dodgers from Dixie actively protested against Robinson, Durocher deflated their mutiny: ``I don't care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a f --  --  --  zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you can't use the money, I'll see that you are all traded.''
<P>
WHAT lessons can we learn from this tangled tale? A few simple ones seem to leap out. The more greed and lust for victory, the less discrimination. The more competition between teams and businesses, the more cooperation between the races. In contrast, the more collusion, centralization, community standards, and concern for the feelings of people you know, the more bias. If we now look at the remarkable impact that the first few dozen blacks had on Major League baseball, we can confirm the Chicago School's theory that competition tends to make irrational discrimination self-defeatingly expensive.
The 1946 World Series looked as if it would be only the first of many between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals. Led by Ted Williams, the greatest hitter since Babe Ruth, the 1946 Red Sox had won an exceptional 104 games, losing only 50. The Cardinals, meanwhile, had averaged 104 wins per season during the four seasons that the young Stan Musial had anchored their lineup. Both leftfielders would long remain superlative hitters. As late as 1957 Musial led the National League (NL) with a batting average of .351, while Williams topped even that with .388, the highest average between the Roosevelt and Carter Administrations. Yet neither man ever returned to the World Series. Why not?
<P>
Largely because of St. Louis's and Boston's boneheaded bigotry. With Robinson apprenticing in the minors throughout the 1946 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers finished two games behind the Cards. In 1947, Rookie of the Year Robinson made the difference, as the Dodgers edged the Cards for the pennant. Jackie instantly became the league's biggest draw, with the Dodgers setting NL records for both home and away attendance. During each pre-season alone, Robinson earned his annual salary from the huge Southern crowds, black and white, that turned out to cheer and boo him at Dodger exhibitions. (By barnstorming through Dixie, Rickey was exposing Robinson to a real threat of assassination, as well as the insults of Jim Crow, but, hey, the money was too good to pass up.)
<P>
Rickey followed up his masterstroke by signing more Negro Leagues stars like Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe. During Robinson's ten-year tenure, Brooklyn's dividends for desegregating first were six NL titles, fueled by black Dodgers' winning five Most Valuable Player awards and four Rookie of the Year awards.
<P>
In contrast, St. Louis frittered away the heart of Musial's stupendous career by not obtaining a black regular until Curt Flood in 1958. The Cards paid a brutal price for discriminating. During the first four years they had Stan the Man (up through 1946), the Cards won almost 18 more games per year than the Dodgers. But during the Robinson era, the Cards fell to nearly 13 victories per year fewer than the Dodgers, a monumental swing of over 30 wins per 154-game season. The Cardinals stubbornly ignored blacks until Augie Busch bought the team in 1954. Fearing a black boycott of Budweiser, he immediately ordered his scouts to find black players, but by then the easy pickings were gone. Although too late for Musial, Busch's integration move finally paid off in the 1960s, as blacks like Flood, Lou Brock, and Bob Gibson became the core of great Cardinal teams.
As could be expected, the National League, which had been sorely trailing the American League (AL) in superstars since the days of Ty Cobb, more aggressively pursued black talent. By the mid Fifties all NL teams except the Cardinals and the hapless Phillies featured at least one black headed for the Hall of Fame. Between 1949 and 1962, blacks won 11 of the 14 NL MVP awards, while no black was the AL MVP until Yankee catcher Elston Howard in 1963. And the AL lacked an African-American superstar until Frank Robinson arrived via a 1966 trade and promptly showed the league what it had been missing by capturing the rare Triple Crown for batting.
<P>
Integration electrified the NL's style of play, as blacks showed that sluggers didn't have to be sloggers -- e.g., Willie Mays led the league four times in home runs and four times in stolen bases. The balance of power shifted away from the slow, complacent American League. The AL had won 12 of the 16 All Star games played in the Thirties and Forties, but could capture only 5 of the 24 held in the Fifties and Sixties. 
<P>
Where competition is not particularly intense, however, discrimination can linger. In the AL, the New York Yankees ruled, winning 29 of 44 pennants from 1921 to 1964. Not surprisingly, the Yankees saw little need to rush into integrating, especially after they signed Mickey Mantle, a white man even faster and stronger than the NL's black stars. With most of the AL not expecting to dethrone the Yankees (indeed, some forlorn AL franchises subsisted by routinely selling their top prospects to the Yankees), most other AL teams also lagged at integrating. 
<P>
The main exception was the Cleveland Indians. Under master promoter Bill Veeck, in 1948 the Tribe suddenly overtook the Red Sox as the Yankees' chief challenger. The Indians edged out the Red Sox for the pennant that year by a single game, a difference more than accounted for by their two blacks, outfielder Larry Doby and a 42-year-old rookie phenom named Paige. As the AL's most integrated team, from 1948 to 1956 the Tribe would average 94 wins, peaking with a 111 - 43 record in 1954, the best anywhere since 1906. In comparison, under the ownership of beloved philanthropist Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox would fade into mediocrity, wasting Williams's bat as they refused to play a black man until 1959. Still, to be fair, the Red Sox did take only seven more years to hire a black than the Braves -- the Osaka Braves, that is.
<P>
WHILE the complete integration of baseball through competition took longer than we would have liked, it's worth contrasting baseball's record to the civil-rights milestones dependent upon the Federal Government. For example, the vaunted 1954 Brown decision remained mostly a symbol until the Nixon Administration began broadly enforcing it 15 years later. Likewise, although the decline in job discrimination in the South in the 1960s is often attributed to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, little of the now vast array of bureaucratic and legal machinery for enforcing that law existed before the end of that decade. Far more beneficial during the 1960s than pestering private companies was federal intervention freeing up the Southern economy by cracking down on state-authorized discrimination, whether imposed by legislatures or by mobs winked at by local authorities. These gains became permanent under the most wholly successful civil-rights law, the 1965 Voting Rights Act. By finally establishing a competitive market for political power, this law rapidly made hatemongering unprofitable for Southern office-seekers. 
<P>
Today, conservatives tend to lionize the 1964 Civil Rights Act for embodying color-blindness. In denouncing quotas while supporting anti-discrimination laws, however, the Right shows a surprising faith in the ability of government bureaucrats and judges to decide case by case which private hiring decisions were tainted by bias. In reality, close study of possible instances of discrimination shows why the sainted 1964 act made quotas inevitable. Frequently, no outsider, and sometimes not even those involved, can know which of the many possible reasons for an employment decision was actually conclusive.
For example, the Yankees first employed black minor-leaguers in 1949 but didn't promote any to the big club until 1955. Was this long delay caused by discrimination? If you assume that any team in the early 1950s that didn't have a few blacks must have been discriminating, it appears obvious that the Yankees were guilty. But if you reject this kind of statistical or quota-based reasoning, how do you find the smoking gun? Did the Yankees trade away their top prospect, the black Puerto Rican Vic Power, for his uppitiness (when a Southern waitress once told him, ``I'm sorry, but we don't serve Negroes here,'' he blithely replied, ``That's OK, I don't eat them'')? Or were they sincere in claiming they'd lost faith in his potential? Or both? Presumably bias played a role, since Power turned out to be a good (though not great) Major Leaguer. But who can say for sure? Ballclubs constantly make honest mistakes about minor-leaguers (in the same period, the integrated Dodgers discarded another young black Puerto Rican, the great Roberto Clemente). Did the Yankees then force their other most promising black minor-leaguer, outfielder Elston Howard, to convert to catcher in order to delay his rise to the big leagues? Possibly, but this time the Yankees proved right, as Howard became an MVP behind the plate.
<P>
This ambiguity inherent in so many hiring decisions explains why aggressive anti-discrimination laws always end up impelling employers toward quotas. Unfortunately, racial quotas have numerous side effects. While the overall impact of reverse discrimination remains harshly controversial, we can safely say that year by year quotas' benefits to blacks diminish while quotas' costs to blacks rise. Since strong anti-bias laws make quotas inevitable and quotas are inexorably becoming a net harm to blacks, then logic would imply that we must eventually repeal enforcement of the Civil Rights Act's prohibitions against discrimination by competitive employers. 
<P>
How, then would we fight racism in hiring? I suggest: in roughly the same way as we now deter its cousin, nepotism. In noncompetitive organizations like government agencies, laws often ban nepotistic hiring. On the other hand, the government allows the market to police competitive firms. If a CEO promotes Junior and he turns out to be inept, well, the firm pays the price in lost profits.
<P>
Our country is probably several years away from even beginning to grasp this logic, but in the long run it may prove compelling. Conservatives, however, can't seize the rational high ground until they stop leaping to defend institutions they, especially, should be wary of -- e.g., unions, regulated monopolies, and government agencies -- against the threat of racial quotas. True, competition does restrain irrational discrimination. But where competition is lacking -- such as in government monopolies like police and fire departments, or in labor unions, which exist to negate competition -- then quotas can sometimes be necessary to put a price on discrimination.

NEW YORK, MARCH 12
<P>
Impatient right-minded reformers are whispering to themselves that the Gingrich GOP has run out of steam, and they are quite right about that. The big parade is stalled out there as people leave to look in on the primaries. Last week's action/inaction on regulatory reform was an attempt at a quick revival, but it didn't work. 
<P>
The idea was based on something that didn't happen about twenty years ago. The idea of it is ``sunset legislation.'' An example of the kind of thing Mr. Gingrich has had in mind inflames the memory. 
<P>
The story goes back to the early Fifties, when former President Herbert Hoover was asked by President Truman to recommend reforms that would retire useless government ventures. The Hoover Commission went to work and made a number of recommendations, but one of them sticks in the mind. During the Civil War, the British Navy quarantine threatened the import of hemp needed by the Union Army. So . . . something like a synthetic fiber was developed to make certain that the army should not run out. 
<P>
The Civil War ended in 1864. In 1951, Mr. Hoover's scouts discovered that the hemp factory was still operating in a little town in Massachusetts, never mind that hemp had been available on open markets for nearly ninety years. It employed about ninety hemp workers, and Mr. Hoover marked it down for execution. But Senator John F. Kennedy interceded: He did not wish any Massachusetts enterprise to be hurt. Mr. Hoover sent an emissary to Kennedy: How about agreeing that anyone who retired from work in the Civil War Massachusetts Emergency Hemp Factory should not be replaced? That way, the factory would die of old age in a little while. The answer from JFK: No. For all we know, they are still making hemp in Massachusetts, with a government subsidy, at twice the cost of the other stuff. 
<P>
About twenty years ago, the idea of sunset legislation had a very strong run. Its primary enthusiast was Senator Charles Percy, a Republican from Illinois. The idea was that every ten years, a given regulatory agency would report to Congress on what it was doing and how much it was spending. The Executive would then recommend changes in that agency's activity. Congress would ponder those recommended changes, and adopt them or not. If they were not adopted, the agency would -- expire, at the end of that congressional session. Assuming that every agency of government were reviewed and disapproved, in ten years there would be none left; no, not even the agency that had kept alive the hemp makers in Massachusetts. 
<P>
A version of that was sought by the Gingrich Contract, which borrowed the old sunset idea about existing regulations but put it on a seven-year cycle. A year ago, the House leadership sought a moratorium on new federal rules along with a demand that proposed new rules give an accounting estimate of how much they would cost, and how much they should effect. 
<P>
This year, under the kind of inertial pressure that the Clinton White House has become so effective in generating, the leadership retreated from the robust bill that would have included all regulatory agencies to something more modest, more tentative. Wearily, that was sent back to the drawing board, where a paler version is asked for. 
<P>
Mr. Gingrich's offensive is the great casualty of the Republican primary campaign, which has had a dissolute effect on Republican purpose. The call for a flat tax is bracing and interesting in itself. The call for protective tariffs, for some sort of intervention to guard against corporate downsizing -- all these have had the effect of diverting attention from a job that might well have been done without the primaries to absorb public interest and energy. 
<P>
It will all be fine for the GOP if the downsizing of the Contract with America has merely meant that the gestation of an effective political program is taking longer than envisioned. Reformers will not complain if, a year from now, President Dole signs one after another of the bills sent to him by a Republican Congress. Yes, if you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread. 
<P>
The Republicans have a great deal to do to re-energize a Congress that so inspirited the country as recently as 14 months ago. A good beginning would be for Messrs. Buchanan and Forbes to call it a day.

<LI>Free-market fanatics, which emphatically includes us, are disturbed by Patrick J. Buchanan's heretical revival of the American tradition of tariffs. Of course, we have to admit that tariffs are just another form of tax. Arguably, they would result in no more misallocation than the enormous onslaught of taxation that has taken federal revenues from below 5 per cent of GDP under Calvin Coolidge to almost 20 per cent under Bill Clinton, without too much libertarian uproar. But meanwhile we have another question: Why has no one -- for example, his fans at the Cato Institute -- noticed that Steve Forbes is committing an even greater heresy against free-market writ? He is reviving another American policy tradition, that of the currency crank. He wants to abandon floating exchange rates (the prescription and lifetime achievement of Milton Friedman), fix the U.S. dollar against gold at a high rate, and resist any and all pressures to let the dollar depreciate (``trashing the dollar,'' in Forbes-speak). This, of course, would mean periodically closing down the economy to reduce imports and generate a dollar-bolstering current account-surplus -- the celebrated ``stop - go'' effect that crippled Britain in the 1960s. That's apparently OK with Mr. Forbes, who seems to view a ``strong dollar'' as an end in itself. But his ``strong dollar'' would also make American products more expensive in foreign markets -- and foreign products cheaper in American markets. Amazingly, Steve Forbes intends to subsidize imports and tax exports -- across the board. He's a protectionist too -- an inverted protectionist. Ed Crane, call your office.

<LI>ANNALS OF EXTREMISM. ``By forcefully raising the issue of economic vulnerability, Buchanan pushes the whole debate to the left. A month ago, the issues were budget balance and the flat tax. Today they are corporate greed and working-class wages. Thank you, Pat. . . . Now that Pat Buchanan has demonstrated that economic fears equal political pay dirt, we can expect Democrats . . . to begin speaking with a bolder voice. It's about time.'' -- Robert Kuttner, Boston Globe. Looks like ``flirting with socialism'' to us.

When I asked what was the connection between maneuvering in the woods out of fear that the government might go tyrannically haywire and campaigning for a lifelong Pentagon/Beltway insider, Ditzhazy praised Powell's 'integrity and moral courage' . . .'' -- Richard Brookhiser, in a piece on the Powell book tour in Forbes FYI.

Anyone who thinks that the Democrats are really reconciled to the end of the era of big government should look at congressional Democratic proposals to address worker anxiety. Much of their agenda, outlined by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, is standard Democratic fare: ``fair trade,'' more spending on education and training programs, health-insurance regulation, pressure on the Fed to ease up on inflation. But the centerpiece of Gephardt's proposal -- and of legislation sponsored by Sens. Daschle and Bingaman -- is financial incentives (tax breaks, government contracts, pension-fund investments) for ``corporate citizenship.'' Essentially, the Federal Government will bribe companies to operate little welfare states for their employees. Companies will be rewarded for not laying people off, for offering generous non-wage benefits, and for unionizing. This bold new idea is in fact corporatist socialism, a very old idea with roots in medieval guilds. Democrats offer these regressive proposals because their analyses of the economy's problems focus on huge bureaucratic corporations like AT&T. In fact, the health of small businesses and the number of new business start-ups are vastly more important than the health of a few mega-corporations. There is reason for concern about the economy: family incomes and wages have been stagnant in the Nineties, and, as Alan Reynolds points out, the seven ``fat years'' of the Reagan expansion have been followed by seven ``lean years'' under Bush and Clinton. But this anemic growth is largely the result of specific mistakes: e.g., tax and welfare policies that discourage people from seeking work. Americans' economic anxieties can be addressed by reversing those mistakes: by cutting taxes and regulations. House Majority Leader Dick Armey gave a fine speech along these lines the same day Rep. Gephardt spoke. We hope Sen. Dole -- and Mr. Buchanan -- were listening to the right speech.

On February 29, Federal District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer threw out the suit brought by the Federal Election Commission against GOPAC. The FEC admitted that GOPAC gave no money to federal candidates, Newt Gingrich included. Still, it claimed that efforts to organize state and local GOP groups and to shape the national agenda were actually sneaky, unregistered attempts to affect federal elections. According to the FEC, any attempt to affect politics or issues at any level falls under the control of the FEC. Judge Oberdorfer said, No way. The get-Newt crowd spun into overdrive. David Bonior filed another ethics charge against Gingrich rehashing the FEC charge; the still-taxpayer-funded National Public Radio expressed dismay that the judge would let GOPAC beat the rap for ``secretly'' raising millions of dollars to engineer a Republican takeover of Congress.

NATIONAL REVIEW's call to reconsider a failed drug war has not exactly been embraced on the presidential hustings. That is no surprise -- politicians respond only to deep-seated shifts in opinion. But a gradual shift on the drug war continues: Richard E. Neville, a Chicago Criminal Court judge, became the latest law-enforcement figure to say: Enough is enough. High profits bring ``ten replacements'' for every drug offender imprisoned. ``No matter how many we put in jail, that isn't going to stop. . . . It's a revolving door that has continued for thirty years, and will continue until we change the policy.''

In Australia's elections -- a decisive defeat for Labor -- the main campaign issues were youth unemployment and immigrants on welfare. John Howard, the new conservative prime minister, campaigned on dismantling the system of lavish ``retraining'' and high minimum wages, which produces unemployment of 30 per cent among 16-to-21-year-olds. Howard also promised to extend from six months to two years the waiting period for immigrants to be eligible for welfare. But some of the biggest electoral upsets suggested that there's an even tougher-minded brand of conservatism in the outback. Labor's Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, a loud champion of all kinds of superstitious native land claims, lost his seat in a 14 per cent swing. Graeme Campbell, a Labor MP expelled from the party for his attacks on multiculturalism, won re-election as an independent. And in the fastest-growing state, Queensland, another rebel won -- conservative Pauline Hanson, who stirred up the media by saying that campaigners for aboriginal land rights were ``only interested in money.'' Disowned by the frightened establishment, including Howard, as a ``racist,'' she lost her party support but won her race handsomely, also running as an independent. The Australian electorate wanted straight talk on taboo issues, and the more politically incorrect the better. Sound familiar?

Minister Louis Farrakhan made a One Man March through Africa and the Middle East, strewing bouquets everywhere he went. In Iran, he addressed crowds that were chanting, ``Death to America''; in Libya, he was promised a billion-dollar (sic) loan from Col. Qaddafi; in Iraq, he called UN sanctions ``mass murder'' and a ``crime against humanity''; in Nigeria, he compared Gen. Sani Abacha, the local tyrant, to Moses. He also visited the Sudan, where (black) slaves can be had for $15. Teach, brother! All of which led Eric Breindel of the New York Post to an interesting point. Pat Buchanan is supported by Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, who has shared podiums with racist kooks. Bill Clinton is supported by former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who, as head of the Congressional Black Caucus, made a ``sacred covenant'' with Louis Farrakhan. Pratt, called on his behavior, denounced kookery. Mfume, not called on anything, maintains a profound silence. Pratt and Buchanan are Bad Men. Mfume and Clinton are -- what?

Before 1970, one member of a divorcing couple had to be shown to be at fault. After 1970, states began allowing divorce merely on the grounds of ``irreconcilable differences.'' Divorce rates shot up, and there arose the phenomenon of impoverished, mostly middle-aged women whose husbands had abandoned them for fresher prospects. In California, divorced women on average suffer a 73 per cent decline in standard of living. Their former husbands suffer more subtle woes. Lately, state legislators in Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Idaho, Pennsylvania, and Georgia have been talking about reinstating the older criteria for granting divorces. But the lawmakers face an uphill battle. As Janet Daley has pointed out in the London Daily Telegraph, no-fault divorce arises from a common intellectual assumption: that social institutions should be judged according to whether they retard or advance ``personal liberation.'' By this standard, marriage becomes just a love affair which, when it ceases to satisfy one partner, may be dissolved. If it is to be at all meaningful, says Miss Daley, marriage must be more than that: ``a public act of commitment [to] the wider community: the extended family, future offspring, perhaps the Church, and society at large.'' What is needed is not just a legal counterrevolution but a philosophical one.

Americans are conducting the sixth presidential election campaign since the Supreme Court decreed a virtually unlimited ``right'' to abortion in Roe v. Wade and its companion case, Doe v. Bolton. Over the past 23 years, the abortion debate has been about abortion, of course; but it has also been a debate about the kind of society America is and seeks to be. Throughout our national history, few issues have so sharply focused attention on the fundamental purposes of the American democratic experiment. For, in the abortion debate, we are required to confront an urgent moral issue: Who is to be included in the community of the commonly protected?<BR>
The following statement of principle, endorsed by a broad spectrum of pro-life organizational leaders and scholars, is the result of consultations held over the past several months at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. The statement aims to clarify the principles on which the pro-life movement stands, to articulate a pro-life vision of the American future, and to suggest a set of political, legal, and cultural strategies that are capable of translating that vision into reality. The signatories, who join the statement as individuals, offer this statement to the public in the hope that it will raise the level of public discourse on this highly controversial issue, and thus strengthen American democracy. The signatories are deeply grateful to NATIONAL REVIEW for opening its pages to their ideas and concerns.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>WENTY-THREE years after the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions, the conscience of the American people remains deeply troubled by the practice of abortion on demand. Because of these two decisions, abortion is legal at any time of pregnancy, for virtually any reason, in every state. This constitutes an almost completely unrestricted private license to judge who will live and who will die.
<P>
That America has the most permissive abortion regime among the world's democracies is a betrayal of the American promise of justice for all. That is why a new sense of moral concern is stirring throughout our country in this election year. That is why millions of Americans have refused to accept the Court's 1992 admonition in Planned Parenthood v. Casey to stop debating the issue.
<P>
2. To those weary of this argument, it may seem that there is nothing more to be said on the matter of abortion. We disagree.
<P>
Survey research tells us that the American people do not want a legal regime of abortion on demand for any reason, at any time during a pregnancy. We believe we have an obligation to employ the arts of democratic persuasion to help reinstitute legal protection for all unborn children.
<P>
The extent of the abortion license and its reach into other areas of law and public policy is widely underestimated. We believe that, as citizens of the United States, we have the responsibility to discuss with our fellow citizens the facts of the abortion license and its impact on our common life.
<P>
Many women in crisis earnestly seek alternatives to abortion. We believe we ought to encourage those alternatives and help to provide them.
<P>
3. Pro-life service to women in crisis and pro-life advocacy on behalf of legal reform are expressions of our highest ideals as citizens of the United States. We affirm the nobility of the American democratic experiment in ordered liberty. We affirm the rule of law and the principle of equal protection under the law, even as we work to reform constitutional and statutory law so that the American legal system is, once again, congruent with the Founders' claim that the inalienable right to life is one of the great moral truths on which American democracy rests. We want an America that is open, hospitable, and caring -- a community of civic friendship in which neighbors reach out to assist neighbors in distress.
<P>
4. The abortion license has helped to erode the moral foundations of the American civic community. Right now we are not the country we ought to be. That is why our national conscience is troubled. That distress is, to us, a sign of moral vitality. We speak now because we seek to defend the America we love. We speak to promote the cause of an America in which women and men, together, rebuild the fabric of civil society by acknowledging our common responsibility to serve and protect the weakest and most vulnerable among us. We speak for a rebirth of freedom in these United States: a freedom that finds its fulfillment in goodness.
<P>
<H3>Victims of the License</H3>
<P>
5. Americans of every race, economic condition, religion, and political persuasion share a common concern today for what some have called a national ``virtue deficit.'' As a country, we have not paid sufficient attention to nurturing those habits of heart and mind that make democratic self-governance possible and that undergird what the Framers of the Constitution called ``civic virtue.'' We believe that the abortion license is a critical factor in America's virtue deficit.
<P>
6. Abortion kills 1.5 million innocent human beings in America every year. There is no longer any serious scientific dispute that the unborn child is a human creature who dies violently in the act of abortion. This brute fact is the root of our national distress over the abortion license. Abortion kills: few would now deny that. But in order to defend the private ``right'' to lethal violence that is the essence of abortion, proponents of the license frequently resort to euphemisms like ``products of conception'' and ``the termination of pregnancy.''
<P>
The public dialogue is not coarsened by depictions of the reality of abortion. But a coarsening of our common life has taken place; it is evident in the lack of moral revulsion that follows one newspaper's accurate description of an abortion procedure that ``breaks . . . apart'' the ``fetus'' before ``it'' is ``suctioned out of the uterus'' or ``extracted.'' 
<P>
7. The abortion license hurts women. Some (including the narrow Supreme Court majority in the 1992 Casey decision) contend that the license is necessary to ensure social and economic gains for women. It is ever more clear, though, that women pay a huge price for abortion. By providing an alleged technological ``fix'' for unintended pregnancy, the license has encouraged widespread male irresponsibility and predatory male sexual behavior. Abortion-on-demand has given an excuse to a man who shirks his responsibilities, claiming that the child he helped to conceive ought to have been aborted, or that the woman who declined to abort may not impose on him any responsibility for her ``lifestyle choice.''
<P>
Fathers have also been harmed and dehumanized by the abortion license. Some watch their children killed against their will; others learn to their distress only much later that a child they would have raised is dead. Even when agreeing to support the abortion decision, fathers, like mothers, suppress their grief, deny their protective instincts, and otherwise damage themselves when they allow the killing of their own children. Abortion contributes to the marginalization of fatherhood in America, which many agree is a primary cause of the alarming breakdown of American family life. 
<P>
The license has thus poisoned relationships between women and men, even as it has done serious harm to the thousands of women who now suffer from the effects of post-abortion grief. The women of America do not need abortion to be full participants in our society. To suggest otherwise is to demean women, to further distort relationships between women and men, and to aggravate the difficulties of re-creating in America a community of virtue and mutual responsibility.
<P>
<H3>The Public Dimension</H3>
<P>
8. Abortion is not simply a matter of private ``choice.'' Rather, the abortion license cuts to the heart of America's claim to being a law-governed democracy, in which equality before the law is a fundamental principle of justice.  The abortion license also threatens the cultural foundations of our democratic political community. For if it becomes a settled matter in American law and in American public morality that there is, in fact, a private ``right'' to use lethal violence to ``solve'' personal, family, or social problems, then the claim of American democracy to be an expression of the people's commitment to ``establish justice'' will be undermined, just as it was when the law claimed the ``right'' to exclude certain Americans from its full protection on the basis of race. Thus the abortion issue is the crucial civil-rights issue of our time.
<P>
9. A sweeping abortion license was defined unilaterally by the Supreme Court without recourse to the normal procedures of democratic debate and legislation. This in itself wounded American democracy. And the Court's persistent refusal to permit the American people to debate the basic issue of an alleged ``right to abortion'' in their legislatures continues to damage our democracy by alienating tens of millions of Americans from their institutions of government.
<P>
10. The Court's definition of a ``right to abortion'' -- first enunciated as a ``privacy right,'' then as a ``liberty right'' under the Fourteenth Amendment -- has had other damaging effects. The language of ``rights'' puts the dilemma of unwanted pregnancy into a legal-adversarial context, pitting mother against child, and even father against mother. But as the common experience of humanity -- and, increasingly, the findings of science -- demonstrates, what hurts one party in this most intimate of human relationships hurts both parties. The America we seek is an America in which both mother and child are the subjects of our concern and our community's protection. To abuse the language of ``rights'' in this matter further advances the demeaning practice of reducing all human relationships in America to matters of adversarial adjudication. This is a prescription for democratic decay. For democracy rests on the foundations of civil society, and in a truly civil society, relationships between people have a far richer moral texture than that suggested by adversarial procedure.
<P>
11. The Court's vain attempt to justify the abortion license in terms of an all-encompassing right of personal autonomy has begun to infect other areas of the law. Thus the ``autonomy'' logic of the Court's 1992 Casey decision is now invoked as a warrant for a constitutional ``right'' to euthanasia. And if it were followed to its conclusion, this logic would require us to consider such profound human relationships as the bond between husband and wife, or the bond between parents and children, to be nothing more than matters of contract, with the claims of the autonomous individual trumping all other claims. Enshrined by the Court to legalize abortion on demand, this autonomy logic threatens to give us an America in which the only actors of consequence are the individual and the state; no other community, including the community of husband and wife, or the community of parents and children, will have effective constitutional standing.
<P>
12. The Supreme Court's insistence on a ``right'' to abortion has had other disturbing effects on our public life. This ``right'' has been used to justify the abridgment of First Amendment free-speech rights, as when sidewalk counselors are threatened with legal penalties for proposing protection and care to women in crisis at the crucial moment of decision outside an abortion clinic. This ``right'' has been used by the Federal Government to coerce state governments into providing abortions, even when state legislatures or popular referenda have clearly registered the people's unwillingness to use public funds for elective abortions. The abortion ``right'' has distorted our national health-care debate, as well as the debate over welfare reform. It has even had an impact on U.S. foreign policy. American attempts to impose the ``right'' on the rest of the world at the 1994 Cairo world conference on population and the 1995 Beijing world conference on women have been deeply resented by other countries, as have U.S. attempts to promote abortion overseas through foreign aid.
<P>
13. The Court's attempt to define a ``right'' to abortion has polarized institutions and professions that were once among the bulwarks of American civil society. Professional associations of lawyers, academics, teachers, and civil servants have been divided by attempts to enlist their resources and prestige in support of abortion on demand, and in opposition to any effort to regulate abortion even in ways held constitutional by the Supreme Court. The medical profession has been deeply divided over its relationship to the abortion license. That the practice of abortion on demand is now widely recognized within the medical community as contradictory to the most deeply held values of the profession of healing is, we believe, a sign of hope. Yet some medical groups now threaten to reverse this trend by coercion -- for example, by requiring medical residency programs to teach and perform abortion techniques. There are also disturbing signs of the corrupting influence of the abortion license in other professions. History has been rewritten to provide specious justification for Roe v. Wade. The teaching of law has been similarly distorted, as have political theory and political science. Such extremism underlines the unavoidably public character of the abortion license. The abortion license has a perverse Midas quality -- it corrupts whatever it touches.
<P>
<H3>The Way Ahead</H3>
<P>
14. Our goal is simply stated: we seek an America in which every unborn child is protected in law and welcomed in life. Legal reform and cultural renewal must both take place if America is to experience a new birth of the freedom that is ordered to goodness. We have just described, in this statement, the nature, sources, and dimension of our concern. Now, as pro-life leaders and scholars, we want to propose a program of action which we believe will appeal to Americans with open minds and hearts on this issue.
<P>
15. Means are always available to enable women to overcome the burdens that can accompany pregnancy and child-rearing. There are always alternatives to abortion. The legacy of Roe v. Wade involves a massive denial of this truth and a deformation of social attitudes and practices so pervasive that women are actually encouraged to have abortions as the ``easier'' road to the goals that an unexpected pregnancy appears to threaten. As individuals and as a society, we bear a common responsibility to make sure that all women know that their own physical and spiritual resources, joined to those of a society that truly affirms and welcomes life, are sufficient to overcome whatever obstacles pregnancy and child-rearing may appear to present. Women instinctively know, and we should never deny, that this path will involve sacrifice. But this sacrifice must no longer remain a one-way street. In particular, men must also assume their proper share of the responsibilities that family life -- indeed, civilization itself -- requires.
<P>
16. The pro-life movement must redouble its efforts to provide alternatives to abortion for women in crisis. There are now over 3,000 pregnancy-care centers in the United States, providing medical, educational, financial, and spiritual assistance to women who, facing the dilemma of a crisis pregnancy, bravely choose to carry their unborn children to term. We support an expansion of this service to our neighbors, so that by the turn of the century what we believe to be true today has become unmistakably clear to every American woman: No one in the United States has to have an abortion.
<P>
17. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that adoption is preferable to abortion. We must streamline and simplify the legal procedures involved in adoption, while providing effective support to those married couples who choose to adopt. 
<P>
18. The abortion license is inextricably bound up with the mores of the sexual revolution. Promotion of the pro-life cause also requires us to support and work with those who are seeking to re-establish the moral linkage between sexual expression and marriage, and between marriage and procreation. We believe that a renewal of American democracy as a virtuous society requires us to honor and promote an ethic of self-command and mutual responsibility, and to resist the siren song of the false ethic of unbridled self-expression. 
<P>
19. Service to women in crisis, the promotion of adoption, and the restoration of sound sexual morality are essential if we are to experience a national cultural renewal that will help to sustain legal reform of the abortion license. The way in which we pursue the latter is also crucial, both to cultural renewal and legal reform.
<P>
We pledge ourselves to exercise the arts of democratic persuasion in advancing our legal agenda. We urge Congress and the courts to reconsider their ill-advised restrictions on the rights of pro-life activists.
<P>
We unequivocally reject the use of violence in the pro-life cause as contrary to the central moral principles of our movement. For more than 23 years, we have worked within the democratic process to advance the protection of all innocent human life, and we will continue to do so. 
<P>
20. The unborn child in America today enjoys less legal protection than an endangered species of bird in a national forest. In this situation, we believe a broad-based legal and political strategy is essential. There are many steps to be taken on the road to an America in which every unborn child is protected in law and welcomed in life. Thus we find no contradiction between a rigorous adherence to our ultimate goal and the pursuit of reforms that advance us toward that goal. Legal reforms that fall short of our goal, but that help move us toward it, save lives and aid in the process of moral and cultural renewal. 
<P>
21. In its 1992 Casey decision, the Supreme Court agreed that the State of Pennsylvania could regulate the abortion industry in a number of ways. These regulations do not afford any direct legal protection to the unborn child. Yet experience has shown that such regulations -- genuine informed consent, waiting periods, parental notification -- reduce abortions in a locality, especially when coupled with positive efforts to promote alternatives to abortion and service to women in crisis. A national effort to enact Pennsylvania-type regulations in all fifty states would be a modest but important step toward the America we seek. 
<P>
22. Congress also has the opportunity to contribute to legal reform of the abortion license. A number of proposals are now being debated in the Congress, including bans on certain methods of abortion and restrictions on federal funding of abortions. We believe that Congress should adopt these measures and that the President should sign them into law. Any criminal sanctions considered in such legislation should fall upon abortionists, not upon women in crisis. We further urge the discussion of means by which Congress could recognize the unborn child as a human person entitled to the protection of the Constitution. 
<P>
23. The right to life of the unborn will not be secured until it is secure under the Constitution of the United States. As it did in Brown v. Board of Education (when it rejected the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine of ``separate but equal'' as an adequate expression of rights secured under the Fourteenth Amendment), the Supreme Court could reject the ``central finding'' of Roe v. Wade, that abortion on demand is required by an unenumerated ``right to privacy'' protected in part by the Fourteenth Amendment. The claim that such a correction of error would damage the Court's authority is belied by the experience of Brown v. Board of Education, and by the fact that the Court has corrected its own erroneous interpretations of the Constitution on scores of other occasions.
<P>
A more enduring means of constitutional reform is a constitutional amendment both reversing the doctrines of Roe v. Wade and Casey, and establishing that the right to life protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments extends to the unborn child. Such an amendment would have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states: a requirement that underlines the importance of establishing a track record of progressive legal change on behalf of the unborn child at the state and local levels.
<P>
Even with a constitutional amendment, every path to the protection and welcome we seek for unborn children requires the re-empowerment of the people of the United States and their elected representatives to debate and resolve the specific statutory enactments that will govern the question of abortion. A constitutional amendment, in other words, is not a self-executing instrument that will end the debate on abortion. It will, rather, correct a gross misinterpretation of the Constitution (as was required to reverse the grievous errors of the Dred Scott decision) and require states to debate and adopt policies that do not violate the unborn child's right to life.
<P>
Such a process does not, we emphasize, amount to the determination of moral truth by majority rule. Rather, it requires conforming fundamental constitutional principle to a fundamental moral truth -- that abortion is the unwarranted taking of an innocent human life. Such a process also respects the role of representative government in fashioning policies that will ultimately secure that principle in practice. The project of constitutional reform on this issue, as on the precedent issues of slavery and segregation, is to bring our legal system into congruence with basic moral truths about the human person.
<P>
<H3>An Appeal to Our Neighbors</H3>
<P>
24. We believe the pro-life cause is an expression of the premise and promise of American democracy. The premise is that we are all created equal; the promise is that there is justice for all. For all the reasons cited above, the abortion license has done grave damage to America: it has killed tens of millions of unborn children, caused untold anguish to their mothers, and marginalized fathers in our society. The renewal of American democracy according to the highest ideals of the Founders requires us to stand for the inalienable right to life of the unborn, to stand with women in crisis, and to stand against the abortion license.
<P>
25. Few Americans celebrate the abortion license today. For many who are troubled by the license and its impact on our society, to be ``reluctantly pro-choice'' is now thought to be the responsible position. We respectfully urge those of our neighbors who hold that position to reconsider. We ask them to ponder the relationship between the abortion license and the crisis of family life in America. We ask them to reconsider whether radical autonomy is a sufficient understanding of freedom. We ask them to reflect, again, on the morality of abortion itself. We ask them to think about the social impact of a legally defined private ``right'' to lethal violence. 
<P>
We ask them to ask themselves: ``Is American society, today, more hospitable, caring, and responsible than it was before Roe v. Wade?'' We believe the answer is ``No.'' Problems that the proponents of abortion claimed the license would help alleviate -- such as childhood poverty, illegitimacy, and child abuse -- have in fact gotten worse, throughout every level of our society, since Roe v. Wade. Thus we respectfully ask our neighbors to consider the possibility of a connection -- cultural as well as legal -- between the virtue deficit in contemporary American life and the abortion license.
<P>
26. The pro-life movement is about affirmation. Thus we ask our neighbors, of whatever political persuasion or current conviction on the matter of abortion, to engage in a great national debate about the America we seek, and the relationship of the abortion license to that future. We ask all Americans to join with us in providing effective, compassionate service to women in crisis. Work on alternatives to abortion and on the reform of adoption laws and procedures can create the conditions for a new dialogue on the future of abortion law and practice in America. We are ready for that new conversation. We invite all our neighbors to join us.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
This is going to be a quick one. Little Al and I are conducting an experiment, and I can't take too much time from it.
<P>
We're watching television. We've been glued to the set since seven o'clock this morning, and we're going to try to watch until dinnertime. 
<P>It was Little Al's idea. ``Dad,'' he said, ``you talk a lot about all the bad stuff that's on TV, but I don't think I've ever seen anything bad on TV.'' 
<P>``You have an excellent point, son,'' I said. I haven't had much time to really sit in front of the set and ``vege'' out, as the kids say. Bill and I have been too busy leading the nation and supervising AmeriCorps. But after the White House Summit of leaders in the television industry, well, I knew I was a little bit behind. In the first place, I'm not really sure who the Friends are -- though I'm pretty sure I don't want Little Al to know either. But the minute it came up in the conference, Bill just lit up: ``Oh yeah -- love that show,'' he said, ``we ought to get Jennifer Aniston involved in this -- we ought to get her to come to the White House.''
<P>``Can do, Mr. President,'' said Bob Wright, the head of NBC. ``We'll get the whole dang cast of Friends and ER right here to salute you in the wisdom you have shown by not auctioning the remaining spectrum.''
<P>``Just Jennifer, okay?''
<P>``As you wish, sir,'' Wright said, ``and insofar as the spectrum auction is concerned -- ''
<P>Just then, Bob Iger, the head of ABC/Cap Cities, hustled over. ``Mr. President,'' he said, ``about this ratings idea -- is there some wiggle room here?'' 
<P>``I'm not sure I understand the question,'' Bill said. 
<P>``Well, now, take a show like NYPD Blue, okay? What I'm saying is, on that show -- which airs pretty darn late, nine or ten o'clock -- sometimes we'll show -- strictly in context, you understand -- how do I put this delicately?'' 
<P>``You show that fat guy's naked hindquarters.''
<P>``Yes, sir. Exactly. Okay, we're all on the same page here.''
<P>``And I think you shouldn't be allowed to show that. If you absolutely must, then you should rate the show 'adults only,' and the V-chip, which I proposed in my State of the Union message -- ''
<P>Iger looked taken aback. ``Gosh, sir,'' he said, ``I was about to ask if we'd be out of line to once in a while show the naked top half of a feisty young policewoman, but if you're dead set against -- ''
<P>``Let me finish,'' Bill said. The ``V-chip, and a set of ratings, should not be imposed without careful consideration.''
<P>``I've got an idea!'' Bob Iger exclaimed. ``What if the ratings were voluntary?'' 
<P>``I love it!'' Bill cried.
<P>Peter Lund, the head of CBS, pushed over. ``And the V-chip could be removable!'' he shouted. 
<P>``Or,'' Bill added thoughtfully, ``it could have an on-off switch hidden somewhere so your wife couldn't tell.'' 
<P>``Better,'' Lund said. 
<P>I was happy that the meetings were going so well. Bill and I are going to need the support of the television industry. They have a sacred duty to use the airwaves responsibly. In a way, they should treat the people's airwaves with the same care that we treat the people's money. I made a mental note to pass this analogy on to Bill for use on the campaign trail. 
<P>``So, what?'' I heard Bill say to Bob Iger as they headed to lunch. ``She'll be, like, in bed or something and then suddenly sit up or roll over?'' 
<P>``Or she could be in the shower, Mr. President, toweling off.''
<P>``Yeah, yeah, I see how that could be contextual.'' 
<P>``Totally. Totally contextual.''
<P>``And you could just kind of reach around and click off that V-chip -- ''
<P>``Just click it off, Mr. President,'' Iger agreed.
<P>``Could you make that V-chip go three ways? You know, on, off, and a setting where . . .''
<P>``Where if she dropped the towel . . . ?''
<P>``Yeah, exactly. Exactly.''
<P>``Mr. President, I see no reason why not. The era of big government is over. Let the era of big entertainment begin.''
<P>So here I am, channel surfing. And let me tell you, there are a lot of programs on in the middle of the day that are totally unfit for children. I caught Little Al watching a program that included the most shockingly explicit sexual descriptions. Granted, it was the opening arguments of the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit on Court TV, but -- in the middle of the day? I made Little Al switch to an old Western. A gunfight is easier to explain.
<P>
Your Pal,  Al

NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 23
<P>

The New Hampshire event throws light primarily on Pat Buchanan even though, at only a point or two ahead of Senator Dole, his victory was nominal. The exhilaration was there, bringing to mind that of Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1968 when even though he did not defeat the sitting President, he came close enough (at 42 per cent) to electrocute Lyndon Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election. What has the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire told his own party?
<P>
This is not instantly clear, because many of his positions are also held by other contestants. Steve Forbes is not the original flat-tax man, but he is the flat tax's primary champion -- Buchanan, with this or the other modification, agrees. On turning functions over to the states and, where possible, to individuals, Buchanan's position is also that of Lamar Alexander. Senator Dole took a strong stand against the degeneracy of Hollywood and so pleased the social conservatives, to whom Mr. Buchanan speaks eloquently. Buchanan is isolated from the others on two matters, one specific, the other general. He would repeal the two treaties that commit us to free trade, NAFTA and GATT. And he would adopt an isolationist foreign policy. The other three would not. 
<P>
And yet when Mr. Buchanan speaks of his candidacy he singles it out as entirely unique, a messianic episode. And there is a sense in which he is correct. These things are not up for arithmetical measurement. Suppose one reasonably predicted that on ten positions involving public issues, Buchanan and Alexander (or Dole) would vote the same way on eight. Does that make them in the long perspective indistinguishable?
<P>
The answer is, No. Because Buchanan is a figure whose persona overwhelms the political grid. In Houston in 1992 he declared that the United States was engaged in a war to the death between two cultures, the traditional and the countercultural. Many thought him correct (I do), but his tone was not that of Abraham Lincoln, but that of John Brown. The afflatus is historically distinguished and honored, and as often as not the prophet is martyred. He is seldom brought on, like Churchill, to act as leader. 
<P>
There is another question, a matter of public and moral psychology. There are those Americans (again, I include myself) who believe that the isolationist temptation, both politically and economically, is a temptation most fiercely to be avoided, since its implications can be lethal. Although I do not believe for one minute that, if he were President, Mr. Buchanan would actually rush to dismantle NATO (any more than I believe that if Dole were President he would immediately balance the budget), the fact is that Buchanan said exactly that. The go-it-alone insularity is reflected in his economic nostrum for demoralized American workingmen: Blame foreigners. Charge the Japanese 10 per cent on imports, the Chinese 20 per cent. 
<P>
The political conundrum looms, as such wise men as there are in Republican politics acknowledge one thing, namely that there would not be much point in nominating Pat Buchanan with the mission of dispossessing President Clinton, since that is inconceivable. Buchanan is a prophet, not a king. That being so, practical men will pause over how exactly to handle the phenomenon. The memory of George Wallace comes to mind. In 1968 his popular strength was critical: he more or less owned the South, and he had a large following among hardhats in the industrial Midwest. But the Democrats were moving sharply left just then and had no time for him or for conservative Democrats in general. He avenged himself by running as an independent candidate, securing 13.5 per cent of the vote, and ensuring the election of Richard Nixon. Wallace's followers voted Republican for the next twenty years.
<P>
The challenge is to detach from Buchanan that in his campaign which the Republican Party ought to concern itself with, and be grateful to him for giving it focus. Buchanan almost singlehandedly revitalized moral political sentiment on the matter of abortion. His call for a national acknowledgment of a common culture has as its symbol a vote against Bilingual America. His earnest suspicion of predatory government is repeated by other candidates, but they are toothless in their language by comparison. The sheer joy with which Buchanan takes his positions is -- a joy to hear. A long night with the master cheerleader. 
<P>
It will end in a few weeks, and then Republicans need to hope that the idealistic imperative of replacing Mr. Clinton will generate the necessary poultices, and mobilize the common will; which requires reorienting America in the general direction fought for by Pat Buchanan.

<P>

<HR><P>

<LI>``Anonymous'' has a new novel in the works about the Gramm campaign. Working title: Colorless Primary.
<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>How's this for a bizarre twist: Phil Gramm is a Bob Dole supporter. The Gramm campaign -- predictably -- couldn't recover from the wound inflicted on it by Pat Buchanan in Louisiana. But in many ways it was self-inflicted. The foray into Louisiana -- fertile territory for New World Order-baiting Buchanan -- was misconceived from the start, a too-clever attempt to get a contrived bounce into Iowa, where, ironically, Gramm was doing just fine prior to his bayou debacle. There were other more fundamental problems with the campaign as well: its failure to court social conservatives vigorously or early enough; its myopic focus on ``ready cash'' (the campaign foolishly discounted Buchanan because he didn't have it); Gramm's unsympathetic public persona. But, all that said, Gramm looked like the candidate best suited to unite the rapidly parting economic and social wings of the conservative movement. The GOP had better find another, or Gramm won't be the only loser.
<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Dr. Jack Kevorkian was prevented from assisting in another suicide when police stopped him at the entrance to RNC headquarters.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>This year, as in past years, the Iowa caucuses were marked by appeals to the state's many religious conservatives. Sadly, they were also marked, as in past years, by dirty politicking among the same. In 1988, when Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp battled for those votes, slanders abounded that Kemp was gay, and that Robertson belonged to a Korean cult. This time, the victim was Steve Forbes, whose yacht was accused of harboring a Mapplethorpe (an accusation designed to allude to Malcolm Forbes Sr.'s late-blooming homosexuality). There is a Mapplethorpe in the Forbes yacht -- a seascape. A group which is itself the regular of malicious falsehoods should take care to honor the common decencies, to say nothing of the Ninth Commandment.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Plans for that nationwide chain of Phil Gramm charm schools have been put on hold.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Because establishment leaders have abandoned them on immigration, the American people have been in effect growing a new head. One sign of this: the high quality of private individuals speaking out on the issue. Thus the University of California at Davis's Professor Norman Matlof has single-handedly discredited the notion that Silicon Valley needs ``foreign geniuses'' [NR, ``Debugging Immigration,'' Oct. 9, 1995]. Now his expose of Chinese and Russian immigrants' massive dumping of elderly parents on the Supplementary Security Income program has been cited by the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector in the first critical article on immigration to appear on the Wall Street Journal's editorial page for nearly three years. Devastatingly detailed and closely reasoned letters from Linda H. Thom, a Santa Barbara budget analyst, are an occupational hazard for unwary media immigration enthusiasts: Miss Thom has just shown that the U.S. census is systematically understating the impact of immigration by shifting the U.S. citizen children of immigrants into the totals for native-born families. And Barbara Coe, a principal architect of California's successful Proposition 187 denying illegal immigrants social services, is now running for the Republican nomination in the state's 67th assembly district. This is another reason immigration will be an issue in California's March 26 primary. Good luck to her -- and to all of us.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>After one year as New York's Governor, George Pataki is rapidly turning the Empire State into the privatization capital of the nation. Pataki's fast start owes much to the appointment of businessman and long-time privatization advocate, Ronald Lauder, as Chairman of New York's Privatization Council. The Administration has accepted Council recommendations to privatize Stewart Airport, the World Trade Center, the freight division of the Long Island Railroad, and a variety of state properties and services. Governor Pataki has also been appointed Chairman of the Privatization Task Force of the Republican Governors' Association. In February, both Pataki and Lauder testified  before Congress's Joint Economic Committee on eliminating federal barriers to privatization (by means other than victory in November).<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The era of progress continues. After toppling the previous regime, the victorious military junta in Niger, Africa, sent word of its coup to the country's diplomats abroad by fax.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Maybe Lori Berenson was naive when she and the Tupak Amaru Revolutionary Movement co-signed the lease on a house in Lima, Peru, which police later found packed with weapons. Or maybe Miss Berenson, a 26-year-old Manhattanite sentenced to life imprisonment in Peru for aiding terrorists, really is as fierce a revolutionary as her madwoman-in-the-attic performance at a pre-sentencing press conference would suggest. Probably the truth lies somewhere in between, in which case it wasn't entirely fair of that secret Peruvian military court to make Miss Berenson spend the rest of her days in an Andean dungeon with no heat and no hot water. But ordinary Peruvians, sick of decades of revolutionary terror, don't feel too sorry for Miss Berenson. May her example serve as a warning for other idealistic norteamericanos eager to meddle in other people's politics.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>``Grover Cleveland was the only President to serve two non-consecutive terms. Bill Clinton is the only President serving two consecutive Presidencies in one term'' -- Paul Gigot in the Wall Street Journal. Hmmph. By our count, Mr. Clinton is up to six or eight Presidencies, or maybe twenty-three, and that's not counting Mrs. Clinton's Presidencies, which are reinvented every time she changes her hair.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, Gen. Gary Luck, cabled the Pentagon late last year warning that the threat of North Korean Scud missiles was growing and urging that he needed two batteries of the Army's new THAAD (Theater High-Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile launchers as soon as possible. Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cabled him back a month later to say that delays in the Pentagon's overall theater-missile programs would postpone THAAD deployments until 2002 or 2003 at the earliest. Fortunately, the 1996 defense authorization act -- signed into law February 10 by President Clinton -- will force the Pentagon to cut through the red tape and deploy THAAD and other systems by 1999. Time for Shali to get cracking.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Iran will hold elections for its majlis (parliament), and the Chief Justice, Mohammad Yazdi, gave a sermon on Teheran radio explaining the ground rules: ``It does not matter if [there] is a majority vote or a consensus. As long as the suffrage counters the will of God, it does not count.'' At last, a clue to the late Mayor Richard Daley's whereabouts in the hereafter.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The Army Corps of Engineers, which valiantly defends the nation's wetlands, recently declared the drainage ditches along a highway in central Nebraska to be protected ``waters of the United States.'' The Nebraska Roads Department wanted to fill in the ditches as part of a road-widening project on the twenty-mile stretch of Route 30 between Cozad and Lexington. Before the project could proceed, the Corps demanded offsetting new wetland. To satisfy the Corps, the state Roads Department is buying 19 acres of prime alfalfa farmland at $2,000 an acre and spending more than $2 million to turn it into a bog. The 
Roads Department designed, and the Corps approved, an artificial wetland in the shape of a bison, the state's emblem. Though the Omaha World Herald figured out it's really bull.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>President Clinton, meanwhile, has approved a plan to turn hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of productive south-Florida farmland into the Everglades. Like, all we need down there is more alligators, huh? And of course at taxpayer expense. But wait: the land is currently used for growing cane sugar, and the screams you hear are from a handful of domestic growers getting stinking rich thanks to federal sugar-price controls at triple the world price that cheat American consumers out of billions of dollars. The answer is to remove price controls and open U.S. markets to foreign sugar. The farmland will thus lose its artificial premium value, and so be restored to the Everglades at a fraction of the cost. Consumers will save those billions. And the alligators can have any remaining sugar growers.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The victory of ``actress-author'' Joan Collins in a contract dispute with Random House left earnest folk wondering what Miss Collins's famous editor, Joni Evans, could have been thinking. Random House said it shouldn't have to pay for Miss Collins's ``very primitive, very much off base . . . jumbled and disjointed'' novel, as Miss Evans put it sneeringly before a New York jury. Didn't Miss Evans know, when she first offered Miss Collins a multi-million-dollar advance, that actors, like First Ladies and billionaire-businessmen, rarely write their own books, and that when they do, the result tends to be incoherent, dull, or both? Of course Joni Evans knew. What she didn't know was that Joan Collins would fade from TV while the work was in progress, thus cutting into her marketability as a celebrity ``author.'' The jury was right to let Miss Collins keep her advance, bloated as it was by her publisher's greed. As for Joni Evans, she deserves to be confined to her office with nothing to read but Joan Collins novels until she admits that a deal, however dumb, is a deal.<p>

<LI>Standing Pat?
<P>
NEW Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary seems designed to keep the GOP race going to the bitter end, and maybe beyond to a brokered convention. Pat Buchanan won with 27 per cent of the vote and must now be considered a serious candidate. Front-runner Bob Dole ran behind with 26 per cent, so narrow a margin as almost to amount to a tie vote. Senator Dole's failure to score higher is damaging, but hardly enough to justify predicting his defeat. And Lamar Alexander's third-place finish at 23 per cent was indeed better than expected. With Mr. Buchanan supported by the grass-roots, Mr. Dole by the party establishment, and Mr. Alexander by the media, there is a candidate for every taste. So why the gloom?
<P>
A British saying has it that ``the Tory Party never panics -- except in a crisis.'' In the last few weeks, the GOP establishment has outdone the Tories; it has panicked without the excuse of a crisis, and indeed in the face of a historic realignment. Pat Buchanan's strong showings in Louisiana, Iowa, and New Hampshire are treated as harbingers of the end of civilization. Grown politicians threaten not to support him in the (still unlikely) event of his nomination. And there is much dark muttering that the new voters supporting him are -- O Horror! -- not Republicans, but people voting Republican for the first time. (Buchanan Democrats?)
<P>
But things are not as bad as they would seem to those whose interest is limited to differences within the party. Mr. Buchanan's showings are a tribute to his skills as a campaigner, which everyone has long acknowledged. They reflect also the allure of his positions and highlight the narrow ideological turf the GOP has been defending since the Bush years and, yes, even since the Gingrich revolution.
<P>
Mr. Buchanan's issues come in three clusters: moral, cultural, and economic. These attract three broad constituencies. Mr. Buchanan has gathered his support by opposing abortion and gay rights, by affirming family values, and by criticizing a degraded popular culture.  On most of these issues he is at one with other conservative leaders, though he sometimes speaks in a distinctive voice. His opposition to racial and gender quotas and to unrestricted immigration gives him access to the more secular ``radical middle'' owned by Ross Perot. But his appeal to blue-collar voters anxious about their economic future takes him furthest from Republican -- and conservative -- orthodoxy. For here his appeal is frankly protectionist.
<P>
NATIONAL REVIEW has for many years urged the GOP to adopt many of the positions taken by Mr. Buchanan. It is a weakness of the Dole - Gingrich Congress that these issues have been either neglected (official English), or soft-pedaled (immigration, racial quotas). Red-meat issues have yielded to green eyeshades. And the GOP comes off looking like etiolated, bloodless bookkeepers.
<P>
But Mr. Buchanan's economic stance is troublesome. And it is an aspect not only of his economic position but also of his isolationism -- America v. the world. He has rightly identified a strong vein of worry about the economic future among middle-class, especially blue-collar, Americans. These worries are real. But Buchanan's protectionist remedy is flat-out wrong: American workers benefit from selling their goods in global markets, and American consumers benefit from buying goods without the taxation of tariffs. Above all, John O. McGinnis points out in this issue what free trade protects: the American people, against high levels of government regulation and taxation. 
<P>
But political disagreements, even fundamental ones, are the stuff of coalition politics every party must learn to live with. The GOP needs the votes of those attracted by Pat Buchanan in the primaries, and it is reassuring that he has promised to stay within the Republican party, the alternative being a nagging third party whose only accomplishment would be to keep the Democrats in power. There are, after all, many points on which the combatants can agree. Mr. Buchanan endorses a flat tax, his opponents have paid some deference to official English. Before the recent spate of negative ads, these men were all friends and occasional colleagues.
<P>
The anxieties that are appeased by calls for protectionism need to be dealt with. But that policy is uniquely divisive in GOP ranks. The incomes of both low-paid and highly skilled workers have suffered from indiscriminate immigration policies and the prospects of white male workers are plainly hurt by race and gender quotas. Here are issues on which economic conservatives can give Pat Buchanan and his supporters more than they could get from the synthetic and short-term relief of tariff barriers. And if such a compromise unites the GOP, it would also split the Democrats, capturing more blue-collar voters than the Republicans have seen since the Gipper's heyday.
<P>
High stakes. The GOP establishment should play to win big, not hoard its chips for fear of losing. And so should Pat Buchanan.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>E</FONT>IGHTEEN months ago, ``The 100 Best Conservative Movies'' was a big hit with NR readers, inspiring an outpouring of their own film favorites. The following new list is drawn mainly from these suggestions with a few additions. Once again, many films come from the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. If you want to understand the meaning of ``Victorian virtues,'' in Gertrude Himmelfarb's phrase (as distinguished from ``modern values''), these movies are the place to start. Their creators often were children of the Victorian age. They grew up with convictions like faith, family, thrift, self-restraint, and patriotism, long before the ``de-moralization'' (Miss Himmelfarb again) of society and mass culture by material affluence, radical ideology, and cynical, corporate commercialism. But lately there are some hopeful signs of  a return to these virtues -- in films like Apollo 13, which celebrates American know-how, or the three new Jane Austen adaptations, which subtly endorse traditional manners and morals. So much for trends in film history. Now to Your 100 Best Conservative Movies.
<P>
Most Popular Conservative Movies Omitted from the Previous List: Patton (1970). This film makes a calculated appeal to anti-war liberals as well as to conservatives. But there's no doubt about George C. Scott's riveting portrayal of our greatest World War II army commander. It's a performance that sweeps away all those liberal theories that the way to fight a war is by controlled escalation or ``sending signals.''
<P>
Ben-Hur (1959). Oscars for Best Picture and Actor (Charlton Heston). The most revived of the 1950s biblical epics, giving a panoramic and realistic view of the cruel pre-Christian world. Long -- but not long enough for many NR readers.
<P>
The Sound of Music (1965). One of the best loved of all movies. President Reagan once apologized for not having read his official papers because the previous night this film had been shown on television. Best-Picture Oscar.
<P>
Best Modern Films about Individual Conscience and Courage: Walking Tall (1973). Based on the true story of Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, powerfully played by Joe Don Baker, who routed local corruption while wielding a baseball bat. See also Lean on Me (1989), the story of conservative New Jersey school principal Joe Clark (played by the admirable Morgan Freeman) for the baseball bat as a symbol of sturdy American righteousness.
Rob Roy (1995). Scotsman fights for his home and property, from the Walter Scott novel. It is, however, marred by needlessly explicit sex and violence. Braveheart (1995), another Scottish patriotic tale, brilliantly directed by Mel Gibson, is also open to criticism for its unrestrained violence. But both are powerful morality tales about chivalry and courage in the face of ruthless adversaries. Incidentally, Tim Roth, the wonderfully wicked English courtier in Rob Roy, may be the long-awaited successor to Basil Rathbone as an all-purpose distinguished villain (see below, passim).
<P>
Notable Films about an Individual's Triumph over Adversity: Rocky (1976). Best Picture Oscar.
Interrupted Melody (1955). The story of opera star Marjorie Lawrence, felled by polio. Tour de force performance by Eleanor Parker (the Baroness in Sound of Music), the unsung greatest actress of the 1950s (e.g., in Caged, Detective Story, and The Man with the Golden Arm.)
<P>
Best Film about a Poor Family's Struggle to Succeed: The Southerner (1945). Sharecropper Zachary Scott's uncle collapses in the field and dies in his arms with the words, ``Grow your own crops.'' This beautifully directed film (French master Jean Renoir) dramatizes the faith, love, and determination that unite Scott's family against terrible adversity; their suffering and hard work lead to fulfillment.
<P>
Best Movies about Russia's War in Afghanistan: The Beast (1988). Superb drama of Red Army versus mujahedin.
<P>
Best Movie about Defeating Terrorism: The Final Option (1982). Stirring film about anti-nuclear Marxist terrorists who seize hostages in U.S. Embassy in London to block deployment of U.S. missiles in Britain. Britain's elite Special Air Services teaches them a thing or two. Also critical of bureaucrat appeasers, this is one of the noteworthy conservative films of the 1980s.
Delta Force (1986). Chuck Norris and his all-purpose motorcycle lead U.S. commandos into downtown Beirut to rescue American hostages. Lively adventure film.
More Great Movie Tributes to the Soldiers of Freedom: Twelve O'Clock High (1949). Outstanding drama about ``tough love'' Air Force commander who saves a wartime USAAF base from demoralization. Plus The Purple Heart (1945); Back to Bataan (1945) and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), both with John Wayne; Battleground (1949); and Uncommon Valor (1983) among many more.
SPECIAL MENTION: Prisoner of War (1954). Ronald Reagan as intelligence officer who arranges his own capture by North Koreans so he can document their torture of U.S. POWs. Make that man President.
But Not All Soldiers Are in Uniform: In Casablanca (1942), directed by Michael Curtiz, Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains join the Allies, Ingrid Bergman joins the Resistance, and ``As Time Goes By'' joins the unforgettables.
<P>
Best Movies about Dropping of the Atomic Bomb: The Beginning or the End (1947) and Above and Beyond (1953). Notable for contrast with ABC's vile documentary last July on the Enola Gay mission and other press attacks on this harsh but necessary feat of American arms. The first film, although marred by some propaganda claims, is important because it points out that the success of the $2-billion Manhattan Project was a triumph of free enterprise. Not only scientists, but ``men, women, builders, carpenters, electricians,'' not knowing their project, met the challenge by ``working, working, working.'' The film respects scientists who declined to work on the bomb, but, as the Enrico Fermi character comments, ``Sometimes it takes greater principles to stay than to go.''
Fighters for Good against Evil: The Magnificent Seven (1960), with its famous score by Elmer Bernstein.
<P>
Best Films Depicting Martial Valor: Zulu (1964) and Zulu Dawn (1979). If the battle of Rorke's Drift -- in which ninety Welsh soldiers beat off an attack by four thousand Zulu warriors -- had not happened, we would have dismissed it as a cartoon adventure. But a heroic episode gets a superb dramatization in Zulu (also an early Michael Caine movie).
Best Movies about the Evil of Our Enemies: The Hunt for Red October (1990). Russia plans first strike against U.S. Plus The Fourth Protocol (1987), about a KGB nuclear terrorist (although weakened by liberal ending).
The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), directed by Michael Curtiz. This sweeping Errol Flynn epic has nothing to do with the facts of that disaster, but it has a scene that should be required viewing for all hostage negotiators. British commander of garrison besieged along the Northwest Frontier accepts treacherous enemy Surat Khan's pledge of safe passage, only to see all men, women, and children slaughtered.
<P>
Best Swashbucklers: Mention of the intrepid Mr. Flynn inevitably brings us to this thrilling genre. What makes swashbucklers conservative? They feature bold heroes who have no difficulty at all distinguishing right from wrong: no moral relativism for these fellows. Three of the best are:
Captain Blood (1935). Still the best pirate saga. Classic duel on the beach between Flynn and his rival, the inimitable Basil Rathbone, for the hand of Olivia de Havilland, to the stirring music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Directed by (who else?) Michael Curtiz.
Gunga Din (1939). Cary Grant and comrades in British India. (Hollywood did more for the British Empire than Cecil Rhodes.) Sam Jaffe is the courageous sepoy who perishes as he saves the battalion: ``You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.'' A noteworthy point about imperial epics like Gunga Din and Drums (1938) is that anti-colonial rebels are not dismissed as savages, but allowed to state their case.
Thunder Road (1958). A swashbuckler is a flamboyant adventurer. That certainly describes Robert Mitchum in this cult classic about a slick-haired, independent hero running moonshine past ``Revenooers'' through the Smokey Mountains.
Happily, with the Reagan 1980s we saw a return to tradition with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), all directed by Steven Spielberg. Good, although slightly self-conscious, fun.
<P>
John Wayne's Oscar: True Grit (1969). Our aging, fat-bellied hero still has what it takes to dispatch Robert Duvall and a host of other villains as he fights for justice for a teenage girl (herself full of the right stuff).
Best John Wayne Character of Our Time: Clint Eastwood of course in, among other films, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), High Plains Drifter (1973), Pale Rider (1985), and the Dirty Harry series.
<P>
Best Adventure Film about Personal Redemption: The Four Feathers (1939). Branded a coward, young aristocrat redeems himself in the 1898 Sudan campaign. Perhaps  the best movie celebration of imperial heroics, it contains a superb conservative speech by the heroine explaining why duty must come before happiness.
<P>
Glorifying the American Family -- and Families Divided: Ah, Wilderness (1935). Lovely comedy of teenage growing pains in turn-of-the-century New England (from the play by, curiously, Eugene O'Neill). Affectionately directed by Clarence Brown. Funniest scene: the high-school graduation.
The Fighting Sullivans (1944). Story of five brothers who all went down for their country with the U.S.S. Juneau in the Solomon Islands in November 1942. Most of the film depicts their childhood and is a case study in classic family virtues.
Life with Father (1947). Mary Gaydos of New York loves William Powell (playing Clarence Day), writing: ``Perhaps you have something against red-headed, heterosexual, capitalist, Eurocentrist men. Me, I love them.'' Directed (again) by the great Michael Curtiz.
Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938). One of the vastly popular series about the growing pains of young Mickey Rooney, who learns some truths at the knee of father Lewis Stone.
Of Human Hearts (1938). Young James Stewart becomes an army surgeon in the Civil War thanks to the sacrifices of his mother; but he ignores her, and for his ingratitude receives a lecture on a son's duties from no less than President Lincoln himself. Yes, it sounds corny, but this is a moving film, directed by Clarence Brown. John Carradine's Lincoln is by far the most credible performance in this impossible part.
Home from the Hill (1959). A divided Texas family, and the hurt endured by an illegitimate son whose father won't accept him. This film has the most restrained murder scene in movie history -- we see no killer, no weapon, and no blood, but the artistry of director Vincente Minnelli (he made more than just the best musicals like Gigi) conveys all the horror and pathos of the crime. Is such artistry of restraint beyond the abilities of today's filmmakers? Robert Mitchum's best movie.
<P>
Best Scene Dramatizing the Sanctity of Innocent Life: Rob Roy (see above). Our hero's wife is raped by his enemy, but Rob Roy embraces the child she conceives as an innocent life that must be brought into the world.
<P>
Best Movies about Children Learning Virtue: Captains Courageous (1937). Rich brat falls off transatlantic liner and is rescued by fishing trawler. Under the tutelage of a simple, devout Portuguese fisherman, he learns to be a man. Spencer Tracy as Manuel amply earned his first Oscar for the role that made him a major star. Based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling, and directed by Victor Fleming, this is one of the outstanding films of Hollywood's Golden Age.
Boys Town (1938). Tracy retained the Oscar as Father Flanagan, who founded an orphanage for ``wayward'' boys: volunteerism over bureaucracy. The film reflects traditional liberal reformism in its stress on improving a child's environment -- although conservative suggestions nowadays on removing neglected children to better surroundings receive liberals' scorn. Perhaps liberals worry this new environment would include religious teaching and discipline, as in the film, rather than ``self-esteem.''
<P>
More Classics about Religious Faith: Faith is not, of course, a matter of being conservative or liberal, but the treatment of religious themes in earlier movies reflected a society that was less secular -- and thus healthier -- than our own.
The Fugitive (1947). ``Whisky priest'' in Mexico on the run from anti-clerical government. As in Graham Greene's novel, the flawed vessel of Christianity offers more real hope for the people than the this-worldly salvation of the socialist state. Reportedly the personal favorite of director John Ford.
A Man Called Peter (1955). Biography of the Scotsman who became a minister and chaplain to the U.S. Senate. 
The Keys of the Kingdom (1944). A missionary in China.
<P>
Best Conservative Romantic Movie: Camille (1937). This classic story of a beautiful, consumptive Parisian courtesan, who forsakes her life of riches and pleasure for the love of an earnest young diplomat, is conservative in 1996 because it is a story about responsibility and sacrifice. It also features Greta Garbo in the screen's most moving performance.
<P>
The film, directed with rich detail and nuanced understatement by George Cukor, contrasts Garbo's hedonistic life with an almost sacred depiction of marriage, family, and religious ritual. When Garbo cynically dismisses her friend Nichette's plan to marry a penniless young lawyer (they once existed), Nichette entreats her: ``It's ideal to love and to marry the one you love.'' Their later wedding scene in the country (the priest reciting the Latin service) briefly but movingly conveys the holiness of the marriage sacrament. In another brief but telling scene, Cukor depicts the devout familial bonds of Robert Taylor's (Garbo's diplomat suitor) family, and particularly the respect of son for father (Lionel Barrymore).
<P>
The peak of Garbo's performance is the renunciation scene, when Barrymore pleads with her to end her country idyll with his son, who will be ruined if it goes on. Barrymore had come in anger and reproach. Love cannot last, he says, ``unsanctified by marriage, unblessed by children or social ties.'' But -- such is the spirituality and force of Garbo's performance -- he departs with humility, gratitude, and admiration when she accedes to his pleas.
<P>
Also noteworthy from today's perspective is the eroticism conveyed by the film's understatement. In a famous scene at one of Garbo's Paris parties, Taylor has followed her into her boudoir, where he urges that she send her friends away. She agrees, but he must leave first to keep the others off guard. As he kneels before her, she leans over and kisses him all over his face -- restrained by the Production Code, but white hot with passion. Such restraint also raises the dueling scene between Taylor and Garbo's aristocrat paramour (Henry Daniell) to classic status: the camera is on Garbo as she hurries out of her carriage, running to stop it. No gore, only the sound of the pistols firing, but deeply dramatic.
<P>
Camille's lavish production, the hallmark of MGM (e.g., The Wizard of Oz), reflects the sensibility of a more refined, civilized time. It is evident how much the studio strove for perfection: sets, costumes, Garbo's hair styles, editing, and music (one of the few successful examples of classical music as a score, arranged with keen dramatic sense by Herbert Stothart) underline the writing and acting to make a profound emotional experience.
<P>
HONORABLE MENTION: Sense and Sensibility (1995) for its depiction, as in Camille, of romantic love, and for its realization of the ideals of visual beauty and noble character. This is the best translation to film among the recent crop of Jane Austen adaptations; but both Persuasion and the made-for-TV Pride and Prejudice are fine pictures -- well acted, beautifully photographed, and scrupulously attentive to period detail and atmosphere. More to the point here, they embody a classical morality of self-restraint, civility, and good manners -- but also the injunction not to be deceived by outward appearances.
<P>
Best Soap-Opera Movie about Accepting Responsibility: My Reputation (1946). Barbara Stanwyck could have received an Oscar for this performance as a young widow with two boys. After extended mourning, she is about to accompany an officer friend to New York, only to recognize that her duty lies with her children. Her mother advises, ``Young people hate convention. But as they grow older they learn conventions meet a need.'' When she bids her friend goodbye at the train station, he says, ``You have to take responsibility. You wouldn't be you if you didn't.''
<P>
Ronald Reagan's Most Charming Movie: The Voice of the Turtle a/k/a One for the Book (1947). Sgt. Reagan on wartime leave in New York is stood up by superficial Eve Arden and falls for winsome young Eleanor Parker, a fellow-unsophisticate. In a movie glowing with gossamer charm, they dance to ``Danny Boy,'' have milk and cookies -- and he sleeps on the couch. One of the many 1940s films that paint New York as a wonderfully civilized city, and NR's favorite Reagan movie.
<P>
Best Scene Illustrating pre - Great Society View of Welfare: In Love on the Run (1936), Joan Crawford flees her London socialite wedding and is spirited off to France by Clark Gable. When she learns Gable is a reporter who has been secretly filing stories with his New York paper, she sends him packing, and he's fired. The following dialogue ensues between Miss Crawford and Gable's rival (Franchot Tone):
Tone: ``He's blacklisted. Through.''<BR>
Crawford: ``Can he do anything else?''<BR>
Tone: ``Nothing that won't land him in jail.''<BR>
Crawford: ``I suppose he'll get on relief.''<BR>
Tone: ``He might for a few days, but that's all. They're fussy about who gets on relief.''<BR>
<P>
Best Movie Dramatizing pre - Great Society View of Penology: The Big House (1930). Still among the best prison dramas. The inmates here have no radio and no weights. They wear grim flannel uniforms, are marched into the mess hall, and, when the guard's whistle blows, eat their gruel in silence. If they get out of line (which doesn't take much), they are deposited in the ``dungeon,'' where they stew alone for thirty days on bread and water. And when they riot and take guards hostage, Warden Lewis Stone answers their demand for freedom: ``I'll see 'em in Hell first. Let 'em have it.'' Whereupon his machine guns open up and the tanks crash through the inmates' barricade. Or was the lower crime-rate in those Depression days just a coincidence?
<P>
Best Movies about Capital Punishment: Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). Murderer James Cagney agrees to the request of Father Pat O'Brien to feign fear as he heads to the electric chair in order to give a moral lesson in the wages of sin to the Bowery Boys. Another Michael Curtiz winner, and a welcome contrast to amoral blood baths like Bonnie and Clyde and The Godfather.
Just Cause (1995). Liberal law professor saves victim of police brutality from Death Row -- only to find he really is a vicious murderer. In today's Hollywood, this is a surprise.
Best Movie about Government Economic Controls: A Private Function (1985). Confronted with British Labor government's rationing, three local worthies fatten up an illegal pig. The vet's socially ambitious wife discovers the plot, and a British class-war comedy breaks out. All Creatures Great and Small laced with arsenic.
<P>
The Editor's Favorite Satire on Modern Manners: Serial (1979). Hilarious send-up of ``liberated'' Northern California customs from granola to marriage (``I declare thee to be pair-bonded for so long as you find it mutually enriching''), drawn from Cyra MacFadden's martini-dry satire. Brilliant off-beat casting includes Christopher ``Dracula'' Lee as leader of gay San Francisco bikers.
Four More Conservative Comedies: Being There (1979). The always brilliant Peter Sellers as an obscure, hermit-like gardener who finds himself the darling of Washington's power elite and a media sage. Is ``being there,'' rather than knowing anything, a secret to Washington success? Sellers does dispense two bits of wisdom: Let the economy grow on its own like a garden (though it's not clear the film takes a positive view of this advice) and -- horrors -- he doesn't read the New York Times or Washington Post!
Sullivan's Travels (1942). Joel McCrea as Hollywood comedy director (Ants in the Pants of 1933) who wants to make socially significant films (Brother, Where Art Thou?) but accidentally lands in a Southern prison where he learns that the oppressed masses would rather laugh than be uplifted. This comedy has an unexpectedly moving scene that has probably done more to undermine racism than anything out of Washington -- a black preacher urges his dirt-poor congregation not to shun the prisoners when they arrive shackled for Sunday service; they are God's children too. Written and directed by Preston Sturges. Mr. McCrea, incidentally, was the staunchest of Hollywood conservatives.
Brother Orchid (1940). Edward G. Robinson as hood who takes refuge as a monk in a monastery. At first he tries to work the monastic system to his own advantage, but he soon learns the real truths of life from the other monks.
Harry's War (1981). Postman battles IRS.
<P>
Best Tax-Revolt Movie: The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Rush Limbaugh once noted that Robin Hood is actually the story of taking from the government and giving to the poor and middle class. Here Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin in another great triumph of Hollywood's Golden Age, directed by (you guessed it!) Michael Curtiz, with William Keighley. We first encounter Flynn galloping his horse as the camera cuts to a close-up of his confident, smiling face. This heroic romanticism characterizes the entire film, from the early Technicolor verdant greens and shimmering light that evoke Sherwood Forest as Arcadia, to the balcony scene between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian), accompanied by a gorgeous love theme from Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Richard Strauss - Puccini-like score. Supply-siders will love the ambush of the villains in Sherwood and even Keynesians will relish the duel (photographed in silhouette against monumental castle walls) between Flynn and Basil Rathbone. Run through, Rathbone plunges into the moat, and Flynn leaps down a stairway to the dungeon into Miss de Havilland's loving arms, all to triumphant Korngold fanfares.
<P>
Finest Unsung Anti-Communist Movie: Hollywood's political transformation in the 1960s sent a large batch of anti-Communist movies down the memory hole. The Red Danube (1949) is the best of them -- a striking drama about forced repatriation of Russians in postwar Vienna. The conflict is one of Christianity against Communism. A decent, atheist British officer (Walter Pidgeon) thinks it his duty to return to the Russian sector a young ballerina (the lovely Janet Leigh) who has been given sanctuary in a convent. After a series of debates with the Mother Superior (Ethel Barrymore) and the suicide of the ballerina, he eventually understands how faith helps one recognize evil (``This is what men do to other men when they don't believe in God''). Excellent script and cast, including the young Angela Lansbury as Pidgeon's service driver. Occasionally seen late at night on TNT -- but, then, so is the absurdly pro-Stalinist Mission to Moscow.
<P>
More Anti-Communist Movies: The Conspirator (1949) features the gorgeous 17-year-old Elizabeth Taylor as wife of British officer and Red spy. Her shock and disgust on learning of his treason, as if he had the plague, is a valuable reminder of the early resolute Cold War spirit.
<P>
Of course, the greatest anti-Communist movie is, improbably, a comedy: Ninotchka (1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, written by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, starring Garbo and Melvyn Douglas. This appeared in the first list of best conservative films, but it must be mentioned again because, underneath the jokes, it is a powerful defense of humane values against totalitarian ``virtue.''
Example: ``How are things in Moscow?''
``Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.''
<P>
Also be sure to see Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller; The Woman on Pier 13 a/k/a I Married a Communist (1949); The Prisoner (1955); The Seduction of Mimi (Italy, 1974); Night People (1954); High Treason (1952); Guilty of Treason (1950), about the Cardinal Mindszenty case; and the recent Burned by the Sun (1995).
<P>
Another Classic about the Inhumanity of Mass Revolution: The Scarlet Pimpernel (1935). Cross out ``Bolsheviks,'' insert ``Jacobins'' -- and send in languid aristocrat Leslie Howard to rescue the victims and wife Merle Oberon from Robespierre's left-hand man, played by Raymond Massey (second only to Basil Rathbone in portraying distinguished villains). Interestingly, Howard actually was a British agent in World War II.
<P>
Two More Great Movies about the Value of Tradition: Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939). Robert Donat, who won the Oscar for Best Actor, is superb as the shy teacher whose long service wins the affection of generations of schoolboys. Telling moment: Mr. Chips, reading out list of teachers and old boys killed in World War I, includes the former teacher of German who died fighting on the other side.
Tunes of Glory (1960). A Scottish regiment falls into turmoil when army bureaucrat tries to override its traditions.
<P>
Best Movie Depicting America as One Culture: It's a Big Country (1952). Eight short stories about the immigrant experience, with an all-star cast (Gene Kelly, Gary Cooper, Fredric March, Nancy Davis). Best line: ``Religion is part of the heart of American culture.'' Note the producer, liberal Dore Schary. Liberal then, conservative today: because the Clintons' secular and multicultural politics are radical; they have abandoned traditional liberalism. Where today's liberals prattle about ``diversity,'' Schary's movie ends: ``America, one nation, indivisible.''
<P>
Best Movie Critique of Multiculturalism: Around the World in Eighty Days (Best Picture of 1956). Intrepid Phileas Fogg (David Niven), exemplar of British imperial phlegm, rescues Indian princess from suttee funeral pyre (young Shirley MacLaine, of all people!). Many critics today undoubtedly would object. After all, if that's the Indian custom, what right has Fogg to impose Western values?
<P>
Best Anti-Anti-American Movie: Barcelona (1994) describes the last gasp of European anti-
Americanism -- the Soviet-inspired campaign to halt U.S. missile deployment in the early Eighties -- through the eyes of two young Americans trying to pick up Spanish girls. Good fun.
<P>
Best Conservative Science-Fiction Movies: Frankenstein (1931) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) explore the consequences of hubris -- Dr. F.'s ``insane ambition'' and ``mad dream.'' Sounds like the Great Society -- except that Mr. Hyde and the Monster don't live on indefinitely.
The Thing (1951). The scientist as Rationalist Fool. Researchers in the Arctic defrost a visitor from outer space who is not friendly. Here is an early prototype of the scientists behind SANE and the nuclear freeze, and who oppose any common-sense policy to defend ourselves. Best scene: the scientist attempts to negotiate.
<P>
Best Conservative Musicals: MGM's Singin' in the Rain (1952), An American in Paris (1951), and The Bandwagon (1953). They are conservative because Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, and director Vincente Minnelli celebrate common sense and professionalism over pretension and phoniness. They have no designs on us, they simply want to divert and amuse.
<P>
Best Conservative Special-Effects Movie: San Francisco (1936), for the famous earthquake. Clark Gable as blasphemous gambler finds faith through priest friend Spencer Tracy and beautiful, devout Jeanette MacDonald.
<P>
Best Scene Illustrating Press Irresponsibility: King Kong (1933). As the giant ape is being exhibited in a New York theater, the press is invited onto the stage to photograph Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) standing before him. The flash bulbs enrage the beast and his captor demands they stop: ``He thinks you're attacking the girl.'' The photographers click away, one saying: ``Let him roar. It's a swell picture.'' The rest of the story is, as they say, history.
<P>
Best Movie Illustrating Politicians' Blather: In Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935), our hero on the run finds himself in a political meeting, where he is mistaken for the official introducing the candidate. He proceeds to deliver a hilarious parody of windy oratory -- and gets a standing ovation.
HONORABLE MENTION: A Face in the Crowd (1957). This will stand as the best movie depiction of an Arkansas demagogue until Barbra Streisand produces a movie biography of the 42nd President. A striking film about TV image manipulation, ahead of its time. Directed by Elia Kazan.
<P>
Best Conservative Silent Movies: Orphans of the Storm (1921), America (1926), both by the father of all directors, D. W. Griffith; plus Ben Hur (1925); The Iron Horse (1924), directed by John Ford; and Noah's Ark (1929), an early Michael Curtiz gem in which the flood was so realistic that some extras drowned.
Best Conservative Shorts: The Sons of Liberty, with Claude Rains as Hayim Solomon, who comes to the financial rescue of Washington's Army, and dies reciting the Declaration of Independence. (One more by Michael Curtiz.)
The Monroe Doctrine. The melodramatic sweep and production panache of Casablanca applied to U.S. history.
An Airman's Letter to His Mother. U.K. film by Michael Powell, based on fact, in which RAF officer penned an eloquent statement of war aims before he was shot down.
And Our Gang in Three Smart Guys, wherein the boys play hooky and go fishing, only to receive a lesson in how those who study catch the biggest fish of all.

Dear Rusty,
<P>

A few months ago, Bill and I were having lunch together, and I said to him, ``Bill, you should get out and meet the people, get the campaign muscles warmed up.'' He nodded, picked up the phone, dialed a few numbers, and said into the phone, ``Dick, it's Bill. What are my numbers today?''
A few minutes later, the fax machine delivered the numbers: he beats Dole, Lamar!, and Buchanan. He's got a 49 per cent approval rating in Iowa and New Hampshire -- which, with the margin of error, is almost a 49.5 per cent!
``Al,'' Bill said as he surveyed his fax, ``it looks like I'm going to New Hampshire and Iowa.''
I headed off to Florida to talk about preserving the Everglades, a real barnburner. After the rally, I headed to a local coffee shop to do what we in the campaign biz call ``a flying drop-by.''
I moved on down the row of booths until another elderly woman introduced me to her husband.
``What brings you to the Miami - Dade area?'' she asked.
``What?'' asked her husband.
``I ASKED HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM TO THE AREA,'' she replied loudly. Several Secret Service agents turned down their earpieces.
``I'm here to talk about preserving the indigenous creatures of South Florida. You know, we too easily assume that because a mammal has scaly skin or is unattractive to look at, that we can just let it die. Well I'm here to fight for their preservation.''
``HE'S HERE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY,'' she shouted.
``Well, actually -- ''
``You mean you're not?'' she asked.
``That's exactly why I'm here,'' I said.
You know, Rusty, back in the '88 Democratic primary, I would have told that woman the truth: that I wasn't in South Florida to talk about Social Security, and that if I was elected, I would means-test benefits and gradually phase out the system, and replace it with an IRA-type instrument. 
Boy, have I learned a lot since then!
A quick change of clothes and I was in snowy New Hampshire.
Since I had so much luck with the senior citizens in Florida, I scoped out a lonely looking old man sitting by himself at the counter of the local Derry, New Hampshire coffee shop.
``Sir,'' I said, ``I'm Al Gore, and Bill Clinton and I would like your vote in November.''
``Forget it, Al,'' said the man. ``I'm going all the way.'' And then he chuckled to himself.
``Dick Lugar?'' I asked.
``So what if I am?'' said the old man, who, it turned out, was indeed Dick Lugar. ``So what if I come in fifth or sixth? I've just got to stay viable until Super Tuesday, ride out the storm, walk into the convention hall with my head held high, and then, you know what? People will say -- hey, Dole can't beat Clinton, Lamar can't beat Dole, but who's the man with the eye of the tiger? Who's the White Knight come to slay the Dragon?''
``Colin Powell?'' I asked.
``Exactly. And when he isn't available it'll all fall in Dickie Lugar's lap, just you wait.'' He held his coffee mug up to the waitress. ``You want to hotten this up for me, honey?''
As she poured him more coffee, I slipped out.
I was about to enter another local coffee shop, when we had to wait for the CNN camera crew to make it from Manchester, where Pat Buchanan had announced that Burger King was owned by Grand Metropolitan, an English-owned company, and that when he was elected, he'd string concertina wire along the drive-through lane until each Whopper was ``crafted with pride by legal Americans in the USA.''
As I waited outside the coffee shop for the crew to arrive, it began to snow.
``Can't I wait inside the coffee shop?'' I asked.
``Then we'll miss getting the delighted looks on the faces of the citizens of Nashua as they realize that the Vice President is joining them for lunch.''
``But they can see me standing here through the window. Look, some of them are waving.''
``Don't worry, Mr. Vice President. These are New Hampshire folks. They'll turn it on for the cameras. They're just saving their energy for show time.''
But, sad to say, Rusty, I never did get to go inside. Boy, did I freeze my toes out there in the snow. But, apparently, back at the Burger King in Manchester, Pat Buchanan committed a verbal gaffe when he declared that he was the only candidate running who would beat President Hindenburg in November -- so the CNN crew never left.
I'm getting the feeling back in my toes! I'm ready for Super Tuesday!

NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 16
<p>
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that he will run for re-election as President of Russia. It is his duty to ``consolidate all healthy forces and prevent shocks that could lead to a civil war.'' That is quite a threat to toss about, something no candidate in New Hampshire has got around to. In the past few months Mr. Yeltsin has got rid of those of his lieutenants identified with the reform movement. This greatly surprised those members of our State Department who rued the long interval back in 1991 during which Gorbachev was falling apart and U.S. policy refused to recognize the importance of Yeltsin. We did so only after that dramatic day in Red Square when Yeltsin defied the revolutionists and soon after was elected president.
<P>
It was demoralizing to read the assessment of Yeltsin by Vyacheslav Kostikov, Yeltsin's former press secretary. ``Power is his ideology,'' he said, ``his concubine if you want, his lover -- and his passion. Everything that is beyond the fight for power concerns him much less.'' When that remark about Yeltsin was aired, Kostikov was instantly fired (he had been ambassador to the Vatican). Fifty years earlier he'd have been instantly executed. Even ten years ago he would have suffered something more resonant than dismissal from a diplomatic post.
<p>
There are many contenders for the presidency of Russia, but the thinking in some quarters is that there will be a run-off between the two lead candidates, and that they will be Yeltsin and Gennadi Zyuganov. Now Mr. Zyuganov, formerly a provincial teacher, is running on the Communist Party ticket and is thought the probable victor.
<p>
It staggers the mind. Suppose that in Germany a politician were to run on the National Socialist Party ticket. He might say, ``Let's see if this time around we can do it without killing the Jews, or invading France.'' Zyuganov being a very acute politician, it can't be said of him that he got tripped up into running as a Communist. As with Yeltsin, one can't know what this politician's internal designs or attachments or loyalties are. But Zyuganov proclaims his attachment to Communism, intending to persuade the Russians that much of the pain they now experience -- en route to a free society and a free market -- they didn't experience back then under Stalin and Brezhnev, when no one was ever fired from his job, prices were stable, and crime was at low tide. In December's parliamentary race Zyuganov faced a liberal challenger. At one of their encounters, posters were flaunted: ``50,000,000 VICTIMS OF CIVIL WAR, COLLECTIVIZATION AND REPRESSION WOULD NOT VOTE FOR ZYUGANOV.'' He won handily.
<p>
The great revisionism is underway. It begins by closing the memory. Four years ago, 84 per cent of high-school students tested knew what the Gulag was. Today, only 34 per cent can tell you that the Gulag was that great charnel, the archipelago in which twenty million Russians were killed, either by execution squads, or starvation, or exposure. Such historical tablelands, when brought to the attention of the Communist candidate for President, are shrugged off as incidents of yesteryear. ``We can't answer for the mistakes of the past.''
<p>
What is lost sight of is the primary finding of history in the matter of the Communist approach to government. It is that the cruelty, the repression, the economic sclerosis are an organic part of the whole. When Gorbachev authorized glasnost his critics proved absolutely correct, that glasnost would need to be repealed, or else that it would bring on the dissolution of the Communist enterprise, because free speech and Communism are irreconcilable. Yeltsin is already moving toward economic interventionism, and in his pursuit of power will almost certainly go further. The Communists in China are experimenting with economic freedom carefully sequestered, but their fear of its leverage on civil rights brings them to furious exhibitions of power and threat; because experience teaches that economic freedom requires a measure of personal freedom. 
<p>
So, after all of this, the next President of Russia might be a Communist. What will be his attitude toward the liberated republics? We know what the position is of Zhirinovsky, the hero of the super nationalists: bring them all back. If that were accomplished, we would be facing a Communist leader of a new Soviet Union and wondering, quite reasonably, whether it would be thought new for so very long.

26-FEBRUARY-1996
<P>

<LI>Outgoing, and if that isn't proof of God, what is? Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.)
instructed Sen. Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.) to stop the ``witch hunt'' against Hillary Clinton.
Ahhh . . . le mot juste. <p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The Republican loss of Bob Packwood's Oregon Senate seat shouldn't come as a shock, even
though conservative businessman Gordon Smith had a good chance to pull off a long-shot
victory there. Instead, Rep. Ron Wyden, the Portland liberal who in his 15 years in Congress
has famously managed to avoid learning Bosnia's location or the name of the Canadian prime
minister, squeaked through by a paper-thin 1 per cent margin. If Wyden's win is hardly a
harbinger of a liberal revival, it does point to some Republican weaknesses, especially on
the environment. Wyden made crucial inroads among suburban women with the issue, which
Republicans have consistently mishandled over the last year (they have yet to find a
convincing way to defend free-market environmental reforms). Meanwhile, liberal coalition
groups demonstrated that they still have some weight to throw around, dumping hundreds of
thousands of dollars into ads that made a mockery of Wyden's ``100 per cent positive''
campaign. The Teamsters ran a shameful radio spot accusing Smith of, in effect, being
responsible for the death of a 14-year-old at one of his companies. Smith, a top-notch
candidate, almost overcame it all, even prevailing among older voters, according to one exit
poll, despite the usual Democratic Mediscare campaign. The GOP should take heart: if a
conservative message almost takes in ecotopian Oregon, it can sell anywhere.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Mrs. Clinton must now be willing to answer the Senate Whitewater Committee's questions
in writing. She called Barbara Feinman to the White House.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) plans to revive his bill banning federal race and gender
preferences, again presenting the House leadership with the decision whether or not to push
it. Last year, the leadership blinked, opting for the development of an ``empowerment
package'' that would, in theory, provide cover for a subsequent assault on racial
preferences. That package is now almost complete, but waiting for it to wend its way through
Congress would be a mistake. No package of enterprise zones and school vouchers is ever
going to win over blocs of minority voters or make it easy to repeal preferences. But the
same voices that urged the empowerment tack last year -- including Southern conservatives
worried about energizing their districts' black voters -- will be raised against Canady
again. Their fears are unjustified: Are any of the 226 Republicans who voted to end the
Viacom set-aside last year suffering as a result? In any case, with a revived California
Civil Rights Initiative now likely to make the November ballot (thanks to the support of
Gov. Pete Wilson), there will be no dodging affirmative action in the fall. Congressional
Republicans might as well seize the moral high ground of color-blindness, present President
Clinton with a bill that makes for a tough veto -- and stop looking guilt-ridden about it.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Dr. Kevorkian has presided over the suicide of his 27th ``patient,'' showing once more
that he believes the Hippocratic Oath to be a living document.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> The ruckus over the proposed Parental Rights Amendment, which asserts that ``The right
of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children shall not be
infringed,'' points up the degree to which the traditional prerogatives of parents have
already been eroded by the state. Through the schools, it has arrogated to itself the right
to counsel children on everything from careers to abortion options. Introduced now in twenty
state legislatures with eight more in the offing, the amendment has so far garnered wide
support, including that of the very visible Virginia Gov. George Allen; some, believing the
idea less viable as an amendment, have embodied its essence in more salable bills before
legislatures. Critics say they oppose the watering-down of local school boards' legitimate
authority to help abused or neglected children. What they really dread is the loss of the
educational establishment's promotion of a purely secular agenda. One proponent of the
amendment accurately described the opposition as showing ``the level of distrust of parents
by the elitist so-called experts who want to raise our children. Whose kids are they,
anyway?''

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> At the big feminist meeting in Washington last week Michelle Billies, a 28-year-old
social worker, sighed, ``We do feel that the world is open to us. But we find out that it's
not the clear straight path we may think it is.'' Welcome to the human race, baby.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt has spent his long congressional career
fighting Republican tax-cut proposals. In the 1980s he opposed President Reagan's cuts in
the income-tax rate. In the early 1990s he successfully blocked President Bush's proposal to
cut capital-gains taxes. And, today, he stands in the way of Republican efforts to grant
parents a $500-per-child tax credit. Gephardt, a self-proclaimed advocate of ``working
Americans,'' says Republican tax-relief initiatives subsidize fat cats by raiding programs
for the elderly, the poor, and the infirm. Thanks to an ethics complaint filed against
Gephardt by Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R., Wash.) we now know that in 1991, while he was blocking
tax cuts for the rest of us, he was involved in a property swap to acquire a substantial
oceanfront lot. The deal enabled Gephardt to avoid paying about $79,500 in capital-gains
taxes. Apparent inconsistencies among Gephardt's real-estate and tax records raise serious
questions of possible tax and bank fraud. Worst of all, think of the schoolchildren who went
without hot lunches.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> The key to Republican success is to make the next election a referendum on the
incumbent President -- to run, in other words, a ``negative'' campaign. An implication of
this strategy is that Republicans in Congress must abandon the attempt to build a
``positive'' record for themselves. An object lesson in what not to do is provided by the
GOP's decision, as we go to press, to send President Clinton a watered-down package of
welfare and Medicaid reforms cobbled together by the nation's governors. The substance of
this deal is bad enough. For the sake of immediate budget savings for the states,
Republicans are now endorsing proposals that would have no perceptible effect on American
life -- other than to persuade the public five years from now that conservative reforms have
been tried and have failed. The politics is worse. Clinton has already vetoed welfare and
Medicaid reform: now he will have another opportunity to deprive Republicans of a key issue
and build up a fraudulent ``New Democrat'' personality. By September, he will be sounding
like Charles Murray on the stump.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Re: President Clinton's veto (later overridden by Congress) of the bill limiting
securities-fraud suits. With one stroke of his pen Mr. Clinton: a) alienated the business
community, especially the high-tech companies headquartered in California, the most populous
state; b) alienated Democratic moderates who supported the bill; c) aligned himself with
trial lawyers, arguably the least-liked group in the nation; and d) reinforced the
perception of a man bereft of core beliefs, since only a few days before his veto he was
telling supporters he would sign the bill. Well, at least he's efficient.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> It just isn't safe to make a joke about global warming. Someone will take it seriously.
So it happened when we wrote that the January 7 - 8 blizzard in the Northeast obviously
``proves'' global warming has arrived . . . Whereupon Jessica Matthews, a leading
environmentalist commentator, immediately wrote a column in the  Washington Post arguing
precisely this proposition with great seriousness. Global warming as a long-term trend, said
she, is increasing the severity of the weather, whether hot or cold, flood or drought. The
problem is that the climate models all predict higher temperatures at the poles (hence the
melting of the icecaps) and minimal change at the equator. Since most extreme weather events
are driven by temperature differences between the poles and the equator, global warming
should reduce the severity of storms, not increase them. At other times it has been claimed
that the warming would be apparent if only all that awful atmospheric pollution weren't
there. A few years ago, we were being told that the explosion of Mount Pinatubo was masking
global-warming effects. And so it goes. If one argument disappears, another is grasped, then
another. The theory is logically unfalsifiable, hence unscientific. One thing, however, is
clear: since global temperatures began to be measured accurately from a satellite in 1979,
there has been no warming trend, rather a slight cooling. The rest is, well, hot air.

<p>

<p>

<LI> There are three things Hillary must do to become more popular. Unfortunately, no one
knows what they are.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Jacques Chirac, the most pro-American French president in decades, recently paid a
state visit to Washington. When he addressed a joint session of Congress, all the seats on
the Republican side of the aisle were filled (so much for Republican isolationism), but
there were rows of vacancies on the Democratic side. Some were out campaigning; some were
protesting France's just-completed series of underground nuclear tests in the Pacific. Poor
Chirac -- boycotted by American Greens even after he had caved in to Clinton Administration
pressures to curtail the tests. Perhaps the Republicans should have boycotted his speech to
protest his cave-in.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Sesame Street is going to be shown in Russia. If Vlas, Enik, and Korzhik don't sound
quite like Bert, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster, too bad. PBS gets its foot in the door, and
we all know where that can lead. Next it will be Barney, then All Things Considered, then
the restoration of the Soviet empire . . .

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> In Rochester, New York, the parents of a comatose young woman have been confronted with
certain ``ethical'' considerations about saving the life of a baby growing inside their
daughter's body. The daughter has been in a coma for ten years, and this past summer she
seems to have been raped by someone at her nursing home. Before the car crash that sent her
into a coma, she was adamantly pro-life, and so her parents think she would object to an
abortion. An ``ethicist'' quoted in the New York Times will have none of it. Ellen Moskowitz
asks if ``using [the comatose woman] as a vessel . . . offends the natural order.'' So, goes
the implied answer, off with the baby's head! For the pregnant woman's Catholic parents, the
``natural order'' has a name, God, and in His eyes using their daughter ``as a vessel'' is
better than killing their grandchild. It looks as if ``ethics,'' as our pluralists define
it, is a one-way street, which always leads away from God, even if believers are involved.
Which isn't very pluralistic, is it?

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> In an early reaction to our cover story last issue, the Clinton White House declared
that ``we're not'' going to ``throw in the towel'' on the drug war, though ``NATIONAL REVIEW
might want to.'' New slogan: FIGHT DRUGS -- DON'T INHALE.

<H1>GEORGE WASHINGTON</H1> 

<H2>Founding Father</H2>
<p>
<H3>by RICHARD BROOKHISER</H3>  
<p> 
<I>His own father died when he was 11, and he had no children
himself.<BR> But Washington bound his fate to the destiny of his stepchildren,
his soldiers, and unborn millions of Americans.
</I><BR>
<P>
<HR  width=50%>
Mr. Brookhiser is a senior editor of NR.<BR>
<HR  width=50%>
This article is adapted from <BR>Father of His Country: Rediscovering George Washington,
(c)1996 by Richard Brookhiser,<BR> to be published later this month by The Free Press, an
imprint of Simon & Schuster. <HR  width=50%> </center><P> <FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>E speak of
``founding fathers,'' in the plural. Yet there has been only one ``father'' of this country.
National paternity began gravitating to George Washington six months before the Declaration
of Independence, when one Levi Allen addressed him in a letter as ``our political Father.''
The first reference to him as ``Father of His country'' appeared in an almanac in 1778, and
since then the title has been fixed. <P> That title is the greatest barrier to our
appreciation of him now, for never was the comparative term of the metaphor so problematic.
We are not sure what the fathers of families do, much less fathers of countries. The
stereotypical father of the Fifties, who worked till five, then read the paper, has been
replaced by a new stereotype of dad as diaper-changer. But the increased role taken by
fathers in rearing children (by those who actually take one rather than just talk about it)
has been more than offset by the increased number of fathers who have disappeared through
the escape hatch of divorce. Other fathers vanish pre-emptively, by not marrying the mothers
of their children in the first place, while the men who take their places -- stepfathers,
mothers' boyfriends -- are responsible for most of the beating and raping of children that
goes on. Our predicaments have a biological basis. Bearing a child takes nine months of a
mother's life, and through most of that time, she is in touch with what is going on inside
her. She carries the weight, she feels the kicks. Once a child is born, it seems that a
mother is, to some degree, wired to attend to it, however badly she may do the job. None of
this applies to fathers. Conception is a spasm, an incident. The task can be as easily
accomplished by a sperm bank, or a baster. Without a blood test, fathers cannot tell how
many of ``their'' children are their own, while mothers who have not been rigidly faithful
cannot tell who are the fathers of their children. <P> Seneca, whose book of moral essays
Washington owned, was aware of the wispiness of literal fatherhood. ``My father gave me the
benefit of life . . . not knowing to whom . . . It is true, that without a father I could
never have had a being . . . but I do not, therefore, owe my virtue . . . to my nativity. .
. . The generation of me was the least part of the benefit: for, to live is common with the
brutes; but, to live well is the main business.'' If a man does only the biological minimum
required for fatherhood, then he has no role in whether his children live well, or even in
whether they live at all. <P> Fatherhood, as any society understands it, is the result of
training, and an act of will. A man who would be a father in name as well as in fact must go
beyond what is merely natural. A father is a man who follows through. This is why it was
particularly appropriate that Washington came to be known as the father of his country, for
he was the founder, above all others, who followed through. <P> The old historian's parlor
game, whether events make men or men make events (old because most historians long ago gave
the palm to events), seldom considered the option that was always open to historical actors,
which is that of doing nothing at all. If the question is, How many of Washington's public
deeds were thrust upon him by circumstance?, the simplest and truest answer is that none of
them were, for he could always have stayed home. If an entirely private life would have been
too eccentric for a man of his station -- even the retiring George Mason held public office
-- then he could have spent his career in the planters' club of the Virginia legislature. If
he went to the Continental Congress, he need not have taken committee chairmanships, or made
himself available for military service. At the end of his tenure as Commander-in-Chief, he
could have returned home for good, and spent the remainder of his days farming and fussing
with canals. If he went to the Constitutional Convention, he could have sent the document
into the world, and not himself. After one term as President, he could have stepped down.
But always he did the next thing, and then the next. <P> The span of his accumulated
follow-throughs is remarkable. Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson, Reagan, and (we now realize)
Eisenhower were strong Presidents for two terms, with varying degrees of national leadership
before their first elections. Franklin Roosevelt was a leader in peace and war for 12 years.
Lincoln's national career lasted only 7 years, from the Senate race against Stephen Douglas
to his assassination. Washington was the most important man in America, whether he was
onstage or off, for 24 years; for 17 of those years, he was front and center. It is a record
unmatched in our history, scarcely matched in the histories of modern democracies. <P> <FONT
SIZE=+3>W</FONT>ASHINGTON'S record as a ``political Father'' is all the more striking
because his own father, Augustine Washington, seems to have left such a blank in his life.
Augustine was 38 years old when George was born, the first child of his second marriage, and
he died 11 years later. We know nothing bad about Augustine Washington as a father; we also
know nothing good, except for the facts that he sent his two sons by his first marriage to
England to be educated, and that he left his family a substantial estate. The many volumes
of Washington's collected works yield three brief references to him, all unrevealing. <P>
Scanning Washington's life for possible father figures, one finds a few candidates. His
half-brother Lawrence, 14 years older, was a captain in the British army during a forerunner
of the French and Indian War. Lawrence went off to war when George was 8; here may have
begun the lifelong love of uniforms. Later there was Lawrence's father-in-law, William
Fairfax, who employed George as a surveyor, and General Edward Braddock, who commanded him
in the French and Indian War. But they do not seem to have been significant father
substitutes; they do not bulk as large in Washington's life or his recollections as he
himself loomed in the lives of his proteges. <P> Mary Washington, George's mother, left a
more vivid impression, though it is rather grim. In her later years particularly (which
lasted into her son's Presidency) she was stingy with praise and lavish with demands. During
the Revolution, she encouraged a motion in the Virginia legislature to grant her a pension,
which prompted Washington to send the Speaker of the House a mortified letter. ``Before I
left Virginia, I answered all her calls for money, and since that period, have directed my
steward to do the same. Whence her distresses can arise, therefore, I know not . . . she has
not a child that would not divide the last sixpence to relieve her.'' She did give her son
her temper. ``Of the mother,'' a childhood friend of George's recalled, ``I was ten times
more afraid than of my own parents.'' Mary Washington influenced her son's choice of a wife:
Martha Custis, besides being cute, rich, and a shrewd businesswoman, was calm and devoted,
and never gave her husband a moment's trouble. <P> Washington's early life is too misty to
understand the family dynamics. All that stands out is the lack of positively engaging
parental figures, especially paternal ones. <P> Washington never became a parent himself.
Martha Custis was a 27-year-old widow when he married her in 1759, and she had given birth
four times in her first marriage. There is no account of an illegitimate child of
Washington's that is more than graffiti on the bathroom wall of history. The conclusion that
he was sterile is inescapable. <P> >From time to time he tried to escape the conclusion
nevertheless. After he had resigned his commission as Commander-in-Chief in 1783, he wrote
to Congress asking if he could have the paper back, since it might ``serve my grandchildren
some fifty or a hundred years hence for a theme to ruminate upon.'' Both he and Martha were
over fifty, and they had been married for almost a quarter of a century. If they were going
to have any children, they would have had them by then. Still he ruminated. <P> Six years
later, the subject came up again, though in a very different way. In the discarded draft of
his first inaugural, a long and often personal address which Madison persuaded him not to
give, Washington was prepared to acknowledge his childlessness publicly. ``. . . it will be
recollected,'' he wrote, ``that the Divine Providence hath not seen fit, that my blood
should be transmitted or my name perpetuated by the endearing, though sometimes seducing
channel of immediate offspring. I have no child for whom I could wish to make a provision --
no family to build in greatness upon my country's ruins.'' This lack, he argued, made him
more fit to be entrusted with the Presidency. ``Let then the Adversaries to this
Constitution . . . point to the sinister object, or to the earthly consideration beyond the
hope of rendering some little service to our parent country, that could have persuaded me to
accept this appointment.'' Washington's wistful letter to Congress had been written at the
beginning of his sixth decade; as he neared the end of it, he accepted his personal loss,
and though he never gave the speech, in his own mind he transmuted the loss into a political
benefit. <P> The dynastic temptation was very real. The country was lucky that there was so
little material for temptation to work with. Of the first five Presidents, only John Adams
had sons who survived to adulthood. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, whose Administrations
covered the first quarter of the nineteenth century, were known as the ``Virginia dynasty,''
but if the seducing channel of immediate (male) offspring had flowed from any of them, the
dynasty might have extended into a second generation. How much more likely was it that this
would have been the case for literal sons of Washington. None of these men would have
tolerated a son becoming President by any means except election. But a gaggle of junior
Washingtons, Jeffersons, Madisons, and Monroes could have crowded the political landscape
intolerably. As it was, John Adams's eldest son, John Quincy Adams, became the sixth
President. <P> Lacking descendants of his own, Washington turned to three substitutes. The
first were his stepchildren and stepgrandchildren. Two of Martha's four children survived
infancy: a daughter, Patsy, who was sickly and died at 17; and a son, Jack, who married and
lived to be 27. Washington worried about Jack's education, writing one tutor that he wanted
him ``fit for more useful purposes, than a horse Racer,'' and he worried about his behavior
when Jack was elected to the Virginia State Senate during the war: ``I do not suppose that
so young a Senator, as you are . . . can yet have much influence in a populous assembly. . .
. But it is in your power to be punctual in your attendance.'' He expended the same anxious
attention on Jack's son, George Washington Parke Custis. But he never considered the Custis
brood his own, and they never considered him theirs. ``. . . his own near relatives feared
to speak or laugh before him,'' remembered Nelly Custis, one of Jack's daughters, ``. . .
not from his severity,'' but out of ``awe and respect. . . . When he entered a room where we
were all mirth and in high conversation, all were instantly mute. He would sit a short time
and then retire, quite nd the army was winding up its affairs, he twice used a striking
phrase. In a letter to a staff officer, he hoped that the ``Peace and Independency for which
we have fought'' would be ``a blessing to Millions yet unborn,'' and in the Circular to the
States, his farewell address as Commander-in-Chief, he warned that ``our fate'' was bound up
with ``the destiny of unborn Millions.'' This was a more particularized image than ``the
destiny of the republican form of government,'' which he would invoke in the version of the
first inaugural address that he actually delivered -- more particularized, and more
personal, even though the persons were unknown, unknowable.     In 1783, as his letter to
Congress showed, he still imagined that the unborn millions might include descendants of his
own. But even if he had been the most prolific father in the world, most of them would be
the posterity of others -- strangers to his blood, as well as strangers to him in time.
Mentioning them was an act of adoption. <P> Six years later, Washington received a printed
sermon, which had been delivered in 1759 by a minister in Maine. Washington got sermons all
the time; when he acknowledged this one, he added that he ``appro[ved] of the doctrine
inculcated.'' The sermon commemorated the death of a Maine hero, Sir William Pepperrell, who
fought in two colonial wars and was made a baronet and a general. The text was from Psalm
82, a short psalm addressed to ``the mighty'' of the earth, which ends by reminding them
that ``ye shall die like men.'' What, when the mighty die, should they have accomplished?
The minister turned for an answer to a funeral oration quoted by Socrates. ``Hereditary
Honor is indeed a noble and splendid Patrimony. But to enjoy a fair Estate, either in Fame
or Money, and for want of a proper Supply of Wealth and Glory of your own, not to be able to
transmit it to your Posterity, is infamous and unmanly.'' The mighty -- the Pepperrells and
the Washingtons -- should pass on as much honor and riches as they had inherited. But to
whom? Hereditary, Patrimony, and Posterity are terms of blood, of literal fathers and
children. General Pepperrell had a son; this part of the sermon had been addressed to him.
General Washington had no sons. But he could ensure that his ``Honor,'' the reflection of
his life lived well, might be a benefit to the millions unborn, his adopted political heirs.
This was a doctrine he could approve of.<P>

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>

You'll never believe it! Tipper just gave me the best gift ever -- and it isn't even my
birthday! <P> I was sitting in my study, reading that new book, Primary Colors. It's a new
novel by an anonymous author loosely -- and I mean loosely -- based on our '92 campaign. The
whole town is trying to figure out who wrote the darn thing. Personally, I don't really
care. It's not a funny book. It's a mean book. If Bob Dole wasn't so busy campaigning and if
I wasn't sure that he wasn't on our Clinton-Gore '92 Bus Tour, then I'd be convinced that he
wrote it. <P> Anyway, while I was reading, Tipper wheeled in a giant crate. She giggled
excitedly while I opened it -- it was a HealthRider. Sort of a cross between a see-saw and a
bicycle. <P> ``Tipper!'' I shouted happily. ``This is the best present ever!'' <P> ``I knew
you wanted one,'' she said. <P> ``Wanted one?'' I said. ``Tip, I needed one. Watching those
clips from the State of the Union -- '' <P> ``I know, I know.'' <P> `` -- and listening to
Al Jr. say, 'Who's that fat guy sitting next to Newt Gingrich?' But aren't these things
expensive?'' <P> ``Don't worry about it, Al,'' Tipper said mysteriously. ``I've just had a
little windfall. Pretend like I invested in cattle futures, if it eases your mind.'' <P>
``But why, Tipper? Why the surprise?'' <P> ``Well,'' Tipper said, ``it looks like it's going
to be a long, hard campaign -- '' <P> ``You think I need to shape up for a race against Bob
Dole?'' <P> ``Okay, okay. You look fat, Al. And I don't want to have to let out the waist of
your inauguration trousers.'' <P> ``Okay, then,'' I said. I appreciated Tipper's honesty.
And before I knew it, I was bobbing up and down on the bicycle seat just like they do on the
commercial. It was a cozy Sunday afternoon, and one of the few quiet ones we've had for a
while. The girls were at the library studying for exams, Bill was in New Hampshire at a
pancake breakfast, Hillary was at the office of Wilmer, Cutler, & Pickering, and Al Jr. was
quietly surfing the 'Net until his mother saw the places he was surfing to and put a stop to
it. <P> After about twenty minutes of bouncing up and down, I was pretty tuckered out. So I
collapsed on the couch with Primary Colors. Tipper curled up next to me and read the Sunday
New York Times. <P> ``Primary Colors just hit the bestseller list,'' she said. <P> I
shrugged. I don't really like it when I'm reading and Tipper keeps trying to start a
conversation. It's one of the reasons I haven't been able to get through the Telecom bill.
<P> ``Tipper, do you mind?'' <P> ``I'm sorry.'' <P> ``It's just that I have to finish this
stupid book this afternoon. I don't want to be left out at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting.'' I
went back to reading. <P> Tipper rustled a few pages of the paper. ``Al?'' <P> I looked up,
exasperated. ``What?'' <P> ``What did you mean when you said it was a 'stupid' book? The
critics don't seem to think it's 'stupid.' The Post called it 'winning and lively.' The New
York papers raved. It got nice write-ups in The New Yorker and Time and Newsweek. And it's
selling like hot cakes. And if it gets sold to the movies we're talking some heavy coin.
They have to let the original author write the first draft. So when you say something is
'stupid' you should think first, because a lot of people might think that writing a book
about the environment is stupid and writing a best-selling novel about the '92 presidential
campaign is smart. Especially the author of Primary Colors and her agent, Mort Janklow, who
thinks she's a 'rare comic find.''' <P> ``Excuse me?'' <P> ``Nothing. It's the weather. It's
got me cranky.'' <P> She smiled her wide Tipper smile, and I smiled back because I know how
the weather can ruin a person's mood. It's this damn global warming, Rusty. It's made the
winters cold and the summers hot and the autumns chilly and the springs wet. Where will it
end? <P> I went back to my reading. Tipper suddenly looked up. <P> ``Kim Basinger and Alec
Baldwin!'' she cried. <P> ``What?'' I asked. <P> ``They'll play us in the movie of Primary
Colors!'' <P> ``Tipper, we're not even in the book.'' <P> ``Yeah, well, we'll be in the
movie.'' <P> And she raced off, leaving me in peace to finish the book. I'm sorry, Rusty.
It's just not funny. And I know funny. <P> Your Pal,  Al <P> </body> </html>

<H3>Misfire On Drug Policy
</H3> 
<div align=center><p>
<hr></p></div>

<p>Wm. F. Buckley Jr. </p>


NEW YORK, JANUARY 30
<P>
The bipartisan Council on Crime in America, whose most conspicuous spokesman is William
Bennett, does fine work, but when it touches on the matter of drugs its analytical powers
simply decompose, as though the writer were high on crack cocaine or the legal stuff. <P>
Last week the Council exploded in opposition to the call for an approach to the legalization
of drugs made by seven writers (myself included) in this journal. To the title of the
symposium -- ``The War on Drugs Is Lost'' -- the Council replies that that is most certainly
not so. To the end of proving this, it cites the reduction of drug use by non-addicts. It
declined by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The planted axiom of course is that that
decline is owing to the war on drugs. But what is it that accounts for the decline in the
number of users of tobacco during the same period, from 33.5 million to 26.5 million? The
use of tobacco is not illegal. But since 1979, and beginning even before that, the
deleterious effect of cigarettes was so persuasively argued that even William Bennett gave
up smoking. <P> A look at the formal side of the war on drugs is required. If something is
illegal, then the law that makes it so is effective to the extent that it imprisons those
who violate it, thereby hypothetically reducing the number of lawbreakers. <P> That would
seem obvious, but isn't to the distinguished members of the Council on Crime in America. In
1985, 811,000 arrests were made for drug offenses. In 1994, 1.35 million arrests were made
for drug offenses. Does that mean that the war on drugs is effective? Well, no. An effective
law diminishes, rather than increases, the number of violators who have to be arrested. <P>
And then of course one asks, If 1.35 million drug users were arrested in 1994, how many drug
users were not arrested? The Council informs us that there are more than 4 million casual
users of cocaine (defined as people who use it less than once a week). How so? Why haven't
they been arrested? And goes on to say that there are over 2.2 million heavy (at least
weekly) users. That makes a total of 6.2 million who violate the law from once a week, to
every two weeks or so. How effective is the war when such figures can be cited? Now take the
big one. There are over 70 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, and about 10 million
who continue to do so. Why aren't they in jail? Does the Council on Crime in America really
wish that they were in jail? <P> It must have embarrassed the Council that the same week it
sputtered forth on the great success of the war on drugs, The Economist cited another
Council report on crime in America which gainsays its entire position on the drug war. We
learn that only one criminal is jailed for every hundred violent crimes committed; that over
one-half of America's convicted felons are not sentenced to prison (because, in part, the
prisons are full); that the most violent criminals serve less than one-half their sentences,
and the average murderer released in 1992 from a state prison had served only 5.9 years. <P>
The Economist cites the experience of a patrolman in Haughville, a scruffy area of
Indianapolis. ``He drives up and down in the evenings, past anoraked figures who stand
outside liquor stores and turn their faces from him. He can guess what they are; few people
apart from drug dealers stand around on nights like this, when the puddles in the potholes
freeze hard. Besides, Patrolman Reichle knows most of them: he reckons he has arrested one
in five of these young men.'' City prosecutors ``do not even bring charges against drug
dealers until they have been arrested several times. Those who do get charged and found
guilty will not go to prison, unless they have other convictions. President Bill Clinton's
call for a crackdown on drug dealers sounds pretty hollow in Haughville.'' <P> Such is
overcrowding in state prisons in Indiana -- notwithstanding that the national increase in
prison space is threefold since we decided to wage hard war on drugs -- that even a
relatively new American prison might have merited describing by Charles Dickens. ``Prisoners
pass their days in narrow, ill-lit cages; there are no chairs or tables, so the men pace up
and down like zoo animals or slouch upon the floor.'' <P> So what has the war done? It has
made a mockery of an anti-drug law that is simply ignored by millions; it has induced
violent felonies in pursuit of drug profits; and it is self-evidently powerless to do
anything about the recent increase in marijuana use by reckless adolescents. It is a pity
that men and women of the moral and intellectual character of William Bennett treat drug
legalization as the equivalent of moral acquiescence in drug abuse, when other reasons for
repealing our stupid laws are so clearly articulated, primary among them to relieve non-drug
users from the heavy load they bear in the phony and ineffective war. One forgets -- who won
the Hundred Years War back then? Was it really necessary to take it on for one hundred
years? <P>

<head><title>The Week -- NR</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>

<p><li>
Scientists have found the so-called missing mass of the universe, the invisible matter that shapes galaxies. It was discovered in a cardboard box inside a closet at the White House.

<p><li>It's time for Republicans to beat a strategic retreat on the balanced budget. Any attempt in the House to stick it to the President with so-called ``targeted appropriations'' -- bills that fund Republican priorities, but not those of the Democrats (AmeriCorps, the Commerce Department) -- will appear vindictive, rather than simply economy-oriented. And the President will just veto the bills. Nor should Republicans give Mr. Clinton a reason to paint them as ``extremists'' by playing politics with the debt limit. The GOP's best option is to pass a continuing resolution funding the government for the rest of the year at levels low enough that they can say they have cut spending as much as could be done with a recalcitrant Democrat in the White House. Then they should put the budget behind them. Republicans can continue to slam the Clinton budget proposal as dishonest, but only within the context of a wide-ranging assault on the President designed to collect as many vetoes (or Senate filibusters) on tough issues as possible. In keeping with this strategy, the GOP's work on welfare should be considered complete. Clinton already sided with ``welfare as we know it'' with his veto of a weak reform bill this month. Why give him a second chance? Next, he should be made to declare himself on affirmative action, English as the official language, third-trimester abortions, and all the other issues pushed aside by the GOP's year-long effort to balance the books. The more chances Republicans give Clinton to obstruct popular legislation unacceptable to his liberal base, the more likely voters are to veto him in November. After that the ``revolution'' can begin in earnest.

<p><li>In a speech to the Cato Institute, Sen. Phil Gramm became the first candidate in the presidential race to offer a comprehensive economic agenda. Gramm promises to balance the budget in his first term and, if re-elected, to start paying back the national debt. He proposes a flat tax set at 16 per cent; if his policies spark so much economic growth that federal revenues threaten to increase ahead of schedule, the rate would be cut still further. He would repeal the estate and gift taxes and work to reduce regulations to free trade. Flat-tax purists will not be perfectly satisfied -- Gramm would not abolish the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving, as Steve Forbes does. And where Forbes would eliminate capital-gains taxes, Gramm would apply the 16 per cent rate to them after adjusting for inflation. But if enacted, Gramm's proposal would still provide the most favorable treatment of capital in recent history. And it's the most politically attractive reform plan around. By retaining the two deductions and by taxing investment income at the individual level rather than at the business level, Gramm cuts off openings for liberal attacks while sacrificing little of substance. Any candidate who wants to offer a different plan is going to have a tough act to follow.

<p><li>Tax-policy wonks were recently treated to the rarest of rarities: a controlled experiment in supply-side theory. In 1993 the top federal income-tax rate for the highest-income families ($250,000+) was increased from 31 per cent to 39.6 per cent. The income cap on Medicare taxes was also eliminated, effectively tacking on another 2.9 per cent. By contrast, income-tax rates on the middle-income group ($50,000 to $200,000) didn't change. So we have, in effect, two test tubes -- tax hike, and no tax hike -- with everything else held constant. The results? Gross income of the ``tax hike'' highest bracket fell $31 billion short of the level it would have reached had it kept pace with the gross income of the ``no tax hike'' middle-brackets in 1993. So instead of collecting an extra $16 billion, Uncle Sam received just $5 billion, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research study. By earning less, highest earners have pushed a larger share of federal taxes onto the backs of the rest of us.

<p><li>President Clinton toyed with a core belief that he would like to punch columnist William Safire in the nose for calling Miz Hillary a congenital liar. He has not yet expressed any core belief about punching out columnists Suzanne Fields, Georgie Anne Geyer, and Mona Charen, among others who concluded Miz Hillary was you-know-whatting about her role in Travelgate and Whitewater.

<p><li>A while back Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio said that ``if there is retributive justice,'' Jesse Helms will ``get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it.'' The tireless Arnold Beichman has found a source for her moral reasoning. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the anti-nuclear activist Dr. Helen Caldicott told a reporter that ``the accident should have happened here. I hate to say that as a physician, but unless there are thousands of American martyrs, nothing will be done.'' Dr. Caldicott has disappeared since the end of the Cold War. Maybe Nina Totenberg could find out where, and join her.

<p><li>It is the conventional wisdom of welfare reformers across the political spectrum that people on welfare must move to the work force. The problem is that welfare pays too well for most of them to afford to work. The latest Cato Institute Policy Report shows that in New York City welfare provides the equivalent of an hourly pre-tax wage of $14.75 (it's $11.35 in Baltimore and $10.90 in Detroit). In 40 states welfare pays more than $8.00 an hour, and in 17 states more than $10 an hour. In 9 states welfare pays more than the average first-year salary of a schoolteacher, and in 29 states more than the average starting pay of a secretary. In 47 states it pays more than a janitor gets. In the 6 most generous states a first-year computer programmer would be better off on welfare. How many NR readers would be better off on welfare? And would they use the extra cash to buy subscriptions for friends?

<p><li>An observant reader notes an apparent contradiction among NR editors. Contributing Editor Stephen Moore argues in NR (December 25) that Republicans are losing the budget battle because Federal Government spending will continue to increase in dollar terms. Senior Editor Peter Brimelow, with help from NR Economics Analyst Ed Rubenstein, argued in Forbes (December 18) that Republicans are winning because federal spending will fall as a share of the economy (at least 3 percentage points of Gross Domestic Product between 1995 and 2005 -- both in the Republican and in the White House plans). Who's right? Both. Dollars spent are important because there's no absolute reason why spending should move pari passu with GDP. But the Federal Government's share of GDP is the ultimate issue, because it measures Washington's stultifying effect. Now all we need is for those out-year forecasts to be something like accurate.

<p><li>The presidential campaign, as George Will remarked, is generating more detailed policy arguments than usual. Yet the recent Republican debates have been remarkably unedifying, with most of the cheap shots aimed at Steve Forbes and his flat tax. (See ``On the Right,'' p. 62.) The low point of the Iowa debate came when Lamar Alexander trashed Forbes for having raised the price of his magazine. Far worse than the unfairness to Forbes is the possibility that the rumble could bury tax reform as an issue. Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform has sent an open letter to the candidates reminding them that in ``a similar heated primary season not long ago, one candidate's unfortunate remarks about 'voodoo economics' did incalculable damage to the party over a period of years and contributed to a climate of distrust that ultimately doomed a Presidency.'' Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment was meant to protect the climate of opinion, as much as personalities.

<p><li>The House and Senate have reconciled their versions of the FY1996 defense authorization bill, but only at the price of significant concessions by the House conferees. The commitment to deploy a multiple-site ground-based national defense against ballistic missiles by the year 2003 has been dropped, as were restrictions on the President's freedom to dispatch U.S. troops under UN command. The Administration will be cheered by these concessions. Meanwhile, also on the defense front, some liberals have started once again casting their eye on the defense budget as a place to raid for funds for domestic programs. It won't fly. This year's defense appropriation (already signed into law) puts spending at about $265 billion. That's 40 per cent below the 1985 level in real terms, and a little over 3 per cent of GDP -- lower than at any time since before Pearl Harbor. We've cut enough.

<p><li>The uproar over the World Trade Organization's ruling against the United States for differential pricing is embarrassing. If ever they ruled against us motivated by reasoning manifestly tendentious, then that would be the time to tell the court -- and, for that matter, GATT -- to go to hell. But when you join in a conference to set the speed limit and proceed to exceed that limit, you should expect to be stopped, and should be stopped. The principal beneficiary of free trade is the American people, and it is for that reason that Congress and Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton entered into a convenant whose executive arm should have no alternative than to rule on the facts, which the court did.

<p><li>Secretary of State Warren Christopher mentioned in passing in a Harvard speech on January 18 that admission of the Central European democracies into NATO would proceed ``on a roughly parallel track'' with their entry into the European Union. But linking the NATO and EU timetables for admitting new members only slows down the NATO process, since the EU, at its December meeting in Madrid, put off the beginning of any such membership talks until 1998 at the earliest. This is another sop to Russia and another slap in the face for the Central Europeans.

<p><li>Disturbing evidence continues to surface of discrimination on Death Row. Guinevere A. Garcia, an inmate in Illinois, made news by publicly pleading to be put to death. (Gov. Edgar ultimately commuted her sentence.) As Professor Victor Streib told the New York Times, ``We've sentenced 112 women to death since 1973 and only executed one. . . . It was nearly a joke in the business that for a woman to get executed she would have to volunteer, and that's what's happening now.'' If there is any merit in the call for more executions of white men to bring that statistic in line with the figure for black men, then there should be many, many more executions of women, black and white. America executes thirty or forty people a year, all men. If enough women to make up the difference can't be found languishing on Death Row, the obvious solution is to extend the death penalty to lesser offenses than murder. Since women don't commit rape very often, we'd be willing to consider littering, driving too slowly on the freeway, and eating peanuts from supermarket bins without paying for them as new capital crimes. Let Justice reign and flourish through the land, nor youth, nor charms divert her iron hand.

<p><li>A social-service inspector in England has acted, censuring a vicar who operates a day-care center. His offense? There are no black dolls for the kiddies. They do have one or two yellow dolls, who represent the Sino-Japanese community. But even though there are no black children in this center, the inspector reminded the vicar, there are black children elsewhere, and so this affront to multiculture must cease. And then there was the church ceremony in Coventry intended to honor the automobile. An 1897 Daimler sputtered its way down the aisle, but its exhaust nearly asphyxiated the congregation. They recovered, only to succumb again when a young woman stripped naked, a la Lady Godiva, the better to make her point, which was a naked protest against the ravages of the motor car. The madness is not entirely domestic.

<p><li>Heard from the Greens: Now that two of the last three winters have proved colder, icier, and snowier than any others in the last half-century, there can no longer be any doubt about the reality of global warming.

<p><li>What did Hillary know, and when did she shred it?

<h2>THE WAR ON DRUGS IS LOST</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>



The following is an excerpt from a symposium that appears in the Febuary 12th issue of the magazine
 
<p>
<p>NATIONAL REVIEW has attempted during its tenure as, so to speak, keeper of the conservative tablets to analyze public problems and to recommend intelligent thought. The magazine has acknowledged a variety of positions by right-minded thinkers and analysts who sometimes reach conflicting conclusions about public policy. As recently as on the question of troops to Bosnia, there was dissent within the family from our corporate conclusion that we'd be best off staying home.
<p>For many years we have published analyses of the drug problem. An important and frequently cited essay by Professor Michael Gazzaniga (Feb. 5, 1990) brought a scientist's discipline into the picture, shedding light on matters vital to an understanding of the drug question. He wrote, for instance, about different rates of addiction, and about ambient pressures that bear on addiction. Elsewhere, Professor James Q. Wilson, now of UCLA, has written eloquently in defense of the drug war. Milton Friedman from the beginning said it would not work, and would do damage.
<p>We have found Dr. Gazzaniga and others who have written on the subject persuasive in arguing that the weight of the evidence is against the current attempt to prohibit drugs. But NATIONAL REVIEW has not, until now, opined formally on the subject. We do so at this point. To put off a declarative judgment would be morally and intellectually weak-kneed.
<p>Things being as they are, and people as they are, there is no way to prevent somebody, somewhere, from concluding that ``NATIONAL REVIEW favors drugs.'' We don't; we deplore their use; we urge the stiffest feasible sentences against anyone convicted of selling a drug to a minor. But that said, it is our judgment that the war on drugs has failed, that it is diverting intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and penal procedures associated with police states. We all agree on movement toward legalization, even though we may differ on just how far.
<p>We are joined in our judgment by Ethan A. Nadelmann, a scholar and researcher; Kurt Schmoke, a mayor and former prosecutor; Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Robert W. Sweet, a federal judge and former prosecutor; Thomas Szasz, a psychiatrist; and Steven B. Duke, a law professor. Each has his own emphases, as one might expect. All agree that the celebrated war has failed, and that it is time to go home, and to mobilize fresh thought on the drug problem in the context of a free society. This symposium is our contribution to such thought.

<H3>1. Wm. F. Buckley Jr.</h3>
<p><i>Last summer WFB was asked by the New York Bar Association to make a statement to the panel of lawyers considering the drug question. He made the following statement:
</i>
<p>WE ARE speaking of a plague that consumes an estimated $75 billion per year of public money, exacts an estimated $70 billion a year from consumers, is responsible for nearly 50 per cent of the million Americans who are today in jail, occupies an estimated 50 per cent of the trial time of our judiciary, and takes the time of 400,000 policemen -- yet a plague for which no cure is at hand, nor in prospect.
<p>Perhaps you, ladies and gentlemen of the Bar, will understand it if I chronicle my own itinerary on the subject of drugs and public policy. When I ran for mayor of New York, the political race was jocular, but the thought given to municipal problems was entirely serious, and in my paper on drugs and in my post-election book I advocated their continued embargo, but on unusual grounds. I had read -- and I think the evidence continues to affirm it -- that drug-taking is a gregarious activity. What this means, I said, is that an addict is in pursuit of company and therefore attempts to entice others to share with him his habit. Under the circumstances, I said, it can reasonably be held that drug-taking is a contagious disease and, accordingly, subject to the conventional restrictions employed to shield the innocent from Typhoid Mary. Some sport was made of my position by libertarians, including Professor Milton Friedman, who asked whether the police might legitimately be summoned if it were established that keeping company with me was a contagious activity.
<p>I recall all of this in search of philosophical perspective. Back in 1965 I sought to pay conventional deference to libertarian presumptions against outlawing any activity potentially harmful only to the person who engages in that activity. I cited John Stuart Mill and, while at it, opined that there was no warrant for requiring motorcyclists to wear a helmet. I was seeking, and I thought I had found, a reason to override the presumption against intercession by the state.
<p>About ten years later, I deferred to a different allegiance, this one not the presumptive opposition to state intervention, but a different order of priorities. A conservative should evaluate the practicality of a legal constriction, as for instance in those states whose statute books continue to outlaw sodomy, which interdiction is unenforceable, making the law nothing more than print-on-paper. I came to the conclusion that the so-called war against drugs was not working, that it would not work absent a change in the structure of the civil rights to which we are accustomed and to which we cling as a valuable part of our patrimony. And that therefore if that war against drugs is not working, we should look into what effects the war has, a canvass of the casualties consequent on its failure to work. That consideration encouraged me to weigh utilitarian principles: the Benthamite calculus of pain and pleasure introduced by the illegalization of drugs.A YEAR or so ago I thought to calculate a ratio, however roughly arrived at, toward the elaboration of which I would need to place a dollar figure on deprivations that do not lend themselves to quantification. Yet the law, lacking any other recourse, every day countenances such quantifications, as when asking a jury to put a dollar figure on the damage done by the loss of a plaintiff's right arm, amputated by defective machinery at the factory. My enterprise became allegorical in character -- I couldn't do the arithmetic -- but the model, I think, proves useful in sharpening perspectives.
<p>Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book, America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs, and scholarly essay, ``Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster,'' reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs. It is acknowledged that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another consumed, or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug. But the estimate authorized by the federal agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week. There are (again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana. From the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in their lives or careers. About such users one might say that they are the equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result.
<p>Curiosity naturally flows to ask, next, How many users of illegal drugs in fact die from the use of them? The answer is complicated in part because marijuana finds itself lumped together with cocaine and heroin, and nobody has ever been found dead from marijuana. The question of deaths from cocaine is complicated by the factor of impurity. It would not be useful to draw any conclusions about alcohol consumption, for instance, by observing that, in 1931, one thousand Americans died from alcohol consumption if it happened that half of those deaths, or more than half, were the result of drinking alcohol with toxic ingredients extrinsic to the drug as conventionally used. When alcohol was illegal, the consumer could never know whether he had been given relatively harmless alcohol to drink -- such alcoholic beverages as we find today in the liquor store -- or whether the bootlegger had come up with paralyzing rotgut. By the same token, purchasers of illegal cocaine and heroin cannot know whether they are consuming a drug that would qualify for regulated consumption after clinical analysis.
<p>But we do know this, and I approach the nexus of my inquiry, which is that more people die every year as a result of the war against drugs than die from what we call, generically, overdosing. These fatalities include, perhaps most prominently, drug merchants who compete for commercial territory, but include also people who are robbed and killed by those desperate for money to buy the drug to which they have become addicted.
<p>This is perhaps the moment to note that the pharmaceutical cost of cocaine and heroin is approximately 2 per cent of the street price of those drugs. Since a cocaine addict can spend as much as $1,000 per week to sustain his habit, he would need to come up with that $1,000. The approximate fencing cost of stolen goods is 80 per cent, so that to come up with $1,000 can require stealing $5,000 worth of jewels, cars, whatever. We can see that at free-market rates, $20 per week would provide the addict with the cocaine which, in this wartime drug situation, requires of him $1,000.
<p>My mind turned, then, to auxiliary expenses -- auxiliary pains, if you wish. The crime rate, whatever one made of its modest curtsy last year toward diminution, continues its secular rise. Serious crime is 480 per cent higher than in 1965. The correlation is not absolute, but it is suggestive: crime is reduced by the number of available enforcers of law and order, namely policemen. The heralded new crime legislation, passed last year and acclaimed by President Clinton, provides for 100,000 extra policemen, even if only for a limited amount of time. But 400,000 policemen would be freed to pursue criminals engaged in activity other than the sale and distribution of drugs if such sale and distribution, at a price at which there was no profit, were to be done by, say, a federal drugstore.
<p>So then we attempt to put a value on the goods stolen by addicts. The figure arrived at by Professor Duke is $10 billion. But we need to add to this pain of stolen property, surely, the extra-material pain suffered by victims of robbers. If someone breaks into your house at night, perhaps holding you at gunpoint while taking your money and your jewelry and whatever, it is reasonable to assign a higher ``cost'' to the episode than the commercial value of the stolen money and jewelry. If we were modest, we might reasonably, however arbitrarily, put at $1,000 the ``value'' of the victim's pain. But then the hurt, the psychological trauma, might be evaluated by a jury at ten times, or one hundred times, that sum.
<p>But we must consider other factors, not readily quantifiable, but no less tangible. Fifty years ago, to walk at night across Central Park was no more adventurous than to walk down Fifth Avenue. But walking across the park is no longer done, save by the kind of people who climb the Matterhorn. Is it fair to put a value on a lost amenity? If the Metropolitan Museum were to close, mightn't we, without fear of distortion, judge that we had been deprived of something valuable? What value might we assign to confidence that, at night, one can sleep without fear of intrusion by criminals seeking money or goods exchangeable for drugs?
<p>Pursuing utilitarian analysis, we ask: What are the relative costs, on the one hand, of medical and psychological treatment for addicts and, on the other, incarceration for drug offenses? It transpires that treatment is seven times more cost-effective. By this is meant that one dollar spent on the treatment of an addict reduces the probability of continued addiction seven times more than one dollar spent on incarceration. Looked at another way: Treatment is not now available for almost half of those who would benefit from it. Yet we are willing to build more and more jails in which to isolate drug users even though at one-seventh the cost of building and maintaining jail space and pursuing, detaining, and prosecuting the drug user, we could subsidize commensurately effective medical care and psychological treatment.I HAVE spared you, even as I spared myself, an arithmetical consummation of my inquiry, but the data here cited instruct us that the cost of the drug war is many times more painful, in all its manifestations, than would be the licensing of drugs combined with intensive education of non-users and intensive education designed to warn those who experiment with drugs. We have seen a substantial reduction in the use of tobacco over the last thirty years, and this is not because tobacco became illegal but because a sentient community began, in substantial numbers, to apprehend the high cost of tobacco to human health, even as, we can assume, a growing number of Americans desist from practicing unsafe sex and using polluted needles in this age of AIDS. If 80 million Americans can experiment with drugs and resist addiction using information publicly available, we can reasonably hope that approximately the same number would resist the temptation to purchase such drugs even if they were available at a federal drugstore at the mere cost of production.
<p>And added to the above is the point of civil justice. Those who suffer from the abuse of drugs have themselves to blame for it. This does not mean that society is absolved from active concern for their plight. It does mean that their plight is subordinate to the plight of those citizens who do not experiment with drugs but whose life, liberty, and property are substantially affected by the illegalization of the drugs sought after by the minority.
<p>I have not spoken of the cost to our society of the astonishing legal weapons available now to policemen and prosecutors; of the penalty of forfeiture of one's home and property for violation of laws which, though designed to advance the war against drugs, could legally be used -- I am told by learned counsel -- as penalties for the neglect of one's pets. I leave it at this, that it is outrageous to live in a society whose laws tolerate sending young people to life in prison because they grew, or distributed, a dozen ounces of marijuana. I would hope that the good offices of your vital profession would mobilize at least to protest such excesses of wartime zeal, the legal equivalent of a My Lai massacre. And perhaps proceed to recommend the legalization of the sale of most drugs, except to minors.

<P>



Well, Tipper was right again! She told me this morning that if I cleaned out the basement, I'd be surprised by what turned up. So down I went with a box and a mess of recyclable trash bags and a reluctant Al Jr. And boy! do we Gores have a messy basement!
<P>But since it's snowing like the dickens out and since Al Jr.'s soccer game (St. Alban's vs. Calvert) was called off due to snowdrifts five feet high (the tallest kid on Al's team is 4'11"), the Gore men weren't that unhappy to do some early spring cleaning.
<P>We found the usual basement stuff: solar hats, earth brick molds, planetary communication panels, that kind of thing. But behind a box of copies of Earth in the Balance, we found a box of notes that look like they could belong to you -- they're handwritten, and written in some form of scientific notation, I think; at least, I can't make heads or tails out of it:
<P>2/23/93
<br>HRC -- v. upst. Scrmng. Rd fcd. Snrlng. Thrwng lmp @ potus.
<br>Wnts WHTrvl Offc ``hng out 2 dry.''

<br>$$$$$$$ more $$$$$$$ more $$$$$$$.
<p>Does any of that make sense to you? It looks to me like some kind of complicated photosynthesis thing.
<p>We also found a stack of computer printouts. Here's one of them.
<br>RSE LW FRM -- BILLING/PROJECT CODE/HRS
<br>HRC -- WhtWtr/CstlGrnd/McDgl/et al -- 110 hrs @ $350 
<br>HRC -- rprsntg WhtWtr to Gov -- 110 hrs @ $350
<p>These go on and on. Stacks and stacks of them. Could they be the baby-sitting ledger for one of the girls?
<p>And then we found some more handwritten notes.

<p>Does any of that make sense to you, Rusty? Could it be something the Quayles forgot to take?
<p>The strange thing is, I was just down here a few weeks ago and I didn't notice all of this junk cluttering the place up. And when Tipper ordered me to clean up the basement, it was like she knew that all of these boxes and papers were here, even though as far as I know, she hasn't been down here for ages. 
<p>``What's down there, Tip?'' I asked.
<p>``Our last hope,'' she said. You know women, Rusty. It's like they have some kind of sixth sense for housecleaning. 
<p>The next thing that turned up was a computer disk, which Al Jr. happily ``hacked'' his way into. The screen on his laptop just sprang alive -- numbers and figures zooming by. All I caught was: 
<p>TO: B.C. & H.R.C.
<p>FR: H.Th. & L. B-Th. 
<p>Attached please find profit projections for Air Thomason, Inc. Please initial and route to M. McL. and D. Watkins. 
<p>Then some sort of spreadsheet program began, and the numbers kept getting larger and larger.
<p>And the last scrap of paper -- and this one really might be important -- 
<p>IOU $30,000 for re-election Gov. Ark.
<p>Redeemable in cash or in kind.
<p>I'm tempted to recycle most of this -- we should be encouraging people to e-mail whenever they can, and so if whoever it belongs to comes back looking for it, well, let them learn the hard way.
<p>There was also a giant box of computer diskettes, but I gave them all to Al Jr., who's merrily erasing them so he can use them to save his ``Zoop'' games.
<p>I still haven't decided what to do with all of this paper, though. Maybe I'll ask Tipper to handle it. After all, she's the one who sent me down here in the first place. She'll know what to do with
it.

Forbes's Rich Problem
<p>
NEW YORK, JANUARY 16
<p>Steve Forbes's campaign is revealing, challenging, and amusing. The sheer improbability, last 
November, that he would get anywhere tended to interdict any other consideration of his candidacy,
 yet here he is, running second in various states. In the debate in Iowa on Saturday the other 
candidates all consolidated as a Get Forbes posse. He escaped, but bruises landed, inflicted by 
fellow Republicans, of course, and, in many cases, fellow conservatives. 
<p>He has split the 
conservative vote, and, accordingly, Senator Gramm went after him lustily. This was in part a 
professional obligation (there is no way Phil Gramm can stop Dole and share affections with Steve 
Forbes) and in part personal (Senator Gramm is smarting from Forbes's ads).
<p>Forbes has of course 
been baiting Gramm in a television and radio campaign that has suffused Iowa with Forbes's agenda. 
His complaint is that Gramm's insistence on a reduction in government expenses pays insufficient 
heed to the possibilities that open up under a return to supply-side policies. Gramm counters that 
you can't have effective tax relief without asphyxiative government policies that would hugely 
reduce government expenditures. Without exactly saying so, Forbes resists this, preferring to 
cite the prodigality of growth when the yokes are removed from the taxpayers' necks. 
It is a nice quarrel, and conservatives tend to hope that both sides will win.
<p> Now the special vulnerabilities of Forbes on the larger political scene are 
difficult for such as Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan and indeed Lamar Alexander to 
cope with. His company has a private airplane blissfully named Capitalist Tool. 
And his company has a gorgeous big yacht, which will take you around the world, 
if you press the right button. Now the Internal Revenue Service, over the years, has 
examined the expense accounts of these two amenities with ferocious attention, but the 
records absolutely establish a business purpose in maintaining them. The primary weight 
of their expense rests on the shoulders of the stockholders, who are the Forbes family. 
<p>There is that, plus also the general political disability of disposing of great wealth. 
The public doesn't find this disqualifying -- FDR was relatively rich -- and anyway, right-wing 
inclinations do not go in lockstep with wealth. (Bill Gates voted for Clinton.) In 1958 there were 
three contenders for statewide office in New York. Averell Harriman was standard-bearer of the left
 wing of the Democratic Party; challenger Nelson Rockefeller was standard-bearer of the left wing 
of the Republican Party; Corliss Lamont was, pure and simple, a Communist fellow-traveler running
 on a socialist ticket. All three gentlemen were heirs to great fortunes. 
<p>So that the Republican
 public, in a Republican primary, is not going to be frightened off by the documentation of Steve 
Forbes's wealth. It is a slightly different matter that he has put that wealth entirely at the 
disposal of his campaign. That understandably irritates those poor souls who have to spend half 
of every day collecting nickels and dimes from house to house; but there is no indication that the 
public is put off on the matter, although there may be a considerable difference between the cited 
popularity of Steve Forbes and the number of people who will actually turn up to vote for him. 
<p>His primary problem has to do with the widespread belief that a flat tax would hurt the middle 
class, specifically, those who earn between $70,000 and $200,000. Forbes acknowledges that for the 
first year, perhaps two years, taxing families with incomes over $36,000 at 17 per cent, 
disallowing deductions, and immunizing dividend and estate income would mean a deficit, but 
one which, he vows, would soon disappear under the promptings of an invigorated marketplace. 
But of course the first thing done by the other candidates and their accomplices was to try to 
figure out how much less this would hypothetically cost Steve Forbes personally, compared with 
what they figure out he paid last year. 
<p>The estimated saving is substantial. Forbes was 
justifiably inflamed at the preposterous suggestion that someone is going to run for President of 
the United States in order to spur on a tax reform that will save the new President money on his 
income tax. The gentle Steve Forbes waxed wroth on the point and retorted that he will have spent 
twenty times the hypothetical saving on his presidential campaign. A rather convincing point: It 
doesn't really make sense to spend $20 million in a campaign in order prospectively to diminish 
one's tax payments by about $200,000. Some will remember the character in the Hollywood movie 
whom the all-powerful, manipulative gang offered either of two alternative posts: Commissioner 
of Baseball, or President of the United States. William Powell paused, twitched his moustache, 
then said, ``Which pays more?'' 
<p>Mr. Forbes isn't playing a political part, isn't going to be 
President, but he has done an endearing thing.

<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>


<p>
<li>


Severe weather last week forced the cancellation of thousands of flights, most of them Hazel O'Leary's.


<p>
<li>


Even the arcane election laws of New York State have not prevented Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan from collecting enough petition signatures to get on the presidential primary ballot. Provided they surmount one last hurdle: the efforts of the state party machine, which backs Bob Dole, to disqualify them. New York's laws give gimlet-eyed regulars so many opportunities to challenge signatures that petitioners are advised to collect twice as many as the already extravagantly high legal requirement. Dole knows these rules well, for they were used to keep him out of the New York primary in 1988, when the Bush forces ran the state GOP. But this is playground justice, not justice. New York Republicans should be able to vote their preference. And wouldn't it be fun to watch Forbes and Buchanan returning each other's serves in a New York match-up? (Dole could take the role of the net.)


<p>
<li>


After a few weeks of ``crisis'' and media interviews of whining federal workers suffering speakably on paid leave, someone started the whole thing up again, and the next thing you know, you get your Form 1040 in the mail.



<p>
<li>

Just as Nixon has Oliver Stone, so Pat Buchanan, Nixon's old speechwriter, has Charles Lane, whose profile of Mr. Buchanan (``Daddy's Boy'') ornaments a recent issue of The New Republic. Lane finds the source of Buchanan's pathologies in his twisted family roots: Catholic dad, Franco-lover, walloped his kids, etc., etc. As it happens, the worst that can be said about Buchanan's brawling youth was said by Buchanan himself, with candor and charm, in his memoir, Right from the Beginning. So Lane has to reach further, exhuming old quarrels with neighbors and trotting out that classic of politics masquerading as science, Theodor Adorno's The Authoritarian Personality. In the authoritarian personality, Lane quotes, ``there is no place for ambivalence or ambiguities.'' That's Pat! But then, five pages later, when Lane asks Buchanan about some of the liberal policies he had to swallow working for the Nixon White House, such as the opening to China, Buchanan says, ``You know, I'm ambivalent about that.'' Lane doesn't take the hint (he lacks Stone's empathy) but maybe there are sparks of goodness in Buchanan after all.

<p>
<li>



The White House announced that President Clinton was considering putting himself out of work for the shutdown and taking no pay, to show his sympathy for furloughed federal workers. Then some whiz must have noticed that this would have put the President in the ``non-essential worker'' category. The story quickly and quietly disappeared.



<p>
<li>

Perhaps Bill Clinton is running for re-election because he must, says Mark R. Levin of Landmark Legal Foundation. Levin reminds us that Mr. Clinton is the first President to claim attorney - client privilege, which he did in hopes of preventing congressional investigators from learning about his Whitewater activities. He is the first President to assert executive privilege against himself, which occurred when his own deputy attorney general was stopped by his own White House counsel from examining the late Vincent Foster's files. He is the first President to receive legal aid from the taxpayers by using government lawyers for his personal legal matters, a practice previous Presidents considered unlawful. And Mr. Clinton is the only President to demand absolute immunity from all civil lawsuits -- even where the suit involves matters alleged to have occurred prior to his election to the Presidency -- which is intended to prevent a trial on charges that he sexually molested a former Arkansas state employee. If Clinton loses the Presidency, he may actually have to account for his personal behavior.



<p>
<li>

Our friend Bill Kristol, after talking up Newt Gingrich and Colin Powell as presidential candidates, has recently been seen dallying with Lamar Alexander. With a record like that, if Bob Dole does get elected, Kristol will be forced to move to Bermuda come January 1997. On the other hand, if Dole caves in to Clinton on the budget again, Mr. Kristol will quickly be joined by members of the late Republican majority in Congress.


<p>
<li>


When Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich created the Kemp Commission on tax reform, it was widely viewed as a stalking horse for a Dole tax plan. In the end, however, the commission shied away from devising a detailed plan of its own, preferring to outline general principles for tax reform with which all the advocates of competing flat-tax and sales-tax plans could agree. The most important of these was that the ``progressive'' structure of multiple rates be scrapped in favor of a single low rate. The task for Republicans now is not to design an ideal tax system from scratch, but to improve the tax system in a politically achievable way. (The commission has already suggested that the charitable deduction and mortgage-interest deduction may have to stay.) We would urge that long-term political consequences also be kept in mind. Tax reform should not raise taxes on any large class of taxpayers; so tax reform must incorporate a major tax cut. Reform should not make taxes less visible and thus easier to raise -- a substantial defect of some current proposals. And conservatives should be leery of taking millions of Americans off the income-tax rolls, as both the Armey and Forbes plans do, lest citizens come to believe that they can enjoy Big Government for free.

The new 1040s have been mailed, yet there are still 97,000 people who haven't received a refund check for last year's IRS overcharges.

Some time ago, North Miami passed a law, upheld by a Florida state court, disallowing applications for city jobs  from anyone who had smoked in the past year. A 52-year-old typist, Arlene Kurtz, challenged the ruling, but the Supreme Court has now declared that it was rational for North Miami to discriminate against her, because smokers get sick more often than non-smokers. Logically, this clears the way for all kinds of ``rational'' discrimination: against gays, because they suffer disproportionately from AIDS; against skiers, because they break their legs more often than non-skiers; against lovers of junk food, because a healthier diet would make them less vulnerable to heart disease; and so on. Of course, the New Class has no ideological interest in attacking skiers and it takes a decidedly protective interest in gays. Smokers, on the other hand, and everyone else who enjoys bodily pleasures deemed medically inadvisable, are very much in the sights of our betters. It's time for Congress to step in. They live pretty carelessly, and what's bad enough for them should be bad enough for the rest of us.

Sam Zhadanov, a 60-year-old inventor and engineer, is serving a five-year sentence in federal prison for making little plastic bottles. His customers told him the containers were for perfume samples. The government said they were crack vials. Feeling he had done nothing wrong, Zhadanov originally insisted on a trial. But under pressure from prosecutors, who threatened to arrest his wife, and on the advice of his attorney, he pleaded guilty. In addition to the prison sentence, Zhadanov has lost almost all of his property to forfeiture. He had never been in trouble with the law before. Yet he was punished more severely than anyone else in the case, including the distributors who hired him to make the bottles and the retailers who sold them to the ultimate users. Although the government said the retail buyers were crack dealers, none of them were arrested, and none of the defendants ever saw any drugs, let alone sold them. Furthermore, in a 1992 case involving crack vials, the courts found that containers did not fall within the federal definition of drug paraphernalia. Zhadanov, who has been in Allenwood Federal Prison Camp for a year, plans a hunger strike on January 18 to call attention to the abuses committed in the name of the war on drugs. ``For much of my life I endured the oppression of the former Soviet Union. Now I am reliving that experience in my new home, where I came in search of justice and liberty.''

Chap in Fort Worth walked into a bank next door to a police station, waited patiently in line wearing a ski mask, ordered the teller to fill a bag with money, politely told her to have a nice day, walked out, and was arrested instantly.

The great environmental scare of the 1980s was acid rain threatening forests with epidemics of dieback. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Canadian forestry agency looked into the causes of forest dieback, and the results are just coming in. Records of the health of maple and birch forests going back a hundred years show no evidence of increased dieback: ``in fact the successive peak levels [of dieback] decreased slightly over the three most recent episodes.'' The research cites no role for acid rain, and explains episodes of dieback as owing to ``overmaturity'' (scientific jargon, we assume, for ``old age'') and late frosts, which can weaken trees. We expect the EPA to say that the electric companies can scrap all those expensive electrostatic precipitators they were forced to install on their smokestacks to reduce sulphur-dioxide emissions. And to announce that electric bills will drop 20 per cent.

Rich and Spoiler
<p>
Steve Forbes's optimistic message
is resonating with voters. But does
Forbes really have a chance?
<p>
RICH LOWRY
<p>
Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter.
<p>


<p>STEVE Forbes's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, volunteers an answer to a question a reporter asks of his candidate: What has Forbes learned about campaigning since launching his long-shot presidential bid? ``That at least you're pretty good at it,'' says Dal Col, smiling, glancing admiringly at his boss. Forbes, making a late-December campaign swing through Iowa, is tucked into the back of a chartered jet in awkward proximity with two reporters and two members of his campaign staff, trying to steal glances at the day's Wall Street Journal. He laughs at the boastful comment with an almost boyish embarrassment, then gestures Dal Col's way with a typically laconic rejoinder: ``Spinmeister, here.''
<p>If the cliche of 1990s politics is that ``anything can happen,'' this is anything: a diffident multi-millionaire magazine publisher with no elective experience, no knack for small-talk or back-slapping, seemingly no traditional political skills at all, rocking the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Thanks to a TV advertising blitz that has already cost an estimated $12 million and made him a minor celebrity among blue-haired old ladies in places like Sioux City, Iowa, Forbes is running second in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire and is first, according to one recent survey, in Arizona. He may be the candidate of the ``air war,'' but Forbes threatens to cause major disruption on the ground -- for the candidates still looking to get a clean shot at Bob Dole, and even for the front-runner himself.
<p>The Forbes campaign is 1980s supply-side faith given a 1990s torque. Its roots are in the collapse of the supply-side message within a GOP that has made Ross Perot's obsession with the deficit its own; in the slow political deterioration of supply-side champion Jack Kemp, who has failed to stay at the cutting edge of the party; and in the search of supply-side guru Jude Wanniski, among others, for a presidential candidate to fill the resulting message and leadership vacuums. But the campaign also owes a debt to Perot populism -- in its anti-Washington, pro-term-limit rhetoric -- and, oddly enough, to the hard-ball political tactics of Sen. Jesse Helms. So, at the same time Forbes runs on Reagan optimism, he flirts with an opportunistic, ``outsider'' populism at odds with the idea-driven rationale for his candidacy.
<p>Steve Forbes, of course, enjoys a head-start in name ID. His grandfather, B. C. Forbes, began Forbes magazine in 1917 as a feisty chronicle of the ``doers and doings'' of American business. When his son Malcolm took over in 1964, he embarked on a frenetic campaign of promotion of the magazine -- as a ``capitalist tool'' -- and of himself that swelled the magazine's circulation and profit margins. By the 1970s, Malcolm was the world-conquering capitalist, famous for his collection of Faberge eggs, his motorcycling, and extravagant parties. Steve joined the magazine shortly after graduation from Princeton. He started as a reporter, worked his way up through the ranks and already had a large hand in running Forbes by the time of his father's death in 1990. 
<p>Steve's first full-contact political experience was as chairman of the Board of International Broadcasting, which oversaw Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, in the Reagan and Bush Administrations. By all accounts he was an able BIB chairman, engaged on the substantive questions before him and tenacious in protecting the interests of the ``radios'' on Capitol Hill. In 1993, along with then - Wall Street economist Larry Kudlow, Forbes developed the 30 per cent, across-the-board tax cut proposal that became the centerpiece of his friend Christy Todd Whitman's successful New Jersey gubernatorial campaign. Around the same time, Forbes became chairman of the board of the listless Jack Kemp/Bill Bennett organization, Empower America.
<p>Part of Empower's trouble was that it was perceived as a mere holding pen for Kemp until he ran in 1996. As 1995 progressed, it became clear that Kemp  wouldn't be running, and supply-siders began looking for another horse to back. Jude Wanniski, the brilliant if eccentric supply-side guru, had been engaged in an unlikely dalliance with Bob Dole that he abruptly cut off in early March. Within days he was faxing Forbes (one of a number of Wanniski's unlikely presidential possibilities, including first-term Utah Senator Bob Bennett) a several-thousand-word memo on why he should run. ``Several hours later,'' recalls Wanniski, ``the phone rang and it was Steve. And he said, 'Wow, this memo knocked me out.''' Forbes would soon decide that there was a growth, supply-side vacuum in the race, and that he was the man to fill it.
<p>
<p>The shy Forbes appears the unlikeliest of politicians. At a late-December meet-and-greet at a restaurant in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Forbes stood away from the doors, his hands awkwardly at his sides, as dozens of locals filed in for a chicken sandwich and stump speech. With those voters who ventured over to him he shook hands in his distinctive style -- arm out stiffly, head bowed as if he's looking at his interlocutor's Adam's apple. Standing three feet from him its impossible to hear Forbes's words, he's so soft-spoken, except for the occasional, ``Oh, goodness!'' But he laughs often, tucking in his chin like a Citadel cadet, grinning wide with all his teeth. With his thick eyeglasses and soft manner, the impression is of Clark Kent, pulled from his desk at the Daily Planet, forced to do public relations.
<p>The Forbes stump speech can be just as awkward. He delivers it from memory, but in the same halting cadences as if it were being read. Despite it all, Forbes elicits warm reactions from crowds, who not only like his themes but take a shine to his naked genuineness. The speech has almost no applause lines except his prescription for the current tax code: ``Scrap it, kill it, drive a stake through its heart, bury it, and hope it never rises again.'' But at a restaurant in Sioux City, jammed with two hundred Iowans one recent Friday night, people clapped almost every time Forbes stopped to take a breath, even after he called for a radical overhaul of Social Security.
<p>The key to the Forbes campaign is that it has a split personality; the good-willed awkwardness of Forbes the person is combined with the relentless ferocity of Forbes the campaign ad. Free from the state-by-state spending restraints that limit other candidates, Forbes has blanketed Iowa, Arizona, and New Hampshire with his spots. Some are biographical, others pegged to the flat tax, still others ruthlessly critical of his opponents, especially Bob Dole. One attacked Dole for delaying a term-limits vote in the Senate, neglecting to mention that Dole did so at the behest of term-limits supporters. A shameless cheap shot. The latest are cut from the same cloth, hitting Dole for supporting the construction of the Senate subway and funding for an Idaho ski project -- minutiae pulled from larger bills with no particular connection to Dole.
<p>The ads are almost certainly the fruit of Forbes's early decision to make a battle-tested group of North Carolina operatives, instead of Jude Wanniski, central to his campaign. Explains one insider: ``Jude basically tried to bring in John Sears to resurrect the old Reagan campaign of '79 and early '80, this time with Jude as the Svengali of policy. And Forbes wouldn't have any of it -- thankfully.'' Forbes turned instead to the tag team that ran Jesse Helms's campaigns until a bitter recent split with the senator, Carter Wrenn (who is on the Forbes payroll) and Tom Ellis (who is an informal ``kibitzer''). The hallmark of the two are media-intense, hard-hitting, through-the-roof-expensive campaigns.  In the deep-pocketed Forbes, says one North Carolina insider, ``they got the dream candidate.''
<p>The chief issue they will help Forbes sell is, of course, the flat tax. Under his plan, personal exemptions would keep a family of four that makes up to $36,000 a year from paying any taxes at all. All income after that would be taxed at a 17 per cent rate. There would be no deductions and no tax on interest, dividends, or capital gains -- just on labor income. The benefits from rationalizing the system, reducing marginal rates, and eliminating the double taxation of savings and investment would be considerable. And, sure enough, part of the Forbes sales pitch is pure Jack Kemp optimism, a paean to economic forces unleashed. But Forbes also talks, like Pat Buchanan, of families sweating it out on the ``treadmill.'' And there are whiffs of another flat-taxer, maverick Democrat Jerry Brown, in his attacks on the current code as ``the principal source of political corruption in Washington.''
<p>It makes for a potent mix. But, upon closer examination, the politics get trickier. The dirty secret of the flat tax is that it threatens to raise taxes on the middle class, drop lower-income people off the rolls, lower the tax burden on upper-income taxpayers, and exclude capital income, disproportionately enjoyed by the rich, from taxation entirely and someone, i.e., the middle class, will have to pick up the slack (and give up their home-mortgage deductions to boot). It's a deadly political shortcoming. Forbes tries to avoid it by promising a flat tax that is a tax cut. His 17 per cent rate would, by his campaign's estimate, lose $40 billion its first year (by some estimates it would lose as much $200 billion). Forbes dismisses these figures because he argues that lower tax rates will lead to greater growth and, hence, more revenues.
<p>But again politics intrude. After a grueling year-long fight, are Republicans really ready to say all their Congressional Budget Office economic assumptions are irrelevant and the ``glide-path'' to the balanced budget of secondary importance? Perhaps they should be. But the deficit has become a crucial political proxy for shrinking the size of government. Without it, making the case for getting ``savings'' from entitlement programs like Medicare or paring back discretionary spending becomes that much more difficult. Forbes gives no indication of having the stomach for the fight. On the stump he offers up one specific agency for total elimination: the Federal Communications Commission. Forbes exudes the naive 1980s supply-side faith that it's not the size of government per se but marginal tax rates that pose the biggest threat to the economy and to the culture. 
<p>Indeed, for Forbes the flat tax is more than an economic elixir. It stands in for most of the rest of his policy. ``Contrary to what some people would have you believe,'' he says on the stump, ``in America there really is no difference between values and economics. They are one and the same.'' Forbes then evokes thrift, hard work, trust, etc. -- and within limits he has a point. But it's not always clear he knows the limits. In his announcement speech Forbes promised that the flat tax and his other economic idee fixe, the gold standard, would lead to ``a renaissance the like of which has never been seen before. Families would step off the tax treadmill; wage earners could relax a little, save more easily; parents would have more time to spend with their children and each other; they would have more time to devote to where it belongs -- to the home and hearth, where all true value lies.''
<p>For this vision, ``optimistic'' is not the word. It is tinged with a kind of economic determinism and a faith in human nature that offends against the deepest wellsprings of traditional conservatism. In the world of Steve Forbes, entrepreneurs busily advance their ambitions in a kind of perfect social harmony, responding to the positive incentives of a free economy. Harold Johnson of the Orange County Register refers to it as ``possibility thinking,'' the sunniness popularized by Californians like Kemp and supply-side pioneer Arthur Laffer. Traditionally conservatism takes a darker view of the human potential for vice and folly, and prescribes a certain amount of negative incentive, whether through social ostracism or the force of law, to keep it in check. It is this element that is missing from the Forbes world-view and is reflected, on the concrete level, in his unease with parts of the Republican social agenda.
<p>Take abortion. On Roe v. Wade -- bad law, whatever you think of abortion -- Forbes takes the essentially pro-choice dodge that it can't be overturned absent a shift in public opinion. Pro-lifers in his camp hold out hope of moving him rightward on the issue; he recently denounced partial-birth abortion in his ``Fact and Comment'' column in Forbes  and characterizes his position as ``not pro-choice.'' But as of now his position limits his appeal among the social-conservative base of the GOP necessary for any serious challenge to Dole.
<p>The other social issues present a similar problem. The social agenda provides the ``wedge issues'' -- crime, welfare,  immigration -- that allow conservative candidates to appeal to Reagan Democrats. Forbes clearly isn't comfortable talking about them. On immigration, he parts ways with an employee, Forbes senior editor and immigration restrictionist Peter Brimelow. ``I prefer Julian Simon on that issue,'' says Forbes. He has warned of the more hard-edged GOP welfare proposals that ``The American people will not tolerate cutting off benefits for children.'' Forbes tries to make up for his soft social edge with anti-Washington rhetoric; instead of talking about welfare, he runs ads on the Senate subway.
<p>And he has had some success with this tack. Rather than picking up the traditional pro-growth voters (wealthier, better educated), Forbes, according to New Hampshire surveys by the Polling Company, is making inroads among men making less than $40,000 a year and independent voters. The populist appeal of the flat tax and his anti-Washington rhetoric, as well as his indisputable status as an ``outsider,'' account for this seeming anomaly. Meanwhile, in lower taxes and economic growth, Forbes has picked up on an appealing theme inexplicably dropped by the other candidates. All this combined with piles of money -- at least $25 million -- makes the campaign's strategy plausible, if not likely. The idea is to finish respectably in Iowa and New Hampshire, then become a real contender by knocking Dole off somewhere else, perhaps the early primary state of Arizona, where Forbes is spending a mint.
<p>An alternative scenario is not so happy. Forbes is vulnerable to just the sort of cheap populist attacks he himself has been launching. (If the Forbes campaign thinks the Senate subway makes a good image for extravagance, it should just wait till some opponent latches onto the Highlander or Capitalist Tool.) Some of Forbes's advantage dissipates as soon as it becomes clear that the other candidates have already endorsed the principles (if not every politically unpalatable detail) of the flat tax. And Forbes's late jump in organizing will inevitably hurt when it comes time to turn out actual voters, especially in the Iowa caucuses.
<p>All these obstacles suggest that the upper limit for Forbes may be the role of spoiler. He splits the conservative vote three ways with Gramm and Buchanan, and blocks Alexander's emergence as an ``outsider'' alternative to Dole, while perhaps never quite becoming viable himself. Jude Wanniski, always the supply-side optimist, once wrote that ``Insofar elections are honestly conducted, they always turn out right.'' His candidate is about to sorely test the theory.

Rusty
<p>
I understand that you're angry. You have every reason to be. You know and I know that your work down in the Amazonian rainforest is important.
<p>But you have to understand that while I certainly don't consider you ``non-essential,'' the Federal Government does. And, if I may say so, you've got it pretty easy down there; the furloughed non-essential federal employees who live up here can't pay for their groceries with a carton of cigarettes and a Penthouse
magazine.
<p>I'm trying to be sympathetic here, but, as my dad would say, ``Put a little gratitude in that attitude.'' Be thankful that when I re-invented government, I didn't re-invent it so much that we got rid of 350,000 ``non-essential''
personnel.
<p>And, it isn't our fault that those people aren't working. It's the Republicans who keep erecting roadblocks. I mean, we've agreed to balance the budget in seven years.
And we've agreed to cut Medicare. And we've agreed to a per-child rebate. But they keep pushing for a balanced budget in seven years, and Medicare cuts, and a per-child rebate. And so the impasse continues.
<p>And in the third place -- and this is strictly between us -- I mean, let's be honest: most of those federal employees make an average annual salary of $41,500, which by OMB standards, puts them squarely in the category of the ``super mega rich,'' and so in many ways, I say to them what my dad said to me when I complained about the food in Eliot House: ``Cry me a river.''
<p>And in the fourth place, the ``super mega rich'' are all that the Republicans care about, giving them huge tax cuts and corporate handouts. So the ``super mega rich'' and ``non-essential'' federal employees should blame the Republicans for this gridlock, not us, because we care about them, and the Republicans only care about . . .
<p>Wait a sec. I'm getting lost here. Let me check my notes.
<p>Okay. Got it. Back on trac.
<p>Dick Morris has provided all of us with a laminated three-by-five card -- just like Reagan used -- that keeps a lot of these issues straight. Tipper quizzes me on it while driving me to the Brinkley show. It's a pretty clear card:
<p>We're totally against the Republican tax cuts for the rich. But that doesn't mean that we don't think that we raised taxes too much on the rich. It just means that we're totally against the Republican tax cuts for the rich.
<p>And we are absolutely not going to cut welfare. But we are going to end it as we know it. But we are not going to cut it.
<p>And we are going to balance the budget in seven years. But a balanced budget isn't that important. And anyway, we've already balanced it.
<p>Any question?
<p>The only thing that concerns me is that I'm not sure this message will carry us through November. I keep pushing for a ``They'll warm the globe; we'll warm your heart'' type of slogan, but Dick is pretty adamant that we stay ``on message.''
<p>``Dick,'' I asked him the other day, ``are you at all concerned that running against Congress might backfire? Sure, we're ahead in the polls now, but so was Jimmy Carter at this point in 1976 -- and, for that matter, George Bush in 1992. But at some point, we're going to have a budget deal, and people are going to forget about the impasse.''
<p>``That's an awkward question, Mr. Vice President. The short answer to your question is, 'Hey, I've got you guys to about 54% approval, Bob Dole is most probably going to be your opponent -- I mean, what more do you want?' The longer answer to your question is, 'Yes, you've made some interesting points, and I'm sure that when he takes over, Jim Carville will fine-tune the message to a more, shall we say, left-wing frequency.' Rest assured, though, I will never be more than a phone call away.''
<p>For some reason, Rusty, that didn't reassure me. 
<p>I spent a few minutes collecting my thoughts. Then I popped into the Cabinet Room. Bill, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, and an assortment of others were embroiled in negotiations. Bill had just conceded a capital-gains tax cut.
<p>``Am I hearing you right, Mr. President?'' Speaker Gingrich asked. ``You're now in favor of a capital-gains tax cut?''
<p>``Absolutely,'' Bill said.
<p>``Well, this is good news,'' Gingrich added
<p>.Bill smiled. ``Just as long as it doesn't involve a capital-gains tax cut.''
<p>``Um . . . '' Gingrich said
<p>.Bill folded up his laminated card, looked up and caught my eye, and gave me a big ``thumbs up.''
<p>Here's hoping you get back to your non-essential work soon, Rusty.

<h2>On the Right</h2>

<P>


 Wm. F. Buckley Jr.
<p>
Who Is to Blame?
<p>
NEW YORK, DECEMBER 19
<p>
<p>On the program 60 Minutes, a half-dozen retiring legislators submitted to friendly interrogation inquiring into the reason for their decision to give it all up, go home. Most of their complaints we are familiar with. Unquestionably the most searing is the business about money: Senator Alan Simpson reported that a senator has to raise a minimum of $10,000 every week, which is a heavy load. When you consider 10 thou times 52 times 6 that adds up to over $3 million -- which is only one-third of what retiring Senator Paul Simon had to spend to get back into the Senate. 
<p>Is that situation inherently corrupt? Not a bad question. One senator put it this way. He gets back to his hotel at 10 P.M. after a hard day of electioneering and he has twenty telephone messages, all of them from strangers. But one name he does recognize, because that goodbody had donated $1,000 to the senator's campaign. The senator has the energy left, at that time of night -- after such a day -- to make one phone call, so whom does he call? Right. And even if it happened that the caller's message was, Please vote in favor of Measure X, and the senator goes out and votes against Measure X, it still remains that the only person who got through to him was a Measure X enthusiast, and enthusiasms have a way of communicating themselves, not least when fueled with thousand-dollar bills. Is there a way to stop all that? No, not under our system. It could be changed only by going to a parliamentary system on the British model.
<p>But a less conventional complaint of some of the retiring gentlemen had to do with the under-celebrated art of compromise. People just don't understand, one man put it, that politics is -- you guessed it, the art of compromise. The gentlemen being interviewed were too polite to say it in exactly as many words, but what they were criticizing was the Gingrich House. To use bald figures, one had the impression that if Gingrich would simply give up on tax reform, he'd get substantially what he wanted in the way of tax reform. 
<p>And of course compromise is the civilized approach to most controversies, but the operative word in that sentence is ``most.'' And the entrenched mood of the congressmen who do not wish to compromise with Mr. Clinton is reinforced by the rhetoric used by Mr. Clinton and his satellites. It could be that your call to reduce medical expenses by $270 billion in seven years could be adulterated a little, say to $250 billion in eight years, that kind of thing -- do it, take a deep breath, and sigh resignedly over the rough nature of democratic compromise. 
<p>But to engender receptivity for the compromise mode requires rhetorical adaptation at the other end, and this President Clinton is ostentatiously declining to do. He speaks instead of Republicans wishing to cut medical services for the aged and the indigent, using words appropriate to a situation in which Congress was planning to sequester a million people every year in a huge federal compound and let them die there of starvation and exposure. Slowly. 
<p>Even the most dogged defenders of state welfarism here and there break under the strain. The New Republic's editorialist, remarking on the success Mr. Clinton is having with his phony scare tactics, lays the final blame on the voting public. ``The only people being fundamentally irresponsible in the recent -- and continuing -- budget battle are the American people. They are, to borrow a phrase from our colleague Michael Kinsley, big babies. A year ago, in a realigning election, voters ushered in a Republican Congress that had pledged, in complete candor, to balance the federal budget. In the days before that election, voters backed Republicans over Democrats by a 2.8 per cent margin. Then the Republicans made a fatal error: they tried to deliver on their promise. The result is that in the last few months, the party positions have been completely reversed. The Democrats now lead by 2.4 per cent.'' 
<p>But then whom do you blame for the people's immaturity? The editorialist suggests it is the people themselves who are to blame, for wanting one thing and authorizing another. ``Speaker Gingrich, for all his failings, is the first American politician actually to confront the public with the reality. For that, he gets an approval rating of 27 per cent.'' Any effort to bail out the American people for this act of irresponsibility would have to reason to the people's ignorance for believing what their President has been telling them, six times a day, for the past six weeks. If the voters believe Clinton is correct -- that passage of the Contract with America will result in agony and death for uncounted hundreds of thousands of Americans -- then they are right to say no to Mr. Gingrich. 
<p>And the problem becomes: What to do about demagogues in the White House? Vote them out of office? Yes, but what will inform the voters that that is the thing to do?

Jack Kemp explains that liberal Congressman Tom Campbell (R., Calif.) represents ``what Colin Powell calls the Lincoln wing of the Republican Party.'' Make that the Lincoln Continental wing, Jack.
<p>

Yes, the House Ethics Committee essentially cleared Newt Gingrich on all but one of the sixty counts of ethics complaints against him. It's also true that the one outstanding question -- whether tax-exempt foundations violated their tax status by donating to his college course -- involves an eye-glazing technicality. But Republicans are fooling themselves if they think any of this matters. The Speaker suffered a grievous blow when the Ethics Committee agreed to appoint an outside counsel to investigate that last count. Ethics Committee Chairman Nancy Johnson (R., Conn.) apparently didn't realize it, but any other result would have been preferable. In an outside counsel, Democrats get what they've always wanted, a gung-ho investigator who will push to expand his inquiry until he finds the one violation that provides the leverage for forcing Gingrich from office. In this overtly political fight, Republicans must start punching back. First, they should insist that the outside counsel be a tax lawyer rather than a prosecutor willing to become a Grand Inquisitor. Next, the GOP needs to defend the Speaker more generally. Republicans were encouraged when the exquisitely moderate Tom Campbell trounced an anti-Newt candidate in a December 12 special election. But GOP freshmen won't have Campbell's luxury of distancing themselves from the Speaker. Their reputations depend, at least partly, on resisting the Democrats' effort to decapitate the new majority through the sheer force of negative press and ethics smears. This time it's the counter-revolution that mans the guillotine. Republicans must blunt its blade.
<p>
<li>

After speaking non-stop for five hours at a news conference, Rep. Enid Waldholtz (R., Utah) faces a little-known federal charge: impersonating the President.
<p>
<li>

Rep. Ron Wyden won the Democratic nomination to run for Sen. Bob Packwood's seat in Oregon's special election, but the eight-term House veteran hasn't recovered from the humiliation of scoring 0 for 7 in a local TV station's pop quiz. Wyden couldn't find Bosnia on a globe; didn't know the price of a loaf of bread, a gallon of gas, or a gallon of milk; couldn't give the unemployment rate or largest employer in Oregon; and couldn't name Canada's prime minister. Mail-in balloting begins on January 10, and a recent poll has Republican State Sen. Gordon Smith (quiz score: 5 for 7) ahead by 5 points. Poor Wyden -- he was probably looking for Bosnia at the heart of Europe.
<p>

Move over, Engler and Weld; George Pataki has joined the club. In his latest budget New York's governor calls for a 25 per cent cut in welfare benefits, a six-month eligibility limit for able-bodied beneficiaries, and a reduction of $1 billion in the state's gold-plated Medicaid program. For the first time in over fifty years spending financed by state and local sources will decline -- if George Pataki has his way. To be sure, his program is unlikely to survive intact, and even if it did, would still leave New York with the highest per-capita state and local spending in the nation. The governor's conservatism is less an epiphany than atonement for mistakes made in his freshman year, when the largest tax cut in state history was offset by a wide array of gimmicks, most of which merely pushed costs into future years. Time may be on Pataki's side, however. After lagging the nation throughout the Cuomo years, New York State added 90,000 new jobs in the last year, catapulting from 50th to 4th in private-sector job creation. Replacing nanny with a job seems like a far more practical proposition today -- even in the nation's premier nanny state.

Hollywood will make another movie about Grumpy Old Men as soon as they finish the GOP primaries.

For all the attention the Western media have paid, the world-wide evangelical Protestant revolution, described in this issue by the distinguished sociologist David Martin, might not be happening at all. Yet as revolutions go, it seems likely to prove of at least equal significance to Islamic fundamentalism and more lasting than Marxism. Other Christians, especially Catholics, will be of two minds about its religious impact since its general tendency is to turn bad Catholics into good Protestants. Even so, its effect on the Roman Catholic and other mainline churches may be ultimately benign. As Professor Martin points out, it provides them with a sharp incentive to reform religious beliefs and practices that have become infected by either a tepid secularism or leftist politics. For the paradox of evangelical Christianity is that by stressing holiness and personal salvation above the ``social gospel,'' it turns this world upside down. It releases people from ancient forms of bondage, both practical and psychological, into hard work, self-reliance, responsibility, love of family, and equality before God. These virtues, preached pre-eminently by John Wesley, redeemed the British working class from the moral squalor of the early Industrial Revolution and, translated to politics, fueled the American Revolution (ruefully described by George III as a revolution of Presbyterians). On the wings of the English language, they are now spreading to every continent. The Western media will notice eventually -- watch for headlines like: ``The Religious Right Goes Global.''
<p>
<li>

David Rieff writes in The New Yorker that President Clinton ``has probably never before made a decision so fraught with political peril'' as to deploy troops in Bosnia. ``The stakes are enormous -- for the peace of Europe and, if American soldiers start coming home dead, for his own re-election hopes.'' For the soldiers too.
<p>

The great regulatory push to ban smoking in bars, airplanes, restaurants, and workplaces is based on studies that purport to show that non-smokers breathing in smokers' smoke are at risk. The most important study came from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which went so far as to claim that three thousand Americans were dying each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. The 1993 EPA report was subject to widespread criticism by statisticians and epidemiologists, and now the Congressional Research Service has called it junk science: ``the results are not definitive . . . even at the greatest exposure levels the measured risks are still subject to uncertainty . . . very few or even no deaths can be attributed to ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) . . .'' Senator Wendell Ford (D., Ky.) called on federal agencies to reconsider the blanket ban on smoking in public and semi-public places. Fat chance! The PC bureaucrats' rule is: Never let science get in the way of a good regulation.

Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary knows how to travel in style. On a week-long trip to South Africa, she flew in a luxury jet used by Madonna and brought along one hundred people. She has also taken expensive trips, courtesy of the taxpayers, to India, China, and Pakistan. Al Gore came to her defense: ``On these trips, she has created thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars in contracts for companies in this country.'' And that's just counting her entourage.
<p>
<li>

From the German magazine Der Spiegel: ``Gunther Burpus remained wedged in his front-door cat flap for two days because passersby thought he was a piece of installation art. Mr. Burpus, 41, of Bremen, was using the flap because he had mislaid his keys. Unfortunately, he was spotted by a group of student pranksters who removed his trousers, painted his bottom bright blue, stuck a daffodil between his buttocks, and erected a sign saying: 'Germany Resurgent. An Essay in Street Art. Please Give Generously.' Passersby assumed Mr. Burpus's screams were part of the act, and it was only when an old woman complained to the police that he was finally freed. 'I kept calling for help,' he said, 'but people just said, ``Very good, very clever!'' and threw coins at me.'''

Madonna threatens to take out ads in the Village Voice to find a suitable father for the child she wants to have. Let us make it perfectly clear: Madonna's ad will not be run in NR's classified section.

<P>

Dear Rusty,
<p>

<p>Happy Holidays from all of us at the Gore home, and let me just say, right now, things are up in the air. We've got a budget showdown looming, to be honest, and it looks like it's going to be another eye-to-eye staring contest. We were strategizing just this afternoon in the Oval Office. 
<p>``What's our strategy?'' I asked. 
<p>Dick Morris looked up from his pipe. Bill puffed away on his cigar. 
<p>``I'm not following you, Mr. Vice President,'' Dick said.
<p>``You see, Al,'' Bill chimed in, ``Dick thinks -- and I think, too, of course -- that while a budget is nice -- hey, more than nice, a budget is pretty darn useful in many ways -- it's not the be-all-and-end-all.''
<p>``I'm a little confused,'' I said.
<p>``What Dick is saying -- and I agree with him, by the way -- is that sometimes a budget is really good and really helpful by not being written. By not being settled. Do you get me?''
<p>``What the President is saying,'' Dick interjected, puffing on his pipe, ``is that a dog that doesn't bark sometimes saves the house from being robbed.'' 
<p>``So I shouldn't call my friends in the Senate and work the back channels to make a deal?''
<p>``Weeeeelllllll,'' Dick said, ``if you put a gun to my head, I'd say no.''
<p>Bill gazed at me through the thickening smoke. ``You see, Al,'' he said, ``there are deficits and there are deficits. There's the $250-billion budget deficit -- and hoo, boy, that's a big one, no one's saying it isn't -- but there's also a little thing called a 'people deficit'.''
<p>``A 'people deficit'?'' I asked.
<p>``As in, how many people we need to approve of what we're doing versus how many people actually approve of what we're doing,'' Dick said.
<p>``Oh,'' I murmured. 
<p>``And you've got to admit, Al,'' Bill said, tapping the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, ``that Dick's starting to get at least one of these deficits under control.'' 
<p>I had to admit that, Rusty. As much as I like to think that I'm governed by pure motives, once or twice I've allowed myself to think about the coming campaign -- not '96, you understand, but '00, and '04. And when I hear talk like that from Bill and Dick Morris, well, I get a little concerned. Gore '00 and Gore '04 are going to be a lot easier -- and a lot more fun -- if we can lick this budget thing right now. 
<p>So I left the meeting a little early, just as Bill wasn't returning a phone call from John Kasich. The minute I sat down behind my desk, the phone rang. It was Dad, calling from Carthage, Tennessee. 
<p>``Hi, Dad,'' I said. ``How's the weather down there?'' 
<p>``Cold, I think. Though I'm getting warmer,'' he said, shaking his highball glass next to the receiver. ``Well, all this talk about Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security has got your mother and me a little worried.''
<p>``Worried?''
<p>``You folks up there aren't planning to hang us older folks out to dry, are you?''
<p>``Of course not, Dad,'' I said, with as much emphasis as I could. 
<p>``Glad to hear it. Some of the neighbors are starting to talk -- there's a rumor around town that Medicare premiums are going to go up almost $14 in the next few years.'' 
<p>``Well, they might, Dad. You see, the system is very expensive -- '' 
<p>He interrupted me. ``I know it's expensive, son. You forget: I voted it in! I was in the Senate at the time, Mr. Smartypants, while you were in Harvard Yard, experimenting with prose forms. And we didn't vote the damn thing in so's you guys could cut it off. We voted it in for us! So let us have it!''
<p>``Dad?''
<p>``You know, you've got your Great Aunt Catherine scared to death. She thinks that you guys in Washington are going to take her Medicare and her Social Security away and leave her penniless and begging in the streets.'' 
<p>I tried to soothe him. ``Okay, Dad, I'll call her this afternoon and explain things to her.'' 
<p>``It'll have to be next month,'' Dad replied. ``She's on a Mediterranean cruise until February.'' 
<p>He hung up on me. I was too keyed up to work, so I headed back to the Oval Office. But by the time I got there, it was such a smoke-filled room that I could barely recognize Bill and Dick. 
<p>My secretary just buzzed me -- John Kasich is on line one. Excuse me while I don't take this. 
<p>Happy Holidays, Rusty!

<h2>Bread and Circuses</h2>

<P>


<p>



<p>When Members of Congress finally head home for the holidays they will have ended the busiest legislative session in the last 14 years; both houses convened during 1995 for three months more than last year. How is the show being received? Well, even without thunderous applause for the Act I Contract with America, and despite the intermission in Act II's balanced-budget act, the House Republican leadership is already scripting an encore for its exhausted troupe.
<p>Much depends on whether a deal is reached with President Clinton on the budget. If so, veteran Members and the freshman ingenues alike believe they can look forward to a more measured pace of activity next year. Congressional Republicans will be focusing on implementing the budget provisions. But 1996 being a presidential election year, they will also be timing their debates and floor votes on new issues to cause maximum discomfort for candidate Clinton. Without a budget deal, however, the arguments over Medicare, tax cuts, welfare reform, and Medicaid will remain at the center of congressional politics -- and of the presidential race. Deal or no deal, next year promises to be every bit as contentious as this year has been.
<p>But there will be no second Contract with America. As one leadership aide explains, ``It was easier last year to draw up the Contract because many Members had little interest in it.'' He points out that a second version of the Contract could never accommodate the specific interests of enough Members to win consensus support. Still, Republicans recognize the success of last year's common message and the importance of the ``promises kept'' strategy. So they plan to unveil a joint legislative agenda for their presidential nominee and congressional candidates to run on following their convention in August.
<p>San Diego is nine months away, however. What will the GOP talk about in the meantime? Senator Dole won't be sitting down with his committee chairmen until January to lay out a legislative agenda that promotes issues he views as helpful to his presidential campaign. But the House leadership has sketched out an agenda: on immigration reform, eliminating race and gender preferences, campaign-finance restrictions, an empowerment/community-renewal program for the cities, parental-rights legislation, and banking reform. As well as this fresh agenda, some old issues will be back to cause dissension in the ranks. There will be funding disputes over abortion and Title X, and House conservatives are determined (again!) to see large spending cuts imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts and Legal Services Corporation.
<p>New and old issues alike will provoke tough fights within the Republican caucus. One Hill staffer predicts that Newt Gingrich will regret not having the discipline of this year's Contract to enforce consensus. ``The Contract provided momentum that kept the caucus together, but next year Members will be looking at their individual races and the issues they care about,'' he explains. Still, GOP strategists hope that if these issues provoke some fratricide among Republicans, they can also be framed to threaten regicide at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>``This stuff scares Clinton to death,'' declares a House Judiciary Committee staffer about the bill introduced by Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) to eliminate federal race and gender preferences. As proof he points to the Administration's refusal to disclose the results of its review of preference and set-aside programs undertaken following the Supreme Court's Adarand decision holding that such programs are subject to strict scrutiny. Scared or not, however, Mr. Clinton has to fight on this issue; his liberal base will insist. He is therefore expected to begin by laying down a smokescreen of disinformation, claiming (falsely) that he too opposes quotas, and that the Republican bill weakens existing anti-discrimination laws. A donnybrook is likely. But the leadership is committed to the Canady bill and its supporters are confident they can win -- if their colleagues have the stomach for the fight.
<p>Some have ulcers. More timid Republicans, fearful that the race card will be played against them, want the new empowerment/community-renewal package (sponsored by Oklahoma's J. C. Watts and Missouri's Jim Talent) moved first. The Watts - Talent bill, designed with the help of community self-help groups, is expected to include tax and regulatory relief for inner cities, school-choice provisions, and housing reforms. Watts and Talent promote the bill on its merits, recoiling from any connection with the debate over affirmative action. GOP moderates insist they need its cover to help them do the right thing.
<p>The Republican caucus remains divided over legal immigration -- with House Majority Leader Dick Armey strongly opposed to new restrictions. The President, on the other hand, gave an instant welcome to the Jordan Commission's proposals to cut legal immigration. Apparently, he feels Jimmy Carter lost him the Arkansas governorship in 1980 by admitting the Mariel's Cuban immigrants. He doesn't intend to lose himself the White House over immigrants -- and he has already invaded Haiti to prove it.
<p>
<p>That leaves campaign-finance reform, where the impetus comes from the freshman class. Party strategists are less gung-ho, fearing its provisions will damage GOP candidates and that even raising the issue will fuel public cynicism about Congress -- now run by the Republicans. Caring little for such calculations, the freshman class plans a retreat in January to determine next year's priorities. Institutional reforms and the elimination of Cabinet agencies will be top priorities, as will the parental-rights legislation sponsored by their fellow freshman, Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
<p>Many freshmen believe they were thwarted in their attempts to advance proposals this year. They will be less compliant next year. So, God rest ye merry, gentlemen, there'll be little respite in the new year. -- KATE O'BEIRNE

The Pot War In England
<P>

NEW YORK, DECEMBER 8
<P>
<P>A friend abroad writes to ask whether the U.S. press has picked up on the November 11 editorial in The Lancet entitled ``Deglamorising cannabis.'' The answer is: No, not as far as I am aware. And indeed no-news here is very strange news because The Lancet is the pre-eminent medical publication in Britain, something like the New England Journal of Medicine. And the extraordinary last line of the editorial reads, ``Cannabis per se is not a hazard to society but driving it further underground may well be.'' 
<P>Inquiry into the story reveals that a Labour MP, Clare Short, proposed in the House of Commons recently that pot be legalized. As would have been the case if she had made the same proposal in Congress, Miss Short was all but run out of town.
<P>But one has to suppose that some of the data she cited seeped through to the British consciousness. Begin with the poll in Glasgow. It documents a quite astonishing story, namely that one-half of all students between the ages of 14 and 25 admit to smoking pot ``every day.'' Miss Short then went on to cite the experience of cannabis use in the Netherlands and in doing so bumped into another story.
<P>It is this, that for twenty years the authorities in Amsterdam have simply ignored the use of pot, which is regularly sold in four thousand coffee shops in amounts up to 30 grams per customer. Technically, the use of the drug, let alone the sale of it, is illegal, and during its most recent campaign the governing party pledged to rectify this hypocrisy and was all set to do that when it was reminded by its neighbors of something called the Schengen agreement, which introduced the border-free zone between the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, and Belgium. France threatened to annul the agreement because cannabis was flowing merrily into a country in which no drug is permitted to compete with alcohol. The Dutch have said that they must therefore crack down on pot, which would mean closing half the coffee houses, not a popular idea. 
<P>But The Lancet, reviewing the controversy kicked up by Miss Short, asks the Home Office to consider the implications of the rise in marijuana use in Great Britain. Notwithstanding its laws, consumption of pot has doubled in ten years. And The Lancet goes on, ``Perhaps the politicians' real fear was that freedom to use soft drugs would automatically progress to increased use of substances such as cocaine and heroin. If so, they must have overlooked the recent Dutch government review which pointed out that decriminalization of possession of soft drugs had not led to a rise in the use of hard drugs.'' 
<P>Even so, the government struggles on. Last year Home Secretary Michael Howard increased the maximum fine for possession of the drug from $750 to $3,750, which is rough stuff but not, of course, to be compared with going to jail for a year or ten, as we do things here. There it ``depends where you get caught,'' writes drug-reformer Mike Goodman. ``There are parts of Wales and various rural areas where you'll certainly go to court for possessing cannabis and get a fairly stiff fine. In other areas, such as London, you'd be unlikely even to get a caution.'' In London, what you usually get is ``informal disposal'' -- which means the police throw the confiscated drugs down the drain.
<P>The evidence pours in. Another Home Office survey, this time of 25-year-olds, reveals that eight out of ten men and women have taken illegal drugs and that the biggest consumers were not schoolchildren but young white males from the professional and middle classes. At the other end of the empire we read that a businessman in Vancouver is quite openly engaged in distributing cannabis seeds all over the world, is paying his taxes, and the government of British Columbia is perfectly happy to accept the wages of sin, keeping his tax money and ignoring his illegal activity. ``If the drug ever does become legal in Britain,'' writes a correspondent of The Herald (Glasgow), ``it will be because of the sheer weight of such statistics, which indicate a threefold increase in the use of pot since 1989.'' 
<P>What is striking isn't so much the difference between what is legal and what people do, as the quite calm acceptance by the medical community of the relative harmlessness of cannabis, though the point is regularly made that if the weed were legalized, its quality could be superintended. And attention continues, however gradually, to focus on the paradox. Although ``no exact figures are available,'' says the dispatch from The Herald, ``it is known the Government is spending about twice as much on policing and prosecuting drug offenders as it does on education, prevention, and rehabilitation.'' That strikes some people, including your servant, as dumb.

<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>


<p>
<li>
TV stations in New Hampshire and Iowa have started to get complaints that they keep
interrupting the Steve Forbes commercials to show programming.
<p>
<li>

All signs are that the obstructionists among President Clinton's advisors have the upper hand in
the internal debate over the budget. The idea is to stonewall the GOP's huge budget-reconciliation
bill, then pick it apart next year, making each element one plank in a scare campaign: the farm bill
in the Midwest; the Medicare reforms in Arizona, Florida, and just about everywhere else; etc.
(Think of it as their version of the Contract with America.) Republicans, meanwhile, would be
denied both any significant legislative accomplishment this year and any chance to rebut
Democratic distortions by pointing to the non-apocalyptic reality of their policies. So, it's
imperative that the GOP avoid this gridlock scenario. The chief means of doing so is by holding
the outstanding appropriations bills hostage and threatening another government shutdown come
December 15. Nervous senators -- Bob Dole is calling a second partial shutdown a ``mistake'' --
are beginning to shy away from this approach, chastened by the fallout from the mid-November
shutdown. Which obviously could have been handled better (may Newt Gingrich never exit from
the front door of a plane again). But, even so, once the November shutdown became focused on a
seven-year balanced budget, the White House's nightly tracking polls crashed and congressional
Democrats began to peel off. Clinton has no stomach for doing publicly what he wants in his
heart: to keep the red ink flowing. In the coming weeks, then, Republicans must drag him out in
the open, be flexible on the spending details (giving a little on Americorps, Medicare, and so on),
but refuse to accept ``no'' for an answer. Actually achieving a balanced budget is indispensable
political cover. As in 1990, when the Bush Administration headed for Andrews Air Force base,
the Republican future hangs in the balance. Blink -- and you're dead.


<p><li>
Whatever President Clinton's rhetoric about ``mending'' affirmative action, his Administration's
real commitment is to expanding it. One of the most telling pieces of evidence has been its
conduct in a Piscataway, New Jersey, case involving the use of race as a factor in employment
decisions. The Justice Department had sided with a fired white teacher, Sharon Taxman, during
the Bush Administration. But soon after Deval Patrick became chief of its Civil Rights Division in
1994, the department switched sides -- in the middle of an appeal. This astonishing breach of legal
ethics proved too much for a three-judge panel, by no means composed of conservatives, which
threw the Justice Department out of court late last month. Yet the theoretical revolution here is
even more sinister: for the first time, a branch of the Federal Government is advocating racial
discrimination not to remedy past discrimination, but to promote ``diversity.'' Which is perilously
close to advocating racial discrimination -- the ``right'' kind, of course -- for its own sake. So far,
no court has accepted this rationale for racial preferences. But the President has at least another
year to make judicial appointments. To squelch the social revolution Mr. Patrick desires, voters
will have to throw him out of office as well as out of court.


<p><li>
President Clinton says his Bosnia policy comes with a one-year guarantee. But would you buy a
used civil war from this man?
<p><li>


The ``energy crisis'' that the federal 55-mile-per-hour speed limit was meant to alleviate ended
long ago. Since liberals cannot bear to see any regulation die, they opposed repeal anyway,
warning of carnage on the roads. (If ``saving lives'' were a dispositive argument for the current
speed limit, it would be an even better argument for lowering it to 45 mph.) Now that President
Clinton has grudgingly signed the bill, drivers will still be able to reap most of the safety
advantages of the old laws by driving slowly if they wish to. The added danger from others'
driving faster is too negligible to be taken seriously. If liberals were really concerned about
highway fatalities, they would urge consumers to buy bigger cars -- currently discouraged by
government fuel-efficiency standards.


<p><li>
The U.S. Postal Service has decided what to do about terrible customer-satisfaction ratings. It
will no longer publish them.

<p>
<li>
Poof! In a keystroke Robert Rubin turned the Civil Service retirement fund into old-fashioned
IOUs. Since the latter are not subject to the debt limit, D-Day (as in default) was pushed back
until December 28. We don't recommend the practice. Not only are further trust-fund raids illegal
(Rubin's own lawyers attest to this), but they would increase future federal liabilities, thereby
making a balanced budget that much more difficult. There's a better way. Why not sell all those
assets that the government has no business holding under any fiscal situation? Mortgages and
other loans held by Uncle Sam are worth $203 billion, according to the budget. Government lands
with their mineral rights are worth $577 billion; even environmentalists acknowledge their
despoliation under Washington's management. Selling off gold, foreign exchange, and other assets
held by the Treasury and Federal Reserve would raise about $205 billion, and move us toward the
privatized money supply long advocated by libertarians. Liquidating all non-defense assets could
keep the government afloat for five and a half years, according to the Joint Economic Committee.
Unfortunately, it would take years just to plan such a sell-off. Maybe in the Gingrich
Administration . . .


<p><li>
President Clinton ventured a new core belief that ``Bosnia lies at the very heart of Europe.''
Publishers of maps, atlases, gazetteers, geography texts, and derivative material, kindly make the
necessary revisions.


<p><li>
Peter Rodman's revelation (p. 23) of secret Clinton assurances to Yeltsin that NATO expansion
would be delayed indefinitely was given wide advance circulation by NR among Capitol Hill
denizens, diplomats, and journalists. George Will asked Warren Christopher about it on the
December 3 Brinkley show -- only to be told it was ``absolute nonsense.'' Mr. Christopher denied
any such ``arrangement'' and promised that the NATO Allies were ``on a steady course'' on the
enlargement issue. The term ``arrangement'' was of course a straw man, and the NATO Allies are
in fact on a ``steady course'' to nowhere: the only schedule they have is a schedule of infinite
evasions. Mr. Rodman's sources are authoritative witnesses, on both the Russian and the
American side, to the summit conversation at Hyde Park and also to lower-level exchanges. The
Secretary's stonewall is unbecoming. Speaker Gingrich is including a query about the matter in a
formal letter to the President. We expect a more judicious -- and candid -- reply.
n To you skeptics, we say: A nation that can bring lasting peace to Somalia can bring lasting
peace to Bosnia.

<p><li>

Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, has been chosen as NATO's new secretary general to
replace the departed and discredited Willy Claes. Solana, however, is a Socialist who opposed
Spain's entry into the Alliance in the early 1980s, who has no experience in security matters, and
who represents a country that is not a member of NATO's integrated military command. Six GOP
senators, led by Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have rightly protested the choice. But the
Administration, having clung to Claes well past his sell-by date, and having vetoed the staunchly
pro-American Ruud Lubbers (apparently he wasn't sound on Bosnia), was finally satisfied with
Solana. He's Clinton's kind of guy.


<p><li>
The White House spin is that we are sending ``peacekeepers'' to Bosnia. Presumably that means
that the army, navy, and air force will get to stay home. We'll see. We never quite trust the White
House in these matters.

<p>
<li>
A poll conducted by Frank Luntz uncovers some interesting moral differences between liberals
and conservatives. More liberals ``admit to having taken a hotel towel'' (46 to 37 per cent). They
are less likely to fly a flag outside their home, but far more likely to sleep around, and more likely
to be convinced (61 per cent, to 57 for conservatives) that they are better than their fellow man.
Since all these self-estimates but the last are true, they also rate high in honesty.


<p><li>
Over the past twenty years, the CIA and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) have spent $20
million on psychics, asking them to look into issues of national concern, and we still don't know
what the President's core beliefs are.

<p>
Dear Rusty
<p>
<br>What can I say? We're on a roll!
<br>Peace in Bosnia! Can you believe it? I had a little trouble with the complexities of the
agreement, to be honest. I gave Dick Holbrooke a buzz and said, ``Hey, Dick, when you get a
sec, I'd like to have a quick debrief on the peace talks.''
<br>``Absolutely, Mr. Vice President,'' he said. ``How's mid-morning coffee on February 11th
strike you?''
<br>``Um, to be honest, Dick, I was hoping for something sooner.''
<br>``Sooner?''
<br>``As in today, tomorrow, that sort of thing.''
<br>``Can I be totally honest with you, Mr. Vice President? Personally, I would love to sit down
and chew over the peace plan with you. But my schedule is an absolute bear. I mean, I've got a
profile slash interview thing to sit for -- it'll be in either the Times or the Sunday magazine, we're
still going back and forth on that. Then Walter Isaacson's got some nutty idea about 'Man of the
Year' stuff, silly, I know, but there it is. Then I've got my book to do -- ''
<br>``You've got a book, too?'' I asked. I'm always interested in talking to other authors.
<br>``A couple, actually. I'm almost done with my memoirs, The Peacemaker Finds His Stillness,
then I've got a kind of monograph coming out next year, America in 2000: The Holbrooke
Envisioning -- so as you can see, if I could squeeze you in I'd do it but I just can't.''
<br>``Well,'' I said, ``if you can't, you can't.''
<br>``How about a quick nutshell? It'll have to do because I've got Gail Sheehy here and I'm in
the middle of explaining to her why she's nuts to think that I should be Secretary of State --
though let's be honest, Chris is looking tired and old and rode-hard-and-put-away-wet, and he's
seventy years old, and do we need new blood at State? Darn right we do! -- but it's not like I have
the time, you know?''
<br>``It doesn't sound like it.''
<br>``But could my arm be twisted? Could I be persuaded? I can answer that in the affirmative.''
<br>``Ummm . . .'' I mumbled. I was beginning to get confused. 
<br>``Okay. Bosnia in a nutshell. Got a pencil?''
I grabbed a pencil and a sheet of paper.
<br>``Okay. The situation before Dayton: the Serbs, Milosevic of the Serbian Republic, and
Karadzic and Mladic of the Bosnian Serbs -- ''
<br>``You just lost me,'' I said.
<br>``Let me put it very, very simply: We were in Dayton for three weeks. The first two and half,
we mostly bickered, while the various delegations gorged on Domino's and freaked out over the
high-quality toilet paper we've got in America. Then, in the final days, we brokered a deal.''
<br>``Which was?''
<br>``Well, I thought to myself, 'Okay, pretend you're a Serb leader. You've been killing and
maiming and raping for 44 months, waging a campaign of massacre and genocide, perpetrating
some of the most unspeakable acts of violence and inhumanity since the Third Reich, for what?'
And I answered myself, 'For more land, for more territory.'''
<br>``Once you found out that Serb aggression and their various war crimes were designed to
increase their territory, what did you do?''
<br>``What do you think we did? We gave it to them! C'mon, Mr. Vice President, meet me
halfway here!''
<br>``So the Serbs get away with it? They get what they want? No punishment for their crimes?''
<br>``Hey, I don't know what you call 21 days in a Marriott Suites in Dayton, Ohio, but I sure as
heck don't call it nothing!''
This didn't sound so good to me. ``But aren't we just, I don't know, appeasing them?''
<br>``Mr. Vice President, this is what they taught me at the Kennedy School. What can I tell
you?''
<br>``Well, I guess then it's okay,'' I said.
<br>``Can I go now?'' he asked. ``I've got to call the Times and the Post and issue a strongly
worded statement in support of Warren Christopher, denying that I have any interest at all in the
office of Secretary of State.''
<br>``I do have one quick question. What about Haiti? The word is President Aristide wants
another term in office.''
<br>``Let him have it. You want a second term. So does he.''
<br>``Good point,'' I said. It was, too.
<br>``And bear in mind, Mr. Vice President,'' he said, ``that if you're successful in 1996, Warren
Christopher will be almost eighty years old. And the world, Mr. Vice President, the world is
young. And now I really have to go.''
And he hung up. He's an amazing guy, Rusty. I can't wait 'til he turns his attention to China!

<p>
The Hot Plotters
<p>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28
<p>

The search for a greater choice of presidential candidates can't reach more desperate lengths than
the situation reported over the weekend, namely that a Hot Plot has been hatching by means of
telephone conference calls. Of the seven players who participated in these calls, reported to have
lasted two hours each, three are relatively unknown, the others being Bill Bradley, Gary Hart,
Paul Tsongas, and Lowell Weicker.
<p>Time magazine reports that in their last telephone conference, it couldn't be settled which of
the plotters should enter his name in the formal contest. About Senator Bradley there is this
problem, namely that he would put his audience to sleep if he recited King Harry's speech to his
soldiers at Agincourt. Mr. Bradley was recently in California testing the waters. He found them
uniformly cold, if that is the right word for waters that react not at all to the finger stuck in them
seeking Delphic encouragement. 
<p>Gary Hart, of course, has troubles that date back to his hubristic outing on the yacht Monkey
Business, the design of which caper has to have been to prove that the American voters don't care
any more about adultery than they are supposed to care about abortion. To be sure, Senator Hart,
unlike most of the others on the party line last Sunday, is a charismatic political campaigner. But
when the opportunity came up earlier in the year to run for the Senate from his home state,
Colorado, he decided to pass it up. If you can't count on your home state for senator, it doesn't
make much sense to go for 26 states.
<p>Paul Tsongas is an attractive former senator who fired off a Roman candle or two during the
Democratic primaries in 1992 by calling for a reduced federal deficit. He ran into the usual
problem, which is that most voters are a) in favor of a balanced budget, and b) in favor of
everything that causes the budget to be unbalanced. In any event, Mr. Tsongas has medical
problems which are said to have caused him to rule himself out as the candidate of the Hot
Plotters.
<p>Lowell Weicker did succeed when he ran as an independent for governor of Connecticut,
soon after his defeat for re-election as senator at the hands of Joseph Lieberman. Governor
Weicker's reign calls to mind the blurb written by Evelyn Waugh for his friend Nancy Mitford's
novel. ``In 1945,'' Mr. Waugh wrote, ``Miss Mitford voted the socialist ticket. Having done her
best to make England uninhabitable, she went to France to live.'' It was Mr. Weicker who
instituted the income tax in Connecticut, which has served no purpose other than to make the
state less genial than it once was to middle-class residents and to corporations, many of which
have fled. There is this additional problem, which is that Mr. Weicker is the most obnoxious
moralist since Savonarola, suggesting that any deviation from whatever was his most recent
political epiphany marks the dissenter as a cretin. 
<p>So where do we go from here? As regards Bradley - Hart - Tsongas - Weicker, the answer is:
absolutely nowhere. What their putative coalition is meant to say is that there is (their word) a
``huge'' hunger for the kind of politics they represent. How does one reduce this agenda into
idiomatic political language? Well, the easiest way to put it is that they are anti-Newt.
<p>The Speaker has been having a rough time of it in recent days, and some of it is his fault. It
isn't a fault you'd score against a philosopher, who happily comes up with reticulate bearings to
help to understand any phenomenon. Years ago, wondering about some political quandary, I
asked a distinguished historian to trace the cause of the problem and he replied unhesitantly,
``William of Occam.'' He meant by this the introduction of relativist thought engendered by the
denial of universals in the fourteenth century.
<p>Okay, but of course Mr. Gingrich is supposed to speak in an idiomatic mode, and when
someone calls to his attention a quite awful specimen of human depravity, it is not wise, let alone
prudent, for him to cite federal welfare as the progenitive cause, even if, in a seminar, a professor
might persuasively track depravity back to welfare, back to original sin. But of course the trouble
with an etiological search so comprehensively concerned to identify the prime cause of human
misbehavior is that it could finger Newt Gingrich as suffering from the sin of intellectual pride.
But the surviving point has got to be that the courage and the stamina of the Speaker have given
the voters a vision of something truly distinctive from such an awful stew as one gets from the
Hot Plotters, who don't even have an interesting idiosyncrasy to call attention to them.

<HR>

<p>
by Peter W. Rodman
<p>

WASHINGTON, D.C.
<p>
	One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnian conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests.  One such interest was the future of the Western alliance: the prolongation of the Bosnia war and the squabbles among the Allies were poisonous to the Alliance itself, and the resulting incoherence of Western policy was poisonous to NATO's credibility.  A second key strategic interest was the enlargement of NATO into Central Europe, and prolongation of the Bosnia war was also complicating this.  (During the climactic NATO bombing operations in September, Boris Yeltsin gave a tempestuous news conference in which he conflated the two issues, blustering that an enlarged NATO would soon be dropping bombs on Russia's doorstep.)  The Dayton Accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all this behind us and to re-focus our European policy on our larger concerns.
<p>
	These arguments for Dayton still hold, but NATIONAL REVIEW has learned of a stunningly duplicitous turn in the Clinton Administration's policy toward Russia, Bosnia, and the Atlantic Alliance:  The President and his associates are reported to have given Moscow secret assurances that, in return for its cooperation with the U.S. in Bosnia peacekeeping, NATO enlargement will be put "on the back burner" for the foreseeable future.  The rationale was that, given this demonstration of Russia's readiness to be a partner in a new cooperative "European security architecture," the extension of NATO security guarantees to Central Europe would not be a priority any time soon.  This account comes from official and authoritative sources, both Russian and American.
<p>
	It has long been understood (indeed, admitted by some Administration officials) that concrete decisions on admitting new NATO members would be put off until after the Russian elections, especially the presidential election scheduled for June 1996--which meant, as a practical matter, until after the U.S. presidential election as well.  Russian officials interpret the new assurances to mean that if Mr. Clinton is re-elected, nothing will happen on NATO enlargement in his second term either.
<p>
	The story is accompanied by reports of other assurances to the Russians that their cooperation on Bosnia would put the United States in their debt and earn them greater American understanding on other issues, such as their reassertion of control in their "near abroad" (Central Asia and the Caucasus, including the oil-rich Caspian basin).
<p>
	As usual, this Administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-ackwards.  It is wrong to pay a price to Russia over Bosnia in the strategic coin of our larger interest in consolidating security in Central Europe.  It is wrong to sacrifice NATO enlargement to the Russians over Bosnia or over anything else.  The Administration's repeated assurances to Congress and to the Allies that Russia would not have a veto over NATO enlargement turn out to be empty--perhaps just another of the "terminological inexactitudes" that have become so familiar.  A huge price will ultimately be paid for this.
<p>
	There is no current threat to Central Europe.  The newly liberated states of the region, however, have just recently awakened from a 60-year nightmare, still find themselves situated between Germany and Russia, and know in their bones that their survival is not guaranteed by history.  They consider themselves part of the West culturally, politically, and morally; they therefore seek Western assurances that we feel a stake in their security and independence.  Seen in this light, NATO enlargement is not a new act, but a consolidation of the post-1989 status quo: the are free, sovereign countries exercising their free, sovereign choice to associate with us.  Either Russia accepts this, or it does not.
<p>
	Leaving the security status of Central Europe ambiguous only leaves open temptations to Russian irredentists.  NATO membership for Central Europe is among other things a way of telling the Russians that their acceptance of the post-1989 status quo in Central Europe is the sine qua non of any relationship with us.  If the Russians have a problem with this--which they clearly seem to have--then we are all facing a major problem five or ten years down the road as Russia regains its strength.
<p>
	The Administration's rationale for delaying NATO enlargement has been twofold.  One is the claim that it will be easier to achieve such enlargement if we go about it gradually.  But the nationalist turn in Russian politics, expected to be given new impetus by the December elections for the Duma, tells us that it will not get any easier.  Russia is only getting stronger and more assertive; every month, the risks and inhibitions on our side will only grow.  The Administration's second rationale (at least so I suspect) is what philosophy majors will remember as Zeno's Paradox: the idea that if you divide a distance into an infinite number of tiny increments, you never get to the destination.  This may be the Administration's real calculation.  In other words, it just doesn't want to enlarge NATO--for fear of antagonizing Moscow.  The first rationale is bad judgment; the second is bad faith.
<p>
	Whatever the short-term plaudits due to the Administration for putting the Bosnia conflict on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions.
<p>

<head><title>The Week -- NR</title></head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>

<P><li>
The Federal Government briefly shut down on our 35th anniversary.
Never ones to rest on our laurels, for our 40th we arranged a
shutdown rather more spectacular than the last. For our 45th,
we plan to shut down the Supreme Court.
<P><li>
The Florida straw poll was the last of those elusive pre-primary
events that reflect in equal parts hype and organizational energy,
and generate a wave of analysis that discounts the results even
as it dissects them. The common wisdom from Orlando, as it turns
out, is roughly right: Dole remains the front-runner but is still
a weak one; Gramm's second-place finish was what he needed to
remain viable; Alexander suffered from expectations that he might
come in second, but his finish close to Gramm inches him near
the top tier; everyone else is going to have trouble running a
national campaign (although Buchanan is looking strong in New
Hampshire, and Alan Keyes, who is running on nothing except his
soaring words, continues to inspire a slice of GOP activists).
But the straw poll should send the clearest signal to Bob Dole.
So far, he has run a campaign about as near to flawless (except
for incessant ``off-message'' unscripted comments -- the latest
in Time) as could be expected given his record and inclinations.
And the result is still tepid: a third of the vote, after pouring
a million dollars and impressive organizational resources into
an event stocked with party regulars. If this is what it's like
when the going is good, what happens after a gaffe?
<P><li>
To paraphrase an old feminist line, the U.S. without a Federal
Government is like a fish without a fish-hook.
<P><li>
A few months back, conservatives were criticizing Sheila Burke,
chief of staff to Sen. Bob Dole, for allegedly tugging her boss
leftward. Our own Rich Lowry noted that some of the criticisms
were ``over the top'' and suggested that Dole, not his staffers,
was responsible for any disappointments from his office [``The
101st Senator,'' July 31]. Now Jason DeParle has written a cover
story for the New York Times Magazine under the headline, ``Sheila
Burke is the Militant Feminist Commie Peacenik Who's Telling Bob
Dole What to Think,'' and the subhead, ``Well, no. She's just
the senator's moderate chief of staff, the latest victim of the
conservative attack machine.'' Where to start? No conservative
described Mrs. Burke as a ``Commie peacenik,'' etc. Since NR's
balanced article contradicts his premise, DeParle ignores it except
to mention a minor error that was immediately acknowledged in
the magazine. The cover promises an expose of ``The Campaign to
Demonize Sheila Burke,'' as if DeParle considers it ``demonization''
to call a liberal a liberal -- which, considering what most Americans
think, isn't so far off. Keep ruminating, DeParle: you've come
up with one half-truth, you may find another.
<P><li>
But when the New York Times is fair, how can we fail to be? So
we applaud the Times for its headline after the GOP took the Louisiana
governorship: ``Republicans Regain/National Momentum/With Louisiana
Win.'' Just kidding.
<P><li>
On November 21, the President announced that the Dayton talks
had produced a Bosnia agreement, and he promised to ``consult''
with Congress before a peace treaty was signed and U.S. troops
were sent to police it. Four days earlier, the House had passed,
243 to 171, the Hefley amendment barring any Bosnia deployment.
The President will probably be able to make a veto of this stick,
but a positive vote of support may be out of reach, even in the
afterglow of the agreement. On one side of the debate will be
arguments about the last best chance for peace, keeping a promise
made to allies, and preserving U.S. influence in Europe; on the
other side, arguments about the flaws and shakiness of the ``peace''
and the risks to American soldiers. Sending troops without a congressional
vote of support would compound all the risks, both in Bosnia and
at home, and in all likelihood lead to 1) an attack on U.S. troops
by whichever side finds their presence an obstacle, and 2) their
withdrawal by an Administration not known for its courage under
pressure. That would damage U.S. leadership far more than a refusal
to provide American forces now. Our advice to Mr. Clinton is borrowed
from the Duke of Wellington: ``You have got yourself into a damned
difficult spot, and you must think hard how best to get out of
it.''
<P><li>
If the California Civil Rights Initiative gets enough signatures
to qualify for the ballot, it will almost certainly win -- and
quite possibly scuttle President Clinton's chances of re-election.
But the CCRI is in deep trouble, partly because people mistakenly
assume it is a done deal, partly because of the campaign's own
amateurism. Paid petitioning has been suspended for lack of funds,
and only a fraction of the required signatures has been collected.
Now is the time for the national Republican Party to set up an
independent petition drive to get the CCRI on the ballot; and
for GOP  presidential candidates and California congressmen to
donate soft money to aid that drive. Republicans cannot afford
to let the CCRI fail. Nor can any American who believes that people
should be judged by their individual qualities, not by their race.
<P><li>
Remember Hillary's task force to socialize American medicine?
The White House said it cost $100,000, which turns out to be off
by a factor of at least 138 -- somewhere between an ordinary Clinton
fib and a whopper. The real figure is now put at $13.8 million,
maybe more, who knows?
<P><li>
President Clinton's intervention in Haiti seemed to be going swimmingly
-- until November. First, prime minister Smarck Michel resigned
to protest President Aristide's refusal to proceed with economic
reform. Then, Aristide began to foment violence in an apparent
effort to undermine -- and perhaps to head off -- presidential
elections scheduled for December 17. Aristide's words and actions
have become so indefensible that even his cheerleaders at the
New York Times front-paged a story about the worsening mess. Where
are things now heading? Either to an election seen as illegitimate
by most of Haiti's democrats, in which the leftist Rene Preval
becomes president, or to massive disorder, which permits Aristide
to stay in power. It's entirely plausible that our troops will
leave on schedule, but their departure may well be followed by
yet more violence and even another coup. Isn't this where we came
in, a few hundred million dollars ago?
<P><li>
Fred West, the English serial killer who buried nearly a dozen
bodies at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, was writing his memoirs
in prison when he hanged himself. He entitled them I Only Ever
Loved an Angel. The jury did not entirely agree with him. It had
little difficulty in finding the supposed angel, his wife, Rosemary,
guilty of murdering her daughter, stepdaughter, and lodger (who
was pregnant at the time by Mr. West). By comparison with the
goings-on at Number 25, as revealed at the trial, Fellini's Satyricon
looked like an evangelical crusade for chastity. For the most
part, the sexually insatiable Wests preyed upon rootless young
women from the underclass whom they enticed into their home, where
they tied them up, beat and raped them, killed them, dismembered
them, and then buried them. Their most active period of unspeakable
depravity was the 1970s. The picture of life in the English underclass
that emerged from the trial was horrific in the extreme. One lesson
to be learned from the whole sordid episode is that the underclass
was clearly in place before the advent of Mrs. Thatcher, who is
often blamed for creating it. The West trial, in fact, was a reductio
ad nauseam of the values of the 1960s -- self-expression without
self-restraint.
<P><li>
Incidentally, Dr. Jack Kevorkian presided over his 26th snuffing,
and still hasn't received a Clinton nomination to be the new surgeon
general.

Last January, the Claremont Institute brought together 17 prominent
conservatives -- including Richard Brookhiser, Angela ``Bay''
Buchanan, Linda Chavez, Alan Keyes, Ed Meese, Ralph Reed, William
A. Rusher, and Bret Schundler -- to consider the culture wars.
The ``Conservative Manifesto'' they came up with calls for a renewed
commitment to ``the moral and natural law,'' a project of restoration
that has two steps: ``dismantling . . . ruinous bureaucracies,''
and fighting relativism in the culture. The friends of freedom
and virtue must hang together, or they will hang separately. The
manifesto is a good antidote to liberal pundits eager to see the
conservative coalition break up. If it is less detailed than the
Declaration of Independence, that is because the Founders' enemy
was smaller, and less protean.
<P><li>
Most minorities, according to a Labor Department survey, prefer
older racial and ethnic designations over newfangled multiculturalist
alternatives. Blacks, for example, are most likely to describe
themselves as such (45 per cent); only 28 per cent choose ``African
American.'' Likewise, Hispanics overwhelmingly favor that title
over the liberal-chic ``Latino'' (57 per cent to 12 per cent);
and American Indians scalped ``Native American'' by a margin of
49 to 37 per cent. Whether the Census will respect the wishes
of these groups remains to be seen. Meanwhile, more questions
for the next survey: how many liberals call themselves liberals;
how many feminists call themselves women; how many Episcopalians
call themselves Christian.
<P><li>
The fictional Administration in Rob Reiner's movie The American
President bears a sharp resemblance to the real Administration
of Bill Clinton, down to the  wisp of hair on the forehead of
Michael J. Fox as President Shepherd's Stephanopolitan chief domestic
advisor. But Shepherd is less like the actual incumbent than like
Mr. Clinton's daydream of himself: a strong, decisive leader;
a principled liberal; popular with the electorate and with a sexy
lady whom he gets to bed down right in the White House; highly
organized; slim; a widower.
<P><li>
Samuel Francis, a scholar of political theory and an occasional
contributor to NR, has lost his job as an editorial writer at
the Washington Times. In both his writing and his public speaking,
Mr. Francis had expressed some highly provocative opinions. Most
recently he chided the Southern Baptists for publicly regretting
their failure to fight slavery. Then Dinesh D'Souza, in his book
The End of Racism, quoted Mr. Francis as calling on whites to
``reassert our identity and our solidarity . . . in explicitly
racial terms.'' Now, these strike us as foolish views, especially
the latter: racial consciousness-raising would be as destructive
for whites as it has been for blacks. But are they hanging offenses?
An employer has the right to fire someone he feels is bad for
business. But the decision of Times editor Wesley Pruden to act
on this right was regrettable. At the New York Times, when the
editorial writer Brent Staples published, successively, a bizarre
admission that he had stalked Saul Bellow, and an illiterate attack
on Leo Strauss, he got clean away with it (no surprise: white
liberals expect very little from black liberals). That too was
wrong. Foolishness calls for a rebuke -- whether severe or light,
depending on the degree of foolishness and other mitigating circumstances
(the numerous writing awards Francis won for the Times). With
their respective treatments of wayward writers, neither Times
has done itself credit.
<P><li>
The FDA is thinking about allowing the hair-growth drug Rogaine
to be sold without a prescription, and more cheaply, too. One
instantly infers that the bureaucrats themselves are getting old
and bald. Perhaps there is hope yet for America.

ON THE RIGHT / Wm. F. Buckley Jr.
<P>
X-Ray Time
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 14
<P>
It is useful to examine the federal deadlock through a strictly
democratic prism.
<P>
1. We have a separation of powers that authorizes Congress uniquely
to pass legislation; and a subdivision here that authorizes only
the House of Representatives to write bills that will cost money.
<P>
2. The President is authorized to veto any bill presented to him
by Congress. To override a presidential veto requires two-thirds
of the vote in each house.
<P>
3. In the existing situation, a majority of both houses passes
a measure that would simultaneously do a great many things, including
program an increase in payments required by the public to sustain
Medicaid and Medicare.
<P>
4. The President exercises his veto, complaining specifically
about the measure's health-care provisions.
<P>
5. Congressional leadership asks itself: Given that an override
of the veto cannot be recruited, how might Congress force its
hand on the President?
<P>
Force its hand!? Yes, that is what Messrs. Dole and Gingrich are
saying in effect, because they are seeking to implement what they
understand as strict instructions from the American people. They
are to move toward balancing the budget, and their plan for doing
so is blocked by the President's power.
<P>
But Congress also has power. The continuation of federal activity,
including the health benefits, requires financing. It is generally
assumed that so-called entitlements are inertial forces that cannot
be interrupted. But the forward movement of those forces requires
constant propulsion, and this is doable only by appropriations
by Congress.
<P>
The leadership is quite confident that its mandate hasn't withered
since it was enunciated in the November election. A national survey
done by Public Opinion Strategies only a week ago reveals that
66 per cent of Americans favor ``balancing the budget [even] if
that means that spending on Medicare and Medicaid would continue
to increase but at a lower rate.'' Accordingly, Congress uses
its trump card and freezes spending at the highest level authorized
by a preceding Congress, i.e., at 4.9 trillion borrowed dollars.
<P>
So: The people voted, Congress acted, the President vetoed, Congress
used its primordial power.
<P>
In a parliamentary system, such an impasse would be quickly solved.
The parliament would be dissolved, an election scheduled. If the
party upholding a balanced budget prevailed in that election,
the prime minister would resign and be replaced by a member of
the validated party. If otherwise, the prime minister would be
back with a compliant legislature. But then, the prime minister
wouldn't be occupying the executive mansion unless placed there
by the ruling faction in the legislature. What we face today is
what the British would call a constitutional crisis.
<P>
The public has not yet been discomfited, and no one will be for
a period, the exception being 800,000 furloughed federal workers.
The Treasury secretary is maneuvering and isn't likely to run
out of gas unless a major creditor nation decides that there is
too much harum-scarum going on and, instead of holding its reserves
in dollars, switches to yen, or marks, or pounds sterling.
<P>
What we do have is high-pitched political theater. The people
are vaguely aware of the instructions they gave to the new Congress,
but they are, with various degrees of intensity, concerned with
medical care, and that element of Americans most concerned is
of course the senior citizens, and it is they who exercise critical
clout. The President is relying on his incantatory evocations
of starving children and homeless old people, with here and there
a tear shed for what used to be Yellowstone Park. Presidential
indignation makes its way quickly to the headlines.
<P>
By contrast, it is Congress that is held to be the agent of all
those things, and we come quickly on the supreme irony, which
is that references are almost inevitably to the ``rigid,'' the
``defiant,'' the ``reckless'' Congress, the complement of the
lonely, single defender of the people's interest. There was never
a better example of everybody being out of step except Johnny.

<HR>
27-November-1995

<P>



<p><li>The Dole campaign accuses Sen. Gramm of using Jimmy Carter tactics. We don't know what this is all about, but we know mud when we see it flung.<p><li>The end of the ``revolution''? Not exactly. The results of the November 7 elections offer no signs of a Democratic resurgence. Democrats barely held onto the Kentucky governor's mansion and the Virginia State Senate -- both of which they have essentially owned since Reconstruction -- by mobilizing their base with scare talk about Newt Gingrich and GOP budget cuts. Republican voters, meanwhile, appeared to suffer from complacency, an almost inevitable reaction to 1994. The GOP momentum has unquestionably slowed. But the inertia had set in months ago, especially in the U.S. Senate. A Republican Congress elected to reshape American politics has left its contours remarkably unaltered: so far, no tax cuts, no welfare reform, no end to affirmative action, no regulatory relief -- in short, no tangible benefits for Middle America. So who needs more Republicans? If the elections are taken as proof that the GOP has gone ``too far'' -- if they prompt Republicans to back off before any of their agenda has become law -- voters will inevitably be asking the same question next year.
<p><li>In a partial-birth abortion, the infant is pulled feet first from his mother's womb while the head is kept just within the uterus; the abortionist then punctures the infant's skull and suctions the brain out. (You can understand why pro-abortionists would rather talk about ``choice'' than about these grisly realities.) By a vote of 288 to 139, the House of Representatives passed a bill to ban this vile procedure -- and, in the process, shattered the myth that social issues are tearing Republicans apart. In fact it was Democrats, not Republicans, who were split. If the Senate follows the House's lead, President Clinton will be forced to choose between enraging his most vocal supporters and defending the indefensible. Abortionists are already enraged: in the words of one New York Times story, ``Most of the doctors interviewed said they saw no moral difference between dismembering the fetus within the uterus [and] partially delivering it, intact, before killing it.'' They are, of course, correct.

<p><li>The debate among conservatives over Colin Powell was already burning nicely when Bill Bennett threw gasoline on the fire with some ill-chosen words on abortion. Social-conservative activists had criticized him for speaking favorably of Gen. Powell despite his pro-choice position, and Mr. Bennett blasted back. ``Holding onto the chimera of a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion (the means) has done nothing to reduce the number of abortions (which ought to be the end).'' Pro-lifers would do better, he argued, to support presidential candidates who would talk about ``teen abstinence, adoption, crisis-pregnancy centers, individual responsibility, and the importance of a civilization's common moral code.'' Finally, he maintained that proponents of a Human Life Amendment, to be logically consistent, should advocate applying the penalties for first-degree murder to doctors who perform abortions and women who procure them. Mr. Bennett's empirical claim is debatable: abortion rates have fallen over the last decade and a half, and surely the cultural impact of the campaign for the HLA had something to do with that decline. He errs more seriously in describing anti-abortion laws as merely a means to an end. The ``right'' to take a life unjustly would remain a blot on the nation's conscience and its lawbooks even if nobody chose to exercise it. And abortion laws, contrary to his assertion, never invoked penalties equivalent to those for first-degree murder. Mr. Bennett's proposed alternative -- a lot of talk about consensus virtues -- is striking in its timidity. Polls continue to show strong public support for substantial abortion regulation; pro-abortion intellectuals are in retreat; and pro-lifers have scored significant political victories -- most spectacularly in 1994, when not a single pro-life incumbent of either party lost an election to a pro-choice candidate. Given these trends, pro-lifers would be better advised to escalate their demands than to settle for an agenda that Hillary Clinton could happi
ly endorse.

<p><li>If this is part of a sequel, The Book of Easy Virtues, Mr. Bennett should be warned that it will be a long, long volume.<p><li>Rep. James Saxton (R., N.J.) is House Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), responsible among other things for producting studies that illustrate the benefits of Republican policies like, oh, balancing the budget. So it was no small embarrassment when Saxton, who enjoys a safe congressional seat and hence has no discernible need to pander, voted against the House GOP's budget and Medicare plan, despite a last-minute deal that sent an extra $750 million to his state. (Surely the House leadership can find a JEC chairman who actually votes the way his committee's literature reads.) New Jersey Rep. Dick Zimmer, who plans to run for Bill Bradley's Senate seat, deserted the GOP too, laying to rest any doubts that he would be an additional Senate roadblock to Republican reform. A roadblock like Maine's William Cohen, who after extracting concessions on regulation of nursing-home care and other matters still voted against the Senate Republican budget because he couldn't in good conscience vote to cut taxes. But all this looks almost statesmanlike in comparison to Pat Buchanan's new radio ad attacking GOP Medicare reform as ``cuts'' unfair to the elderly, a particularly naked bit of opportunism from a politician who prides himself on principle. Maybe the next Contract with America should propose career limits.<p><li>Why is Sen. Barbara Boxer participating in the Whitewater oversight hearings? Her daughter, Nicole, is married to Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony. Nicole Boxer Rodham, therefore, is Hillary's sister-in-law. Perhaps this explains Sen. Boxer's blind defense of Bill and Hillary throughout the Whitewater hearings. But it does not explain why her colleagues tolerate what most people would consider a serious conflict of interest. One wonders what former Sen. Bob Packwood thinks of Sen. Boxer's conduct.<p><li>In case it slipped by you, Saddam Hussein won re-election in Ir
aq with a comfortable 99.5 per cent of the vote. The other 0.5 per cent were members of his family who defected to Jordan.<p><li>``For thirty years, Ottawa's federalists have claimed successively that the Quebec separatist dragon did not exist, that its jaws were not open, that it was not going to swallow anyone and -- now -- that Confederation will escape by hanging onto its tonsils.'' NR said that last year about the complacency that greeted the Parti Quebecois's victory in the provincial elections. After the stunningly close vote in the October 30 referendum on sovereignty (see page 32), the Ottawacrats are hanging onto the dragon's tonsils by their fingernails. Even more significant than the overall squeaker was the 60 per cent vote for the Yes cause among French-speakers, a margin of victory that a referendum on American independence probably could not have achieved in New England in 1776. A nation is in quest of a state in Quebec, and Premier Jacques Parizeau was only being realistic when, in his much-denounced concession speech, he pointed out the anomaly that this quest is being frustrated only by the province's English-speaking and immigrant minorities. Naturally, he has been excoriated by the Ottawacrats' Canadian mouthpieces and by their liberal soulmates here. More surprising is to find the usually sensible Charles Krauthammer, in the November 3 Washington Post, decrying the breakup of Canada over ``an issue as relatively trivial as language.'' There could be no better measure of the extent to which even some of America's conservative intellectuals have lost sight of the ethnic and cultural realities that constitute a sense of common nationhood. Except, of course, for our own immigration and language policies.<p><li>U.S. Army medic Specialist Michael G. New is before a court-martial because he refused to don United Nations insignia when his unit (of the 3rd Infantry Division) was assigned to peacekeeping duties in Macedonia. He had served meritoriously before, including a tour in Kuwait last year, b
ut he balked at exchanging his U.S. Army insignia and status for the UN blue helmet and for the nebulous status of serving under UN command. His rationale is that he swore allegiance to the United States, not to the United Nations. Now, individual GIs cannot be allowed to make decisions of high policy. But policymakers ought to make better decisions. The Clinton Administration's infatuation with multilateralism long ago went over the top. If we want to be in Macedonia, we should be there under the red, white, and blue. And New should be reassigned to Alaska, not court-martialed.<p><li>NATO has been searching for a new Secretary General since Willy Claes stepped down to face charges in connection with a Belgian bribery scandal. The real scandal, as NR was among the first to point out, was that Claes held the position in the first place. In the early Eighties, the Belgian Socialist had opposed deployment in Europe of U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles (NATO's response to the Soviet SS-20s), which should have disqualified him. Good riddance. Now, the leading candidate to succeed Claes is Ruud Lubbers, a Dutch Christian Democrat and former prime minister who supported the Euromissile deployment. He is a firm Atlanticist. The Clinton Administration, showing the strategic judgment for which it is so famous, supported Claes to the end and has been resisting Lubbers -- apparently because European NATO members have openly favored him, and Washington does not want to have a staunch pro-American foisted on us by a bunch of pesky foreigners.
<p><li>President Clinton ran a new, wholly unexpected Core Belief up the flagpole, confessing that he had raised taxes too much. Next day, after the Democratic establishment had voiced shock and dismay, Mr. Clinton's Core Belief was back to being ``very, very proud'' of the tax increase, and life returned to normal.<p><li>``The ultimate logic of a market economy is the gangsterization of culture. . . . The marketplace . . . is an extension of the laissez-white supremacy. . . . Same as those with homophobia, keeping trapped the humanity of gay brothers and lesbian sisters.'' No, this is not a scene from Dead Presidents. It is the racio-economic stylings of Cornel West -- liberal flavor of the month -- at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Catholic-funded Campaign for Human Development. For the last several years, drawing on reports from the Capital Research Center, we have been writing about the antics of CHD, which funds gay-rights activists, pro-abortionists, and radical feminist nuns -- all in the name of empowering the poor. In the words of one such activist pondering his good fortune: ``My God! I can't believe they're funding that here.'' Yet Catholics continue to pony up for this organization amid denials from pastors and bishops that, as Catholic readers report to us, go something like this: ``What do you expect from a bunch of conservatives?'' We are glad to see that fallacies like the ad hominem are still taught in Catholic seminaries, but disturbed that they seem to be given as exercises. This year, when the basket comes around for the Campaign for Human Development, just refuse to participate in the ``gangsterization'' of Catholicism.<p><li>Three relics of one of those Arcadian Indian civilizations so cruelly snuffed out by the Spanish Empire were uncovered by scientists on an Andean mountain peak. Frozen and perfectly preserved, they had been killed by Native American priests as a sacrifice to the gods of Mount Ampato. It was an Inca thing. You wouldn't understand.

THE AIDS PLAGUE<br>
Dying of the Light<br>
Presumably aware of the dangers they court, homosexuals continueto contract AIDS at an astonishing rate. The 'support' theyreceive for doing so is unconscionable.
<br>MIDGE DECTER<br>
Mrs. Decter is a writer living in New York City.<br>


<p>SINCE 1981, the experts tell us, some 441,528 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. Of these, it is said, about half have contracted the disease as a result of male homosexual coupling, and another quarter as a result of using contaminated needles for intravenous drug consumption. The rest are in one way or another simply victims of the above: people who have been given transfusions with infected blood, or women whose husbands have taken their secret extramarital pleasures with infected men, or babies born to AIDS-infected mothers. To be sure, in that same period the rates for heart disease and cancer have been much higher, but considering that AIDS has so far proved to be not only incurable but invariably fatal, the number of its sufferers has struck everyone as especially terrible.

<p>An even more terrible number, however, is the 187,309 new cases reported for the years 1993 and 1994. For whereas the earliest AIDS patients knew nothing of their potential affliction until it was too late, by 1993 the means for avoiding infection were very widely known -- indeed, in some places were even being taught to schoolchildren -- and surely universally known to the country's homosexual population. Thus it must be assumed that (with the exception of wives ignorant of what their husbands were doing on the sly and the doomed babies of criminally negligent mothers) the bulk of the most recently recorded cases have been contracted with foreknowledge of the dangers. Particularly in a society as health-obsessed and disease-conscious as our own, this most recent statistic fairly boggles the mind.

<p>Is it, then, willful suicide, or hubris, or the former posing as the latter, that has lately been leading so many young homosexuals knowingly to engage in the kind of unprotected sex that is most calculated to leave them with AIDS? Finding the answer to this question is essential not only for understanding what is really involved in the effort to control the spread of the infection but also for getting a handle on the agenda of the homosexual activists.

<p>For a long time gay-rights activists have divided their time between, on the one hand, declaring that everyone, homosexual or heterosexual, is equally at risk of contracting AIDS, and, on the other hand, demanding special attention and compassion as a community uniquely victimized by it. The idea that everyone is at risk was, of course, meant to prevent a fresh mark of pariahdom from being set upon the brow of the so newly respectable homosexual community: homosexual sex was to be held no more dangerous and no more at fault for the spread of AIDS than the heterosexual variety. (This idea, in addition to leading to the disproportionate expenditure of government funds on research into a cure -- more than a billion dollars per year -- carried the added benefit of engaging homosexuals as homosexuals in the process of writing and/or revising health-education curricula.) On the other hand, the idea that the homosexual community is being singularly victimized has helped to fan the sense of injustice and outrage on which the gay-rights movement, like any rights movement, must depend for its political livelihood and that precisely as a result of its successes might be in danger of diminishing.

<p>Thus the issue of AIDS has plunged those activists who speak most loudly in the name of their fellow homosexuals even more deeply into the contradiction that trembles perpetually beneath their relations with the ``straight'' world -- the simultaneous assertion that they are the same as everyone else and that their experience is unique.

<p>In this, of course, gay politics is more or less like all the other forms of rights-politics in our time. With this one overriding difference: that while the two other current major rights movements, the blacks' and the women's, are subject to essentially the same basic contradiction, neither of them happens to be beset by the complication that a significant number of its members and intended beneficiaries seem to be willfully courting death.

<p>Now, the connection of homosexuality to suicide -- a connection about which the most recent history of AIDS has left little room for doubt -- is, like most things having to do with suicide, in the end a profound mystery. It is, moreover, a mystery which it would be presumptuous, not to say useless, for anyone but homosexuals themselves to attempt to confront -- although confront it is something they would sooner or later be well advised to do. Still, what is in its way even more mysterious is the response of the homosexuals' putative friends and well-wishers to this scourge that has been racing virtually unhindered through their community. For surely never have people professing care and loving kindness been so admiring, so celebratory, of hopeless suffering as has the society of America's enlightened, liberal, rich, famous, and/or beautiful heterosexuals with respect to AIDS.

<p>There are two problems here, one perhaps not so difficult to understand, the other difficult indeed. The first has to do with the homosexuals themselves and their cooperative acceptance of what can be called, if not actual dancing, then certainly large-scale posturing on their graves. Can they really be so benighted as to regard public cheering in the face of their mortal danger as love? Would not scolding and imprecations and efforts to turn them from their fatal ways, however unpleasant, be truer marks of fellow feeling? Alas, so widespread and commonplace has the disease become among them that tolerance for AIDS and tolerance for them may have come to seem one and the same thing. And then, to be sure, there are the enormous political benefits for the gay-rights movements in AIDS's having become literally a cause celcbre.

<p>If memory serves, the celebration began almost immediately upon the country's becoming widely aware of the disease: with the death of Rock Hudson, who was possibly the first very famous person to die of it -- anyway certainly one of the earliest cases to be publicly acknowledged. No doubt millions of American women were stricken to discover that this figure who had for so long haunted their daydreams had in fact been a homosexual and had been carried off as a result of a sexual career both hidden from, and a denial of, them. But whatever that first shock, it must soon have been dispelled by the way a whole raft of people in Hollywood responded to what would once have been a scandal by coming very close to claiming that they had witnessed their colleague being assumed into heaven in a fiery chariot.

<p>And almost from that first moment it was decreed by those who dictate the nation's displays of stylish sentiment that not only would no whisper of shame be attached to what is after all essentially a venereal disease, but indeed suffering from AIDS would be deemed an honorific condition. Nor would it be honored only in profound thought and sensitive prose but, on the contrary, in the most determined and lavish public display. This decree did not, of course, extend to those who became diseased as a result of intravenous drug use; that was tacky. And as for the innocent victims -- hemophiliacs, babies, and so on -- for them there would of course be pity and charitable gestures but certainly no celebration. To be celebrated for having been felled by AIDS -- which is to say, to be sung, storied, eulogized, lobbied for, polemicized about, and truly wept over -- one had to be a homosexual. In other words, one had to have contracted the disease the good old-fashioned venereal way, through heedless (or lately, we are told, intentional) acts of anal and/or oral sex with already infected and equally heedless male partners.

<p>Which brings us to the second problem; call it the puzzle of the scarlet ribbon. Do healthy people who pin the shiny red commemoration of AIDS to their lapel -- and their number is by now legion -- mean to express by it their solidarity with those who are gone? With those who are about to go? With those who will one day inevitably be going? With the disease itself? The issue is not a trivial one, for what does it mean to make a gesture of fellowhood with people who have contrived to become hopeless when one has not oneself?

<p>Perhaps the ultimate in such display was reached in that moment of the Academy Awards ceremony of 1994 when Tom Hanks, accepting the Oscar for his performance as a man afflicted with AIDS, got swept across the boundary between performance and reality and, before an audience of millions, wept with love for his momentarily imagined fellow AIDS sufferers; ``angels in heaven,'' is what he tearfully pronounced them to be. (Hanks himself, of course, would soon be going on to another hugely successful movie, while who knows how many of his potential ``angels'' would be climbing into their beds of pain.)

<p>Actors and their emotions aside, it is no small thing for people who are in virtually no danger of coming down with AIDS -- and who, whatever they say, well know that they are in no such danger -- to make a show of cheering on those who are unlikely to escape it. Under ordinary circumstances, the word for such a show would be cruelty. It is not altogether unlike the behavior of the crowds that gather and watch with bated breath when someone threatens to jump from the ledge of a tall building: whatever such behavior signifies, we could certainly not call it compassion.

<p>Is it, then, that their self-styled friends and sympathizers among the heterosexuals subconsciously wish for homosexuals to die -- much as those crowds subconsciously wish for the figure perched on the high ledge to jump? The answer is of course no. Doubly no: nothing so horrible and nothing so simple. But what they are almost certainly up to is something no less difficult to admit to themselves. For the one unmentionable thing that AIDS has accomplished is to make sex dangerous, and hence important, again.

<p>It would seem that human beings cannot for too long abide our present-day toleration for, and openness to, the possibility of mindless, effortless copulation. It enervates them, and leaves them with an unpleasant sensation of floating, of, as Milan Kundera so perfectly called it, ``the unbearable lightness of being.''

<p>Among heterosexuals, until only the day before yesterday, the ever-present threat or possibility of pregnancy made sex important -- dangerous, even. Now with effective contraception and easy-come-easy-go abortion, what is there to supply the sense of consequence? Under the old anti-promiscuity dispensation, men used to dream of sex without bother, without the burdensome necessities of entanglement. Ironically, what heterosexual men have always dreamed of -- or rather, daydreamed of -- is precisely what homosexual men used to have. In any case, as quickly became evident in those singles bars that served for a time as the local soviets of the sexual revolution, the heterosexual men did not thrive on being granted what they had so much wanted. (About their women, don't even ask.)

<p>In the case of the homosexuals, liberalism deprived them, too, of a good deal of that which had for so long lent consequence to their sex lives, namely, danger -- the danger of exposure and danger from the cops. They came out of the closet and marched in the streets with police protection, and yet seemed to grow ever more shrill and restless.

<p>Now there is AIDS, and there is consequence for them indeed.

<p>The good burghers who don their hiking clothes and go on fundraising walks ``for,'' as they put it, AIDS, the people who fill concert halls and theaters for benefit performances dedicated to AIDS, will tell you one of the reasons they are doing so is that unless a cure is found, we will soon all be at risk. Yet they know that they are not at risk; in 15 years they have seen only a handful of proper, well-off heterosexuals like themselves come down with the disease. Like Tom Hanks, they are play-acting.

<p>``For the rich to play at being poor,'' says a character in Lillian Hellman's <i>Toys in the Attic</i>, ``is a dirty game.'' For the healthy to pretend that they are in imminent danger of fatal illness is even dirtier. There are easier and more honest, though admittedly less popular, ways of trying to call off the sexual revolution.

<p>As for the homosexuals, the only true act of human fellowship with them would be to shake them by their collective shoulders and say over and over again: Cut that out!

ON THE RIGHT / Wm. F. Buckley Jr.


<br>

NEW YORK, OCTOBER 24
<p>Fifty years of the United Nations certainly does not bring on undifferentiated congratulations. The world organization received a jump start on hypocrisy when, in San Francisco, on a motion that Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland be admitted, the ruling was negative, on the grounds that they were not ``peace-loving nations.'' They were three countries that had not gone to war. But the term ``peace-loving'' had already got into the hands of the wordsmiths who gave us the ``Democratic Republic of Germany,'' which was Soviet-speak for undemocratic unrepublican East Germany. 

<p>In the Security Council we had from the outset the Soviet Union as a permanent member with veto rights, and then China, with the same rights. And in the General Assembly, with spooky consistency the Third World powers voted against Western measures, in line with Soviet measures. When in 1960 Fidel Castro, freshly arrived in power, visited the UN, he was hailed as a hero. In 1979, after he had clearly established himself as a ruler as tyrannical as those who presided over North Korea and Albania, he visited the United Nations again; and, again, was treated as a hero by the majority of its members. 

<p>On Sunday, President Clinton opened the celebratory proceedings by giving a moderate speech about this and that. Later in the day, Castro spoke -- the usual tirade against Western conventions, larded with the usual declamations in favor of self-government everywhere except in Cuba -- and got an ovation. Much heavier applause than that given to the President of the host country, our old friend, the superpower, Uncle Sam. 

<p>We pause to note that one reason for the anti-U.S. fever within the UN these days is our failure to pay our debt to the UN. When the organization was founded, President Truman accepted an imposition on the U.S. of 40 per cent of the UN's budget. In the immediate postwar world that was not an unreasonable allocation, given that we were at the time generating about 50 per cent of the world's production. In 1972 we reduced our share to 25 per cent, in line with the reviving economic fortunes of other countries. But in 1982 we began to stall on our payments, in part because we thought the allocations for peace-keeping expenses were rigged against us, in part because the relevant committees in Congress found it tempting to economize at the expense of an organization not all that popular back home.

<p>But the result of it is a very considerable embarrassment. If the State Department believes we are unfairly burdened, then that case should be made. But to make it by simply refusing to pay is to act the deadbeat. We are not alone in lateness in paying our share, but we are the major offender and certainly the most conspicuous. It would be nice to hear from the presidential candidates that they don't go for cheating on obligations, whether to the American Express Company or to the United Nations.

<p>The pointed objective of Fidel Castro this time around is to generate pressure to repeal the U.S. embargo. It is nice to see the tatterdemalion prince of universal prosperity through Marxism begging U.S. business to come on down and give him a hand. And on the merits of the argument, there is every reason to restore relations with Cuba given that it is no longer a salient of a global power seeking the overthrow of the United States. We would need to swallow our pride, but then that is healthy: we did not succeed in bringing Castro down, and it is not dignified to salve our bad consciences by continuing policies appropriate only during the Cold War. We are trading with Vietnam and China, and we never really broke off from trading with the Soviet Union, so why Castro?

<p>He made his demonstration at the UN, and sharply, and sadly, reminded us all that if the division within the UN were once again suddenly to return to Communist superpower challenging Western superpower, we'd almost certainly find ourselves face to face with the old lineup. About 80 per cent anti-American. The old juices run strong, anti-, and jealous of, success; there are memories mired in anti-colonialist slogans, and then, too, some defensible skepticism over U.S. leadership. 

<p>But the UN is with us. We should pay our debt, ignore most of its pieties, and make policy as we have always made it, soliciting UN sanction but quite prepared, when necessary, to ignore it.

Deconstruction, American-Style

<p>
<li>Much of this issue is devoted, in one way or another, to race. But then, so is much of American politics. The 
combination of the O.J. verdict and the Million Man March has shifted it to the forefront of politics again, 
temporarily overshadowing even Medicare.
<p>
As so often, however, the lessons being drawn from these events are the opposite of any reasonable 
conclusion. One subtle suggestion, as Mark Cunningham points out, is that the ``attack'' on affirmative 
action is responsible for the signs of increasing division between the races. 
This might be plausible if there had been signs of growing racial harmony before November 1994. In fact, 
as Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence M. Stratton show, racial divisions have been steadily growing in step 
with the increasing scope, enforcement, and blatancy of the racial quotas at the heart of affirmative action. 
Nor is that curious. Race-conscious policies make people conscious of race.
It is alarming, however, that such race-consciousness has now reached the point where many black 
Americans have begun to think of themselves as a separate nation -- a kind of black English-speaking 
Quebec scattered across the American continent.<p>
That is, after all, the candid agenda of the Nation of Islam, of the Million Man March which it sponsored, 
and of influential black scholars and professionals who devote much ingenuity to constitutional schemes 
that would replace majority rule with cantonal democracy, racial vetoes, ``concurrent majorities,'' and 
various forms of racial proportionality.<p>
Until now, such ``fancy franchises'' have been waystations on the road to majority rule (as in South Africa). 
Will America be the first case in which they lead away from it? The question sounds far-fetched. So did the 
idea of racial quotas when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act.
America is now faced with two theories about itself: either it is a single people or it is a federation of many 
peoples. If the former, it will eliminate racial quotas and downplay race-consciousness generally in favor of 
an inclusive American identity. If the latter, it will move gradually toward racial proportionalism and its 
own deconstruction.<p>
These possibilities are incarnated in two men. Colin Powell embodies the inclusive concept of the American 
whose race is a secondary identity, Louis Farrakhan that of the black who has rejected the accident of being 
born American.<p>
Mr. Farrakhan argues his case forcefully; Mr. Powell does not yet seem to know there's a war on.
<p>


<li>Deconstructionism has been the theme of much speculation on the O.J. verdict. It has been claimed 
incessantly that black Americans, on and off the jury, ``saw'' the evidence differently because they brought 
their own experiences (of police brutality, etc.) to the judgment. Since whites had a different experience, 
black and white ``truths'' were different. And never the twain shall meet.
All this is the greatest nonsense. It denies that there is such a thing as truth or objective reality. Indeed, it 
logically implies that Simpson could be both guilty and innocent of his wife's murder -- depending upon 
who's reaching the verdict.<p>
But it is the identical argument used to justify ``diversity'' in the newsrooms of the mainstream press. As the 
diversity-mongers put it, we need black, Hispanic, lesbian, gay, etc. perspectives on the news. 
Of course, they don't know their own theories. Any competent Parisian deconstructionist could tell them 
that you can safely have a newsroom staffed by live white males because the readers create the texts (i.e., 
write the newspapers) by their own interpretations.<p>
Still, think of the Washington Post and the New York Times as newspapers specially tailored to the 
demands of the crowds who celebrated Mr. Simpson's acquittal.  -- JOHN O'SULLIVAN

06-November-1995

<P> 

 
 
<p><li>Watch for our analysis of Louis Farrakhan's speech at the Million Man March, as soon as he finishes it. 
 
<p><li>Was President Clinton coaching him? 
 
<p><li>The conventional wisdom on the march stresses the dignity and decency of most of the men there, and says 
it's too bad that its main political effect will be to enshrine the noxious Louis Farrakhan as black America's 
most significant political leader. All that is true. And any crowd that boos Rep. John Conyers off the stage 
can't be all bad. Conservatives will even be tempted to praise Farrakhan's message of self-reliance and 
middle-class values as a revolt against the social liberalism of the welfare state. But to indulge blacks as 
they follow the lead of a hatemonger is condescending: adults have to be held responsible for their 
affiliations. And their revolt against liberalism is anyway incomplete. In favoring racial separatism, the 
Nation of Islam has taken ideas long favored by the liberal establishment -- separately tracked school 
admissions, racial employment criteria, segregated campus dormitories and congressional districts -- to their 
illogical conclusion. President Clinton is wrong to describe Farrakhan's bigotry as merely ``one man's 
message of malice and division.'' It is incidental neither to his program nor to his appeal to many black 
Americans. Both the uplifting and the ugly sides of Farrakhan's movement flow from an ideology that posits 
blacks as aliens, as members of a proud and separate polity. Farrakhan does not think blacks should wear 
America's uniform or be subject to America's laws, or that non-blacks should own property or run 
businesses in black neighborhoods. The only antidote to this message is the cultivation of an overarching 
sense of an American identity. It will not be promoted by merely biting our lips as Farrakhan becomes a 
power broker in American politics. 
 
<p><li>According to the Washington Times, one rebellious -- we hope -- soul held up a placard that read: ``ELECT 
FARRAKHAN - SIMPSON.'' 
 
<p><li>The campaign to end the income tax continues to gain momentum on Capitol Hill. Reps. Dan Schaefer (R., 
Colo.) and Billy Tauzin (R., La.) have drafted legislation to replace the personal-income, corporate-income, 
capital-gains, and estate taxes with a 16 per cent national sales tax. Not to be outdone, freshman Rep. Joe 
Scarborough of Florida is working on a 10 per cent national sales tax to replace the personal-income tax. To 
those who argue that ending the income tax for good would require repealing the Sixteenth Amendment, 
Rep. Sam Johnson (R., Tex.) has proposed a new constitutional amendment: ``Three years after the 
ratification of this article of amendment, the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
is repealed, and the Congress shall have no power to lay and collect taxes on incomes except in times of 
war.'' Let the Court find the penumbras in that one. 
 
<p><li>President Clinton will soon issue a statement vowing to devote the rest of his life to searching for the real 
killer of the Democratic Party. 
 
<p><li>Under assault for its aggressive agenda, the Legal Services Corporation has been portraying itself as an 
essential provider of legal services to the poor. However, in a recent Capital Research Center newsletter, 
David Wilkinson, inspector general of the LSC from 1989 to 1991, opens a new line of attack, writing that 
``sufficient resources exist to provide legal assistance to the poor without LSC.'' Turns out that more than 
500,000 lawyers contribute nearly 25 million hours a year of pro bono work valued at an estimated $3.4 
billion; this is five times the number of hours worked by LSC attorneys, and eight times the LSC budget. 
The LSC complains that these numbers are too high because they include attorneys who work individually 
rather than through an organization -- although the poor represented by such attorneys surely are 
unconcerned by the difference. These lawyers are also criticized for doing pro bono work that is 
``traditional'' rather than ``controversial.'' In other words, non-LSC lawyers perform the traditional purpose 
of helping poor people, rather than the controversial one of blocking welfare reform and harassing 
employers. 
 
<p><li>Sen. Sam Nunn won't run for re-election in '96, the eighth Democratic incumbent to take a pass. The Iraqi 
army had fewer deserters during the Gulf War. 
 
<p><li>The number of Americans living in poverty declined in 1994. The bad news is that for an economy 
performing so well, the decline -- from 15.1 to 14.5 per cent -- was pitifully small. But is the news really so 
bad? The government's poverty statistics don't count in-kind transfers like food stamps and housing 
subsidies, and they overstate inflation. Income is a famously misleading indicator of need; cf. the banker's 
son who enters the ranks of the poor by moving out of Dad's estate. Nearly 40 per cent of all ``poor'' 
Americans own their homes. Economists who study these issues have developed an alternative poverty 
measure, one based on what people actually consume rather than the money they take in. Consumption 
poverty fell steadily throughout the 1980s. The reputed failure of Reaganomics to ``lift all boats'' seems 
rooted in statistical malpractice. Surely the poverty industry will embrace this more accurate, and more 
hopeful, analytic prism. Well, maybe not. 
 
<p><li>Willie Brown recently encouraged students to, ``basically, just terrorize'' Professor Glynn Custred, co-
author of the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would outlaw state-sponsored affirmative action. This 
from the other side of the debate. 
 
<p><li>Heard any good economist jokes lately? Here's one: In March 1981, 364 economists wrote the Times of 
London to warn that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies were destroying the economy. The punch line: 
a recent New York Times article detailing the mad dash of foreign investors into Britain. Over the past 
decade Britain has become the preferred European location for the big three Japanese automakers (Nissan, 
Toyota, and Honda) and for large Asian electronics manufacturers such as Samsung and Fujitsu, as well as 
for German and French manufacturers seeking expansion beyond their high-cost home markets. American 
companies, building upon a long tradition, invested 7.5 times more in Britain between 1986 and 1993 than 
in Germany. Thatcherism didn't carry the day without a struggle. For years Europe derided Britain's 
economy as being too much like America's. Translation: Job security was sacrificed to economic growth. 
Now, with French unemployment stuck at 11.5 per cent and German labor costs nearly double Britain's, 
Continental policymakers are wondering whether to emulate the British experience. Tax cuts, privatization, 
and deregulation were important. But the biggest piece of the puzzle, according to a prominent German 
industrialist, was the defanging of the unions. This, of course, was the quintessence of Thatcherism -- unless 
it was ignoring establishment economists. 
 
<p><li>Hillary Rodham Clinton was seen in South America, her hair done in an Evita bun. We hope she gets the 
job down there, but she will probably be back. 
 
<p><li>It could have been worse. The Nobel Peace Prize this year could have gone to Jimmy Carter. Instead it went 
to Joseph Rotblat and the East - West arms-control dialogue that has proceeded for nearly forty years under 
the aegis of the Pugwash conference, named for the town in Nova Scotia where it first met. The Pugwash 
gatherings provided one of the earliest networking opportunities for Western and Soviet scientists and 
academics. Pugwash was innocent enough in theory, though too often a forum of agitation against NATO 
defense policies and U.S. negotiating positions. The timing of the prize -- the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima 
-- was invidious too. But the grinding of molars, audible all the way from Plains, Ga., almost makes up for 
it. 
 
<p><li>The New York State Trial Lawyers Association has people walk every block of New York City recording 
any and all cracks in the sidewalks. By sending this record to the city government, they ensure themselves a 
case whenever someone trips. You can't call it ambulance chasing -- they're there before the ambulance 
arrives. 
 
<p><li>Conservative economists on the far side of 45 have a special advantage when it comes to appreciating 
Nobel Prize - winner Robert Lucas's contribution. They were brought up on Paul Samuelson's Economics, 
which demonstrated, with crystalline examples and simple diagrams, how the right mix of government tax 
and monetary policy could banish the business cycle and ensure prosperity, and they came of age as Walter 
Heller and Gardner Ackley seemed to be proving Samuelson right. But then came the 1970s. 
Unemployment and inflation both rocketed to near record levels, violating the Phillips Curve (Samuelson, 
p. 344), in which higher inflation produces less unemployment. Robert Lucas spotted the flaw: When prices 
rise unexpectedly, producers initially think that things really have gotten better. They hire more workers 
until, as invariably happens, the price rise affects things that they themselves buy -- notably labor. Producers 
eventually come to expect this chain of events and are no longer snookered by changes in monetary policy. 
With this simple insight Lucas showed that Emperor Keynes was naked. His critique became a rallying cry 
for young conservatives chafing under the interventionist consensus. 
 
<p><li>It would be kind of opportunistic, but one way Steve Forbes could protest the capital-gains tax is by leading 
a Millionaire Men's March on Washington. 
 
 
<p><li>Even as congressional committees scrutinize the behavior of the FBI and U.S. Marshals at Ruby Ridge and 
Waco, the Environmental Protection Agency has developed its own ``green'' berets -- 147 gun-toting 
Special Agents with power to use force to seize records and make arrests, without court warrants. Sen. 
Lauch Faircloth (R., N.C.) has written the EPA inquiring by what authority its agents brandished guns in a 
raid on a shrimp farm in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in June 1990. The agents claimed the farm was in violation of 
wetlands regulations and seized the farm's records and some cash. Five years later John Pai White, the 
owner, has yet to get his money or his records back, even though no charges have been brought against him. 
In reply, EPA Administrator Carol Browner pointed to two paragraphs in the 1988 Medical Waste Tracking 
Act that give agents the power ``to carry firearms; execute and serve warrants; and make arrests without 
warrants for the investigation of criminal violations of any law administered by the EPA.'' If that isn't bad 
enough, the EPA's ``Firearms Policies and Procedures'' were approved by Attorney General Janet Reno. It's 
a good thing the EPA wasn't sent to investigate kerosene emissions at Waco, or there might have been a 
three-way shootout. 
 
<p><li>NR senior editor Jeffrey Hart is seeking reparations for the efforts of his forebears to end slavery. One was 
a colonel in the Union Army's artillery. Another took time out from his work as an artist to paint 
documentary murals of battle scenes for the Union Army. Several others served in the federal ranks. Mr. 
Hart will be pleased to receive one dollar from every descendant of former slaves. Reparations may be sent 
to him care of NR.

The Hangover
<P>
<P>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 5

<P>The brainy wife of the brainy professor said, ``I think the O.J. verdict should be protested.'' The brainy 
professor said, ``How?''
<P>Indeed. How?
<P>The prattle, in which such as Senator Dole are engaged, is that we must accept the verdict and turn over a 
new leaf. Well, it is one thing to accept the verdict as a juridical reality: Nobody is arguing that O. J. 
Simpson should be sent back to jail. It is quite another thing to abide by the superstition that justice has 
been done. A lot of white folks who lynched black folks in the bad days went scot free because white jurors 
wouldn't convict them. But there are those who left that age with their honor intact: they screamed and 
yelled, and insisted that justice was not done. Screaming and yelling doesn't come naturally to a lot of 
people, but the brainy wife of the brainy professor was right, the verdict should be protested. 
<P>One way to do this is to remark the little filigrees on formal acquittal, and resist their effrontery. Johnnie 
Cochran tells the press moments after the verdict that the will of God has been done, as he knew it would 
be. One sighs: someone who can compare Mark Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler can, one supposes, adduce the will 
of God as motivating the jury's finding. Let us in charity assume that the relatives of O.J. sincerely thought 
him to be innocent, and pass over their bulletins to the effect that justice had been done. But what are we to 
make of O.J.'s solemn declaration that, now that the distraction has been swept away, the police should get 
serious and search out the real killer. He, O.J., will do ``whatever it takes'' to identify him. One way to begin 
this search is for everyone to submit a blood sample to the laboratories. And then ask the one out of 28 
million with the telltale blood -- that adds up to about thirty people, sprinkled about in Tibet, Tierra del 
Fuego, and Kazakhstan -- what they were doing on the night of June 12, 1994.
<P>And yes, we really should equip ourselves against hit-and-run self-vindication by legerdemain. Johnnie 
Cochran was on <i>Larry King Live</i> on Wednesday saying what you would expect, the phone rings, and lo! 
O.J. is on the line. He says serene things, and then chastises a woman who had called in to ask Mr. Cochran 
to explain the shadowy creature who had been identified by the limo driver as coming into the Rockingham 
driveway just before 11 the night of the murders. O.J. says, Did the woman not<i> listen</i> to the witness, because 
the witness, if you followed him carefully, had said something quite different, and oh! how much he, O.J., 
had suffered from people drawing conclusions from the testimony which the testifiers had simply not said, 
understand?
<P>It is on the order of rising to say, ``I told you there wasn't a purple cow on the property that night, DID I 
NOT?'' People begin nodding their heads. We are off to the races with the reconstruction of the scene that 
night in June, one little piece at a time. 
<P>What effect will the verdict have on the career of Colin Powell, somebody asked? Answer: One would hope 
none. But there is most definitely a danger there. When 75 per cent of black Americans believe that the 
answer is A, not B, and 75 per cent of white Americans believe that the answer is B, not A, then what we 
have is a breakdown in communication between two cultures. Either we share a common language and a 
common rational apparatus or we do not. It is a very very scary thing when three-quarters of one ethnic 
group flatly disagree with three-quarters of another ethnic group about the structure of rational arguments. It 
is simply wrong to suppose that the white majority believed O.J. to be guilty because he was black. It is 
simply undeniable that the black majority believed him innocent because he was black. And -- remarkably -- 
those figures remained static throughout those endless months of testimony. It was tempting for the white 
majority to conclude that the black majority was engaged in iconolatry. O.J. is a hero and that is the end of 
it. 
<P>Not entirely hard to understand. If the spelunkers were to come up from their caves with evidence that St. 
Francis of Assisi ate live pigeons for breakfast, there are those of us who would simply refuse to believe it. 
Legends, to be legendary, must be sacred, inviolate. But this is not to dodge the question: Yes. If the 
innocence of O.J. is a black postulate, then intercommunication has suffered a quite awful setback.

06-November-1995

<P>

<P>IN the 1930s, when James Burnham, later a founding editor of this magazine, was a young professor 
becoming committed to Marxism, he was recruited by Earl Browder, the head of the American Communist 
Party. Browder managed to explain all his party's doctrines but one: its endorsement, as dictated by Stalin's 
latest inspiration, of a separate state in the South for American blacks. Burnham knew that was a non-
starter, and moved on to Trotsky.
<P>How is it that what seemed fantastic sixty years ago, even in the heart of 
the totalitarian Left, can draw a Million Men (give or take a few hundred thousand) to Washington, and 
only ad hominem criticism of the march's sponsors?
<P>There is a black American identity, partly out of free 
choice, partly because centuries of racism have been perversely reinforced by thirty years of misguided 
liberalism. Busing, quotas, affirmative action, wars on poverty (read: black poverty), urban renewal (read: 
inner-city renewal), victimology, multiculturalism, diversity -- all conspire to set blacks apart, not in an 
affirmation of their culture or way of life, but because they are persuaded to feel they have no alternative in 
a racist white-majority America which wishes them ill.
<P>This ``community,'' so artificially maintained and so 
carefully hedged about, is experiencing a vacuum of leadership just now. Jesse Jackson has gone nowhere. 
The Congressional Black Caucus is a bunch of gerrymandered petty chieftains, who lost their institutional 
clout when the GOP took Congress. Black clergymen -- and this is a bad legacy of Martin Luther King -- 
have become what Burke called political theologians and theological politicians, as distracted in their way 
as their soulmates in the pulpits of the white Protestant mainstream. Into this void stepped Louis Farrakhan -
- scenery-chewing orator; leader of a thuggish cult; possible conniver in the murder of Malcolm X; inspired 
by visions from UFOs; expounder of the view that whites are devils produced by a prehistoric experiment in 
dysgenics on the island of Patmos; apologist for slavers, so long as they are Moslems who pay him off. This 
was his march; he was its ``onlie begetter.'' 
<P>But take Farrakhan out of the march -- and Alton Maddox, the 
lawyer who defended the hoaxster Tawana Brawley, and Farrakhan's aide, Khalid Mohammed, who praised 
the racist murderer Colin Ferguson -- and would the march have been the worthy thing that earnest liberals 
claimed?
<P>Self-help is a good thing -- if the self is helped to the right goals. It is not good for blacks to talk up 
economic nationalism (even if they don't use Farrakhan's imagery of ``bloodsuckers'' to describe non-blacks 
who deal in black neighborhoods). Korean storeowners provide services for their customers. If a black 
storeowner wants to provide the service, let him offer a better product or a lower price. If responsibility is 
the goal, why converge on Washington -- fount of the handouts that have done blacks such damage? Yes, 
that's where King marched in 1963 -- but by then, he was calling for welfare-state liberalism too.
<P>The religious revival is an old feature of American life -- older than independence. And celebrations of ethnicity 
have also been welcome, so long as they were combinations of good clean fun and Tocquevillian mediating 
institutions: the Columbus Day parade and the charitable society. There was a lot of this mixed up in the 
Million Man March. But American leaders, both black and white, have to sift it all out, and condemn the 
alloys.
<P>Colin Powell, concluding his book tour cum campaign swing, had an ideal chance to do so, and he 
wimped out. ``Let's let the people at the march make the judgment,'' he told reporters in New York on march 
day. ``Let's trust them to make an informed decision [about] what is wisdom, and what is not wisdom.'' But 
that's what leaders are supposed to do. Instead, he worked at earning back his advance, and becoming 
President-by-coronation.
<P>America will never become two literal nations. But, without hard thinking from 
men who would be leaders, and men who would be millions, we can be a house divided against itself -- and, 
pace Lincoln, such houses can stand, unhappily, for a long, long time.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>generation</font> after the civil-rights movement, Americans are once again engaged in a radical rethinking of their attitudes toward race. Racial preferences are now opposed by the vast majority of Americans; even among blacks, there is a new and vibrant diversity of opinion on the subject. Yet so far no one has questioned the very premises of the discussion. The basic assumption of our current racial debate is still that racism is the theory and discrimination is the practice. Racism is said to be based on ``prejudices,'' which constitute judgments made in the absence of evidence, and ``stereotypes,'' which are grossly misleading generalizations about groups. The obvious solutions, promoted by Martin Luther King and other activists, were twofold: statutes intended to outlaw racial discrimination, and social and educational programs to increase interaction between groups. As whites regularly lived and worked with blacks, their attitudes and actions toward them were expected to undergo a transformation, as ignorant prejudices gave way to enlightened acceptance.
<P>
As a result of these policies, state-sponsored segregation is dead; overt and arbitrary racial discrimination has greatly abated; white attitudes have undergone a revolutionary transformation in favor of equal rights in employment, housing, voting, and education; and there is a large and thriving black middle class. Yet, at the same time, the prevailing civil-rights model, and the laws and policies based on it, now seem irrelevant to contemporary problems, such as the lurid sufferings of the underclass, which have worsened over the past few decades. Consequently the debate seems to have been polarized and stalled by the crosscurrents of white backlash, black rage, and liberal despair. African American scholar Derrick Bell conveys some of the regnant frustration: ``We have made progress in everything, yet nothing has changed.''
<P>
Perhaps one way to gain an enlarged perspective on our current situation is to step back and turn our assumptions into questions. Are there circumstances in which discrimination actually makes sense? Are people who discriminate against people of other races by definition racist? Might prejudices reflect not ignorant predisposition but prudent judgment?
<P><P> 
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> problems with the prevailing civil-rights paradigm become evident when we examine the most widely cited contemporary example of racial discrimination -- the refusal of many taxidrivers to pick up young African-American males. In a recent article, Gregory Wright commented in the <I>Washington Post</I>:
<P>
<blockquote>
As an African American, I am fed up with having to flag down five cabs before finding one that will take me home, fed up with feeling anger, embarrassment, and frustration when cabdrivers swear they are off-duty and then pick up a white customer before I can get around the corner. Taxidrivers, many of whom come from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, say they don't want to pick up African-American passengers because they are afraid of being robbed, assaulted, or murdered. One Nigerian cabdriver told me he only picks up African Americans who are well dressed and look like businessmen. For African Americans, this discrimination can be inconvenient and downright humiliating.</blockquote>
<P>

It is easy to sympathize with the indignation expressed at such flagrant acts of racial discrimination. Yet according to Wright's own account, many of the cabdrivers who are reluctant to pick up young African-American males are themselves African, Caribbean, or Middle Eastern.  Moreover, the Nigerian cited by Wright says explicitly that he will pick up blacks who are suitably dressed. His discrimination seems to be based not simply on skin color but on other aspects of appearance.
<P>
During my travels I took up the issue with a number of taxidrivers in New York, Washington, Chicago, and other cities. Most of them denied that they refuse to pick up every black male, and all ridiculed the notion that cabdrivers pass up black women. But many groused that African-American passengers frequently leave no tip and sometimes beat the fare, and virtually all acknowledged that as a consequence of previous threats, robberies, and assaults they employ a kind of heightened scrutiny before they will stop for a young black man.
<P>
``This racism stuff is all bull --  -- ,'' one African student who was driving to put himself through school, told me. ``I'm not going to pass up a fare, which is money in my pocket. But I don't want to get robbed. You know what the black crime rate is in New York? Do you want me to risk a gun to my head, man? What's wrong with you?''
<P>
A white driver in Chicago told me, ``No exceptions, pal. I never pick up niggers.''
<P>
``You don't like blacks?'' I asked.
<P>
``Not blacks. Niggers.''
<P>
``That sounds like racism to me.''
<P>
``Hey, that's c---- . I pick up older blacks all the time. I have no problem with giving black women a ride. My black buddies won't pick up no niggers. I ain't no more racist than they are.''
<P>
These concerns seem to be borne out by cabdriver muggings and killings. In August 1994, Keith Moore, a 38-year-old cabdriver and single father, was found with the keys in the ignition and two bullet wounds in his head. His friends told the <I>Washington Post</I> that he never worried about picking up passengers in questionable neighborhoods no matter what the time of day. If Moore had exercised prudence, his colleague Louis Richardson said, he probably would be alive today. The U.S. Labor Department recently reported that driving a cab is the riskiest job in America, with occupational homicide rates higher than those for bartenders, gas-station attendants, and policemen.
<P>
These facts suggest how hollow it sounds to accuse cabdrivers of ``prejudice'' and ``stereotypes.'' While we can be sure that racist taxidrivers would discriminate, not all taxidrivers who discriminate are racist.
<P>
<P>
<font size=+3>M</font><font size=+1>ICHELLE</font> Joo, an Asian-American shopkeeper in Washington, D.C., acknowledges that she discriminates based on race. When deciding whether to let people into her jewelry and cosmetics store, she tells the <I>Washington Post</I>, ``I look at the face.'' She won't open the door ``if he looks ugly, if he's holding a bottle in a paper bag, if he's dirty. . . . If some guy looks kind, I let him in.'' Young black men are kept out if they seem rowdy, Miss Joo says. Usually they react by banging on her glass windows. One may say that Michelle Joo has no fixed policy of keeping blacks out. Nor does she have a quota about the number she will admit. Rather, she seems to be a prudent statistician. She employs race as one factor, but not the only factor, in her decision-making. As a means to ensure her security and business survival, she is practicing what may be termed rational discrimination.
<P>
Thousands of other store owners in major cities make similar decisions every day. So do countless women -- black, white, Hispanic, and Asian -- who come across black males in circumstances they consider not entirely safe. Regardless of their general attitudes about civil rights, they do what they feel is necessary in each particular case. Shopkeepers scurry to the front of the store where they can monitor the exit. Female pedestrians may clutch their purse more tightly or cross the street if approached by one or more young black men. Sometimes people snap the locks on their car doors as African-American youths walk by.
<P>
The psychological toll of such reactions is high. If you are black, columnist William Raspberry says, it is unusual to find yourself treated as an individual, and to receive the kind of consideration that whites expect. In <I>The Rage of a Privileged Class</I>, Ellis Cose describes a typical justification for black rage: ``Why am I constantly treated as if I were a drug addict, a thief, or a thug?'' Many who echo these sentiments also question the basis for group judgments about blacks. Legal scholar Charles Ogletree argues that ``99 per cent of black people don't commit crimes.''
<P>
Blacks make up approximately 12 per cent of the nation's population. Yet according to Uniform Crime Reports, published annually by the FBI, blacks account for 39 per cent of those arrested for aggravated assault, 42 per cent of those arrested for weapons possession, 43 per cent of those arrested for rape, 55 per cent of those arrested for murder, and 61 per cent of those arrested for robbery. Even discounting for the possibility of some racial bias in criminal arrests, it seems clear that the average black person is between three and six times as likely to be arrested for a crime as the average white person.
<P>
Young black males are arrested and convicted of crimes at an astonishingly high rate. According to the Sentencing Project, a liberal advocacy group, about 25 per cent of young black men in America are in prison, on probation, or on parole on any given day. For whites, the figure is 6 per cent. In major cities, the figures for young black men are even higher.
<P>
Jesse Jackson acknowledged the cultural pathology of violence among inner-city blacks when he said, ``There is nothing more painful for me than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start to think about robbery, and then see it's somebody white and feel relieved.'' Faced with immediate criticism from other black activists, Jackson hurried to ``clarify'' his views and deny that he meant what he said. But several African-American scholars have made the same point. Johnnetta Cole writes that among black women ``one of the most painful admissions I hear is: I am afraid of my own people.'' Given black crime rates, Howard University education professor Kenneth Tollett says, ``The statements we have called stereotypes in the past have become true.''
<P>
Personally I would be angry and upset if, as a law-abiding person, I were routinely treated as a criminal by taxidrivers, storekeepers, or pedestrians. Yet, equally predictably, taxidrivers, storekeepers, and women who clutch their purses or cross the street will attach little significance to such personal and historical sensitivities. Such people are unlikely to be intimidated by accusations of prejudice. For them, the charges are meaningless, because the prejudice is warranted. In this context, a bigot is simply a sociologist without credentials.
<P><P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>T IS</font> now time to examine with fresh eyes the meaning of familiar terms such as prejudice and stereotype, which underlie the conventional liberal understanding of racism. African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates writes: ``Racism exists when one generalizes about attributes of an individual, and treats him or her accordingly.'' Gates offers some specific examples: ``You people sure can dance,'' and ``Black people play basketball so remarkably well.'' He concludes, ``These are racist statements.'' But are they?
<P>
In his classic work, <I>The Nature of Prejudice</I>, published in 1954, Gordon Allport drew on modern social-science theories to explicate the paradigm of liberal anti-racism.  Allport argued that prejudices and stereotypes reveal less about their objects than their subjects. Applying such concepts as displacement and frustration-aggression theory, Allport maintained that when people feel hostility and anger which they have difficulty coping with, they project it onto others, who thus become sacrificial victims or ``scapegoats.'' Allport helped to establish a premise that many social scientists continue to hold today: prejudices and stereotypes endure because of the principle of self-selection. From the distorted perspective of the racist, blacks who do not conform to preconceived notions simply do not exist; they are, in Ralph Ellison's term, invisible men.
<P>
For the better part of a generation, this liberal understanding of racism worked fairly well. The reason was that both whites and blacks had indeed developed many erroneous views about each other as a consequence of the social isolation produced by Southern segregation. During slavery the races stayed in regular, even intimate, contact, but after emancipation the forced separation of the races created a divided society in which dubious and even absurd generalizations could endure, unchecked by contrary experience. The civil-rights movement's assault on prejudices and stereotypes, as well as the experience of desegregation, helped to topple many such group generalizations that could not withstand empirical examination.
<P>
The problem with the liberal paradigm is its premise that <I>all</I> group perceptions are misperceptions. Paradoxically it is desegregation and integration which have called the liberal view into question. One of the risks of increased exposure to blacks is that it has placed whites in a position to discover which of their preconceived views are true.
<P>
In fact ethnic groups which have had little history of oppressing each other now seem to be formulating clear and often critical images of other groups. In one of the more remarkable surveys of recent years, the National Conference of Christians and Jews reports that many minority groups harbor much more hostile attitudes toward other minority groups than whites do. For example, 49 per cent of blacks and 68 per cent of Asians said that Hispanics ``tend to have bigger families than they can support.'' Forty-six per cent of Hispanics and 42 per cent of blacks agreed that Asian  Americans are ``unscrupulous, crafty, and devious in business.'' And 53 per cent of Asians and 51 per cent of Hispanics affirmed that blacks ``are more likely to commit crimes and violence.''
<P>
It is, of course, possible that these minority perceptions reveal that, by a kind of social osmosis, everyone is learning racism from whites. But if so, why would minority perceptions be stronger than those of whites who are the alleged racists par excellence? More likely, these intergroup minority perceptions are the product of experience. Most people today have fairly regular contact with others of different races, and have many opportunities to verify their collective judgments about other groups.
<P>
During my speaking trips to college campuses, I decided, as a journalistic exercise, to test people's perception of group traits by raising the question of whether stereotypes may be true and prejudices based on them therefore legitimate. Inevitably, I encountered strong emotional opposition. Educated people today have been taught to despise group generalizations. In a sense, we have been raised to be prejudiced against prejudice.
<P>
Recently on a West Coast campus, I raised the question of whether, as a group, ``blacks have rhythm.'' A professor of Afro-American Studies insisted, ``Absolutely not,'' and a number of white students readily agreed. Instinctively, they raised the familiar defenses, ``I know a black man who can't dance.'' ``How can you generalize about a group that is so diverse?'' ``What about Elvis? He had rhythm, and he wasn't black,'' and so on. I pointed out that these were poor refutations of a proposition that was being offered as true on average, or compared with the experience of other groups. One cannot rebut the statistically irrefutable statement that men on average are taller than women by producing a six-foot woman and a four-foot man. Those individuals would merely constitute exceptions to a general pattern that has persisted across cultures for most of recorded history.
<P>
Incidentally, the view that blacks tend to be more rhythmic than whites is no whimsical recent invention but is supported by observation and experience in several cultures over two millennia. In ancient Greece and Rome, which held no negative view of black skin color, Ethiopians and other blacks were celebrated for a perceived natural inclination to music and dance. This is a central theme of that segment of Greek and Roman art which focuses on blacks. Moreover, the same perception of blacks is evident in many Arab descriptions of African blacks written in the late Middle Ages. Ibn Butlan, for example, writes that if a black man was dropped from heaven ``he would beat time as he goes down.'' The Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun attributed the black African proclivity for music to the relaxing influence of the sun's heat.
<P>
On one point the liberal paradigm about group generalizations is sound: people's perceptions of others are always filtered through the lens of their own prior experience. But the liberal understanding cannot explain how particular traits come to be identified with particular groups. Only because group traits have an empirical basis in shared experience can we invoke them without fear of serious contradiction. Think how people would react if someone said, ``Koreans are lazy,'' or ``Hispanics are constantly trying to find ways to make money.'' Despite the prevalence of anti-Semitism, Jews are rarely accused of stupidity. Blacks are never accused of being tight with a dollar, or of conspiring to take over the world. By reversing stereotypes we can see how their persistence relies, not simply on the assumptions of the viewer, but also on the characteristics of the group being described.
<P>
This is no case for group traits having a biological foundation. Probably the vast majority of group traits are entirely cultural, the distilled product of many years of shared experience. Yet prejudices and stereotypes are not intended to explain the origins of group traits, only to take into account their existence. Nor is this an argument to emphasize negative traits. Stereotypes can be negative or positive. Indeed the same stereotype can be interpreted favorably or unfavorably. One can deplore Roman machismo or admire Roman manliness; deride Spanish superstition or exalt Spanish piety; ridicule English severity or cherish English self-control. In each of these interpretations, we see a single set of facts, a different set of values.
<P>
William Helmreich, in <I>The Things They Say Behind Your Back</I>, takes up the issue of whether there is a rational basis for group stereotypes. Helmreich finds some stereotypes that are clearly false. During the Middle Ages, for example, apparently many Christians took religious polemic literally and came to believe that Jews have horns. Clearly this was not a perception destined to last: one has only to encounter a few Jews to discover that they do not, in fact, possess horns.
<P>
Helmreich takes up other stereotypes, however, such as the view that many Nobel laureates are Jewish, or that the Mafia is largely made up of Italians, or that the Japanese tend to be xenophobic and nationalistic, or that many Irishmen and American Indians drink enormous quantities of alcohol. Basically Helmreich finds that these perceptions are confirmed by the data. Of all the stereotypes he considers, Helmreich concludes that ``almost half the stereotypes have a strong factual basis.''
<P>
Thus the liberal assumptions that groups do not differ and that group generalizations are irrational turn out to be wrong. Indeed they generate a civil-rights paradigm which is at variance with most people's direct observation of the world. We would do better to acknowledge the reality of group traits and ask how we should act on it.
<P><P>

<font size=+3>R</font><font size=+1>ATIONAL</font> discrimination is not limited to the exasperating but relatively inconsequential actions of taxidrivers and storekeepers; it is also quite pervasive in other areas, notably hiring.
<P>
In one of the most famous demonstrations of the persistence of hiring discrimination, in 1991 the Urban Institute sent ten black and ten white testers to apply for a range of private-sector jobs in Chicago and Washington, D.C. The testers were matched in pairs with very similar appearances, deportments, and credentials. The Institute found that in 67 per cent of cases neither candidate received a job offer; in 13 per cent, both did; in 15 per cent, only the white tester received an offer; and in 5 per cent, only the black tester did.
<P>
Although these results hardly prove, as the Institute concluded, that racial discrimination against blacks is ``widespread and entrenched,'' they do suggest that it continues to exist. Curiously, however, the Institute study found that white and black employers were equally likely to discriminate. This suggests the possibility that discrimination persists because in some cases it is efficient; it makes economic sense.
<P>
Conventional economic theory holds that arbitrary racial discrimination is economically costly. The reason was explained years ago by economist Gary Becker: employers who refuse to hire the best person for the job are likely to suffer relative to their competition. Even discrimination based on arbitrary features such as race can be profitable, however, when the cost of discrimination is lower than the transaction cost of evaluating candidates individually.
<P>
Consider the case of a chain of stores seeking to hire entry-level workers recruited mainly from the local high-school. Let us assume, further, that African Americans as a group have substantially higher crime rates than whites, Hispanics, or Asians. Employers could disregard this fact and carefully scrutinize the individual history and character of each applicant. This would certainly be the ideal course of action. But employers, who are in business to make a profit, may reason that entry-level jobs do not warrant the expenditure of time and effort to investigate every applicant's personal history. The employer may save transaction costs by simply keeping the number of blacks hired to a minimum.
<P>
That the discrimination unearthed by the Urban Institute study was probably rational is suggested by its finding that the race of the interviewer showed no correlation with the likelihood of engaging in discrimination. Discrimination practiced equally by white and black employers is likely to be discrimination that does not depend on racist intentions, but rather applies the logic of predictive evaluation, discriminating against people in high-risk categories. Race is not being singled out here: employers may have similar rational reasons for their reluctance to hire women, who may get pregnant and leave, or the elderly, who are more likely to fall ill, or young people, who may prove less reliable as employees.
<P>
In Chicago, one of the sites of the Urban Institute study, Joleen Kirschenman and Kathryn Neckerman interviewed employers about their motives for hiring and found support for the rational-discrimination hypothesis.<br>

 -- In general, one construction-company owner said, for urban blacks ``the quality of education is not as great as white folk from the suburbs, and it shows.''<br>
 -- Another employer remarked, ``The Polish immigrants that I know are more highly motivated than the Hispanics.''<br>
 -- One manufacturer said, ``We are not shutting out any black specifically, but I will say that our experience has been bad.''<P>
The authors conclude that employers are using race as a proxy for ``aspects of productivity that are relatively expensive or impossible to measure.'' Many employers do seem to recognize diversity among blacks, often describing a particular individual as a good prospect, ``the exception to the rule.'' Nevertheless, employers do use group generalizations, so that in Kirschenman and Neckerman's view, ``black job applicants, unlike their white counterparts, must indicate to employers that the stereotypes do not apply to them.''
<P>
Rational discrimination may be difficult to understand in hiring, yet its economic justification is obvious in other areas. Insurance companies, for example, have no special dislike for teenage boys, but they charge them higher rates than female and older drivers. This is very unfair to an individual teenage boy who is a skilled and cautious driver, because he is penalized on account of the statistical habits of a group he did not voluntarily join. Yet even with reasonably thorough personal information, companies are not in a good position to predict individual behavior.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>S</font> discrimination based on race necessarily racist? Not if you define racism as a doctrine of intrinsic superiority and inferiority, which leads to judgments against a group on grounds of biology rather than conduct. Indeed, the existence of rational discrimination compels us to revise the liberal paradigm which holds that racism is the theory and discrimination is the practice. The two may be unconnected. It is possible to be a racist and not discriminate: this would be true of many poor and marginalized whites who might hate blacks and consider them inferior, but who are not in a position to enforce their convictions. So too it is possible to discriminate and not be a racist: this would constitute rational discrimination.
<P>
Just because discrimination can be rational, however, does not mean that it is always moral. When individuals and companies make decisions not to go to great lengths to ensure that they are not misjudging any particular person, they are sacrificing the just treatment of individuals at the altar of security, convenience, or profits. Even though such judgments may be prudent and realistic, they are not, strictly speaking, fair. Rational discrimination based on unalterable traits is problematic in a way that discrimination against high-school dropouts and convicted felons is not.
<P>
Thus the question of whether rational discrimination should be legal is a real one. The new public-policy dilemma is based on the recognition that discrimination sometimes makes practical sense, and that such discrimination forces a choice in which the claims of morality are on one side, and the claims of rationality and productivity are on the other.
<P>
We have, in fact, three models of how to deal with the persistence of discrimination. The first is affirmative action. Some advocates, such as legal scholar David Strauss, argue that racial preferences are an essential remedy for rational discrimination. Yet this argument is specious. After all, rational discrimination is objectionable because it treats competent individuals as incompetent on account of their involuntary membership in a disfavored group. This is hardly remedied by racial preferences which treat comparatively incompetent individuals as competent on account of their membership in a favored group.
<P>
The second approach is to make all discrimination, including rational discrimination, illegal in the public and private sector. This was Martin Luther King's solution, and it remains attractive to most Americans. Yet such a solution, although a vast improvement over the current system of racial preferences, would require massive state intervention in the private sector to unmask and punish discriminators, including minority firms which prefer to hire members of their own group, and other employers whose only sin amounts to engaging in rational behavior.
<P>
Then there is a third, and venerable option which was once considered liberal, but which has been virtually forgotten. In a free society, which maintains a distinction between the private and public sphere, rational discrimination is far more problematic when perpetrated by institutions of government than by private individuals and institutions. The reason is that in a democracy the government is responsible to all its citizens, who have a right to demand that they be treated as individuals equally under the law. Thus a new option emerges: the government should be strictly race-neutral, but private actors would be free to discriminate. In this scenario, rational discrimination would be legal, and so would private-sector affirmative action.
<P>
I can already hear the gasps of civil-rights activists, who are so wedded to the paradigm of old struggles that they cannot see what is obvious to the generation born after the civil-rights movement: Bull Connor is dead, and the <I>ancien r&#233gime</I> is finished. True, there will be employers who will refuse to hire blacks, and some may even post signs that say ``No African Americans Need Apply.'' So what? Irrational discrimination of this sort is harmful only when it is comprehensive in scope -- when everyone discriminates. On the other hand, if only some employers discriminate, then competitive markets impose the main financial cost of discrimination on the discriminator, where it belongs.
<P>
Thus we arrive at a supreme irony: perhaps the best way to save affirmative action is to abolish the civil-rights laws, or rather, to limit their employment provisions to government conduct. This would be not a repudiation of the civil-rights movement but its natural fulfillment. Only such a bold strategy establishes a framework of state-neutrality and personal freedom that permits citizens of all backgrounds to pursue their competing utopias, and offers a realistic way out of our current thicket.

9-OCTOBER-1995
<P>

<p>



<LI>John Paul II's book tour will be less extensive than Colin Powell's, and rightly so: he is only the Vicar of Christ.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>Do people, and the businesses they form, have a presumptive right to the money they earn? Or do they get to keep some portion of it only as a favor from the Federal Government? That's the question at issue in a dispute over the meaning of the term ``corporate welfare'' -- and astonishingly enough, the usually sound conservative Rep. Bill Archer (R., Tex.) is on the wrong side of it. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee wants to eliminate about sixty business tax preferences over the next seven years to help balance the budget. But to end a tax break without reducing tax rates amounts to a tax increase -- which, political junkies might recall, Republicans are supposed to be against. If Congress really wants to attack ``corporate welfare,'' it should abolish the Export - Import Bank, agribusiness subsidies, and tariffs. Giving other people's money to select businesses is welfare; letting them keep more of their own is not.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>House Republican efforts to dismantle the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) are in danger of falling victim to the McCollum syndrome, an illness marked by the eager willingness to accept half-a-loaf legislation that afflicts the chronically behind-the-curve Florida Republican. Bill McCollum, joined by Judiciary Committee Democrats, failed in his bid to scrap at the committee level a proposal by George Gekas (R., Pa.) to block-grant LSC funds to the states. But McCollum did succeed in increasing funding for LSC and stretching it out over several years. Conservatives rightly consider this a betrayal of the deal the House leadership cut earlier this year to end LSC funding after two years. McCollum explains: ``The very essence of being a conservative is a desire to preserve the underpinnings of the democratic system, and this [the LSC] is one of them.'' The House leadership hopes to strip the weakening amendments out of the legislation on the floor. Senator Phil Gramm, meanwhile, managed to get a tough Gekas-like bill out of committee, but faces a possible stiff challenge on the Senate floor (perhaps led by Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici). The upshot of all this may eventually be that the LSC gets the axe. But in Washington these days nothing pays like revolutionary skepticism.

<LI>The first contributor to the ``If I Were President'' column in <I>George</I> magazine was Madonna. Yeah, it was frivolous -- but Steve Forbes has less money, and Arlen Specter has the same positions on social issues.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>From a shoebox in Pat Robertson's garage to a 1.7-million-member organization. From political outcasts  -- ``poor, uneducated, easy to command,'' as the <I>Washington Post</I> once put it -- to presidential kingmakers. The Christian Coalition celebrated a political passage at its annual ``Road to Victory'' conference in Washington. All the GOP presidential candidates -- except Pete Wilson and the uninvited Arlen Specter -- were there to tout their social-conservative credentials. And Robertson could quote a recent article describing the Coalition as the dominant force in 18 state Republican parties -- and counting. ``We have gained what we have always sought,'' declared Executive Director Ralph Reed. ``A place at the table.'' The transformation of evangelical Protestants into a powerful, impossible-to-ignore electoral bloc -- by one estimate the Coalition mobilized 4 million activists and 50 million voters last year -- will keep ``the culture'' front and center in American politics. Of course some fear the GOP's becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pat Robertson -- a groundless fear when Catholics, Jews, non-evangelical Protestants, and hard-headed agnostics account for more than half of the <I>conservative</I> coalition. Perhaps a more likely danger is the Christian Coalition's becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of a GOP which will not always behave as the Coalition would like. A place at the table is worth having only if on occasion you can walk away from it.

<p>



<LI>A new nationwide poll conducted by Adams Research for <I>Talk Daily</I> flattens the media myth that talk-radio listeners are rednecks and morons. The survey finds that listeners have higher annual incomes than the national average, are twice as likely to be college graduates, and are politically active (92 per cent are registered voters). A whopping two-thirds of listeners regard talk radio as an ``important source of political information and ideas.'' And they're everywhere: one in six Americans has listened to Rush et al. in the last 48 hours, three out of ten in the past week. Such talk is music to our ears.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>One advantage the Left has long enjoyed is its ability to get funds coercively, in the form of tax dollars and compulsory union dues. Since last year's elections, taxpayer funds have permitted the advocacy Left (e.g., groups like the National Council of Senior Citizens, 90 per cent federally funded) to fight the new majority's agenda on the balanced budget, Medicare savings, and welfare reform. Conservative freshmen in the House are eager to strip the Left of that advantage. Their vehicle is the Istook - McIntosh - Ehrlich amendment, an appropriations rider that would prohibit non-profit organizations that receive federal grants from spending more than 5 per cent of their budgets on lobbying. Liberal special interests have fought back ferociously, enlisting prestigious organizations like the YMCA, the March of Dimes, and the American Red Cross to lead the battle. And the strategy has worked with liberal Republicans, to the extent that Arlen Specter stripped the rider out of the HHS/Labor appropriations bill, and Mark Hatfield and James Jeffords are resisting efforts to attach it to the Treasury/Postal appropriations bill. Now, however, scores of freshmen have indicated that they will vote against the bill unless it includes the rider. The House leadership may not understand this freshman intransigence. The people back home will.

<LI>Democrats were indignant when Republicans issued a ``Wanted'' poster with pictures of Democratic politicians, including many women and minorities. Now Majority '96, a Democratic group, has compiled a list of 33 House seats it's targeting in the next election, including those of Gary Franks, Andrea Seastrand, Linda Smith, Helen Chenoweth, and J. C. Watts. That's one-fifth of the Republican women (and almost half the conservative women) in Congress, and 100 per cent of the black Republicans. A coincidence, we're sure.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>House leaders traditionally refrain from making presidential-primary endorsements. Majority Leader Dick Armey broke that tradition by announcing his support for Phil Gramm, saying that he could not inflict another Bush Administration on his children. So Gramm has swept the economists in Congress.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>It was the first rumpus of the Age of Newt. After being sworn in as Speaker, Mr. Gingrich appointed Christina Jeffrey, a former colleague from Georgia academic life, to be House Historian. Democrats spotted a critical 1986 review she had written of ``Facing History and Ourselves,'' a Holocaust-education program for schools. It took a lot of selective quotation to turn Mrs. Jeffrey's critique into evidence of anti-Semitism and Nazi sympathy, but Reps. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Barney Frank (D., Mass.) were up to the task. Gingrich buckled under the barrage -- though subsequently, he showed the courage and the decency to regret publicly his loss of nerve. Now Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, has declared that the ADL is ``satisfied that any characterization of [Mrs. Jeffrey] as anti-Semitic or sympathetic to Nazism is entirely unfounded and unfair'' -- a creditable statement. He also accepted her invitation to co-sponsor a conference on Holocaust education at Kennesaw State College in Georgia, where she now teaches. No sign yet from Messrs. Schumer and Frank -- who slandered an innocent woman and exploited a catastrophe in order to score political brownie points -- that they have faced this bit of history, or themselves.

<LI>Who's the richest one of all? Australians, according to a new study by the World Bank, are worth an average of $835,000 per capita, putting them at the top of the heap. The U.S., at $421,000 per capita, ranks a mere 12th, behind such stellar performers as Iceland, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The catch? Along with income and man-made wealth, these figures include the value of a nation's untapped natural resources, i.e., all the outback gold and silver or Gulf oil available to future generations. But how valuable will those resources be to someone a hundred years from now? When measured relative to wages, the prices of natural resources today are half what they were in 1980, and only one-eighth what they were in 1900. Real oil prices dropped 62 per cent between 1980 and 1992. Food is 49 per cent cheaper. Prices of most resources shoot up during wars or when the government imposes price controls, but quickly fall again when markets are allowed to allocate resources freely. The Greens have it all wrong: countries that husband natural resources will become ever less wealthy relative to those that turn them into something useful. We'd short Iceland and go long on the United States.

<LI>Genuflecting to the multiculturalists, General Mills is reincarnating Betty Crocker. By combining 75 ethnically diverse faces, the company plans to cook up a new image for its homemaker which truly reflects the diversity in our country. No word yet on whether Aunt Jemima will be thrown into the mix.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>Preparing for a possible train wreck, the State Department asked each ambassador to provide a list of essential personnel, with a justification of their essentialness. The result has been a mad scramble as worried diplomats rush to justify their embassy's particular mission. Although several embassies are rightly concerned about having continuous support at a sensitive time (e.g., those handling the Bosnian peace negotiations), others are more worried about losing face over the diplomatic grapevine (``Did you hear, Bob got only ten 'essentials' while Jim held out for fifteen?''). How else to explain David Aaron's cable stating that his entire staff of 44 at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is essential? His assertion is remarkable considering that no one knows exactly what the OECD does. Aaron's cable explains that fall is the busiest season at the OECD (just like the fashion industry). What happens during the other three it doesn't say. 

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>Will State classify Pamela Harriman's pastry cook as ``essential personnel''? We'll never know, since, under French law, the U.S. has to pay local employees even if they're furloughed.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>But a tip of the hat to Ambassador Donald McConnell in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, who concluded that 30 per cent of his American staff was not essential. Must be more tempting to go native in Paris than in Ouagadougou.

<p>

<p>



<LI>When Tina Brown, hip editor of <I>The New Yorker</I>, announced that Roseanne -- no last names, please, we're famous -- would guest-edit a special issue on women, the feeling in journalistic circles was that the <I>Tinad&#228mmerung</I> had begun. It isn't that Roseanne is <I>lumpen</I> left -- the magazine is as liberal as it was for years past. It isn't that Roseanne is gross -- no surprise from an editorial regime that, among (many) other horrors, put a crucified Easter bunny on one cover. The reason folks feel Tina Brown's time is up is that Roseanne is pass&#233. She has been gracing the pages of People and The National Enquirer for the better part of a decade. And yet, Tina Brown just discovered her. Fatal, for the High Priestess of Now. The New Yorker, whatever its ideological short-circuits, was once a beacon of urbanity and style. Those are different from hype and hip, as Miss Brown is at long last learning.

A California jury awarded $1 million to a man who said he had been wrongly fired merely for weighing four hundred pounds. We'll drink to that, and make it a double chocolate malt.

<H2>Se Habla Ingles</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 5
<P>








It was wise of Senator Dole to come down on English as the national language when he was firing away over the weekend at anti-U.S. academics. The movement to make English the official language of the United States is making legislative headway. The State of New Hampshire has just now enacted an English-language bill, and what appeals to New Hampshire, beyond apples, tends to appeal to presidential candidates.
<P>
The principal lobbying group in favor of universalizing English (it is called ``U.S. English'') is ironically headed up by someone whose native language wasn't English (he is Mauro E. Mujica). And of course the heftiest warrior for English was the late senator and semanticist S. I. Hayakawa, whose native language was Japanese. Senator Hayakawa wanted nothing less than a constitutional amendment. U.S. English will settle for less; others want more.
<P>
There is of course the other side. Why does the United States have to have a common language? After all, Switzerland doesn't.
<P>
The first thing to learn about Switzerland is never to invoke what happens there in an effort to prove any point about any other country. Switzerland breaks all the rules, gets away with it; is a wonderful country with, unhappily, a bad drug problem.
<P>
There are very good historical reasons why the French should have been permitted to nourish their language in Canada and, more recently, to insist on the recognition of French as a substitute language in everything from ballot forms to road signs. But every now and again Canada threatens to become two nations, and so reminds us of the burden the British would have been spared if, two hundred years ago, they had, after defeating the French, exported them back to France, or else sent them south to the United States, where immigrants were taught English.
<P>
Opponents of the universalization of English use two arguments. The first is multiculturalist in ideology, the second, a <I>faux</I> cosmopolitanism. There is every reason in the world for the schools in the United States to teach foreign languages, beginning with Spanish, which is progressively important in commerce and hemispheric comity. But hanging onto one's Spanish if that is the native language is entirely different from depending on it.
<P>
It makes sense in addressing the issue to close our eyes to what happens with the first generation. Yes, many immigrants -- perhaps millions -- who arrived here in middle age went on to become conversant with English. But millions did not, and will not, and it is an expression of geniality to give them radio and television and newspapers in Spanish.
<P>
But their children need to be treated differently. I have experienced a 15-year-old boy who speaks English with difficulty even though he has lived in New York City with his mother for five years. It turns out that in public school, before he moved to a parochial school where he now studies, young Saul was taught six classes every day, five of them in Spanish.
<P>
The quarrel is between two camps, one of them, so to speak, total immersion in its approach, the second a little looser. There are those who believe that English can only be rapidly mastered if every foreigner is required to use it when engaged in any transaction over which that person is superintended. Thus, for instance, employees at McDonald's would be required to talk to each other in English while on-premise. One way to generalize this approach is that everywhere you're not permitted to smoke, you are permitted to speak only in English.
<P>
The approach of U.S. English is less draconian, so also is the House bill introduced by Representative Bill Emerson. It would enforce the use only of English in all government communications, forms, ballots, whatever. Mr. Emerson's bill has 180 sponsors, and in a previous version had also as sponsor Newt Gingrich, who endorses enthusiastically the notion of a national language, nationally accepted as such.
<P>
It is really quite cruel to go in the other direction. A few years ago a middle-aged woman told me that when her parents were sent to Moscow they plunked her down in a Russian school. ``I cried every day for about a month and in about six weeks I understood everything that was said in Russian.'' To stand in the way of young people devoting themselves to the English language is on the order of encouraging obesity by cramming them with Mars bars. It is surely the case that every immigrant who can now handle English is grateful for the experience even if it meant crawling through gnarled, spiky, thorny brushwood for a few months or years.

Dear Rusty

<P>



You'll never guess who I met last week! Hint: he dresses in robes, speaks in a foreign accent, and has been reincarnated 17 times. Give up? I gave Tipper the same clues, but after she guessed ``Henry Kissinger,'' she lost interest in the game.
<P>
Okay, I'll tell you: the Dalai Lama! That's right! The Lama himself was right in my office, and let me tell you, we had a great conversation. He has a real ``presence,'' if you will -- you can tell at once that he's a religious man, and not just because of the robes and the bald head and the incense, either. His eyes are very wise, in a non-Western way. And the way he kept murmuring, ``We need more money,'' had a distinctly spiritual ring to it.
<P>
You're probably wondering how this all came about. Well, with Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton in Beijing, at the UN Women's Tribunal, a lot of us in Washington thought we should do something publicly to denounce the repressive regime in Beijing. But since we've been doing that for a couple of years now, and it hasn't seemed to work -- I mean, they're all still in power over there (though I hear that Deng smokes two packs of unfiltered Camels every day, and has since he was 17 years old, so he'll be lucky to see his 97th birthday) -- someone over at State thought it would be smart to consult with an expert. And who knows better how to deal with the Chinese than the Dalai, who's been on the run since the late '50s?
<P> 
Anyway, besides you and my daughter Karenna, I don't really know any practicing Buddhists, so I was a little nervous about the meeting. Plus, Tipper, Sara, and Kristin insisted on being part of the formal greeting party, ``in case he brings Richard Gere,'' so the office was crowded. 
<P>
Yet he instantly put us at ease. He sort of glided into the room -- a big robe and flip-flops has that effect -- sipped a glass of iced tea, and smiled. Tip and the girls left quickly -- no Richard Gere, just a few monks -- and the Dalai and I got down to talking. ``Welcome to Washington,'' I said. 
<P>
``Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You know, your office looks remarkably like the set they're using on Oliver Stone's movie Nixon.''
<P>
``Really? I didn't know that,'' I said.
<P> 
``Oh yeah. Oliver's pretty much a detail person. I just visited with him. I flew in on the red-eye.''
<P> 
``Oh.''
<P> 
``Can I get a slice of lemon in this tea?''
<P> 
``Of course, of course,'' I said, and sent an usher out to get a tray of lemons.
<P> 
``So, Mr. Vice President,'' the Lama continued, ``as you know, the Chinese have been occupying my nation of Tibet for almost half a century. Theirs is a brutal and violent reign.'' 
<P>
``Yes, we know. But you see, Dalai Lama, we're having a hard time deciding on a policy.''
<P> 
``Any chance of a cigarette?''
<P> 
``I'm sorry, your Holiness, but there's no smoking in the White House.''
<P> 
``Not even for a reincarnated holy man?'' 
<P>
He had a point, Rusty -- and since the enforcer of the ``No Smoking'' rule was in Beijing I sent another usher out for Marlboro 100s and a light.
<P> 
``So,'' I continued, ``do you have any suggestions as to how to proceed with our relationship with Beijing? How we can stop the violence against your people?'' 
<P>
The Lama thought about this. ``I'm not sure,'' he finally murmured. ``We've been fighting them for generations -- well, not fighting, since we're non-violent and we advocate non-violence for others -- but we've been pressuring them and pressuring them, and so far, with no result.''
<P> 
``Hey, same here,'' I said. ``But you know, the First Lady is in Beijing right now. Just yesterday they passed a law against sex-based wage inequities, so if we keep our fingers crossed, they might get to the whole Tibet situation before the Tribunal disbands.''
<P>
An usher dashed into the office. Apparently, no one in the White House would admit to having cigarettes -- they suspected some sort of trap, it seems -- so the usher had to race down a couple of blocks to the liquor store. He was mugged.
<P> 
``I'm sorry, Dalai Lama, but I'm afraid we won't be able to offer you a cigarette. But if we could get back to the violence in your homeland . . .''
<P>
``I wish we could. Unfortunately, I'm due for dinner in Manhattan with Richard Gere. If I leave right now I can snag the three o'clock shuttle.''
<P> 
As the Dalai left my office, an aide handed me an urgent cable. Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton and the delegation at the UN Women's Tribunal in Beijing had just voted to outlaw male aggression, which, if broadly defined, might include things like the Chinese invasion of Tibet. So at least there was some good news to celebrate.

<LI><B>Bob Dole</B> hits first downdraft in nomination bid in Ames, Iowa, straw poll. 
<I>Newsweek</I> notes: ``Dole's campaign has stumbled whenever he's ventured beyond
 his familiar Senate lair,'' warns campaign ``may be only one misstep away 
 from the kind of shake-ups [Dole] has engineered in the past,'' although for
  moment campaign manager Scott Reed and deputy manager <B>Bill Lacy</B> are ``safe.'' . . .<B> Bob Novak</B> reports conservative Dole advisor
  <B> Don Devine</B> being pushed aside. . . . Campaign ignited mini-firestorm by returning $1,000 check from Log Cabin Republicans, a gay 
   group. Log Cabin executive director <B>Richard Tafel</B> says Dole campaign solicited money, then, post Ames, ``basically figured they 
   could write off the gays because they need the right wing.'' <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> editorial headline: ``The Dole Way: If You're 
   Down, Kick a Gay.'' . . . A <B>Pete Wilson </B>aide suggests a new Iowa strategy for Bob Dole: replace Scott Reed with<B> Ralph
   Reed</B>. 
   New Southern strategy? Replace <B>Sheila Burke</B> with <B>Delta Burke</B>. . . . Dole drops 7 points, from 42 to 35 per cent, in Time/CNN poll.
    Undecided column picks up the slack, jumping to 25 per cent. Rest of field in single digits. . . . Pete Wilson announces
     presidential bid -- again -- hits illegal immigration, affirmative action in speech with Statue of Liberty as backdrop. 
     (<B>Mario Cuomo</B> suggests changing inscription to ``Let us send back your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.'') . . . 
     <B>Lamar Alexander</B> campaign runs New Hampshire radio ads highlighting Wilson's former support for tax increases, affirmative
      action, scores California governor as ``political chameleon.'' . . . Continuing buzz around possible independent candidacies.
      <I> The New Yorker's</I> <B>Hendrik Hertzberg</B>, noting <B>Ross Perot</B> won 19 per cent after he ``had spectacularly proved his unfitness,'' 
       asks: Could a <B>Colin Powell - Bill Bradley</B> ticket win? ``There is every reason to think so.'' . . . <I>Wall Street
       Journal</I> reports 
       Pentagon is ``immune to the hype'' surrounding Powell. Senior officers criticize ``Powell doctrine'' -- military interventions 
       should only be undertaken with overwhelming force -- as too risk-averse. . . . <B>George Will</B> on Powell: his views on the centrality 
       of racism and the unequal distribution of wealth ``are shared by millions of good citizens. They are called Democrats.'' . . . 
       In Dole - <B>Clinton</B> race Colin Powell comes in at 27 per cent, both Perot and Bradley at roughly 17. . . . Documentary ``Inside the Republican Revolution,'' produced by conservative Michael Pack and hosted by Donald Lambro of Washington Times, airs nationally on PBS on September 13.

<LI>Presence of New Jersey ex-Gov. <B>Tom Kean</B> (R.) in official delegation to Peking 
conference on women supposed to make U.S. representation ``bi-partisan.'' But

<P>
The Little Engine that Couldn't
<P>
STEPHEN MOORE
<P>
Mr. Moore is director of fiscal-policy studies at the Cato Institute.

<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
ON December 21, 1987, the Democrat-controlled Congress wrapped
13 appropriations bills into a $600-billion, 1,400-page omnibus
spending bill, dumped it on President Reagan's desk, and then
adjourned. Reagan's unhappy options: sign into law the most expensive
spending bill in the history of Western civilization or veto it
and set in motion a Christmas Eve budget train wreck. In the end,
Reagan blinked (thanks to advice from Jim and Howard Baker), the
bill was signed, and House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd were exalted. It was perhaps the low point
of the Reagan Presidency.
<P>
There's a useful, if painful, lesson here for Newt Gingrich and
Co. as they prepare to go mano-a-mano with Bill Clinton to decide
the fate of the GOP fiscal revolution. Throughout the 1980s, congressional
Democrats played fiscal hardball with the White House; they played
to win, and invariably did. They routinely used the threat of
a budget train wreck as a strategic offensive weapon in policy
disputes with Reagan. Most importantly, they almost never blinked
first.
<P>
Will the Republicans? One thing seems certain about the looming
budget fight: if this GOP Congress has anywhere near the fierce
loyalty to its agenda of shrinking the government that Jim Wright
and the Democratic leadership of the 1980s had to their agenda
of expanding it, conservatives will score a resounding victory
by early November. The balanced-budget blueprint, the family and
economic-growth tax cuts, the dismantling of failed Great Society
social programs, the Medicare fix, and the real end to welfare
as we know it -- every one of these long-sought conservative goals
will be achieved in full. As veteran budget analyst Harrison Fox
of Citizens for Budget Reform has put it: ``All that can prevent
total victory is Republicans themselves.'' However, if Republicans
remain unflinchingly committed to the budget revolution that won
them 50 House and 8 Senate seats last November, the White House
will almost assuredly fold like a cheap dime-store tent. Let's
not forget this isn't Clint Eastwood in the Oval Office, it's
just Bill Clinton. 
<P>
Even if Clinton vetoes Republican budgets, he still can't conceivably
force concessions from a unified Republican House and Senate.
Remember, Clinton's beef with Congress is that it's not spending
enough money. (We're talking about a GOP budget of $1.6 trillion,
more money than is spent by all of the Fortune 500 companies combined.
Even if Republicans have their way, spending will still rise by
an enormous $350 billion over the next seven years. This is hardly
scorched-earth fiscal policy.) Since the Constitution gives only
Congress the power to appropriate funds, Clinton can veto Republican
balanced budgets till doomsday, but he can't force Republicans
to spend a dime more money than they want to. To paraphrase House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Livingston: ``When you veto
a zero, you still get zero.'' 
<P>
The real battle looming is not between Republicans and Democrats,
but rather between Republicans and Republicans. At stake is the
soul of the party in the post-Reagan era. Now we find out who
really runs the GOP: conservative visionaries Newt Gingrich and
Dick Armey? Or Bob Dole, Bob Packwood, John Chafee, and other
centerfield Senate Republicans whose concept of a bold new agenda
for America is a slightly less expensive version of the liberal
welfare state?
<P>
``There are a dozen, maybe two, Senate Republicans who are deathly
afraid of a budget train wreck,'' concedes one Senate leadership
staffer. ``They are desperate to avoid the politics of gridlock.''
These are the same GOP senators who have spent the past six months
voiding much of the Contract with America. They now want to chop
off the legs of House conservatives by plotting a separate peace
with Clinton on the budget. Sen. Pete Domenici is already sketching
the outlines of a deal with White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta
that would balance the budget over 8 or 9 years (rather than 7)
and neuter the tax cuts. 
<P>
Any such negotiated settlement with the White House would be a
monumental political and policy blunder. Almost nothing could
do more to resuscitate this comatose Presidency and re-establish
Bill Clinton's policy ``relevance'' than this. And any budget
that Clinton would willingly agree to is a budget not worth having.

<P>
It's not clear why so many Republicans are terrorized by the prospect
of a budget train wreck. A train wreck --  Washington's metaphor
for a fiscal stalemate between the White House and Congress that
causes a short-term shutdown of the government -- conjures up
the image of a kind of mutual assured destruction: everyone loses.
In reality the only casualties would be hundreds of liberal spending
programs. Under the Anti-Deficiency Act, all ``essential federal
activities'' -- the FBI, the military, the courts, the air-traffic-control
system, and other agencies that protect Americans from ``an imminent
threat to life or property'' -- must remain in full operation
if the budget is not approved. Social Security checks would still
be sent out. Everything else, though, from the Legal Services
Corporation, to the National Endowment for the Arts, to the Department
of Education, would grind to a halt. (Sounds as if I died and
went to heaven!)
<P>
Newt Gingrich was right on target when he explained that the GOP
isn't the least bit reluctant to allow Clinton to close down federal
operations, because ``it's their government, not ours.'' Clinton's
threatening conservative Republicans with the prospect of a government
shutdown that would largely defund the agencies of the Left is
as if Harry Truman had threatened that if Japan didn't surrender,
he would drop the bomb on New York City.
<P>
Republicans have been in Washington too long if they believe that
Americans would fret over a five- or six-day time out from having
to pay taxes for a multitude of nonessential government activities,
such as the Small Business Administration, transit subsidies,
or Title X sex-education grants. It's no great catastrophe if
the public schools have to economize by cutting condom-distribution
programs. Former Reagan Administration budget director Jim Miller,
who is urging Republicans not to blink first, recently conjured
up the ultimate liberal nightmare: ``If Clinton shuts down the
government, most Americans may not even notice.'' How many Americans
are even aware that there were seven temporary closures of the
government between 1981 and 1990?
<P>
If Clinton vetoes appropriations bills or the extension of the
$5-trillion debt ceiling, Republicans have a rare opportunity
to unilaterally impose a de facto balanced budget immediately.
Gingrich and Dole could essentially confront Clinton with an ultimatum:
until you accept our seven-year balanced budget plan, our tax
cuts, and our welfare overhaul, we will suspend any further borrowing
this year and prohibit you from spending money on all but the
essentials of government. In fact, Nick Smith, Christopher Shays,
and 150 other House Republicans have declared unequivocally in
a letter to the President and the congressional leadership that
they will refuse to raise the statutory ceiling on the debt until
``legislation is enacted ensuring a balanced budget by 2002 or
sooner.'' 
<P>
Engaging in a high-stakes budget collision with the White House
is unarguably a high-risk political strategy. Senate Republicans
worry that voters' attitude will be: A plague on both your houses.
But it's of no small consequence that the roles in this year's
budget conflict between Capitol Hill and the White House will
be reversed from the institutional struggles of the 1980s: this
Congress is trying to balance the budget, not bankrupt it. In
any face-off with the White House, Gingrich and his allies have
the enormous public-relations advantage that they are the ones
on the side of the angels. More importantly, the central virtue
of a knock-down, drag-out budget fight between congressional Republicans
and the White House is that it will help sharply define for 1996
voters the ideological grand canyon between the two parties. 
<P>
The danger to the GOP majorities in Congress is the growing public
perception that Republicans are doing too little, not too much.
I became aware of this at a political summit of Perot supporters
in Virginia earlier this summer where participants blasted this
``do-nothing Congress.'' One frustrated voter told me that, yes,
he realized there is an ideological war over the size and scope
of government in Washington. But he asked: ``Which side of the
war are Republicans on?'' 
<P>
It's a fair question. We'll have the answer in a few weeks.

<P>
MODERATOR: If I could just -- 
<P>
MARJORIE: Are my kids okay outside?
<P>
MODERATOR: I'm handing out some pages -- 
<P>
OTIS: No one -- that's NO ONE, Sunny Jim -- is taking away my
Medicare.
<P>
MARJORIE: I'm going to check on my kids.
<P>
MODERATOR: Well, we're not really talking about Medicare today.
If I could direct your attention -- 
<P>
OTIS: Damn right we're not talking about Medicare, because NO
ONE is going to take it away.
<P>
DAKOTA: Twenty-five bucks, doofoid.
<P>
DAKOTAH: Can you let the man talk, please?
<P>
MODERATOR: Thanks. What I'd like to talk about is your feelings
about Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
<P>
OTIS: Hate 'em. Hate 'em both. And that wife of his tried to steal
my Medicare.
<P>
MODERATOR: Um . . . okay, we'll start with Otis. Otis, you say
that you quote hate unquote Bill Clinton and Al Gore -- 
<P>
OTIS: And his wife.
<P>
MODERATOR: Whose wife?
<P>
OTIS: Clinton's wife. The Medicare thief.
<P>
MODERATOR: And so you'd describe yourself as someone who is .

<P>
OTIS: I'd describe myself as someone who's entitled to Medicare.
<P>
MODERATOR: Okay, moving right along. Bill, you've been awfully
quiet.

<P>
BILL: My wife.
<P>
MODERATOR: I mean in a political sense.
<P>
BILL: Still her.
<P>
MODERATOR: Let me be more specific. Are you angry because as a
white middle-aged man you feel that your place in society is eroding,
and that the general lawlessness of the streets has come to make
you feel like an outsider in your own country?
<P>
BILL: Well, I wasn't before you mentioned it, but, wow, I see
your point. I am so freaking angry!
<P>
DAKOTAH: Then join a militia, Nazi man!
<P>
BILL: What?
<P>
DAKOTAH: I know all about you angry white men! My dad is one!
At first he was real nice and real supportive and then when I
changed my name to Dakotah and got my nose pierced he was like,
a crazy man. So full of rage. I reject that rage.
<P>
MODERATOR: Dakotah, how would you describe your politics?
<P>
DAKOTAH: I wouldn't.
<P>
MODERATOR: You mean you can't describe your feelings?
<P>
DAKOTAH: No, I mean that you probably work for the government
which killed Kennedy and Malcolm X and if I told you what I really
believe you'd have me killed just like you killed Jerry Garcia.
<P>
MODERATOR: Keith . . . how about you?

KEITH: Oh, am I here?
<P>
MODERATOR: Excuse me?

KEITH: The black man always goes last.
<P>
MODERATOR: I was going clockwise.
<P>
KEITH: To you, clockwise. To me, a systematic method of silencing
my voice.
<P>
MODERATOR: I'm terribly sorry.
<P>
KEITH: You think that white man is angry? Check under my hood
sometime.
<P>
BILL: Are you saying that you're angrier than me?
<P>
KEITH: Damn right I am.
<P>
BILL: I'm WAY angrier than you.
<P>
KEITH: Oh yeah?
<P>
BILL: Yeah.

<P>
MODERATOR: Gentlemen! Please! All I want to know is how you would
describe yourselves politically.
<P>

<P>
Where Does Fuhrman Take Us?
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 25
<P>
One account analyzes the Mark Fuhrman situation as follows: If
the exposure of the tapes comes in as the closing episode in the
trial, the probability is high that the disgust and loathing for
Detective Fuhrman (richly deserved) will provoke in the jury a
sentiment extraneous to the question, Did O. J. kill his former
wife and her companion? Instead, the analysis goes on, the jurors
will ask themselves, How can we express our disgust? Well -- the
analyst concludes -- by voting, Not Guilty.
<P>
The prosecution will of course make an earnest, desperate attempt
to situate the tapes in context. Marcia Clark will argue that
Houdini himself could not have contrived to arrange the evidence
against O. J. with which the prosecution has made its case. The
chief of police in Los Angeles, Mr. Willie Williams, told a press
conference that ``it is inconceivable to believe that for this
one murder 10, 20, 30, or 40 people got together to plot against
Mr. Simpson.'' Only Oliver Stone could stitch together a plot
to do in O. J. that originated at two in the morning and matured
with a bloody glove at his residence, and bloodstains that identified
O. J., his ex-wife, and Mr. Goldman here and there along the route
from the scene of the crime back to Simpson's residence.
<P>
But the thinking at the moment is that the jury will waive matters
that have dulled in memories of men and women who must be feeling
as though they had been sentenced to perpetual isolation during
a seemingly endless trial. Human sensibilities are as they are,
and the jurors are not likely to blame the defense for their incarceration.
The enemy will be the Establishment: the judge who ordained their
isolation, the prosecution that droned on endlessly, and, above
all, the Los Angeles Police Department, which retained in its
ranks someone who -- if the tapes are to be believed -- lives
in fury against the existence of blacks, women, homosexuals, and
civil rights. 
<P>
It is mystifying what exactly were the objectives of Mr. Fuhrman
in his recorded conversations with Laura Hart McKinny, the scholar
at the North Carolina School of Arts, starting in 1985. He reported
to her (according to one passage in the tapes) how on one occasion
he and fellow officers handled four suspects. ``We basically tortured
them. We broke 'em. Their faces were just mush. They had pictures
of the walls with blood all the way to the ceiling and finger
marks of [them] trying to crawl out of the room.'' A messy business,
handling suspects in that way. It required Mr. Fuhrman and his
fellow law enforcers to clean themselves up with a garden hose.

<P>
Now the Fuhrman narrative gives one pause. It does not surprise
that here and there one comes upon sadists, whether in Los Angeles
or in Gulag. The viewers of the Rodney King beating tend to reason,
Why should we be surprised? Such evidently is the way the police
in Los Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, routinely act. But the
Rodney King story is complicated. Extensive investigations revealed
that there was a genuine, spastic concern that King might be armed,
might have intended his own impetuous defense using a weapon.
But in the Fuhrman telling of the treatment of four suspects there
would seem to be nothing of that. It was clinical sadism. 
<P>
Already a quiet investigation by the Los Angeles Police has begun,
designed, no doubt, to track the record of men handled over the
years by Detective Fuhrman. Why did they not complain of their
treatment by him? And if there was a record of Fuhrman engaged
in such activity, why was he retained in the force? How will he
be handled by the law? As a perjurer? He swore under oath that
he had not used the term ``nigger'' when manifestly he had done
so, using the word not in the detached tones of a storyteller,
but with invidious gusto. ``You're talking sh--. You sound like
a nigger.''
<P>
It is endlessly fascinating. Fuhrman the cool bigot. O. J., who
earned the confidence of his private investigator because of the
coolness of his behavior in Chicago in the hours immediately after
the killing. How could somebody so casual in his conduct during
those hours before being told of his ex-wife's murder be guilty?
But of course such reasoning, from the particular to the general,
would justify confidence that the Fuhrman observed on the witness
stand could not be the same Fuhrman who spoke into those tapes.

<P>
The jury's responsibility in this case is awesome, extending far
beyond the question of O. J.'s guilt or innocence. It touches
on the recognition of the awful baseness of which human beings
-- Americans -- are capable.

<P>
<LI>Big winners from <B>Ross Perot</B> confab are an ideological grab-bag:
<B>Pat Buchanan, Jesse Jackson, John Kasich</B>. Former Perot pollster
<B>Frank Luntz</B>, however, points out that audience at United We Stand
America convention was not representative of Perot's '92 supporters.
(Would most Americans pay to hear more than three dozen politicians
speak?) . . . GOP presidential candidates addressed group despite
<B>Bill Bennett's</B> warnings not to kowtow to Perot. Not kowtowing
was front-runner <B>Bob Dole</B>, whose speech defended politicians and
criticized isolationism. According to <I>Washington Times</I>, Buchanan
``electrified'' crowd with America First and protectionist messages;
but <B>Alan Keyes</B> slammed Buchanan for downplaying anti-abortion
stand, less popular among UWSA members. <B>Phil Gramm</B> reiterated
pledges to balance budget in first term and to abolish federal
quotas by executive order in first day on job. (Dole recently
told columnist <I>Lally Weymouth</I> he would not issue such executive
orders.) <I>Lamar Alexander</I> predicted that independent candidacy
would re-elect <I>Bill Clinton</I> if party nominates Beltway insider
. . . Also sounding anti-Beltway note was <I>Pete Wilson</I>. Though
moderate/liberal on social issues, Wilson called rising illegitimacy
``the greatest threat I can think of to America's future.'' .
. . Survey for U.S. News finds that whites like <I>Colin Powell</I> more
than blacks do, ``largely because a surprising number of blacks
don't know much about him.'' Of blacks who can identify Powell,
19 per cent don't know his race.
<P>
<LI>Announcement by N.J. Sen.<B> Bill Bradley</B> that he won't run for re-election
next year reduces Democrats' already-slim chances of retaking
Senate. Dems currently hold 6 of 7 Senate seats that will be open
in 1996 -- and they lost all 6 of their open seats in '94. <B>Claiborne
Pell </B>(D., R.I.) is probably next out the door. Will <B>Sam Nunn</B>,
in Republican-friendly Georgia, be far behind? Dems may be lucky
to hold onto the power to filibuster. . . . Race to replace Bradley
is already crowded: among Republicans, Rep. <B>Dick Zimmer</B> is widely
expected to win nomination but <B>Richard DuHaime</B> is challenging
him from the Right; ex-Gov. <B>Tom Kean</B> and Rep. <B>Marge Roukema</B> could
jump in. Main contenders on Democrat side are likely to be Reps.
<B>Robert Torricelli</B> and <B>Robert Andrews</B>, but ex-Gov. <B>Jim Florio</B> is
interested. . . . <B>Newt Gingrich</B> and <B>John Lewis</B> (D., Ga.) -- the
same Lewis who recently disrupted a Gingrich symposium on Medicare
-- joined forces to submit a redistricting proposal to protect
Georgia's 11 congressional incumbents.
<P>
<LI><B>Norma McCorvey</B>, better known as Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade, departed
the pro-choice movement. Feminists,  she complains, never treated
her -- a reform-school dropout, former drug dealer and alcoholic
-- with respect. Reaction from <B>Sarah Weddington</B>, her lawyer in
Roe: ``It doesn't really matter. The case was a class-action suit.''
New York Times piles on: McCorvey ``never was much of a poster
girl for choice,'' declares editorial page. . . . Pro-lifers make
progress in state legislatures across the country. <B>Clarke Forsythe</B>
of Americans United for Life reports in Wall Street Journal that
so far this year four states have passed laws requiring parental
consent or at least notification before a minor daughter's abortion,
leaving only 12 states without such laws. Three states passed
informed-consent laws -- and Missouri would have joined them but
for Dem. Gov. <B>Mel Carnahan's</B> veto. And the Ohio legislature sent
a ban on ``partial-birth'' abortions to GOP Gov. <B>George Voinovich</B>
for his signature.
<P>
<LI>Defection of Lt.-Gen. <B>Hussein Kamel Hassan</B>, head of Iraq's military
industrialization -- including nuclear and poison-gas projects
-- means regime of <B>Saddam Hussein</B> is collapsing. Iraq itself might
splinter, with neighboring states wrangling for pieces in Yugoslav-type
ethnic free-for-all. . . . Colombia Prosecutor-General <B>Alfonso
Valdivieso</B> expects other drug traffickers to replace captured
Cali cartel leaders <B>Miguel Rodriguez Orejuelo</B> and his brother.
Defense Minister <B>Fernando Botero</B> resigned after accusations he
took drug money while running Pres. <B>Ernesto Samper's</B> campaign.
. . . Meanwhile, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency chief <B>Thomas Constantine</B>
says amphetamines from Mexico are rapidly overtaking Colombian
cocaine as drug of choice in U.S. . . . Mexican police have grabbed
<B>Aaron Morel Lebaron</B>, leader of Texas polygamist sect who is accused
of ordering the murder of three members. . . . Senators <B>John McCain</B>
and <B>Joseph Lieberman</B> are co-sponsoring proposal to establish international
fund to arm Bosnian government. <B>Jesse Helms</B>, chairman of Foreign
Relations Committee, says, ``It's time we treated the Bosnian
people the same way we treated the Contras in Nicaragua and those
people in Afghanistan -- as freedom fighters.'' . . . Russian
ultranationalist <B>Vladimir Zhirinovsky</B> has ordered all his party's
candidates in December parliamentary elections to be examined
for drug addiction, mental illness, and criminal backgrounds.
. . . <B>Vitaly Usov</B>, general manager of new Moscow restaurant offering
traditional Russian fast-food, has taught waitresses to smile
like McDonald's employees.

<HR>
11-September-1995

<P>

<LI>Republicans are pondering a budget showdown that would be, in
the words of one of their analysts, ``the fiscal equivalent of
dropping an atomic bomb on the government.'' Aw, go ahead. It's
the right thing to do. Don't even wait for a budget crisis. Do
it!
<P>
<LI>If you shut down the government, every family in the country would
get a pay raise of, oh, $300 a week. Of course we'd have to give
up bureaucrats and Form 1040, but most families could easily afford
that. Do it!
<P>
<LI>If you have doubts, think of the number of American casualties
it would cost to invade. Do it!
<P>
<LI>You might think that Newt Gingrich is calling for tax cuts because
of a commitment to limited government and economic growth. If
so, you obviously have not read Gail Sheehy's profile of Gingrich
in the September <I>Vanity Fair</I>. Miss Sheehy's readers know that
tax cuts, Medicare reform, and deregulation are not policies at
all, but mental anomalies to be explained by Gingrich's longing
to be loved by two cold, authoritarian fathers. The Speaker is,
in short, a victim. But he is not to be indulged like most victims,
because he is dangerous. Miss Sheehy's article is unlikely, however,
to be remembered for its contribution to public understanding
of manic depression. Much more titillating are her allegations
of infidelities during Gingrich's first marriage, which ended
in 1981. Whatever the truth of the matter, it is none of Miss
Sheehy's -- or the reading public's -- business. Most people are
not saints, and their reputations would suffer from harsh scrutiny.
It might be a different matter if Mr. Gingrich had presented himself
as a sterling moral leader. But he has not done so. The only silver
lining to the story is that it may help dissuade Mr. Gingrich
from entering the presidential race this time  -- which, as we
have argued, would be against his own interests anyway.
<P>
<LI>If President Clinton really wants to stop teenagers from smoking,
he should propose a law requiring that they must be able to read
the writing on a cigarette package before it can be sold to them.
<P>
<LI>Defense hawks are questioning Senate Republicans' commitment to
strategic defense. The House's defense authorization bill, and
previously the Senate's, required that a multiple-site ballistic-missile
defense system be <I>deployed</I> by 2003. But now Senators Cohen, Warner,
Nunn, and Levin have reached a bipartisan agreement (if Cohen
and Warner count as Republicans) which speaks instead of ``developing
for deployment'' -- in other words, still more years on the drawing
board. Armed Services Committee Chairman Strom Thurmond has signed
off on the deal, which will be approved by the Senate. If missile-defense
supporters in the House hold firm in conference, however, they
can probably win enough votes in the Senate for final passage
of their version of the bill. It's high time for Republicans to
come to the defense of missile defense.
<P>
<LI>Hurricane Felix drifted in, drifted out, drifted around, killed
a few people, and otherwise acted remarkably like United States
foreign policy.
<P>
<LI>If Bill Bradley had retired in September, or July, or anytime
except a very slow August, the nation might have been spared the
hype surrounding the New Jersey senator's hint at an independent
presidential bid. Two days on the front page of the <I>Washington
Post</I>. Four pages, including an interview, in <I>Newsweek</I>. Bradley
says both parties are failing America. But in what ways does this
self-styled maverick -- a roughly 90 per cent Americans for Democratic
Action liberal who voted against unfunded-mandate reform, regulatory
reform, and the Balanced Budget Amendment -- differ from his President?
``The issue isn't where I agree or disagree with the President,''
he told <I>Newsweek</I>. ``It's too easy to say, Well, I agree on these
five, I disagree on those four. What does that tell anybody?''
More than anything else we're likely to hear from Bill Bradley.
The senator's glowing coverage suggests that this pillar of the
establishment can, through the sheer force of his seriousness
and decency, save American democracy. From what exactly? He's
not saying.<P>
<LI>And if Bill Bradley is thinking of running for President
as an independent, he joins others considering such a run, including
Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, Lowell Weicker, and Ross Perot. The
only independent to announce so far is Bill Clinton.
<P>
<LI>On August 17, Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr indicted
Clinton crony and business partner James McDougal on 19 counts
of fraud and related crimes. Starr also indicted McDougal's former
wife, Susan, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker. This can't
be good news for the Clintons. The McDougals and Clintons were
50 - 50 partners in the Whitewater Development Corporation. Whitewater
contributed to the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan
-- which cost taxpayers $60 million. Resolution Trust Corporation
investigator Jean Lewis told the House Banking Committee that
Whitewater -- hence, the Clintons -- benefited from Mr. McDougal's
fraudulent activities. Miss Lewis also testified that she was
``obstructed, hampered, and manipulated'' during the course of
her investigation and placed on administrative leave along with
the two supervisors who had backed her. There are several problems
here. First, the Clintons' taxes. They deducted two interest payments
(one of $2,811, the other of $2,322) on loans that were paid not
by them, but by Whitewater. Also, from 1982 to 1986, McDougal
was making their Whitewater mortgage payments. The Clintons claim
they did not know of McDougal's generosity, and they never bothered
to ask who was making the payments. In other words, don't ask,
don't tell.
<P>
<LI>Led by Reps. Barney Frank, Charles Schumer, and Maxine Waters,
the Democrats at the House Whitewater hearings exercised the full
extent of their mental faculties and moral superiority by emitting
grunts, bleats, cackles, groans, chirps, and snorts whenever they
didn't want to hear the evidence, which was usually. Chairman
Jim Leach finally had to rule ``guttural noises'' out of order.
Why didn't anyone think of that these last sixty years?
<P>
<LI>As the number of Whitewater-related indictments rose to 14, Bill
Clinton has denied ever being governor of Arkansas.
<P>
<LI>It didn't take Shannon Faulkner long to realize that there had
to be an easier way to lose twenty pounds. On August 9, the U.S.
4th District Court of Appeals had ordered The Citadel to admit
Miss Faulkner, despite her being above the weight limit, and despite
her refusal to submit to a physical evaluation. By mid afternoon
of the first day of the plebes' Hell Week, Miss Faulkner was in
the infirmary, from which she did not emerge until her hastily
called press conference at week's end. ``I don't think there's
any dishonor in leaving,'' she stated. ``I think there's dis-justice
in my staying and killing myself just for the political point.''
Her unscripted admission on why she had waged her prolonged assault
on the all-male military college was unsurprising. Miss Faulkner's
simple plea for equal treatment was belied by the fact that she
wanted to attend the demanding, 152-year-old institution on her
own terms and clearly relished her role as feminist icon -- until
reveille sounded, and Gloria Allred was nowhere to be found.
<P>
<LI>A dozen top Iraqis defected from Baghdad to Jordan, and ``Jane
Roe'' defected from her pro-abortion stance to join Operation
Rescue. David Gergen is demanding royalties.
<P>
<LI>In an interview in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> Bui Tin, the North
Vietnamese general who received South Vietnam's unconditional
surrender in 1975, confirmed what the Right has known all along:
the antiwar protestors undermined the American war effort and,
yes, through visits of prominent Americans to Hanoi, gave aid
and comfort to the enemy. Says General Bui: ``[The antiwar protestors]
represented the conscience of America. [That conscience] was part
of its war-making capability, and we were turning that power in
our favor.'' Thomas Sowell argues in <I>Forbes</I> that Thirties pacifists
in England, France, and the U.S. helped cause an unnecessary World
War II by keeping their governments from building up deterrent
arms, thus giving Germany and her allies a crucial head start.
In the case of Vietnam the protestors didn't cause the war, but
they weakened our will to continue, resulting in our broken promise
to the people of South Vietnam and -- lest we forget -- to the
57,000 Americans who died there. The Sixties pacifists can atone
for their past offenses by admitting what their professions of
peace-and-love led to.
<P>
<LI>Alternative energy is having some problems, according to the newsletter
<I>Access to Energy</I>. Twenty per cent of the mirrors at the solar-power
field in Barstow, California, are broken, and the rest are working
at reduced efficiency because smoke from the Mount Pinatubo eruption
four years ago is still reducing the intensity of sunlight. Southern
California Edison isn't too unhappy about the low productivity
because it is required by federal law to pay the solar electric
generators 15a/kWh compared to its own generation costs of 3a/kWh.
(Then again, in the absence of competition it can pass the higher
power bills on to its customers.) Meanwhile, at another politically
correct project which generates electricity by means of windmills,
the blades have chopped up thousands of birds in the past two
years, including 78 golden eagles. And at El Centro, California,
a power plant that burns biomass is out of commission: the manure
it was being fed as fuel wouldn't burn after recent wet weather,
and the plant is plugged up with the stuff. No report on whether
it is being tested for conformity to air-quality standards.
<P>
<LI>A controversy broke out in the advertising world over some vaguely
soft pornographic ads taken out by Calvin Klein in <I>YM</I>, a magazine
for girls ages 12 and up. The ads show under-age models in various
states of undress. As reported in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, the
dispute focuses on whether the ads will or will not offend the
young girls who read <I>YM</I>. ``Something that is offensive to adults
may not be to kids,'' reasoned Ira Garey, publisher of <I>Sassy</I>.
``It [the ad campaign] just isn't subtle enough and therefore
isn't cool,'' countered Jane Grossman, publisher of<I> Seventeen</I>.
Nobody seems to have thought about the moral effect the ads might
have. That just wouldn't be subtle enough and therefore wouldn't
be cool.
<P>
<LI>President Clinton is warning Iraq that any military moves against
Kuwait or Saudi Arabia will be met with the full mobilization
of Mark Fuhrman.

Fear Itself
<P>
RICH LOWRY
<P>
Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
``DIRTY rotten stinking . . . meat,'' screams the headline of
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) press release.
``Warner to Voters: `Eat This.' '' DSCC executive director Don
Foley elaborates: ``Senator Warner is an E-Coli Republican. His
vote for corporate greed and irresponsible government literally
threatens American lives.'' Lest anyone miss the point, the DSCC
release includes a cartoon depicting Warner dishing out putrid
meat to a kid.
<P>
 Juvenile campaign tactics are, of course, a bi-partisan affair.
The National Republican Congressional Committee's recent ``wanted''
poster of prominent House liberals won't be winning awards for
high-mindedness. But there are differences that make Democratic
broadsides worth special notice: their shrill attacks still have
a credulous echo-chamber among the establishment media; they often
seem to work; and they may be all that's left in the Democratic
arsenal.
<P>
Consider the stalled effort on regulatory reform. On July 3, as
the Senate prepared to take up Bob Dole's reform bill, the<I> New
York Times</I> ran a front-page story that alleged a GOP assault on
food safety. Calls poured in to the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group that along with Safe
Tables Our Priority (STOP), a coalition of families of <I>E. coli</I>
victims, had already been agitating on food safety. These groups
argued that regulatory reform would nix proposed U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) meat-inspection standards, exposing millions
to tainted meat.
<P>
At one event, activists took 100 hamburgers to Capitol Hill to
hand out to senators, daring them to play ``hamburger roulette.''
Reporters ate it up. In the wake of the Jack in the Box outbreak
in 1993 in which three children died, the bacterium is a high-profile
poster-child for food contamination. Perhaps the most damaging
story was one that aired on ABC News, with a reporter alleging
that under regulatory reform new meat-inspection rules ``could
be dismantled.'' Then the father of an <I>E. coli</I> victim warned against
any reform-induced delay of new rules: ``Every time there's a
delay, over one child a day dies.&quot;
<P>
The thrust of the ABC story and most other <I>E. coli</I> commentary
in the media was dubious on three grounds: 
<P>
-- The original draft of the Dole bill had several provisions
providing an emergency by-pass for new regulations deemed necessary
to protect the public from an imminent threat to its health or
safety. In any case, the bill's cost - benefit analysis wouldn't
stop new meat-inspection rules if they were likely to deliver
the touted benefits.
<P>
 -- The proposed new testing is expressly aimed at catching meat
infected with salmonella, not <I>E. coli</I>. Activists and the media
focused on <I>E. coli</I> anyway because it's scarier. Furthermore, the
difference between the inspection changes favored by industry
and those sought by the USDA is hardly dramatic.
<P>
 -- The figure of 500 <I>E. coli</I> deaths a year -- more than one child
dying a day -- is surely an exaggeration. Anti-reform activists
cite the Centers for Disease Control for the figures. But when
the independent D.C.-based Statistical Assessment Service (STATS)
ran the numbers, knocking out unwarranted extrapolations, it came
up with a range of 3 to 73 <I>E. coli</I> deaths a year.
<P>
``What you really seem to be getting is a known prospect for maybe
3 or 4 people a year dying and then a huge black box of assumptions
and guesses,'' says David Murray of STATS. ``The highest-end numbers
were selected to get the maximum exposure from [the] press.
<P>
''ON THE environment the story is similar. When Republicans proposed
restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency in July, Democrats
accused them of -- what else? -- endangering children. The Republican
changes, Rep. Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.) charged, ``will make
it easier for lead and arsenic to contaminate our drinking water,
causing immeasurable harm to our children.'' Louis Stokes (D.,
Ohio) told listeners that ``while efforts to control refinery
toxic emissions go into suspended animation, the lungs of our
citizens will not.
<P>
''Never mind that with the exception of a provision limiting enforcement
of the Clean Water Act -- meant to prod the Senate into re-authorizing
the Clean Water Act -- many of the 17 so-called ``riders'' on
the EPA appropriations bill are minor, dealing with issues like
auto-emissions testing. President Clinton still denounced the
bill as a threat to Americans' ``basic safety.'' In August, he
alleged it would allow oil refineries ``to spew benzene, a cancer-causing
chemical, without stringent safeguards.'' Actually, the rider
in question is meant to keep the EPA from using 15-year-old emissions
data to justify a new tightening of refinery regulations.
<P>
Still, Democratic jabs can sting. ``If you give them any kind
of hook,'' explains a GOP leadership aide, ``even if it's not
wholly true or wholly accurate, they can use that to reinforce
[a] pre-existing notion.'' Especially on issues like regulation
and the environment, Republicans resort to a defensive crouch.
``On welfare, the Speaker and Republican leaders are able to articulate
an alternative vision,'' says Jonathan Adler of the Competitive
Enterprise Institute. ``The Republicans have yet to transfer that
approach to the environment.
<P>
''The bright side to the Democratic assaults is that the party
seems to have little else. As Majority Leader Dick Armey likes
to put it: ``The party that once lived by the proud motto 'We
have nothing to fear, but fear itself,' has been reduced to a
political strategy of: 'We have nothing to offer but fear itself.'''
<P>
But fear together with a compliant media can be a useful weapon.
In March, a GOP staffer held a courtesy briefing for Democratic
staff on regulatory reform. He had three lawyers, all experts,
along to help answer questions. Afterwards, an account of the
meeting was leaked to the <I>New York Times</I> (almost certainly by
a Democratic staffer), which on March 31 ran a front-page story
suggesting that the lawyers' presence at the informal, open briefing
proved that lobbyists control the GOP. The White House talked
up the story. The Ralph Nader group Public Citizen filed ethics
charges (which have since been dismissed). The evidence? The March
31 <I>New York Times</I>.

<CENTER><H2>Letter From Al</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
11-September-1995

<P>

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
This is going to sound strange, but I'd appreciate it if you'd
please sign the enclosed ``I'm Mad as Hell! Perot in '96!'' petition,
get your research associates down there in Brazil to sign it --
heck, we're not too picky about their citizenship status -- and
pouch it back to me ASAP, so I can dash it down to Dad in Tennessee
and he can mail it from the local post office. I'd ask you to
send it yourself, but if Perot sees a postmark from south of the
border, well, he goes bananasville.
<P>
It's all part of our ``43% and Holding!'' strategy for '96. And
let me be totally honest: for the first time, I get the sense
that Bill is firing on all jets. We had our usual guy-to-guy lunch
yesterday -- just him and me, one on one, except for Dick Morris,
Leon Panetta, Dick Schoen, and Mark McCurry -- and did he ever
have fire in his belly!
<P>
Part of that could be the new McBacon Salsa Ranch Burgers and
the SuperSize Fries (``SuperSize it!'' Bill always says . . .
) that we -- well, that he -- had for lunch, and part of it could
be the fact that he'd just approved Mrs. William J. Clinton's
trip to Beijing (``Stay a while,'' he said breezily. ``SuperSize
it!''), and another part of it could be that the family settled
on Jackson Hole for its summer vacation (``Get me some new shorts!''
he barked good-naturedly at George Stephanopoulos, ``and SuperSize
'em!''), but I think most of it had to do with his sudden realization
that we have 1996 in the bag. 
<P>
In the first place, Bob Dole is pretty much a lock for the Republican
ticket. So we're ahead going in. And in the second place, it looks
certain that Ross Perot will join the fray. I have to be totally
honest with you, Rusty -- two weeks ago, I'd have bet that the
little guy was going to sit this one out.
<P>
So we thought and thought: if only there was some way to goad
him into running, some way to make it clear how little we fear
him and how low our regard is for his importance. 
<P>
``Send Mack McClarty to talk to him,'' Dick Morris suggested,
which I said I thought was odd since McClarty had retired to Arkansas
months ago, but then I was informed that he was still here, not
just in the District, but here here, in the White House here,
and so I scraped the egg off my face (!) and signed on. We send
Mack down to Dallas -- he opened for Alan Keyes, I think -- and
if I'm not mistaken, it was a ``message received'' situation.

<P>
Then, the new Vanity Fair came out with Gail Sheehy's article
on Newt Gingrich. She serves up some pretty spicy revelations,
and boy, did Bill ever eat it up. He flipped through that issue
like wildfire, pages snapping every second. ``I've done that,''
he said at one page, ``did that,'' at another, ``did that twice,''
at another, and ``did that, almost did that, watched that'' at
the final few pages, and tossed the issue aside with a resounding,
``That boy better learn to SuperSize it!'' A few minutes later,
he was on the phone to the woman Sheehy quotes, thanking her for
her ``forthright honesty'' and asking her if she lives in ``the
202 area code.'' It's nice to see him connecting with voters again.
<P>
And, of course, it's nice to see him connecting with Gingrich,
too. As rough as the past few months have been, I think Dick Morris
is right when he says that ``Gingrich in the Big House keeps Bill
in the White House,'' so when Bill read the Vanity Fair article,
the first thing he said was: ``We can do business with him.''
I think Bill really noticed the parallels in their lives -- you
know: strong, slightly nutty moms; weird dad situations; both
kind of fat. The only problem I see is that Bill is insisting
on meeting the woman Sheehy interviews -- ``opposition research,''
he insists -- and that sounds a little too Jimmy-Carter-scheduling-the-White-House-tennis-court
to me. ``Let the experts do it,'' I counseled. 
<P>
I'll admit that there were some tense moments around here when
Bill Bradley announced that he was retiring from the Senate. He
really tore into the current partisanship that's dividing both
houses in Congress. I have to admit that I agree. Congress was
much, much better a few years ago before all those Republicans
got elected. But the bottom line is that he won't run against
me and Bill. He's a centrist, moderate New Democrat -- and there's
only room for one of us on the ticket. Plus, he and Colin Powell
are going to be mighty busy with their respective book tours.
<P>
So the view from here is that we're looking pretty good. About
the only fly in the ointment is the Congressional Medal of Freedom
campaign that Tipper wants to launch for Jerry Garcia. I'm sorry,
Rusty, call me a square, but I don't think the guy who wrote ``Truckin'''
needs any more honors. 
<P>
Gotta go! The NSC wire just blipped out a cable. Saddam Hussein
is massing troops on the Kuwaiti border. Somebody up there likes
us!

Newt Draws Fire
<P>
NEW YORK,
<P>
It's interesting how many are left feeling insecure when the subject
of Newt Gingrich comes up. Dan Quayle, Spiro Agnew, Jesse Helms
-- they can be handled with that equanimity that mainlines its
way onto critics who are confident they are peering down on their
targets. Newt Gingrich doesn't work for them in quite that way.
For one thing he has a very advanced academic degree; for another,
he is politically defter than most of his critics, and nothing
generates hurt like yet one more primary victory by Tricky Dick.
Gingrich stitched together a year ago the unthinkable, a proposed
legislative agenda for a Republican Congress. The whole world
laughed at such presumption and the next thing we knew, the House
of Representatives became Republican. They stopped making certain
kinds of jokes about FDR after 100 days, but in the case of Newt,
the need to laugh begins to sound like the aristocracy in the
Winter Palace, continuing to twit while the Revolution gathered
outdoors. 
<P>
Consider Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. Her recent assault
on Gingrich was ostensibly triggered by his confession that he
was not schooled in foreign policy (he had blurted out that Taiwan
should be recognized diplomatically). But Miss Dowd doesn't conceal
the totality of her concern over the Speaker. She entitled her
piece ``The Loss of the Dodo''; led off by remarking that Newt
was ``sickeningly'' cute; and ended by confessing her ``distress''
at the prospect of ``the Speaker frolicking in the woods with
a bunch of guys in sheets and dresses.''
<P>
The ``cute'' business was a reaction to Mr. Gingrich's having
told a visiting witness that she was welcome to ``come see my
dinosaur.'' The reference is to a facsimile skull kept in Mr.
Gingrich's office, which wouldn't strike most people as ``cute,''
so long as the addict stops short of dinosaur figures on his stationery
or calls for a National Dinosaur Day.
<P>
As to the foreign-policy statement (Why don't we just recognize
Taiwan?), in the same issue that carried Miss Dowd's column, the
Times ran a major story about Taiwan and the loss of national
identity by its people. Taiwan is large enough and important enough
to warrant recognition, but we have here the problem of, ``If
you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread''
-- neither Taiwan nor China will affirm the obvious, which is
that modern Taiwan is as much a zone of modern China as Algeria
is a zone of France.
<P>
Then there is the frolicking in the woods. 
<P>
Miss Dowd noted that Mr. Gingrich would spend the weekend at the
Bohemian Grove, ``the exclusive men's club in northern California.
. . . The camp is a saturnalia of juvenilia, with a lot of old
white rich guys running around naked and in sheets, costumed as
Druids. They drink dawn-to-dusk gin fizzes, relieve themselves
on redwoods, and put on theatricals where they dress up like women.''

<P>
Well yes, but if you are playing the part of a woman in a theatrical,
what should you dress like? Miss Dowd might as well have written
that she doesn't understand why the people in the Metropolitan
Opera chorus go around clutching spears. 
<P>
About five years ago, CBS's Leslie Stahl did an interview with
me about women joining the Century Association. A few minutes
into the discussion she interrupted herself. ``Would you be willing
to talk about the Bohemian Club?''
<P>
Well, I said, it isn't something we're supposed to talk about.
. . .
<P>
``Well,'' Miss Stahl pressed, ``what about this business of going
around naked?''
<P>
I lowered my voice. ``In the years I've been going to the Bohemian
Club,'' I whispered, ``I have seen men naked only in the shower,
and now I'll tell you something in confidence.'' Her eyes hungered
for my revelation. The camera whirred. ``The Admissions Committee
of the Bohemian Grove does not like to admit to membership people
who shower with their clothes on.'' Miss Stahl simply smiled,
gamely. 
<P>
Did Maureen Dowd believe that men in the Grove go about naked?
No, she did not. Two days before her story appeared she telephoned
an old friend, an ex-member of the Club, who told her the naked
business was sheer fantasy -- ``It just doesn't happen.'' Perhaps
Miss Dowd thought to be cute by perpetuating the legend, and in
a way she succeeded, and I'd even go so far as to deny that she
was at this point sickeningly cute. 
<P>
Saturnalia? Those in the Bohemian Grove who drink gin fizzes all
day long (I know of two) drink gin fizzes from dawn to dusk wherever
they are. A drunkard need not bother to travel to California in
order to indulge his habit. But then Miss Dowd would rather spice
up her column than report facts, proving only that the antagonism
to Newt conquers all, even if it does not excuse all.

War Crimes and Misdemeanors
<P>
<LI>William Letwin's article, contrasting a recent visit to Japan with his earlier arrival as a young U.S. occupier in 1945, offers in general a benign judgment of what has been achieved by the Japanese since then. But about Japanese war guilt he feels disquiet.
<P>
With good reasons: the half-heartedness of the official Japanese apology for wartime crimes; the fact that even so modest a gesture was supported by less than half the Diet; and the Japanese concentration upon Hiroshima as the central event of World War II.
<P>
Mr. Letwin points to the main flaw of MacArthur's Occupation, otherwise rightly celebrated, namely that it did not force the Japanese to face up to the fact that Japan entered the war as an aggressor and committed war crimes on a scale that shocked even hardened soldiers. 
<P>
But national amnesia of that kind is common, national repentance on the postwar German model a rarity.
<P>
What is odd is that the U.S. should today agree to gloss over its victory. According to the script of President Clinton's Hawaii commemoration of V-J Day, however, it now turns out that we defeated the Pacific. As Dorothy Rabinowitz drily observed in the<I> Wall Street Journal</I>, the next stage will be to call it: Event in the Pacific.
<P>
This is doubtless intended to suggest America has generously decided to forget Japan's past crimes; unfortunately, it also enables Japan to do the same.

<P>

<LI>Almost every living GOP presidential candidate -- and some whose claim to be  living is questionable -- will have kow-towed to Ross Perot by now. Why?
<P>
It cannot be what he has to say. Now that we have grown used to his snappy (but lacking in nutrition) one-liners, Mr. Perot never says anything interesting, or indeed anything much. 
<P>
Nor can Republicans reasonably think that by proposing to Mr. Perot, they can marry the 19 per cent of voters who supported him in 1992. Mr. Perot was the beneficiary of a large protest vote, not its owner. 
The first Republican to dress down Mr. Perot will advance in the polls. He will have demonstrated the most important asset in politics -- authority.
<P>
Politicians unfailingly fail to grasp this. They imagine that the public wants likable and friendly leaders -- when what it wants above all is strong and decisive leaders. (Okay, okay. Voters would ideally prefer leaders who are both; but a Reagan or an FDR comes along once in a generation.)
<P>
So, the correct strategy for GOP hopefuls in Texas last weekend was to criticize Perot to his face while highlighting the issues his voters care about. 
<P>
Tell me: who did the right thing?


<P>
<LI>Senate rules are meant to cover breaches of a senator's public duty. Boorish actions in private are best dealt with by informal social sanctions such as snubbing. And no doubt decent women did shun Senator Packwood when they learned of his behavior.
<P>
But there is an interesting question that even Senator Barbara Boxer glided over: did his tactic of grabbing the nearest available girl and sticking his tongue into her mouth ever work?
<P>
If not, why did Mr. Packwood employ it for so long? After all, it is such an unpromising experiment that a few consistent failures would persuade most social scientists to try another approach.
<P>
The inference must be that its many humiliations were more than compensated for by a) the occasional conquest, and b) its sheer efficiency (no need of dinner, candlelight, flowers, etc.).
<P>
Will any of these responsive women come forward? Will they testify that it was the senator's power and glamor as a top legislator which led them so to forget themselves? And, if so, will they include those feminists who supported him long after his activities were known because they wanted his vote on abortion, etc.? He could stick his tongue into their PAC any time he chose.
<P>
I would continue on this theme, but it might become tasteless. 
<P>

28-August-1995
<P>



<P>
<LI>We know why President Clinton works so hard to make sure no one has a clue where he stands on anything. He figures, if it works for Colin Powell . . .
<P>
After a brief appearance on the Senate floor, Bob Dole's welfare-reform bill was prudently pulled. It was vulnerable to attack from all sides, but especially the Right. More than twenty senators had rallied to a conservative alternative championed by Phil Gramm -- with good reason. The block grants in the Dole bill retained a tangle of strings and sops to the Health and Human Services bureaucracy (the job-training block grant was some 110 pages long and wouldn't have taken effect until July 1998). Its work provisions would have been entirely meaningless if Dole hadn't at the last minute added ``pay for performance'' provisions pushed by Gramm, and they would still have allowed states to count bogus training programs as ``work.'' And the bill lacked crucial provisions to keep federal funds from subsidizing unwed motherhood. (Sen. Packwood reportedly said such restrictions would be a violation of women's reproductive rights.) If the bill had gone forward this month, it seemed likely only to get worse, with Dole promising new child-care measures and GOP moderates angling for a ``maintenance of effort'' requirement to keep state welfare spending at current levels. Better to wait until September, when perhaps the Senate leadership will have embraced welfare reform worthy of the name.
<P>
<LI>There won't be much R&R over the August recess for nervous House Republicans who have been sent home with talking points, charts, and video cassettes to make the case for a radical restructuring of Medicare. In the words of one leadership staffer, the members have been in ``boot camp'' for the past three months, honing a Medicare reform message that will withstand the Democrats' ``Mediscare'' campaign, which alleges that Republicans will slash spending to give tax cuts to the rich. Republicans believe the report issued in April by the Medicare Trustees, which forecast the program's bankruptcy by 2002, convinced the public of the need for reform. A late July CNN/<I> USA Today</I> poll indicates that 65 per cent of respondents believe Medicare has serious problems, warranting ``drastic action.'' Republicans will unveil their plan for Medicare in mid September; meanwhile they are stressing their commitment to the program, to the 40 per cent increase in spending per capita over the next seven years, and to the expanded choices they hope to include in their reform, including Medical Savings Accounts. A final vote is expected within a month of the GOP plan's introduction. As long as it provides the elderly a real choice of coverage, with no bias in favor of managed care, Republicans can fend off the charge that their plan is warmed-over Clintonism using HMOs to ration care. Speaker Gingrich believes that Medicare reform will be the biggest challenge facing his troops in this high-stakes Congress. They're well trained, they're armed with the facts, and they'll have a detailed plan. But with Medicare as the battleground and the AARP aligned with the Democrats, Newt might want to call on the House chaplain too.
<P>
<LI>GOP charges that President Clinton gave the final go-ahead for the deadly tank assault against the Branch Davidian compound in Waco are ridiculous. That would have required making a decision.
<P>
<LI>On September 12, the Reverend Jesse Jackson and the Reverend Al Sharpton plan to hold a prayer vigil outside the home of Justice Clarence Thomas. They want Thomas to ``repent'' his opinions on the Supreme Court. Broadly speaking, Thomas's opinions have reflected his view that the law should be color-blind and his regard for the Tenth Amendment. Jackson and Sharpton apparently view this as not merely mistaken but as sinful. No word yet on whether Tawana Brawley will come to the mourners' bench.
<P>
<LI>The number of shooting murders in New York City has dropped by 40 per cent over the last year. The reason: police keep their eyes open for minor offenders -- subway turnstile jumpers, public drinkers, loud boom-box players -- and then frisk them if they act suspiciously when approached. Gun-toting thugs, scared of losing their guns over a loud rap song, are leaving them at home. Some of the highest-crime areas in the city have not had a single shooting since the program began on June 1. Sadly, instead of praising the police, the New York Civil Liberties Union and other civil-rights advocates have attacked the program as discriminatory toward blacks and Hispanics in poor areas. Well, crime fighting has got to happen where the crime is. Don't break any laws and you won't get frisked. Law-abiding citizens have lived in fear of the thugoisie long enough. It's time thugs feared the law.
<P>
<LI>Republican presidential candidates would rather have gone to the Vatican for an audience with John Paul II than to Dallas for a confab with Ross Perot. You only have to kiss the Pope's ring.
<P>
<LI>As the debate over affirmative action heated up, Jack Kemp urged Republicans not to run ``a campaign that separates people by race and by gender.'' A number of conservatives, including NR, jumped on him for jumping on us (see ``Equality of Opportunism,'' Aug. 14). Responding in the<I> Washington Post</I>, Kemp explains what he means by ``affirmative action'' -- which turns out to be the supply-side gospel. Calling quotas ``antithetical to the genius of the American idea,'' Kemp calls for school choice, reforming the tax code, enterprise zones, and free trade. If he added keeping out unskilled aliens who snap up starter jobs from poor Americans, we'd be perfectly pleased, but four completions in five plays is good work, quarterback.
<P>
<LI>A study on affirmative action carried out for Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.) concluded that affirmative-action remedies for minorities and women in education have not worked. So she is having the report rewritten to reflect her previous views -- namely that affirmative-action remedies for minorities and women have worked and need to be expanded. Call it affirmative action for disadvantaged ideas.
<P>

<LI>Will the amalgam of three unions -- auto workers, steel workers, and machinists -- wield more power than the sum of its parts? When it comes to lobbying politicians or playing hardball with management, one big slush fund can do far more than three smaller ones. But unionism's decline has little to do with politics or the managerial mindset. Currently only 11 per cent of private employment is unionized. That's less than a third of the peak 36 per cent in 1953. Foreign competition and deregulation of key domestic industries have contributed to the decline. But there has also been a profound change in worker attitudes -- except in the public sector. White-collar workers now constitute a majority in both the service and manufacturing sectors. They reject the notion that management's losses are labor's gains. Not surprisingly, surveys show that white-collar workers overwhelmingly prefer individual representation to union representation. An educated workforce may be the biggest union-buster since the Pinkertons.
<P>
<LI>According to Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R., Fla.), Fidel Castro boasts that he has no difficulty blackmailing the U.S. because ``Clinton has no backbone and his knees shake.'' We resent that characterization. We can't necessarily deny it, but we resent it.
<P>
<LI>Last year <I> NR </I>suggested that the International Republican Institute was poorly managed and needed to be shaken up or shut down (``The Week,'' Oct. 10). A flurry of indignant letters assured us that the IRI was in mint condition, and accomplishing near miracles in promoting democracy and human rights abroad. Now it seems that the powers that be have come around to our point of view, for IRI Board Chairman Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) fired IRI President Bruce McColm at the beginning of August. But the IRI Board still cannot bring itself to look for first-rate Republican talent. Last time around, a nominating committee talked to GOP foreign-policy hands like Elliott Abrams, Paula Dobriansky, and John Bolton -- then kowtowed when Sen. McCain insisted on Mr. McColm, who, though he had an impressive record in human-rights activities, was not even a Republican. This time, the nominating committee did not bother to meet. Sen. McCain insisted on promoting IRI Vice President Lorne Craner, a former McCain Senate staffer. Mr. Craner may be the man for the job, but his role in the IRI under its last two presidents raises doubts. Apparently IRI Board members get free trips abroad, attend a few meetings, and vote as they are told. Kind of like being Cuba's ambassador to the UN.
<P>
<LI>Jacques Chirac set off a public-relations explosion in June when he announced that France, after a three-year moratorium, would conduct eight underground nuclear tests in the Mururoa coral atoll in French Polynesia. Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have protested and organized anti-French boycotts. The ubiquitous Greenpeace is in the act, too, getting ready to infiltrate the site, even though the environmental risks are negligible: the blasts occur deep in the core of an extinct underground volcano; no radioactivity can escape because the blast's heat vitrifies the rock.<I> Cherchez la politique</I>. Anti-nuclear agitation is always directed against Western defense policies and strategies. (No one pressured China to give up its recent testing.) If Greenpeace can veto French defense decisions, it will try to veto ours next. We back Jacques.
<P>
<LI>China announced that Harry Wu has confessed to stealing files from Vincent Foster's office, setting the fire that destroyed the Branch Davidian compound, and causing <I> Waterworld </I>to go millions of dollars over budget.
<P>
<LI>A recent issue of Wellesley College's alumnae magazine contained an article slamming Harvard's legendary President Charles Eliot as a male chauvinist, claiming that in an 1899 address at Wellesley he had said that women's colleges were ``superfluities.'' A Wellesley alumna looked up Eliot's address. In fact, he had said: ``The colleges for women are still regarded by many people as superfluities.'' He then proceeded to disagree vigorously with that view. The alumna sent the correction to the magazine and to the faculty. She received no answer. The magazine made no correction. Instead it printed gleeful letters to the editor based on the assumption of Eliot's chauvinism. Could a Wellesley freshman hand in an English-comp paper using such shoddy methods? Only in the service of such shoddy ideas.
<P>
<LI>Paragon Cable company of New York had the inspired idea of dealing with deadbeat customers by taking away all channels except C-SPAN, forcing them to pay up or else watch the United States Government at work. Money is pouring in.

<CENTER><H2>Letter from Al</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
28-August-1995
<P>
I'm getting a bigger office! 
<P>
For the past couple of years, space has been pretty tight in the West Wing, so I've made do with a smallish office next to the Private Dining Room -- I've always kept my big office across the street in the OEOB, but to be close to Bill, I've pretty much worked out of the West Wing, in an office so cramped that I couldn't open my ThinkPad all the way. 
<P>
Well, finally, there's a little more room. We've knocked down the wall between what used to be Mandy Grunwald's office and what used to be George Stephanopoulos's office, and connected them to what used to be Stan Greenberg's office (right down the hall from what used to be Paul Begala's office) and what used to be Mark Gearan's office. So my office is a little more roomy -- plenty of room on the couch for Bob Squier -- and the walls are finally thick enough that I won't bug Leon Panetta when I play ``Descent'' on my desktop COMPAQ with the HighRes SoundCard on ``Blaster'' mode. 
<P>
And also, finally, the mood around here is a lot lighter -- and not just because we've got more office space. In all honesty, a lot of that space is earmarked for other things -- Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton, for instance, is giving up her West Wing office to the envelope stuffers for the ``Run, Ross, Run!'' campaign. And Park Rangers and Justice Department investigators have sealed off Mack McClarty's office suite until they have fully investigated his strange and unexplained disappearance. 
<P>
Still, even in the heat of August, everyone's cheery. For one thing, Bill's approval ratings are soaring (mine, I may have mentioned, have held solid at 63% for years and years); and for another . . . well, actually, it's just the approval ratings. But that's enough. Not to brag, but when Bill is reaching Gore-like heights of popularity, well, what can I say? I think Tipper's book proposal, ``Surviving the Worst -- Al and Tipper Gore's Year of Trial'' may be a little premature. 
<P>
We've had a string of foreign-policy non-disasters -- starting with normalizing relations with Vietnam. It was time, Rusty, to heal the wounds from that bloody and troubled time in our nation's history. When I voluntarily gave up my college deferment and voluntarily joined the armed forces to serve my country in a war I didn't agree with -- others made a different choice; hey, time to move on; no judgment here -- little did I know how important it would be in the future to keep the Chinese guessing, and how convenient it would be to do that, thirty years later, by allowing the Vietnamese to purchase fully licensed ``Beavis and Butthead'' paraphernalia. Two birds with one stone, Rusty. Three, if you include Bill's war record, which I don't. 
<P>
The second foreign-policy triumph was in Bosnia. We finally put that conflict to rest. Talk about statecraft! Next issue . . .
<P>
So all in all, as we cruise to Labor Day, things are decidedly on the upswing. The mood is positively giddy. When the Secret Service noticed someone lurking around the West Wing looking ``exactly like the Unabomber,'' they wrestled him to the ground and beat him unconscious with their rifle butts. Turned out it was George Stephanopoulos, who had, unbeknownst to any of us, grown a mustache and beard. The Servicemen apologized and apologized, but George was pretty calm about the whole thing -- he took it in stride. There was a time when something like that would have hit the newswires in an instant, but these days, the media's not terribly interested in George Stephanopoulos. I mean, the guy grew a mustache and a beard and no one even knew it. 
<P>
With the poll numbers looking up, we're all breathing a little bit easier on this whole Whitewater matter. The hearings are still going on, but mostly what they've revealed is that the Clintons had a whole lot of friends and a very wide circle of acquaintances, and many of these friends offered the Clintons -- in friendship -- investment advice. (Arkansas is a hotbed of investing, apparently.) And that most of these friends told some of the acquaintances not altogether the truth about these investments, and in any case, they've complied fully with every request for information, except for the requests they haven't, and the documents are being reviewed. 
<P>
See what I mean? I may as well settle in, because I've got an extra four more years surfing the 'Net from this office coming my way! 
<P>
Gotta go! The whole staff is getting together in one of the empty offices to stuff ``Dole in '96'' envelopes.

<P>
<H3>Little Girl from Little Rock</H3>
<P><LI>Searching for phrases to describe Hillary Rodham Clinton's first newspaper column, I
find myself sounding like a wine snob: ``a certain naive charm,'' ``fresh and green-tasting with
hints of corn,'' and ``needs plenty of time to mature -- keep in a dark place.''
<P>It may not be Mrs. Clinton's own handiwork, of course. It lacks, for instance, the wacky
sophomoric platitudes of her valedictory address at Wellesley  -- the collected works of Marcuse,
Abbie Hoffman, and the Weathermen put through a blender and spread very thin. Nor does it
have any taint of her earnest postdoctoral search for ``meaning.''
<P>Indeed, she seems to have regressed to the fourth grade, where she is now writing about
``places I have been'' and . . . well, read on:
<P>``I also have met a lot of interesting people. Some are famous, like Lady Bird Johnson,
Nelson Mandela, and Mother Teresa. But most are men and women we never hear about who
wake up in the morning'' etc., etc.
<P>Through all Mrs. Clinton's personality changes, however, a certain Essential Hillary shines
though: bossy, determined, ambitious, and out of her depth.
<P>Once she saw a vision on the Road to Woodstock. It turned out to be an hallucination, or at
any rate it has had very disappointing results. But there is another Vision just around the corner
if only we would keep quiet and follow her. Orders have not worked; perhaps a little soft soap
will do the trick.
<P>Hence, ``. . . this column will give me the chance to talk things over in the hope that some of
you will join the conversation.''
<P>Over to you, Florence.



<P><LI>Recent articles in NR have dealt with the delicate question of what powers should be
given to the FBI in a politicized age. Much depends, of course, on how sophisticated the feds
are; Can they distinguish between a Bollinger Bolshevik and the real thing? 
<P>I am indebted to Bob Conquest for guiding me to a footnote by the distinguished
criminologist, Sir Leon Radzinowicz, about a philosophical policeman from Scotland Yard who
did just that.
<P>Sergeant W. Reiners, of the Metropolitan Police Office, called on Karl Marx in London on
August 1, 1874, in connection with his petition to become a British subject. Marx did not fool
the London bobby.
<P>``He is the notorious German agitator, the head of the International Society, and an advocate
of Communist principles,'' wrote the sleuth in his official report, adding significantly: ``He has
not been loyal to his own King and Country.'' Hence, by implication, he was unlikely to be loyal
to Britain's.
<P>Good work, Sergeant. Keep an eye on the blighter.



<P><LI>May I make clear that the non-appearance of the Trans-O-Gram in this and the previous
issue is not my fault. I have to be categorical about this because the last time it happened, I was
verbally assaulted by a Supreme Court Justice, a distinguished historian, and several elected
officials in a public place.
<P>Mr. Kem Putney, our puzzle-maker, is indisposed. We decided not to run an earlier
Trans-O-Gram because its devotees are hawk-eyed (and so would notice) and passionate (and so
would kick up a fuss). But we may be forced to such a recourse if Mr. Putney's indisposition
continues. 
<P>Just don't blame me. 



<P><LI>And now for a real apology. I am indebted to Richard Cowden Guido for correcting my
quotation from Dostoyevsky. He points out that what Ivan Karamazov actually says in Brothers
Karamazov is that without God ``everything is permissible.''
<P>As Mr. Cowden Guido points out: ``It  was Christ who said that everything is possible, albeit
with God, not without Him.'' Not therefore a trivial mistake.
<P>My apologies and my thanks to Mr. Cowden Guido. In future I will try to live up to
journalism's first rule: Always verify.

<P><LI>Announcing he was quitting as <B>Bob Dole</B>'s South Carolina co-chairman to
take same job with Sen. <B>Phil Gramm</B>'s presidential campaign, former congressman
<B>Arthur Ravenel</B> cited as reason Dole's chief of staff, <B>Sheila Burke</B>: ``She's a
former liberal Democrat, and she's still liberal, and it's said she has a great deal of influence over

Washington Post</I> ran story with headline ``Dole's Chief of Staff Is Magnet for Criticism.''
<I>Post</I> also quoted conservative activist <B>Paul Weyrich</B>: ``I was the one to fire the
first salvo. Anything good we've gotten from Dole has been over her dead body.'' . . . Dole,
though, has picked up support from unexpected quarter: Arkansas chicken mogul and former
<B>Clinton</B> buddy <B>Don Tyson</B>, whose spokesman says ``Bill Clinton's election is
the worst thing that has ever happened to Tyson Foods and the state of Arkansas.'' . . . Air of

Fiske said he found no evidence that White House aide <B>Vincent Foster</B> was worried
about Whitewater when he committed suicide. In Foster's handwritten notes which were
available to Fiske, however, the committee found plenty. Fiske was initially recommended for
counsel's spot by ex-Clinton counsel <B>Bernard Nussbaum</B>, who has emerged in
committee hearings as leader of efforts to block police from searching Foster's office. In private
practice, Nussbaum and Fiske were friends and gave each other client referrals. . . . Whitewater
panel member Sen. <B>Frank Murkowski</B> (R., Alaska) hit front pages by holding up
Foster's briefcase to show Clinton aides couldn't have missed suicide note inside. He also
prompted first Watergate-style malapropism from defensive Democrats. Thrashing around with
briefcase, indignant Clinton defender Sen. <B>John Kerry</B> (D., Mass.) announced -- in a

closes essentially shut. You can't see in it. I can't see in it. Nobody could see in it.''

<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>
The Cigar, Revisited</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
WILLIAM A. RUSHER
<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
Mr. Rusher, NR's former publisher, is a Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute.
<P>
IN THE special section on ``Pleasure & Its Perils'' in the May 1 issue of NATIONAL REVIEW, our young literary editor, David Klinghoffer, took a swing at ``pretended pleasures.'' He cites two well-known examples: one (the ``white lie,'' as in ``Doesn't the bride look lovely?'') that he approves, and one (which might be called the ``white laugh,'' since it involves laughing at a joke that isn't funny) about which he is somewhat more reserved.
<P>
Then he goes on to scorn -- quite properly, in my opinion -- those who pretend to virtue by admiring what is not admirable but only fashionable (bad foreign films, for example), or by ``abstaining from anything that might prematurely deprive [them] of life in this world: fatty foods, booze, and, above all, cigarettes.'' That sets him up for his final fusillade against water bars, coffee bars, and similar establishments that replace ``the old-fashioned, sinful kind of bar where alcohol and tobacco are ingested.''
<P>
But then Mr. Klinghoffer makes a fatal misstep, complaining that in Manhattan ``The first restaurant for cigar smokers has already opened. . . . Today, one chooses . . . not a cigarette (which is inhaled) but a cigar (which is not). . . . In sticking to safe pleasures such as a cigar, and extolling them as if they were the real thing, a person declares his allegiance to the leading ideology of the day: . . . secular left-liberalism, which took God from us and now seeks to take away even the consolation of genuine pleasure.''
Cigars ``not the real thing''? David, my boy, you have a lot to learn.
<P>
First, let's dispose of the notion that the pleasure of a good cigar must be faked because a cigar isn't inhaled. It's true that a cigar smoker doesn't (simply because he can't) inhale the way a cigarette smoker does: drawing huge billows of smoke into his mouth and thence directly into his lungs, to be exhaled in a great white cloud. Cigar smoke is stronger and thicker than cigarette smoke, and inhaling it that way is simply an invitation to choke.
<P>
But watch a cigar smoker carefully. He will draw smoke from the cigar into his mouth, exhale it gently, and then -- when it has mixed with the air -- inhale a portion of the mixture into his lungs, thereafter exhaling it quietly and almost invisibly. And the air around him will remain perfumed with cigar smoke, and available for further inhalation, almost until he draws on the cigar again.
<P>
In other words, the whole point of smoking a cigar is to savor its aroma and flavor, gentled by the air (and, of course to obtain the agreeable ``nicotine fix'' that all tobacco provides). There is nothing ``pretended'' about it. As a matter of fact, I would argue that smoking a good cigar is one of the most superbly sensual pleasures known to man. (And perhaps spiritual too -- a priest I know calls a cigar ``a sacrament.'')
What's more, just now -- right at the apogee of the national anti-smoking hysteria, when everyone's hand is turned against them -- cigars are making a comeback in the United States that deserves to be called historic. The broader cause is a pronounced upswing in the number of men who have decided to spend a little money on enjoying themselves before they die; but the immediate precipitating factor is a new quarterly magazine called Cigar Aficionado, published by Marvin Shanken, who also publishes The Wine Spectator.
<P>
Shanken is a journalistic genius who is well on his way to cornering the market in magazines catering to those in search of self-indulgent luxury. Simply to thumb through his two publications, reading the come-hither articles and looking at the ads (for everything from humidors to yachts), is to be introduced to a world of unrepentant enjoyment.
<P>
Cigar Aficionado was launched only about three years ago, but it has already led to a humongous boom in cigar sales  -- above all, in sales of the very best cigars. Cigar purveyors are being swamped with orders they cannot fill for months; cigar manufacturers are stepping up production as fast as they can, all too aware that they dare not sacrifice quality lest they ruin the reputation of their finest products. Predictably, cigar prices are going through the roof. But nobody seems to care.
<P>
On April 19 every one of the 31 Ritz Carlton Hotels in the world participated in an ``International Cigar Celebration,'' in the form of a sumptuous black-tie dinner (at $200 a plate) from which those attending took away (if they had not already smoked) eight superb cigars, including a Temple Hall Belicoso, a Partagas Limited Reserve, and a Macanudo Prince of Wales. I was number 54 on the waiting list for the affair at the San Francisco Ritz Carlton until a well-connected friend took pity on me and pulled the necessary strings.
<P>
Telling the two hundred guests at that dinner (most of them not old fogies like myself, but young San Francisco businessmen clearly on their way up) that they were proclaiming their ``allegiance to the leading ideology of the day: . . . secular left-liberalism'' would have invited either hilarity or fisticuffs. I doubt that anybody there was to the left of Newt Gingrich.
<P>
Like anything else, cigars can be overdone. One could, I am sure, smoke too many. (I recently heard of one nonagenarian who has cut back from twenty a day to eight.) And lately, as a result of Marvin Shanken's indefatigable promotion of their pleasures (and perhaps in an attempt to justify the resulting prices), efforts to describe the ineffable characteristics of particular cigars have begun to display the metaphorical excess that has long bedeviled the description of fine wines: e.g., ``filled with cocoa and coffee-bean flavors backed up by smooth woody and leathery notes'' (Cigar Aficionado, Spring 1995).
<P>
But these are quibbles. In the context of contemporary American culture, a good cigar is almost as eloquent as those little American flags that so many of us wore on our lapels in the early 1970s. It proclaims, first of all, that one is an individualist, not easily lured into the deadening conformity of cigarettes -- or, worse yet, into the smug self-righteousness of the health fascists of the anti-smoking brigade. It asserts, second, that the cigar-smoker believes in pleasure, is ready to seek it and spend money on it, and takes time to smell, if not the flowers, then at least the seductive aromas of the humidor. Finally, by its historic identification with good food, it speaks also of a high regard for the delights of the table.
<P>
``Allegiance to secular left-liberalism''? David, what do you think are passed at Bill Buckley's home, after one of Pat's magnificent dinners? What can you hear interfering, every so often, with Rush Limbaugh's enunciation as he sits there at the microphone lecturing his troops?
<P>
De gustibus non est disputandum. But for me, at least, when I have finished lunch and settled into my favorite leather armchair at my club, the Cigar Hour that follows (best of all, of course, with a new issue of NR to read) is the very quintessence of felicity -- and of conservatism.

<P>

<LI>President Clinton has finally had it with Bosnia. He's thinking of deploying the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.



<P><LI>Item by item, the Contract with America is falling a couple of Republican senators
short of enactment. Regulatory reform is the latest victim. By the time the reform bill hit the
Senate floor in July it had been weakened to such an extent -- no provision for applying the
reforms to current rules; weakened provisions for judicial review of regulations -- that it had lost
the support of free-marketeers like the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Even then it was headed
for trouble with the Democrats. They set up a negotiating troika of John Kerry (Mass.), Carl
Levin (Mich.), and John Glenn (Ohio) that was less interested in compromise than in scuttling
the bill. One list of demands the negotiators submitted to Republicans actually had an asterisk
reserving the right to make more demands -- just in case the current ones were met. Meanwhile,
the OMB's czarina of regulatory affairs, Sally Katzen, kept up a drumbeat of outrageous charges,
while the media, especially ABC News, retailed its own (children dying from tainted meat
topped the list). The GOP response was lost in the buzz. In the end, Bob Dole got all
Republicans, even prodigal moderates like John Chafee, to vote for cloture on the bill. But that
wasn't enough. And it won't be until Senate Republicans get some new colleagues.



<P><LI>In the game of inside baseball, Florida Senator Connie Mack, grandson of the
legendary Philadelphia A's owner, recently hit a grand slam, as Senate Republicans adopted most
of the internal-rule reforms he had been pushing. Henceforth, at the beginning of each new
Congress, Republican senators will vote to adopt an agenda, a mini Contract with America. A
committee's choice of its chairman -- are you listening Mark Hatfield? John Chafee? -- must now
be ratified by a secret vote of the whole GOP conference. And committee chairmen will be
limited to six-year terms. All of this tends to chip away at the senatorial independence that has
made it possible for Republican senators to abandon key provisions of the Contract. Adoption of
the rules is the best thing that could have happened to Senate Republicans this year -- short of
Mark Hatfield's being sent down to the minors.



<P><LI>Yes, we want the Supreme Court rebuked sometime, somewhere. But is the
flag-burning amendment the right time and place? If Congress really wanted to light a fire under
the Court, it would invoke Article III, Section 2 (``. . . the Supreme Court shall have appellate
jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the
Congress shall make''). Passing an amendment concedes the Court's power. Besides, if we need
an amendment to undo every judicial outrage, the Constitution will look like a flea market.
Leave the junk business to the courts.



<P><LI>When Harold Rogers (R., Ky.), chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and
Judiciary Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, decided to triple funding for
programs instituted by last year's Violence Against Women Act, from $25 million to $75
million, congressional women, including Republican Conference Vice Chairman Susan
Molinari, howled at his stinginess. Any funding below the Clinton Administration's $175-million
request, it seems, is sheer misogyny. Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (La.)
-- a good cop working in a bad neighborhood -- tried to stand his ground, but a compromise
eventually sent an additional $40 million into an account for battered-women programs, much of
which will end up in the pockets of the feminist Left. Republicans need this old-style politics
like a fish needs a bicycle.



<P><LI>The White House report on affirmative action includes the following triple-negative
doozy: ``The federal programs . . . do not unduly burden non-beneficiaries.'' In English (we hope
this does not unduly burden non-English speakers), that means the onus that affirmative action
currently imposes on men and whites is, well, due. Call it the white man's burden.



<P><LI>Feminists and gay-rights advocates have taken a new turn into the perverse. Congress is
considering legislation -- put forward by Gary Ackerman (D., N.Y.) and Tom Coburn (R., Okla.)
-- to require states to test newborns for HIV, just as they test for diseases like syphilis and
sickle-cell anemia. The advantages of knowing a baby's HIV status are many. The child can be
treated immediately with AZT, which may reduce his chances of actually developing AIDS. The
mother can avoid breast-feeding, which transmits AIDS. Finally, special precautions can be
taken to protect the child against illnesses like pneumonia. But the sexual radicals don't bother
with details. The proposed testing of babies, the president of the New York City chapter of NOW
recently wrote, ``is just one example of the erosion of a woman's right to control her own [sic]
body.'' Gay-rights activists, meanwhile, don't like the idea of any testing. Forget ``Suffer the little
children.'' Try, Let the little children suffer.



<P><LI>Officials of the Republican National Committee arrived at the office one morning to
discover that most of their issues had been stolen. They were later found in the Oval Office, but
Clinton aides say they have no idea how they got there.



<P><LI>Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes Jr. is thinking of joining the field of Republican presidential
candidates, and why not? In an earlier era his scant political resume would have been an
automatic disqualification, but when preachers, talking heads, and billionaires seek the Oval
Office, Forbes's eight years as chairman of the Board of International Broadcasting make him
seem like John Adams. Forbes represents the total-immersion wing of the supply-side
movement; his main issues are the flat tax and sound money. He thinks prosperity will solve
many of the problems that underlie the social issues. He is also unimpressed with the Beltway
fixation on balancing the budget. By itself, this seems too meager to serve as a winning formula
for him, or for the GOP. But it was certainly part of Ronald Reagan's winning formula. It would
not be a bad thing to add it to the current Republican mix.



<P><LI>Michael Lind has been described as a man full of learning, information -- and himself.
Evidence of the last appears in a review of Dick Armey's new book, <I>The Freedom
Revolution</I>, in which Mr. Lind blithely accuses the congressman of having ``bungled his
math.'' Armey had written that an individual in the lowest fifth of all incomes in 1979 was more
likely to have advanced to the top quintile ten years later than to have remained mired in the
lowest group. That struck Mr. Lind as a politically inspired howler. It isn't. Armey's statement is
verified by a Treasury Department study that tracked the ups and downs of 14,000 taxpayers
during the Eighties. Treasury found that roughly 17 per cent of the people who were in the
lowest income bracket during a typical Eighties year rose to a higher bracket in the following
year. As a result, only 14 per cent of those people stuck at the bottom in 1979 were still there ten
years later, while 15 per cent had made it to the highest income bracket. These success stories
were mainly baby-boomers, not unlike Mr. Lind himself. Unfortunately, he thinks he's the only
one.



<P><LI>Acting in unseemly haste, the U.S. Congress is voting on whether to move a statue of
some suffragettes up from the Capitol basement, where it has been sitting since 1921.



<P><LI>The banking industry's version of the abominable snowman has been spotted once
again. After massaging data from a notoriously flawed study by the Boston Federal Reserve
Bank, researchers at the Chicago Fed now claim that banks do indeed reject blacks more often
than equally qualified whites. It's not necessarily racism, mind you. William C. Hunter, author of
the latest study, allows as how bank credit officers, who are overwhelmingly white, simply have
trouble relating to applicants who are from different cultural and economic backgrounds. But if
cultural biases are at work, will Mr. Hunter explain why the relative denial rates by race are the
same at black-owned banks as white-owned banks? And why the default rates on loans approved
for blacks and Hispanics are about the same as for whites? Bankers care about money, not race.



<P><LI>``The GOP is on the brink of being embroiled in a bitter and untidy debate about
immigration reform,'' begins Jamie Dettner's story in the estimable <I>Insight</I> magazine. But
Dettner, otherwise perceptive, illustrates one reason for the untidiness. He relies on the Urban
Institute's estimates of immigrant welfare participation and net fiscal impact. But those estimates
are the result of manipulation, as UC San Diego Professor George Borjas showed in the April 17
NR. The Institute eliminates the immigration problem by eliminating problem immigrants -- for
example, Mexicans are removed from the total on the grounds that many are illegal, although
Mexico is also the leading source of <I>legal</I> immigrants. Authors Jeffrey Passel and Barry
Edmonston have yet to challenge Borjas. But in the one-way immigration debate permitted by
our political elite, they probably figure they don't have to.



<P><LI>Rebels in the Sudan captured some UN workers and then, for unknown and
unimaginable reasons, let them go. Like, we want them back or something?



<P><LI>Senator Jesse Helms has proposed a landmark foreign-policy bill that would (among
other things) abolish three semi-autonomous agencies -- the U.S. Information Agency (USIA),
the foreign-aid dispensing Agency for International Development (AID), and the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) -- and fold their residual functions into the State Department.
The Helms bill has, deservedly, garnered widespread support. But Senator Joseph Lieberman has
offered an amendment that would preserve USIA's autonomy, on the grounds that its unique
``public diplomacy'' function (which includes supervision of the Voice of America) is better
served by a degree of independence from State Department micromanagement. We join many
prominent conservatives -- Jeane Kirkpatrick, Malcolm Wallop, Steve Forbes, Ed Feulner,
Michael Novak, Eugene Rostow, Richard John Neuhaus -- in seconding his motion.



<P><LI>Bill Clinton's effort to tar the Republicans as ``isolationists'' is not working abroad. The
Polish foreign minister met with Senator Dole in mid July and came away with a sense of what's
good for Poland. According to the <I>Financial Times</I>, he ``expressed doubts about the
Clinton Administration's commitment to early NATO enlargement, and suggested that his
government was already looking to a Republican President to make good on the promise after
next year's presidential election.'' All the progess in East - West relations, he added, had been
made under Republican Presidents.



<P><LI><I>New York Newsday</I> folded after ten years, victim of journalistic economics,
and of the lack of a constituency for blue-collar liberalism. In the tabloid's last week on earth,
some PC gnome changed a reference to The Five Blind Boys of Alabama, the black gospel
group, to The Five Blind Men of Alabama. Another year, and it would have been The Five
Visually Challenged Persons of the Cherokee Homeland.



<P><LI><I>Kids</I>, the hot new movie critics call ``frank,'' ``serious,'' and a ``wake-up call to
the world,'' recounts a day in the life of a middle-class white Manhattan teenager, who takes
frightening quantities of illicit drugs, talks in unremitting obscenities, beats a black man
senseless with his buddies, and pursues his hobby of deflowering virgins. He also has AIDS.
<I>Kids</I> is nothing new for the Disney-owned film distributor Miramax and its chief,
Harvey Weinstein, who brought you <I>The Crying Game</I> (adventures of a transvestite),
<I>Pulp Fiction</I> (shocking violence as cool humor), and the Catholic-bashing <I>Priest</I>.
Yet when <I>Kids</I> received an NC-17 rating, Disney pretended to draw the line by refusing
to let Weinstein market it under the Miramax name. So Weinstein set up an ``independent''
distributor called Excalibur. You know -- like <I>The Sword in the Stone</I>.



<P><LI>You are Rodney King. <I>The</I> Rodney King. And you are on a roll. Back in 1991
you led police on a 100-mph chase through Los Angeles and then tried to slug it out with them.
Those guys were rough, but when they were acquitted you had the Big R, man, that's Riot, a
billion-dollar riot. Nobody disses Rodney King any more, man. You are Rodney King. Yes, you
have been picked up twice since then for DWI. Yes, you have been picked up twice for
wife-beating. And, oh yes, you picked up a prostitute who turned out to be a transvestite and so
you tried to run him over. You're on a roll. Maybe you'll star in a movie with Hugh Grant. No
one can put Rodney King in jail, not <I>the</I> Rodney King. They dis Rodney King, they've
got another billion-dollar riot. Hop in. We can get from here to Santa Monica in ninety seconds.
Take a pull on this Old Screech Owl.



<P><LI>From the <I>New York Times</I>: ``Sounding hoarse but robust, President Boris

<HR>
<P>
RAMESH PONNURU
<BR><I>
Mr. Ponnuru is NR's national reporter.
</I>
<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
``IF WE oppose set-asides and quotas,'' the memo began, ``we must be willing to support policies that will achieve equal opportunity for all, as opportunity has not been equal and is not currently equal for blacks, women, and others.'' No, the memo wasn't part of the Clinton Administration's internal review of affirmative action. Representative Nancy Johnson (Conn.) sent it to her Republican colleagues, whom she urged to adopt a ``clear, positive message on affirmative action.'' Specifically, she wanted them ``to offer women significant opportunities to compete in sports''; to let universities and employers take race and sex into account; to treat ``evidence of affirmative hiring processes'' as ``presumptive evidence of non-discrimination, encouraging employers to develop these processes''; and to favor ``socially and economically disadvantaged contractors plus women-owned companies'' in federal contracting. Her conclusion: ``Just as quotas are bad, so outlawing any consideration of difference is wrong.'' In other words, scrap preferences -- but keep preferences.
<P>
It's not a very inspiring battle-cry. Mrs. Johnson has at times seemed fearful that even Bill Clinton would go too far in criticizing preferences: she later issued the memo, slightly altered, as a press release directed at him (``Johnson Urges President to Support Affirmative Action Policies That Will Achieve Equal Opportunity for All''). Since her memo reflects the thinking of many liberal Republicans, it may prove difficult to keep them on board for an affirmative-action rollback. Indeed, the problem is not only Republican liberals: the party as a whole has shown little enthusiasm for moving toward a race-neutral legal regime.
<P>
Scrapping affirmative action wasn't supposed to be this hard. Just three months ago, the conventional wisdom held that it was about to crumble. The Congress started promisingly by killing a minority tax break; William Kristol lauded it for ``opening the entire, rusted arsenal of federal 'affirmative action' provisions to real, meaningful debate at last.'' Most of the Republican presidential candidates called for major reform. So did candidate Clinton. The California Civil Rights Initiative, designed to ban racial and sexual preferences in state hiring, contracting, and university admissions, seemed unstoppable, and sure to keep the issue in the spotlight through November 1996. Now Clinton is reaffirming the status quo, Republicans are addressing the issue tepidly if at all, the California campaign is having trouble raising funds, and the ``meaningful debate'' is stalled.
<P>Getting the 700,000 valid signatures necessary for the CCRI to qualify for the ballot will take roughly $1 million. Large Republican donors have not been opening their pocketbooks fast enough to meet that goal. The recent appointment of San Diego businessman Darrell Issa as co-chairman of the campaign may improve the situation. But national Republican leaders have largely failed to respond to requests for help. When Glynn Custred, one of the two academics who proposed the CCRI, visited Washington, D.C., in April to garner support, officials at the Republican National Committee stood him up. Lamar Alexander and Pete Wilson quickly endorsed the measure -- the latter even signing a fund-raising letter for it -- but other Republican presidential candidates have dragged their feet. Wilson's support has brought some disadvantages: by persuading the University of California Board of Regents to abandon racial preferences, he has removed some of the urgency of passing the CCRI. And the initiative has become so associated with his presidential bid that some conservative figures now appear unwilling to aid it.
<P>
ACTIVISTS in Washington have also had reason to doubt the commitment of Republicans. Repeated delays in the introduction of a bill by Bob Dole and Charles Canady to stop mandating preferences in federal hiring, contracting, and program administration have exasperated them. (Dole now promises to introduce it in late July.) A narrower proposal by Phil Gramm to end some federal set-asides by cutting off appropriations for them failed in the Senate thanks to 19 Republican defections. Not a single senator joined Gramm in speaking for the proposal during two hours of debate.
<P>
Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice, who coordinates conservative efforts on preferences, calls Canady ``a congressional hero . . . both a solid rock and a moving force.'' Hearings before Canady's subcommittee, however, have disconcerted preference opponents. When preference supporters make a foolish or offensive comment, nobody calls them on it. When Democrats verbally abuse witnesses, Republicans don't fight back. Barbara Ledeen of the Independent Women's Forum still fumes recalling her testimony in April: at one point every Republican congressman but Canady left, while all the Democrats stayed. Republicans have been more effective in recent hearings, but the difference in intensity persists.
The Republicans' lack of focus on affirmative action results partly from legislators having their hands full with issues -- like the budget, Medicare, and welfare reform -- that have been deemed more important. In addition, congressmen are unfamiliar with the issue and reluctant to confront it. Democrats see preferences as a bread-and-butter issue politically, while Republicans merely have a mild preference against preferences. And as one staffer explains, ``It's no fun . . . being called racist, being compared to Hitler. There are a lot of weak knees.''
<P>
Some Republicans fear that attacking affirmative action could endanger an imminent breakthrough in black support for the party. David Bositis, who studies minority politics at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, pours cold water on the notion that a breakthrough is around the corner, and suggests that affirmative action would not necessarily prevent one anyway. Blacks willing to listen to what Republicans have to say, he contends, ``would be turned off if it were perceived that the Republicans were approaching this as a wedge issue,'' but not if they ``were going on principle.'' Moreover, at least one-third of black voters have long been skeptical of affirmative action.
<P>
Concern over the black vote has nonetheless led Republicans, including Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, to seek a ``positive'' message to complement opposition to racial preferences. They want to link repeal to ``empowerment'' measures like school choice and enterprise zones, a tactic with undoubted appeal. Others fear, however, that this tactic both makes empowerment seem a crass, opportunistic ploy to appease blacks and concedes that abolishing racial preferences is a step for which Republicans should apologize. ``Color-blindness is so good in itself that you shouldn't have to link it with anything,'' says John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. If Republicans want to win black votes, Bolick says, ``The key thing is a Republican presidential candidate who is willing to campaign in black churches, not a cobbled-together legislative package.''
<P>
Miller also complains that nobody is attacking ``the worst violations of color-blindness, the ones that have made the issue'': preferences in college admissions and in the private sector. Republicans are not proposing to change the legal rules that push the private sector toward quotas (e.g., treating employment practices that have a statistically ``disparate impact'' as discriminatory). Those rules were codified in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 with the support of most Republicans, many of them still on the Hill. One staffer notes, ``To require them to change their votes would kill this thing coming out of the gates.'' It would also draw opposition from big business, which has a large stake in current policies.
<P>
Sluggishness on preferences now may make the issue loom larger in 1996 -- an effect some Republican politicians will welcome. But proponents of color-blindness fear that race relations will deteriorate as long as preferences survive, creating opportunities for demagogues of all colors. They want to eliminate preferences now. But first they will have to overcome what Representative Johnson calls ``the proud history of Republicans in creating and using affirmative action.''

Works in Progress
<P>
<LI>With this issue, NATIONAL REVIEW appears in a splendid new design -- the work of our talented art director, Luba Kolomytseva. We hope that readers find it easy on the eye and enticing to read.
<P>
But further improvements will doubtless occur to Mrs. Kolomytseva after publication. And we are always attentive to suggestions from readers. Consider it a work in progress.


<P>
<LI>Exactly five years ago -- the last time that flag-burning was a political issue -- I wrote on this page: ``. . . [a] constitutional amendment would paradoxically make the flag a symbol of national disunity and partisan passions over two long years. It would be better perhaps to allow the odious antics of a few America-haters to remind the other 247 million Americans of the fundamental patriotism that unites them.''
<P>I am inclined to be even more liberal today. There has been little flag-burning in the last five years -- perhaps because the ``odious antics of a few
America-haters''<I> have</I> reminded the other 247 million Americans of the fundamental patriotism that unites them. Certainly the election results suggest so.
<P>More significantly, if expressive actions are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment, then common sense suggests that flag-burning is indeed closer to the political speech the Founding Fathers thought they were protecting than expressive actions such as nude dancing.
<P>Of course, I do not grant that expressive actions <I>are</I> constitutionally protected speech. But since I seem to have lost that battle, let me exploit my defeat.
<P>If flag-burning is protected by the First Amendment, so surely are cigar- and cigarette-burning. They clearly express hostility to the puritan regulation of our pleasures by a politically correct New Class of bureaucrats. 
<P>This argument seems stronger if the smoker is a non-smoker because his motives are presumably less mixed. The smoker might be smoking for enjoyment rather than for protest. But such an objection is easily countered: the right to free speech has never been invalidated on the grounds that the speaker liked the sound of his own voice (though, come to think of it . . . ).
<P>So, light up. You are employing your constitutional right to free speech -- and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.


<P>
<LI>O'Sullivan's Law -- ``An organization that is not explicitly right-wing will become left-wing over time'' -- continues to be confirmed by reality. 
<P>The latest organization to illustrate it is Action for Children's Television. Back in 1971, ACT asked the Federal Communications Commission to exercise greater control over television programming because (among other reasons) ``parents, no matter how attentive, sincere, or knowledgeable, are not in a position to really exercise effective control'' over what programs their children see. 
<P>By 1987, 1990, and 1994, however, ACT was leading the charge in challenging FCC bans on the late-evening broadcasting of indecent programs. It now took the view that children were at home during those hours and parents were able to supervise their TV fare.
<P>Lights! Camera! Inaction!


<P>
<LI>Friends are pressing me to run for President, but I am as yet undecided. 
<P>They argue, very plausibly, that with Jack Kemp sitting this one out, no candidate represents the upbeat, optimistic, generous-hearted spirit of the modern Republican Party. That I possess these qualities almost to excess will be confirmed by my bankers. On the other hand, February in New Hampshire is extremely cold, and I do not ski. 
<P>
The choice is a finely balanced one. I shall ponder my options through the summer, exploring the national mood through the pages of the
<I>Manchester Union-Leader</I> and working on the problem of how it is that taxes always seem to rise even when they fall. 
<P>Come Labor Day, I shall either announce for President, or not, as the mood takes me.

<BODY>
<H2><CENTER> Was Ames A Mortal Blow?
</CENTER></H2>
<HR>




<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 4
<P>

A legislator who is critically important on such questions as who gets U.S. funding managed a very brief exchange at an affair too noisy to permit fine conversational calibrations. He asked, ``Do you think the CIA can be saved?'' I murmured that I hoped so. He shook his head mournfully. ``I don't think so, not after Ames.''<P>
The reference was to Aldrich Ames. Four books about his treachery were reviewed over the weekend in the <I>New York Times</I> and most of what was said was vaguely familiar, including that ten Russians were martyred at his dirty hands. Less prominent in the memory was the extraordinary behavior of CIA security. Ames disguised himself about as subtly as King Kong, but it seemed that there was nothing he could do blatant enough to attract the attention of the agency whose mission it is to protect the security of the United States and protect the friends of freedom who risk their lives by joining the resistance movement. During those days, 1985 - 91, Mr. Ames feared one thing. Not the CIA or the FBI or the OMB. He feared that friends of the men he was betraying, month after month, would notice the gory disappearance of a member of the resistance and advise Washington that obviously there had been a betrayal. One or two such signals did get through, but it occurred to nobody in charge at the CIA to rope in the alcoholic traitor even though he had become so carefree in his habit that he removed from Langley not discreet copies, but the original documents identifying our hidden friends in the Soviet Union. 
<P>
One recalls the trauma in Great Britain when they caught on to Kim Philby, the traitor who gleefully consigned to death any number of British patriots. Eventually Philby wrote his memoirs, and the reviewer for the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> was Lord Birkenhead, gone to the House of Lords after a legendary record as a trial lawyer. Birkenhead wrote: ``We shall never know how many agents were killed or tortured as a result of Philby's work as a double agent. He is now safe in Russia, and we must, alas, abandon any wistful dream of seeing this little carrion gibbeted.'' Well, Ames isn't in Russia, but we don't hang our traitors.
<P>
Nor, the authors of the Ames books advise us, do we do very much about those who made possible the extravagant treason of Ames. The question seriously arises whether the Agency itself can be rescued. 
<P>
The view is widely held that James Jesus Angleton was the dominant figure in the collapse of CIA security. This is ironic, because Angleton is associated with the sternest of views on security. He was an intellectual, a poet, a gourmet, an aesthete, and a very tough hombre. He had been a close friend of Kim Philby, and when he learned that Philby was a traitor, it affected his powers of reasoning. He became so suspicious, he thought almost every approach by a Russian official was a venture in double agentry. He approached me, on one occasion, requesting support for the publication of a book whose thesis was that the break between Moscow and Peking was a phony, concocted to conceal the ongoing Communist monolith. When he came to my house, the Russian author he desired me to meet, who came in a separate car, was given instructions on an order of exactitude I'd have been embarrassed to write into any of my spy novels. 
<P>
But whatever the causes of disrepair, one hopes that Congress will not go so far as to drop the CIA. Reforms are presumably needed, and were attempted by the Church Committee in 1975, but these were largely miscast, requiring a degree of intimacy between the Executive and the Legislative that is unrealistic.
<P>
But the point is that continued intelligence is critical. Whether Mr. Deutsch,  the new director of the CIA, can get the job done isn't known, though his credentials are good; and it is true that a job worth doing is worth doing even badly.
<P>Thanks to Mr. Ames, it may be another generation before a freedom-loving North Korean, Chinese, Iraqi, Iranian, or Libyan takes the risk of sending secrets for the benefit of the United States. But making the effort to penetrate to the secret designs and resources of such countries would appear to be a strategy more important, even, than an auto-da-fe over our mishandling of the traitor Ames.

31-July-1995



<P>
<LI>A Kansas judge has given permission to exhume the remains of Jesse James. First Zachary Taylor, then John Wilkes Booth, now James. They'll be going for Al Gore next.
<P>
<LI>If good things come to those who wait, the Republican assault on affirmative action will be something to behold. A bill to ban preferences in federal hiring and contracting is said to be forthcoming from Representative Charles Canady (R., Fla.) and, more importantly, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But it was supposed to be forthcoming before -- namely in late June, until Dole abruptly canceled the press conference he had called to announce his bill. Behind some of the GOP skittishness is the idea that large numbers of minority voters are on the verge of joining the GOP (``We are very close to a major breakthrough with black voters,'' one House leadership aide explained to the Washington Times), and that attacking affirmative action will alienate them. Maybe. And maybe not -- polls have always shown large numbers of black Americans opposed to racial quotas. But whatever the politics, abandoning race neutrality as a principle would be too high a price to pay for a breakthrough with anyone. Speaker Newt Gingrich says he understands this and pledged in a recent letter to the New York Times that it is his intention that ``the final [GOP] policy reflect the historic American ideal that personal success and happiness are best achieved through individual liberty and equal justice under the law.'' We're waiting.
<P>
<LI>John Stuart Mill thought that recipients of government benefits shouldn't be allowed to vote -- they're too self-interested. But should they lobby? Legislation proposed by GOP Representatives David McIntosh (Ind.), Ernest Istook (Okla.), and Bob Ehrlich (Md.) would prevent any organization that receives federal funds from spending more than 5 per cent of its non-federal income on political advocacy. Representative Bob Dornan (Calif.) goes further. He would cut off all tax-exempt advocacy groups like the American Association of Retired Persons from federal grants (in FY1994 the AARP got $73 billion in federal support). Meanwhile, neither charitable non-profits nor for-profit corporations could lobby on any matter related to any federal grants or contracts they receive. Both proposals hit the Left where it lives, so they're meeting outraged opposition on Capitol Hill -- with innocuous groups such as the YMCA taking the lead. But something along Dornan/McIntosh lines is essential to short-circuit the self-perpetuating government machine in Washington. The last thing government should be subsidizing is efforts to make it larger.
<P>
<LI>Donors who pony up $100,000 for the Democratic Party will be rewarded with a dinner with President Clinton. Those donating $50,000 also get to eat with the President, but Hillary shows up.
<P>
<LI>William Bennett, in an interview with The New Yorker, discussed his fellow social conservative Pat Buchanan. ``The worst place to stand in a fight is . . . as someone who was on his side but has now deviated by one step. It's a pathology of small differences with him. A real S&M kind of thing.'' Bennett then repeated charges that some of Buchanan's remarks have been ``flirting with'' fascism. ``This Fortress America stuff, this You the People stuff -- I think it's tricky.'' Tricky indeed, if it makes conservatives resort to left-wing arguments when they disagree. If slightly misquoting the Preamble to the Constitution is flirting with fascism, who is preoccupied with small differences? Mr. Bill wants clients who have been very bad.
<P>
<LI>Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, who submits his own versions of any promising Republican legislative initiatives, has come up with a truly Gephardtian ``flat tax.'' It has five tax brackets, just like the present tax code. The brackets are progressive, also like the present code. The rich get soaked, also like . . . But the rates are, like, rounder numbers, or something. The only thing flat about the tax is how it will fall.
<P>
<LI>Until July 10, every cent that everyone in the country earned was taxed away. Government at all levels takes 52 per cent of net national product. Only this week did we start holding on to what we earn. You may wish to keep these details in mind as you follow the debate in Washington, D.C., which is not about taking less, but about whether to slow the rate of taking more.
<P>
<LI>School choice is taking off in Milwaukee. For the last five years, an experimental program involving 800 children (1.5 per cent of the district's students) has distributed to their families vouchers worth $3,209 each, which can be applied to tuition at private non-sectarian schools in the city. Two weeks ago, the Wisconsin legislature approved Governor Thompson's request to expand the program. Allocated funds will increase from $2.4 million to $14.7 million; 7,000 students will be included, with an increase to 15,000 for the 1996 - 97 school year; and parents will be allowed to use the vouchers at religious schools. Naysayers dispute the benefits of the program, and tremble for the future of the public-school system. But consider: the program saves the state money (because private schools are almost all more efficient); parents are involved in the schools and report overwhelming satisfaction; and the quality of education is at least commensurate if not superior. RIP the public-education monopoly; long live public education.
<P><LI>
As the debate over normalizing relations continues, the White House hasn't decided whether it would be better for President Clinton or the Democratic Party to make the first move toward the other.
<P><LI>
John Major won his gamble and is still prime minister, but the balloting showed that at least a third of Tory MPs wished to be rid of him. Startling too, reports our London correspondent, Anthony Lejeune, was the near unanimity with which Conservative newspapers called for a new leader and new policies. The Majorettes now boast that their media foes were discomfited, although whether Gadarene swine should congratulate themselves on having brushed aside herdsmen crying ``Stop!'' seems doubtful. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Major's right-wing critics were excluded while Michael Heseltine, his potential challenger from the Left, was enthroned as deputy prime minister. And on policy Mr. Major has categorically refused to alter course. So the profound ideological split, over Britain's increasing absorption into the European Union and over its tax-and-spend policies, gapes as wide as ever. If the Conservatives had been defeated at the last election, they might now be undergoing a Republican-type revival. If they lose the next one (as, in the light of their present unpopularity, seems probable), something similar may happen. Mr. Major, meanwhile, proposes to fight on the soggy middle ground.
<P><LI>
``Rapid Reaction Force Delayed'' -- headline, British Press Association, July 5.
<P><LI>
Excited crowds gathered around newsstands as the July Fourth holiday approached, all asking the same question: Would the Wall Street Journal editorial page (Robert L. Bartley, proprietor) dare to repeat its call for a constitutional amendment proclaiming ``There Shall Be Open Borders''? This high-water mark of loony libertarianism (apart from anything else, what about disease? welfare eligibility? education costs?) first appeared a few years ago and was repeated several times. It seemed intended as an instant July Fourth tradition. But it was conspicuously absent last year, perhaps because of the obvious imminent rout of immigration enthusiasts in California's Proposition 187 campaign. And the Journal blinked this year too. The disappointed crowds had to be content with an editorial extolling the virtues of skilled immigration. Which, of course, implicitly concedes NR's point that one of the ways in which the current system is fatally flawed is precisely that skilled immigration has been choked off by the misnamed ``family reunification'' provisions of the 1965 Immigration Act. The Journal says a Great Debate on immigration has begun, although the other side is notoriously absent from its pages. Not by Eastern Seaboard windows only, when daylight comes, comes in the light.
<P><LI>
Hugh Grant became the Cary Grant/Fred Astaire of the Nineties by playing charming, diffident men who explicitly included bedding down in their badinage. In real life, he had lived for eight years with a beautiful model, reinforcing his image. Then in real life two vice cops caught him in a car performing a ``lewd act'' with a hooker. Has an illusion left us? That unregulated passion can somehow be confined to charming encounters? The difficulty of so confining it is why Cary and Fred's love interests always maneuvered them toward wedding rings -- not that they would ever have been so crude as to propose doing without them.
<P><LI>
Weighing the messy options, journalistic and ethical, the New York Times began printing the Unabomber's manifesto in 800-word installments, signed ``Frank Rich.''
<P><LI>
Lord Thou Hast Delivered Our Enemies into Our Hands Department: The American Civil Liberties Union recently took out a four-page advertisement in The New Republic. Each page addresses a contentious issue and asserts that the American public agrees with the ACLU that organized school prayer is impolitic, that gays should have special legal recognition, that marijuana use should be legal, and that women should have the right to an abortion. At the bottom of the first three ad pages is the logo ``The American Civil Liberties Union,'' underlined by the phrase ``Live and Let Live,'' picked out in white on a bold black bar. However, on the final page -- the one that defends abortion rights -- the phrase ``Live and Let Live'' is somehow missing. Aborted, you might say.
<P><LI>
Representative Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.) says the attempt in the House to make partial-birth abortions a felony reminds her of the old days when women were persecuted as ``witches.'' It's easy to see why Representative Schroeder took refuge in similes. The partial-birth abortion -- in which a fetus more than five months old is pulled out of its mother feet first up to its neck and then has its brains suctioned out with a catheter to collapse the skull -- is as grotesque as abortion gets. Perhaps the most striking report on the subject was a New York Times article which quoted an abortionist as saying that some mothers find partial-birth abortions comforting because afterward the body can be ``dressed and held'' to allow a chance to ``say goodbye.'' All the debates about the medical nuances of this relatively unusual surgery (does the fetus die painfully during the suction process, or is it killed beforehand?) fade away beside the image of a nurse dressing the tiny, mutilated corpse in baby's clothing and handing it over to the mother for a ``goodbye'' kiss. This picture should bring instant revulsion to any human being whose brain hasn't been sucked out with a straw.

<P>Greatness in Flushing Meadows
<P>JEFFREY HART 
 
 <HR><B>
<P>1939: The Lost World of the Fair, by David Gelernter (Free Press, 418 pp., $23) 
 </B><HR>
 
<P>Mr. Hart is a senior editor at NR. 
 
 
IF YOU frequent large and miscellaneous antique shows, you learn all sorts of things from old memorabilia. 
Some are surprising, such as that Bill McKinley was the most beloved of all American Presidents. Other 
things are not so surprising, such as that the New York World's Fair of 1939 - 40, at Flushing Meadows, 
was probably the most brilliant fair of all time, including the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851. I went 
to it almost every day, and I don't need the memorabilia to tell me how important it was.
<P>Which brings me to 
David Gelernter's book, whose subtitle should be noted: <I>The Lost World of the
Fair</I>. His subject is the lost 
world of the later 1930s as much as it is the Fair itself.
<P>
I cannot do more than begin to suggest here the 
richness of his treatment. In the New York City of 1939 that he paints here the subways and streets were not 
only safe but clean. In that city there were only forty murders per year; just think of that. Executions were 
very prompt. Manners at all levels were more formal than ours. In the middle and upper classes, men wore 
suits and ties. Women never wore shorts. There were rituals about when to touch your hat and when to take 
it off, correct modes of introduction, established rules governing interaction between the sexes. Men
<I>always</I> 
remained standing until the last woman was seated. Gelernter calls this an ``ought'' culture to contrast it with 
our ``want'' culture -- not an altogether satisfactory choice of terms, but pretty good.
<P>
He notices that art, 
technology, and their cousin, design, were allied, and shrewdly sees that this was because people wanted to 
get things done and expected to do so. Engineers were heroes. Among his greatest doers were Robert 
Moses, the master builder; Fiorello LaGuardia, the mayor; and Franklin Roosevelt, the President -- all men 
of authority, a key word here.
<P>
Mr. Gelernter believes that, since the time of the Fair, authority has 
evaporated. He is certainly correct in this, but he offers no theory to explain it. Perhaps it has something to 
do with the circumstances we live in. Could LaGuardia himself have kicked off West 96th Street that 
``homeless'' maniac who terrorized the neighborhood for months? Could LaGuardia have cut through the 
years of fuss and actually put pissoirs on New York's streets? Could Robert Moses, of Jones Beach, the 
Triborough Bridge, countless playgrounds, and magnificent public swimming pools, have rescued Times 
Square or even built a new highway on the West Side?
<P>
Mr. Gelernter is good, but also not entirely 
satisfactory, on the Fair itself. His device for taking us there is a fictitious diary by a bright young woman 
who went to the Fair. This does not quite rise to the subject, nor does Mr. Gelernter's own excellent 
research. He should have looked at the Fair more closely, more continuously and intensely. Yet meaning 
after meaning emerges.
<P>
The hero of the Fair was George Washington, whose large though banal statue 
graced the place: the Father of His Country, the very image of authority. Then you had the Trylon and 
Perisphere, by the great firm of Harrison and Fouilhoux. Let us explicate.
<P>
The Trylon was, by Fair 
regulations, the tallest structure there. No other was allowed to be as tall. Of course you can guess what the 
second tallest structure was: the Soviet pavilion with the Worker atop. He held aloft a huge red star that 
gazed angrily at night toward the Trylon and Perisphere, which were gleaming white but sometimes bathed 
in pastel colors.
<P>
The Soviet pavilion was a depressing and heavy hulk of Stalinist imperial architecture. All 
that I can remember from inside were some folk dancers and a replica station from the Moscow Metro, 
chandeliers and all. You can probably imagine my reaction, even at age 9, to the aesthetics here. Good old 
Ivan -- the Worker -- was a stitch. He had a thick neck and thick wrists, infallible signs of proletarian virtue. 
He seemed disconcertingly stupid. Ah, this was what Stalin was putting up against the Trylon and 
Perisphere? At 9, I became an anti-Communist at a glance.
<P>
An adult, meanwhile, would have seen that the 
Trylon and Perisphere were not casually conceived some lazy afternoon down at Harrison and Fouilhoux. 
He would have seen that they were a climax of High Modernism, perhaps its greatest architectural 
achievement. In their geometric character, they represented pure Mind. Henri Matisse had held that all 
spatial forms could be resolved into triangles, spheres, and cubes: the beginning of Cubism. The Eiffel 
Tower had famously insulted the low mansard roofs of Paris. Architects connected with European 
formalism had experimented with huge spires as images of aspiration, and one had even been submitted in a 
design for Coney Island. Wallace Harrison and Andre Fouilhoux (Wally and Andy to their architect friends) 
knew all this and figured out how to bring it to a brilliant result.
<P>
What did the two gigantic monuments 
mean? George Washington, the Father of His Country, had his Egyptian obelisk, a symbol of maleness, in 
Washington, D.C. This had to be retained, but also transformed. The four-sided obelisk became the three-
sided Trylon. (Ezra Pound: ``Make it new.'') Meanwhile, just as the Trylon was a representation of 
masculinity, the globular Perisphere was pregnant with The World of Tomorrow, a giant model inside 
named ``Democracity.'' Between the Soviet pavilion on the one hand, and the Trylon and Perisphere on the 
other, the Fair symbolized the greatest conflict of our age, and suggested its resolution.
<P>
Much of what this 
model, and the rest of the Fair, foresaw came to pass. That poor Soviet Worker, with his thick wrists and 
thick skull, did not stand a chance against the energy and creativity of the West, represented by Harrison 
and Fouilhoux. Neither, ultimately, did the regime that shipped him here in crates. If the poor clod could 
have escaped from his Stalinist perch, I like to think he would have headed for the Parachute Jump, the 
Aquacade, and the Voyage to Mars, picking up a Zombie (a drink that was ``one to a customer'') on the 
way.
<P>
The Fair was consciously designed to represent optimism and brains at home to the cruel new utopias 
so menacing abroad. Maybe that is why we cared about it so much. The good news is that the Fair -- 
brilliance, energy, speed, electronics, intelligence -- won.

The 101st Senator<BR>
Rich Lowry<BR>
<P>

Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter.
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>SHEILA Burke stands at a phone in her spacious Capitol office, looking down as she listens to an 
unhappy senator on the other end. The senator went home last night not realizing floor votes are scheduled 
today, and wants to know why he wasn't informed. Mrs. Burke apologizes, then explains that a notice went 
to every office last night outlining today's schedule. When she sits back down for an interview, she's still 
shaking her head. ``Told him there would be votes. He left. Now he's mad there's votes,'' she sighs. ``The 
freshmen are just . . . an interesting crowd.''
<P>
Bob Dole's chief of staff can afford some exasperation over the mistakes of first-year Senators -- not only 
has she been here longer, she's probably more powerful. The shortish 44-year-old mother of three, who 
typically wears a dour expression -- as if one of the kids had just tracked mud on the living-room carpet -- is 
often called the ``101st senator,'' in recognition of the latitude given her in running the day-to-day 
operations of the Senate. Conservatives often call her other, less flattering names, ranging from ``liberal 
Democrat'' to the ``woman who runs Bob Dole.''
<P>``The one consistent theme over every major battle that conservatives lost,'' says a former Senate 
staffer, ``was a knife in the back from Bob Dole, frequently at the behest of Sheila.'' A Traditional Values 
Coalition press release recently proclaimed, ``If the American people like Hillary Clinton, they will love 
Sheila Burke,'' an over-the-top piece of rhetoric that nonetheless captures her place in the pantheon of 
conservative villains. As the Dole campaign continues to roll, neutralizing serious opposition on the Right, 
Mrs. Burke stands as a personification of all the old conservative doubts about the convictions and the 
<I>modus operandi</I> of her boss. 
<P>Sheila Burke, a nurse by training, joined Dole in the mid 1970s. At the time, she was a Democrat with, 
as she told <I>U.S. News & World Report</I> last year, ``a bias on the liberal side.'' Her resume included time 
protesting the conservative reign of S. I. Hayakawa as president of San Francisco State and involvement in 
``Nurses for Moynihan.'' No matter. Dole, she says, ``was looking for somebody to do health policy who 
had experience as a provider.'' When in 1985 he was elected majority leader, Mrs. Burke left the Senate 
Finance Committee, where she handled health care, to become his deputy chief of staff. In 1986 she moved 
into the top slot. 
<P>Mrs. Burke's politics had shifted rightward -- ``a maturation on my part,'' she says -- but retained an 
accommodationist/liberal tinge in keeping with her Senate background. The Finance Committee, which 
spends half the federal budget and raises almost all of it, is in the minds of its members a domain too 
important for partisanship. ``She is the Finance Committee,'' one Senate aide says. ``In the Finance 
Committee, people who come to the table with strongly ideological agendas, whether liberal or 
conservative, are marginalized. I think her temperament and approach to issues comport very well with the 
way the committee does business.''
<P>And with the way the Senate does business. Sheila Burke is part of what one aide calls an ``Old Boys 
Network'' of staff loyal to the traditional non-confrontational ways of the Senate (the staff director of the 
Budget Committee was recently described by <I>National Journal</I> as ``deeply perplexed by what he viewed as 
a right-wing takeover of the House''). For Mrs. Burke, the most important boys in this network have been 
women, including Finance Committee staff director Lindy Paull and, until she left to be Rhode Island's 
Director of Human Services, John Chafee aide Christine Ferguson. It's a vaguely feminist, non-ideological 
environment.
<P>All of which has made Sheila Burke, whose intelligence and competence are not in question, a 
lightening rod for conservative suspicions. Whenever Dole strays, Sheila Burke gets fingered. Supporters 
contend this is unfair. ``Dole is his own person,'' says conservative activist Don Devine. Former Finance 
Committee staff director Bob Lighthizer insists, ``Nobody who succeeds working for Senator Dole elevates 
their own agenda above his. He just doesn't tolerate it.'' But Dole tends to have a hands-off management 
style; ``work it out'' can constitute a marching order. It's within this latitude of broad instructions and the 
detailed staff work surrounding any issue that Mrs. Burke has her influence.
<P>CONSERVATIVE critics point to her role in the health-care reform fight of 1993 - 94 as the prototype. 
She maintains close ties to a nursing community not prone to right-wing views, sometimes teaching courses 
at nursing schools. ``The people she sees socially tend to have a corporatist liberal point of view,'' says one 
observer. That background has made itself felt in a variety of ways, from Sheila Burke's personally twisting 
senators' arms to get them to agree to sell a valuable piece of federal land to the Columbia Hospital for 
Women in Washington, D.C., to her interest in becoming head of the Health Care Financing Administration 
(HCFA) in the Bush Administration.
<P>At first blush an odd career move, the HCFA job might have represented a fulfillment of Sheila Burke's 
ambitions (she couldn't take it because her husband's work with Aetna represented a potential conflict). The 
agency runs Medicare and Medicaid; ``it controls American health care,'' explains one staffer.
A chance to do the same by different means came in the health-care fight. Mrs. Burke's friends fashioned 
the Chafee proposal, a pre-emptive surrender to the Clinton plan that would, among other things, have 
required insurers to offer a set of government-defined benefits. At first called Dole -  Chafee, the legislation 
represented the initial instincts of Dole and the policy convictions of his chief of staff. ``Sheila was very 
comfortable with the Chafee bill,'' says one GOP aide.
<P>AS THE health debate moved right, conservatives worried that Mrs. Burke was pulling the other way. 
She achieved unusual visibility for a staffer. On <I>Meet The Press</I> in the fall of 1993 Senator Pat Moynihan 
proclaimed, ``Sheila Burke . . . said this is an important moment. . . . We agree that government now has to 
intervene.'' Come February 1994 Hillary Clinton was hawking the same line: ``Senator Dole told me, 'If you 
and Sheila can agree, I'll vote for the plan.''' Mrs. Burke seemed to be itching to cut the deal. ``If you didn't 
want to take care of this stuff, these [health-care] issues were of such a technical nature that it was a 
discussion you could easily beg off,'' says a former Democratic staffer. ``[But] she was interested in sitting 
down with the other side and getting into all the details.''
<P>When Dole finally decided to sink any version of government-run health-care -- after getting pounded 
privately by conservative colleagues -- Mrs. Burke did dutifully assemble the operation to do it. ``I've never 
seen in my six years up here anything that approached it for sophistication, level of organization, and 
effectiveness,'' says Doug Badger of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. By the end of the process, it 
was the moderates who were complaining. Says former Chafee aide Christine Ferguson: ``I feel like she 
abandoned the ship.'' The overall trajectory of the health-care fight followed a familiar pattern: first (at the 
point when an issue is most likely to be shaped by his staff) Dole gets on the wrong side, then he rights 
himself (when other, outside influences have been brought to bear).
<P>The latest complaint about Sheila Burke comes on welfare. Conservative staff contend she has worked 
in staff-level meetings to limit welfare reform and keep the bill free of language condemning illegitimacy, 
even an innocuous statement like ``marriage is the foundation of a successful society.'' Mrs. Burke says she 
just tried to broker an issue on which the Republican conference is bitterly divided (so-called ``clean'' block 
grants v. those with some illegitimacy strings). But, as on health care, being a good soldier will mean 
crossing her instincts: the ineffective reforms of 1988, which must be scrapped to make way for any 
meaningful change this year, would not have happened without her.
<P>The welfare controversy is typical, based on impossible-to-discern intentions and a pervasive distrust. 
``It's the sense you get of the meeting before the meeting,'' says one aide, ``that her more liberal friends are 
there when you arrive -- and still there when you leave.'' Stories of her betrayals in the Senate cloakroom are 
as rife as they are difficult to confirm. Eyewitnesses recall seeing her pow-wow in late 1992 with Nancy 
Johnson (Conn.) and Fred Upton (Mich.), as the two House moderates made a last minute push for a fetal-
tissue research bill. A similar allegation -- in writing, in an unsigned memo -- had her helping cloakroom 
staff find the votes to shut down a Jesse Helms filibuster last year. ``An absolute falsehood,'' she says. ``I 
wasn't there.'' 
<P>The strained relations with the Right may have contributed to Mrs. Burke's brief move this year to the 
position of Secretary of the Senate, a powerful institutional job, but one removed from Dole's political shop. 
The Dole campaign, went the speculation, was trying to ease her out. But Mrs. Burke kept her chief-of-staff 
job, and by June had moved back to it full-time. Her 18 years of loyal service no doubt stood her in good 
stead, as on a deeper level did her sympathy with Dole. She represents a part of him, if the ``bad'' part: the 
tough-as-nails demeanor, when the ``New Dole'' is supposed to be kinder and gentler, the pragmatic 
operator, when Dole is supposed to be an avatar of conservative principle.
<P>In recent months, Mrs. Burke has presided over an office churning out a steady diet of conservative 
results, most recently beating cloture on the Henry Foster nomination for Surgeon General. But she is 
clearly acting from the head rather than the heart. Asked whether she understands the nation's new political 
currents, Mrs. Burke says. ``There are a lot of things people accuse me of, but being stupid isn't one of 
them.'' The same can be said of her boss, which at least partly explains his compelling rhetoric of late. But 
after the campaign speeches are a distant echo, Sheila Burke (the next White House chief of staff?) will still 
be around. So will the side of Bob Dole that makes her such a good fit.

<H2>LEGALIZING DRUGS: JUST SAY YES</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Legalizing drugs may be the way to help
addicts, and win the drug war. 
<P>
AN INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL S. GAZZANIGA
<P>
Dr. Gazzaniga is Director for the Center of Neuroscience at U.C. Davis.
<P>
NATIONAL REVIEW: Professor Gazzaniga, thank you for talking with us again [cf. 
``The Federal
Drugstore,'' <P>NR, Feb. 5, 1990]. We would like to examine the possible consequences 
of legalizing drugs
in America. However, before we take up this controversial issue, perhaps you 
can sketch a quick picture
of drug use today?

<P>DR. MICHAEL S. GAZZANIGA: The current figures suggest that about 10 per cent 
of Americans use
illegal drugs. Of course, the vast majority of these users -- perhaps as many 
as 90 per cent -- are not
addicted to drugs and use them only infrequently. There is also a strong correlation 
between age and drug
use. In surveys, 13 per cent of 18- to 25-year-olds claim to have used drugs 
in the past thirty days, while
a meager 4 per cent of people over age 26 say they have done so. So, while 
a substantial number of people
have experimented with drugs in one way or another, very few become addicted.
<P><BR><B><P>NR</B>: Are there any studies that help to explain why people take drugs -- and 
why they don't?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Human psychology is very complex; obviously, many factors go into the decision. 

Not
surprisingly, the dominant factor seems to be simply the short-term pleasure 
of the drug experience. In
other words, drugs make people feel good. This simple fact is what causes people 
to take these
substances, sometimes at great medical and social risk. The long-term consequences 
are just not present
in their minds at the moment of arousal.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Nevertheless, the fear of being caught -- and the consequences of being 
caught, like fines,
confiscation, and jail terms -- must deter drug use to a certain extent?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Again, human psychology is more complex than a basic analysis of reward 
and punishment. There
is a large project, near completion, at the Rand Corporation, that is producing 
a lot of information and
analysis, including a cross-national analysis of drug policies and outcomes 
and a historical analysis of
pharmaceutical records from the period when cocaine was legal in the United 
States.
Many of these studies challenge the empirical basis for using deterrence as 
a means of controlling drug
use. For example, the Scandinavians imposed a severe penalty for having blood-alcohol 
levels above
.08 per cent, regardless of a driver's behavior or demeanor. There was a transitory 
drop in road fatalities
but then a return to baseline levels. This pattern is seen over and over again 
when severe penalties are
imposed.
In studies that zoom in on individual people's actual beliefs, we also find 
that the severity of penalties
plays little or no role in controlling whether or not people prone to using 
drugs actually use them. This
disregard for the law is truly remarkable since the cumulative risk of getting 
caught over an extended
career of drug use is fairly high.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So, you are saying that potential drug users are not all that sensitive 
to the threat of legal sanctions?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. Dozens of studies say exactly that.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: In that case, are there any other forces that control -- and could therefore 
be manipulated by society
to control -- the decision to use drugs.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: There are several other forces at work here. One is the perceived health 
risk. If people believe that
drugs are physically harmful to them, they are more likely to resist taking 
drugs. Other forces, such as a
person's perception of the morality of the act, and perceptions of the morality 
of the law, also have an
effect, as do stigmatization from being caught, shame, and other dimensions 
of humiliation. There are
also informal social norms. Professor Robert MacCoun of UC Berkeley, whose 
study was part of the
Rand project, makes a strong case for the importance of these factors. However, 
on the other side of the
coin there is the forbidden-fruit effect, a process that may attract people 
to drug use. As I said, human
psychology is extremely complex.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: You've considered drug use in terms of the individual user. Could you tell 
us a bit more about what
drug use looks like from society's perspective? For example, what does drug 
use ``cost'' society?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: In terms of direct financial cost -- money spent on drugs that could have 
been spent more
productively -- according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] 
approximately $41
billion was spent in 1990, down from $54 billion in 1988. However, those numbers 
are probably highballs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Why is that?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Drug expenditures aren't tallied accurately like your hotel mini-bar charges. 
There's a lot of very
iffy guesswork. ONDCP tries its best by using two different methods. The ``consumption'' 
method
involves multiplying estimates of the number of drug users by estimates of 
the average amount of drugs
used. As you can imagine, neither can be measured very accurately. So they 
try to verify these estimates
by what they call the ``supply'' method, which estimates the amount of base 
crop raised in producer
countries, reduced by the amounts lost, the amounts seized or consumed in other 
countries, and the
amounts seized in our country. The remaining amount is then assessed for value 
by considering current
street prices. So the supply estimate is only as accurate as the six other 
estimates it is calculated from,
and as ONDCP acknowledges, there are even more uncertainties because much of 
drug value is bartered
for sex or for other drugs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So it's possible that the drug market may not be as large as it is commonly 
represented?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. It is likely, in fact. In 1992, Americans spent approximately $44 
billion on alcohol and $37
billion on tobacco. The number of Americans using these drugs is vast compared 
to those using illegal
drugs. Furthermore, alcohol and tobacco are not only available everywhere, 
but are actively promoted.
Taken together, it is hard to imagine that the illegal drug trade produces 
an income nearly equal to that of
alcohol or tobacco.
The overall pattern of data collected by government agencies is also at odds 
with other common
impressions. For example, how much of the drug business is centered on high-school 
and college
students?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Well, you're the one with the data. We'll guess at least half?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: According to ONDCP, only $2 billion of the $41 billion spent in 1990 was 
spent by high-school and
college students. That is less than 5 per cent of the drug market, if their 
figures are correct. So, students
are not the primary drug consumers.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Even if we can't pin down an exact number, it is clear that a substantial 
amount of money is wasted
by drug users on purchasing drugs. On the flip side of the coin, how much of 
society's resources are being
utilized in the war on drugs?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: The cost of the drug war is staggering at every level of government -- 
local, state, federal. For
example, federal grants to state and local drug-enforcement programs are now 
nearly a billion dollars a
year. Federal efforts on international drug control cost more than $800 million 
annually. Federal efforts
on drug interdiction are now at least $2.2 billion a year. The total federal 
drug control budget is in excess
of $12.5 billion a year, according to the 1992 Bureau of Justice Statistics 
Sourcebook. And these
numbers do not take into account the huge amount of money spent by state and 
local governments out of
their own tax sources.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: What about non-financial costs? Certainly the criminal-justice system must 
be heavily burdened
by the war?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: No question. In 1989, 1,247,000 people were arrested for drug-related offenses. 
Two-thirds of
those arrests were for possession only, and most of those were for marijuana. 
As for incarceration, in
1990 there were 930,000 inmates across America in federal, state, and local 
prisons. Of these, 50,000
were in federal institutions, and of these, half were in prison for drug offenses. 
Of the 684,000 prisoners
in state prisons, no less than 22 per cent were being held for drug offenses. 
The courts and jails and
prisons are just jammed with drug offenders.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: We've eased toward the issue of legalization, and now we'll ask you straight 
out. Why not legalize
drugs?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Adversaries of drug legalization or decriminalization feel that relaxing 
drug laws will lead to
increased consumption. They submit that the increase in consumption in turn 
will produce an
unacceptable burden on society. This single point, for example, is the basis 
for James Q. Wilson's
anti-legalization position. However, there are several reasons to think this 
concern is misplaced.
Studies on the decriminalization of marijuana suggest that it leads to no significant 
increase in
consumption. Now, these studies have been contested because decriminalization 
occurred at a time
when overall drug use was declining for many other reasons. However, recent 
re-evaluations of
Prohibition data are consistent with the value of drug legalization.
Furthermore, current surveys indicate that among non-users, only 1.7 per cent 
thought that, if drugs
were legal, they would become users. Addicts did say they might use more. But 
controlled users thought
their own use would be unaffected.
These answers make sense, if you think about it. As I mentioned before, the 
legality of drug use is only
one among many factors that a person considers when deciding whether or not 
to use drugs. At least as
important are considerations such as risks to health, costs in terms of lifestyle, 
the morality of the act.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: But wouldn't lots of people ``try it out'' if it were legalized?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: It's possible that there would be a minor bulge in drug use immediately 
after legalization -- again,
the forbidden-fruit phenomenon. But think about it. Suppose heroin were legalized 
tomorrow and
available everywhere. Would you suddenly become an addict, or even a user? 
Probably not. Well, why
not? Because you would decide that the pleasure does not outweigh the risks.
As for current addicts, if they did use a little more, that would not necessarily 
increase their inability to
function, or further impair society's efforts to deal with them. Addicts already 
cause harm to themselves
and present a danger to others. But there is a limit to the amount of harm 
they can inflict on themselves
and to the degree of risk they can present to society. Is a bum on the street 
much worse off if he drinks four
bottles of Jack Daniels a day instead of only three? Is society much worse 
off?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Then the question, perhaps, is, Would there be more addicts if drugs were 
legalized?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: If non-users are unlikely to begin using drugs, as we've discussed, new 
addicts would have to come
from the ranks of controlled users. As I said, controlled users believe their 
drug use would be unaffected
by legalization. Is this a credible belief? Absolutely. Because drugs are already 
widely available,
controlled users could use more right now if they wanted to. They choose not 
to use more because they
have determined how much they can take and still function. In other words, 
they regulate their own
behavior. And for that reason, they would be no more likely to become addicts 
post-legalization than
they are right now.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: This may be a naive question, but are drugs really that widely available?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: National Institutes of Health studies show that perceived availability 
has remained consistently
high for marijuana since 1975. As it has for cocaine. Furthermore, from 1988 
to 1992 drug availability,
by and large, increased -- despite the war on drugs. There was a 2.5-metric-ton 
increase in marijuana,
with a peak in 1989 - 90. Cocaine, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration 
as of 1993,
``remained readily available in virtually all major U.S. metropolitan areas.'' 
Heroin is available, and its
purity has increased. There are some regional variations in this pattern, but 
overall, drugs are
everywhere.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So legalization would not affect availability. However, the street price 
of drugs is artificially
inflated because drugs are contraband. If the price of drugs dropped precipitously 
-- as presumably it
would if they were legalized -- could this lead to increased consumption? Perhaps 
controlled users are
controlled partly by the high price of drugs.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Lower prices might mean increased use, but the data on this point are mixed, 
and there is some
indication that drug users are insensitive to price. That is, that they use 
similar amounts regardless of the
price of drugs. And again, consider alcohol. It is widely available and inexpensive, 
but not everyone is a
drunkard. In fact, attitudes have changed markedly as far as drunkenness is 
concerned. In the decades
after Prohibition was repealed, drinking hard liquor was a way of showing how 
sophisticated you were,
how you were more urbane than the rubes in the Women's Christian Temperance 
Union. Think of the
image of cocktail parties, of the Thin Man movies in which much of the humor 
revolved around getting
drunk, of Dean Martin's shtik. Nowadays public drinking of hard liquor to the 
point of slurring and
dizziness is just tacky. Square, corny old Johnny Carson had a running joke 
where he affectionately
teased Ed McMahon for his excessive drinking. Cool, hip Letterman and Leno 
wouldn't be caught dead
doing it. These pushes and pulls to alcohol use have nothing to do with jail 
or availability or price and
everything to do with social mores. There's no reason to think that the psychology 
of drug use is any
simpler.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So is the ``bulge'' you mentioned earlier something like the post-Prohibition 
bingeing you just
described?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. But there is an important difference. Just after Prohibition was enacted, 
the drinking rate fell
off sharply. However, throughout the Twenties the drinking rate rose, despite 
Prohibition, and it was on
the rise when Prohibition was repealed. By contrast, drug use is down in every 
age group and across all
sectors of society, and it is continuing to fall. Just as an example, in 1973, 
37 per cent of 18- to
25-year-olds said they had used drugs in the previous month. In 1992, only 
13 per cent said they had.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: That would seem to prove the point of the prohibitionists: it's the war 
on drugs that has caused drug
use to go down.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: No. The drug war targets three specific factors that affect the drug-use 
rate, namely the availability
of drugs, the perceived risk of arrest or legal sanction, and the perceived 
risk to personal health. As far as
drug availability is concerned, the drug war has been a total failure. Drugs 
are as widely available now as
they ever have been. The risk of arrest has certainly increased -- since 1985 
drug arrests have gone up
from 718,000 to 1,247,000 a year. Remember, though, studies indicate that the 
perceived risk of arrest is
often ignored by drug users. Finally, health-education programs are widely 
promoting the belief that
drugs are bad for bodily and mental health.
So, the war on drugs may be having an effect. But it is important to understand 
that that effect is created
through several approaches. I don't know if the risk of arrest reduces drug 
use more than education does
-- or even if it reduces drug use at all. However -- and this is an important 
point -- if drugs were
legalized, health-education programs would continue to disseminate information. 
And they might then
have the resources that now go wastefully toward trying to decrease availability, 
and toward arresting
people. If we could have the same level of drug use through simple education 
programs, wouldn't we as a
society prefer that to incarcerating millions of our citizens?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Isn't there also a financial dimension? Education might be far less expensive 
than our current full
mobilization of the judicial system, would you agree?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: I have seen only one attempt at estimating the potential costs and savings 
that would accrue to
society from legalization. In a recent book, Prohibition's Second Failure, 
Theodore R. Vallance, former
chief of the Planning Branch at the National Institutes of Mental Health, laid 
out a proposal based on his
experience and research. His main professional effort for many years was to 
come up with estimates and
plans concerning America's drug problem.
Vallance's analysis builds on several sources. First he used the 250-page report 
prepared for the NIH by
Dorothy Rice and her colleagues at the University of California. Dr. Rice compared 
the direct and
indirect costs of alcohol and drug abuse as well as of mental illness. Direct 
costs refer to actual program
expenditures such as those by health professionals, the police, the courts, 
and the prison system. Indirect
costs refer to such things as premature mortalities and morbidities due to 
substance abuse. These reflect
real losses in terms of productivity and participation in normal society. Not 
surprisingly, alcohol costs
society more than illegal drugs: in 1985, $70 billion versus $44 billion. For 
alcohol, most of the cost was
for treatment and estimated damage to personal health. For drugs, most of the 
cost was for law
enforcement and losses sustained by crime victims.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Could you break those numbers down a little?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. Let me just review the drug-abuse numbers. Again in 1985, the year 
that was analyzed in such
detail, $13.5 billion was spent directly on the criminal-justice system -- 
police, legal adjudication, state
and federal corrections, local corrections, private legal defense, and so on. 
There was another $19 billion
in the indirect-costs category: around $1 billion for victims of crime, $4.4 
billion in loss of productivity
for those incarcerated, and $14 billion in loss of productivity for those in 
crime careers. Throw in around
$10 billion for the costs of treatment, and you have the 1985 estimate of $44 
billion. The figures for
direct costs are surely much higher today. For example, totally new moneys 
in the amount of $6 billion
were added by the Bush Administration for new task forces, prisons, interdiction 
programs, and many,
many other projects. A realistic current figure would be around $100 billion 
a year.
Vallance does not, however, simply summarize the past. He uses the Rice data, 
combines it with 1993
data on extra expenditures for enforcement, and comes up with the startling 
conclusion that legalizing
drugs could save society approximately $37 billion a year! In fact, I am sure 
his estimate is low, given the
documented increase in the direct costs already discussed. (See table.)
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So the Vallance estimate is about $37 billion, and you say that it is probably 
low. How did he
estimate how much of the saving should be reinvested in treatment? And how 
do you measure other
dimensions of the problem like reduced suffering that might occur under a legalization 
scheme?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: He was making best guesses based on his experience, which he writes about 
with great verve. For
years he had been pushing alternative plans within the government, only to 
be scolded by his superiors
for attempting to question other government agencies' capacity to deal with 
the drug problem. But he
emphasizes that the details could all vary a bit, but the overall pattern of 
the savings would remain the
same.
It is another matter to find a metric for human suffering. Surely a legalization 
scheme ought to find
people less fearful of criminal activity in their neighborhoods. Parents should 
feel better knowing the
police could concentrate on those criminal forces that would continue to peddle 
drugs to children.
Addicts ought to feel better knowing that society is dealing with their problem 
from a health point of
view, and surely there would have to be more programs to assist those who abuse 
drugs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Thank you for your time, Professor Gazzaniga.

McNamara's Brand 
 <P>
Mr. Ferguson is a senior editor of The Weekly Standard. 
 <P>
 
I'M a little bit worried. As I write this, in early June, it's been a 
full month since I've read a nationally published article trashing 
Robert McNamara. All spring, immediately preceding the publication of 
McNamara's memoirs and then for a luscious period thereafter, you 
couldn't pick up a magazine or a reputable newspaper without exposing 
yourself to a shower of bile, all of it directed at our diminutive and 
bespectacled former secretary of defense. NR and The American 
Spectator pitched in, of course, but so did the New York Times and the 
Boston Globe, and Time and Newsweek, and The New Yorker and The New 
Republic -- even The Nation! For a while there, many of us McNamara-
despisers thought we'd died and gone to heaven (a fate, incidentally, 
that McNamara himself is unlikely to enjoy).
<P>
And then -- silence. What gives? Apparently the scribes have moved on; 
never has the press's short attention span been so criminally obvious. 
I feel like a guy at a college beer bust who senses the buzz just 
starting to kick in and wants to part-ay down, only to discover that 
everybody has gone off to the library to cram for a chem final. But 
for all that, I am an optimist; I am one of those who believe the keg 
is half full rather than half empty. And speaking only for myself, I'm 
ready for another draft.
<P>
My interest in McNamara is intensified because he exemplifies a 
peculiar Washington phenomenon. In Washington people fail up. The city 
is exempt from the laws of professional gravity. No other city is so 
accommodating of failure, so friendly to the people who fail. Large 
awards await the bunglers and bobblers, the has-beens and wannabees-
who-never-could. Our present mayor, to cite an obvious example, 
destroyed the city's finances, smoked crack on TV, went to prison -- 
and then got re-elected. Other failures have shown greater artfulness. 
You can see them cruising K Street in chauffeured Town Cars, cashing 
large checks for their "consulting" businesses, digging into filets at 
the Palm. Here's the Iran - Contra bungler, awarded a popular radio 
show for his work destroying the Reagan Administration. Over there is 
the manager of the 1992 Bush campaign, mulling offers from candidates 
to work his magic again in 1996. And over here is the chief strategist 
for Jimmy Carter during the Iranian hostage crisis -- why, he's the 
secretary of state!
<P>
McNamara is spiritual father to them all. He is the architect of a 
career breathtaking in the scope of its screw-ups, a clockwork 
progression of failure and reward, error and advancement. Imagine a 
friend who comes to visit. The first night he cooks you dinner and 
sets fire to the kitchen. The next morning he accidentally 
electrocutes the cat. He blows his nose in the curtains and never 
flushes the toilet. He borrows your car and drives through the garage 
door, then spreads a rare contagion to your kids. By the third day you 
make the decision: You ask him to move in with you.
<P>
This is the pattern of McNamara's career. At Ford Motors, in the late 
1950s, he designed the sclerotic top-down management system that 
almost sank the American automobile industry; for good measure, he 
oversaw the production of the Edsel. Accordingly, JFK handed him the 
Pentagon. There McNamara got the idea for the Vietnam War -- the Edsel 
of American foreign policy. So awed was the Washington establishment 
that it placed him at the head of the World Bank, in hopes that he 
might do for the international economy what he had done for the 
American military. And he did! Within ten years he had doubled the 
amount of money loaned, and lost, to Third World kleptocracies like 
Brazil and the Central African Empire. He was Midas in reverse. 
Wherever he draped his hand, industries wilted, economies collapsed, 
corpses piled up.
<P>
NO one should have been surprised, then, that when McNamara chose to 
write the story of his life, it should have turned out to be a 
disaster by every literary measure: mendacious, sentimental, shameless 
in its exculpation, oily in its tone, a book so badly written that no 
one would ever really want to buy it. And of course it has been a 
rousing bestseller. 
<P>
How does one explain a life thus charmed? His good looks? They may 
indeed have dazzled back in the days when no one minded goofy wire 
rims and the stink of Brylcreem. His sensitivity? It's true he cried 
often, and still does -- the one time I met him, at a think-tank 
luncheon, he teared up over the Cuban Missile Crisis -- and in the pre 
- Alan Alda Sixties a man's capacity to cry could still disarm unwary 
companions. But none of this is sufficient. Washington's inverted 
culture, where failure propels a man ever upward, bespeaks a kind of 
masochism. Of course, the actual  pain is dispersed to the country at 
large. But for the professional failure Washington remains safe 
harbor. Within weeks of the publication of the book, McNamara had been 
called "evil," a "liar," and a "hypocrite." Out in the heartland, a 
few Vietnam vets even sued him. Here in Washington Katharine Graham 
threw him a book party. Everybody who's anybody was there.

<P>

<UL>

<LI> 
NR is delighted to announce the appointment of Kate Walsh O'Beirne as 
our Washington editor. Mrs. O'Beirne, who is vice president for 
government relations at the Heritage Foundation, first came to

<LI>Welfare reform is getting typical Contract-with-America treatment in 
the Senate, i.e., GOP disarray followed by distressingly weakened 
legislation. Majority Leader Bob Dole and Finance Committee Chairman 
Bob Packwood both hoped to rush through a reform bill, Dole to win 
another feather for his presidential cap, Packwood to avoid a conflict 
with his end-of-June ethics hearings. But little had been done to 
ensure GOP unity, and now Senate Republicans are paying the price. The 
bill Packwood reported out of his committee -- weak on work 
requirements, silent on illegitimacy -- is unacceptable to 
conservatives like Lauch Faircloth (N.C.). And Packwood and Dole staff 
have rebuffed attempts to make the bill any more palatable to the 
Right -- even language merely declaring illegitimacy harmful to 
society was kept out of the bill. Faircloth and Phil Gramm were 
pointedly left off a task force formed to hammer out the welfare 
differences. This could herald a bloody intra-Republican battle -- 
with Phil Gramm carrying the conservative banner against the inside-
Washington maneuverings of, among others, prominent Dole staffers. Is 
the Dole campaign paying attention? 
<P> 
<LI>Beware the conciliatory Newt. At the outset of their New Hampshire 
shmooze-fest President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich shook hands on 
creating a bipartisan commission to recommend campaign finance and 
lobbying reforms. It was great feel-good theatrics, but awful policy. 
In the case of military-base closings, a bipartisan commission was 
just the trick, hammering out the unsavory details of a consensus 
goal. When it comes to campaign finance there's no consensus about 
anything, and the only meaningful role of a commission would be to 
create momentum for ill-conceived proposals, with public financing 
(a/k/a the politician's entitlement) topping the list. In case you 
doubt it: former Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer is gung-ho 
about the commission idea. Gingrich proved in New Hampshire that he 
knows moose when he sees them. If only we could say the same about 
bull.

<LI>Eagle-eyed Republican number-crunchers to the rescue! The President's

<P> 
<LI>The House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee recently heard 
five Federal Communications Commission officials explain why their 
bailiwick needed more funding at a time when other federal agencies 
are contemplating deep cuts. Why? The telecommunications legislation 
working its way through Congress creates so many new functions for the 
FCC that there's no way it can cope, given its current resources. The 
legislation crafted by the Senate Commerce Committee under Larry 
Pressler (S.D.) started out fairly deregulatory but got steadily less 
so under the pressure of fat-cat lobbyists and bipartisanship. By the 
time it hit the Senate floor, Bob Packwood (Ore.) and John McCain 
(Ariz.) -- the conscience of the Senate on telecom deregulation -- 
felt compelled to vote against it. The bill proposed in the House 
isn't much better. Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (Tex.) has been 
telling high-tech free-marketeers not to worry, reforms not made in 
the telecom bill can be taken care of in the course of re-authorizing 
the FCC. But the FCC bill Fields has just unveiled -- co-sponsored 
with liberal Democrat Ed Markey (Mass.) -- leaves FCC funding at 
current levels. Unless Newt Gingrich intervenes, the 104th Congress 
will blow an opportunity to unfetter a cutting-edge American industry 
by abolishing the FCC, privatizing the spectrum, and moving away from 
"universal service" requirements for phone service. What would the 
Tofflers say?n Gingrich will make his pitch to kids when he appears on 
an upcoming segment of MTV's Raw. Gingrich follows in the footsteps of 
Bill Clinton, whose performance on the rock 'n' roll network was a 
story second only to Michael Jackson's wedding. So, Mr. Speaker, 
boxers or briefs? 
<P> 
<LI>Ramon Cortines, the chancellor of the New York City School System, has 
resigned, and the liberal intelligentsia is in mourning. Felix Rohatyn 
called it "the saddest day in the twenty years I've been working with 
the city." But what were Cortines's achievements? Unlike his 
predecessor, Joseph Fernandez, he made some tentative but real cuts in 
an education bureaucracy larger than that of France. He reformed the 
practice of "social promotions" -- promoting sub-literate kids so they 
don't feel so bad about themselves. He gave parents the chance to take 
their children out of the program that would give them free condoms. 
But did Cortines gain from the powerful teachers' unions the right to 
dismiss incompetent teachers? Did he clean up the corrupt local school 
boards? Did he bring any discipline into a school system in which one 
teacher a day is hospitalized because of a student attack? Did he do 
anything to reduce the system's cost per pupil -- which remains 
several times that of demonstrably superior parochial schools in the 
city and of public schools in every other nation. Cortines is a decent 
man. The fact that his legacy was so meager shows how badly the 
schools need radical change. The first step toward that is to 
introduce real competition -- and not just in New York City.

<LI>In an annual rite of summer, New York City's "gay pride" parade will 
once again pass by St. Patrick's Cathedral, where militant homosexual 
activists will vent their hatred of the Catholic Church and its 
teaching of chastity for unmarried persons. Last year, while Rudy 
Giuliani turned a blind eye, gay exhibitionists pranced naked down the 
street and engaged in public masturbation. They chorused obscenities 
at the Cathedral, which while not illegal, as William Donohue of the 
Catholic League points out, would never be blessed by New York 
officials if it were done by Nazis in front of Temple Emanu-El, or 
Klansmen in Harlem. Mr. Giuliani has escaped political fallout so far, 
partly because Church officials have not put up much of a fight. Mr. 
Donohue, however, is another story. He has threatened to rouse the 43 
per cent of city residents who are Catholic, many of whom helped give 
the mayor his narrow victory over David Dinkins. If Mr. Giuliani 
wishes to show tolerance for gays, he should find a better way than 
tolerating bigotry against Catholics.

<LI>The dramatic annihilation of Canada's pro-immigration Progressive 
Conservative Party in 1992, and its replacement in the national 
parliament by the new, immigration-questioning Reform Party, was a 
clear warning to U.S. political leaders. Now the general election in 
Ontario, Canada's largest province, on June 8 sends a warning about 
another elite-imposed policy: affirmative action, i.e., quotas. Before 
the three-week election campaign, the provincial Progressive 
Conservative leader, Mike Harris, had wisely positioned his party 
several hundred miles to the right of its late unlamented federal 
counterpart on tax and spending issues. But he still had only about a 
quarter of the vote, according to public-opinion polls. The provincial 
Liberals, with 52 per cent, appeared poised for a landslide win over 
the governing party, the socialist New Democrats. (Reform did not 
participate.) Then the New Democrats' quota policies exploded as an 
issue. Harris attacked them; the New Democrats denied they existed; 
the Liberals allowed as how they were against quotas but in favor of 
affirmative action blah blah blah. Result: Mike Harris is the new 
Progressive Conservative premier of Ontario. Typically, the Republican 
leadership in Washington was simultaneously passing the word that 
abolishing affirmative action will not, after all, be among its 
legislative priorities.

<LI>Disney's new animated film Politicallycorrectahontas premiered in an 
extravaganza in New York's Central Park. The damage inflicted on the 
park's flora and fauna by the crowd of 70,000 certainly vindicates the 
film's message that Western Civilization has been harmful to the 
ecology of the New World. But the worst pollution was intellectual: 
Pocahontas is portrayed as a cross between Buffy Sainte-Marie, Joan of 
Arc, and Petra Kelly; the English settlers of colonial Virginia are 
brutal aristocrat/capitalist land-stealing predators. Powhatan, 
Pocahontas's father, is shown as the saintly leader of a people in 
true spiritual harmony with Nature; in reality he was a sort of Attila 
the Algonquin who conquered twenty rival tribes and annihilated some 
of them. All the facts of Pocahontas's story are so skewed that even 
her Native American descendants have complained that the film despoils 
their cultural heritage. Now we know what we were spared when Disney's 
project for an "American History Theme Park" in Virginia was 
torpedoed. 
<P> 
<LI>While hailing the encyclical Evangelium Vitae (The Gospel of Life), NR 
expressed concern on two points. The press had quoted Joseph Cardinal 
Ratzinger as saying that the encyclical's teaching on capital 
punishment represented a "development of doctrine," and that the new 
Catechism, issued only last year, would have to be revised to reflect 
the new teaching. Since then Fr. Richard John Neuhaus of First Things 
has asked the cardinal for a clarification, and has received this 
reassuring word. "Clearly, the Holy Father has not altered the 
doctrinal principles which pertain to this issue [the death penalty] 
as they are presented in the Catechism, but has simply deepened the 
application of such principles in the context of present-day 
historical circumstances. Thus, where other means for the self-defense 
of society are possible and adequate, the death penalty may be 
permitted to disappear. Such a development, occurring within society 
and leading to the forgoing of this type of punishment, is something 
good and ought to be hoped for." And there is no question of recalling 
the Catechism. The cardinal meant only that the official Latin text, 
which is being prepared after the publication of the vernacular 
versions, will refer to what Evangelium Vitae says about capital 
punishment. So Catholics relying on the Church's official teaching as 
expressed in the Catechism may in good faith disagree over whether, in 
today's circumstances, the self-defense of society requires the death 
penalty. Cardinal Ratzinger's clarification should be welcomed by all 
those who are concerned with the constancy of the Church's teaching. 
We expect it will not be welcomed by people who, ignoring what the 
encyclical says about abortion and euthanasia, triumphantly proclaimed 
that Evangelium Vitae condemns capital punishment.

<H3>Lost Right?</H3>
 
IN Lost Rights James Bovard chronicled typical depredations of federal 
agencies. Each page represents an American who has faced a rigid, 
often unforgiving government, at a price in wealth or energy or 
freedom, or all three. Such encounters serve as a recruiting ground 
for the panoply of new-wave anti-government groups, from property-
rights activists to the county movement in the West to a growing 
National Rifle Association. It's no coincidence that as government has 
gotten bigger -- trying to do more for you by doing more to someone 
else -- so has the range and variety of its resisters.Along with the 
burgeoning government has come an expanded police power. Law 
enforcement no longer just means a cop walking the beat. It can mean 
someone from the Environmental Protection Agency checking to make sure 
you haven't built a new deck on supposed wetlands. It can mean someone 
from the Drug Enforcement Administration confiscating your house 
because a marijuana plant was found growing on the back forty. It can 
mean, as Charles Krauthammer recounted, an FBI agent asking you 
whether a former employee up for an Administration appointment ever 
cracked an ethnic joke. It can mean -- as we all know -- the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms barging into your house to investigate 
some suspected firearms irregularity. Hence, the increasingly uneasy 
relation between conservatives and law enforcement; it's difficult to 
support vigorous enforcement of laws that shouldn't be on the books in 
the first place. But there's a profound risk in seeming anti-law-
enforcement in an American polity that rightly cherishes law and 
order. The risk is all the greater in the wake of Oklahoma City, which 
has shone the spotlight on a right-wing fringe -- the militias -- that 
seems willing to reject the most basic governmental authority. How 
should conservatives respond? First, by sticking to their principles. 
Central government has always posed the gravest threat to liberty, and 
as Angelo Codevilla points out (page 35), liberals bent on tarring the 
entire case for limited government with Oklahoma City are engaged in a 
sinister enterprise. If their logic is taken seriously, they are 
arguing for the criminalization of a philosophical position, while at 
the same time seeking to increase the power of the central government 
to move against it. Even in small doses, this medicine promises only 
unhappy effects.The best way to ensure respect for law enforcement, 
conservatives should insist, is to ensure it for laws. And that won't 
happen until there are fewer of them. As government has grown, 
people's respect for it has dwindled. In fact, it has become an object 
of fear. But all of this fades in the public mind when it sees law-
enforcement agents confronting an armed band that has gunned down 
their colleagues. Whether the case involves David Koresh or Rodney 
King, officers who daily put their lives at risk should get the 
benefit of the doubt, regardless of the operational folly of their 
political bosses.For conservatives this means taking care about where 
to draw the line both in criticizing government and in making allies. 
Freshman Republican Steve Stockman clearly crossed it with his 
incendiary remarks about Waco and Janet Reno in Guns & Ammo. So did G. 
Gordon Liddy when he encouraged his listeners to expect federal agents 
to come busting down their doors. The NRA deserves the flak it has 
gotten for calling ATF agents jack-booted thugs. Finally, most 
militiamen might be weekend soldiers playing with guns, but others are 
paranoiacs who scramble their gun-toting friends at the first sighting 
of a U.S. military vehicle. These lapses on the Right should be 
criticized from the Right. So it was almost refreshing to hear 
Republican Peter King of New York (lifetime ACU rating: 87) say of the 
militias: "They're wackos, they're nuts, they're dangerous, and we 
should have nothing to do with them."The pull of these two imperatives 
-- to limit government but not to stand in the way of legitimate law 
enforcement -- is being felt in Congress now over the anti-terrorism 
bill. The measure has passed the Senate and will soon be considered in 
the House. In a strange-bedfellow alliance, some conservatives are 
joining the ACLU in worrying about the civil-liberty implications of 
the bill. On the strict merits, as Eugene Methvin points out (p. 32), 
these concerns are excessive. One measure that has gotten particular 
attention is the so-called roving wire-tap, which would peg a wire-tap 
to a person no matter what phones he uses. But there is no reason to 
believe this authority would diminish Fourth Amendment protections; it 
is the individual who has the privacy right, after all, not the 
telephones. Also raising concerns are provisions allowing the military 
to assist in domestic cases involving biological or chemical weapons. 
But the military involvement would be strictly limited to technical 
assistance and analogous to the limited role it now plays in the drug 
war. This sounds merely prudent in a world of technological 
terrorists, foreign and domestic. Indeed, former Attorney General 
William Barr -- hardly a liberal -- calls the legislation "balanced 
and reasonable."Still, given the expansive abuses that have occurred 
with well-meaning legislation like the RICO statutes -- originally 
meant to rein in mobsters, now brought to bear against targets as far-
flung as abortion protestors -- conservative suspicion is reasonable. 
Indeed, the current IRS audit of the NRA looks suspiciously similar. 
Hence, it's difficult to cede any more power to a Federal Government 
one can't be sure will act within its given bounds. The short answer 
is to give law-enforcement agencies the powers they need to protect 
society while keeping a careful watch on them and investigating abuses 
like Waco as soon as they come to light. If this sounds ambiguous, 
well, conservatives are doomed to ambiguity on these issues until 
government is returned to its proper place, and law enforcement again 
means foiling criminals rather than harassing citizens. 
 

 
<H3<Courting Trouble</H3>
 
SUPREME Court decisions in two affirmative-action cases mirrored the 
opinions of politicians of both parties. Judges and lawmakers know 
that something has spoiled in the refrigerator, but they can't bring 
themselves to clean it up.Adarand Constructors v. Pena was a case 
involving minority set-asides in federal transportation projects. One 
way or another, the Federal Government steers $14.4 billion a year -- 
8.3 per cent of federal procurement -- to DBEs, or disadvantaged 
business enterprises: firms owned by minorities or women. In Missouri 
v. Jenkins, the Court reviewed the public-school system of Kansas 
City, Mo., which might be called systemic affirmative action. For 
nearly a decade a federal district judge has commanded the state to 
spend $200 million a year on the schools of the inner city, to make 
them equal to the schools of the suburbs.In each case, four Justices -
- Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and David He-Did-It-Again -- voted to 
maintain the status quo. Justices Scalia and Thomas wrote concurring 
majority opinions, calling for a clean slate. "There can be no such 
thing as either a creditor or debtor race," wrote Justice Scalia of 
Adarand Constructors. "As far as the Constitution is concerned," wrote 
Justice Thomas, "it is irrelevant whether a government's racial 
classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by 
those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be 
disadvantaged." On Missouri v. Jenkins, Thomas was even more scathing. 
Affirmative action in education means that "blacks, when left on their 
own, cannot achieve. To my way of thinking, that conclusion is the 
result of a jurisprudence based upon a theory of black 
inferiority."But the majority of the majority -- Chief Justice 
Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor and Kennedy -- would only urge the 
race-levelers to be more cautious. Racial "qualifications," wrote 
Justice O'Connor in Adarand Constructors, "are constitutional only if 
they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling 
governmental interests." Chief Justice Rehnquist, in Missouri v. 
Jenkins, ruled that the rogue district judge was not applying "the 
appropriate test," to evaluate the success of his edicts, but 
Rehnquist's decision did not order his educational fiefdom to be 
dismantled. In other words, the majority held that reverse 
discrimination is a bad thing, unless it is done very carefully. It 
was the equivalent of installing yellow lights on a street that has 
been taken over by drag-racers.The judges were echoed by the pols. 
President Clinton has been trying to find a way of seeming to give the 
issue a second thought, without actually thinking about it. Newt 
Gingrich, meanwhile, signaled to Republican reformers, such as 
Representative Charles T. Canady (R., Fla.), that he was inclined to 
"hold hearings, but not necessarily to move quickly."Which means that 
the decision will be taken by the voters. California will have a 
referendum on affirmative action in 1996; other states will follow. It 
is only a matter of time before the congressional elections will in 
effect become referenda, to be decided by an increasingly fed-up 
majority. If the GOP doesn't enact the majority's sense of justice -- 
which is also the Constitution's -- the electorate will find other 
agents of its will. 
 

 
<H3>Republican Budgets</H3>
 
IN ADVANCING his new plan to balance the budget over the next ten 
years, President Clinton rejects the lessons of Liberal Budget Math 
101: the budget can be balanced only with a combination of tax 
increases and spending cuts, preferably in defense, and never in 
entitlements.Clinton's embrace of a zero deficit, tax cuts, and 
entitlement reforms marks a seismic shift in the political debate over 
federal budget policy. In November, the President was arguing that in 
electing a Republican Congress, voters were expressing frustration 
with the pace of liberal change. Now, though his new budget plan is 
largely phony, the rhetorical capitulation it represents acknowledges 
Republican success in setting the agenda -- perhaps for a generation. 
But it is also smart re-election politics for Bill Clinton. Abandoning 
Hill Democrats reflects the political reality of a plurality President 
seeking majority support in '96. Most surviving Hill Democrats enjoy 
what Bill Clinton lacks -- a safe liberal seat. As 1996 approaches, 
Clinton's political fortunes will improve in direct proportion to the 
distance he puts between himself and a hopelessly liberal Democratic 
caucus. He will position himself as fighting off the mean-spirited 
excesses of the Republican majority while rising above the special-
interest politics of liberal Democrats. This balancing act will be 
popular in the Senate, where there is no shortage of Republicans eager 
to stymie Newt. Come next year, Clinton will, in the time-honored 
manner, run for re-election against Washington, arguing that the 
public needs to be protected against the extremes of both parties on 
Capitol Hill. Before that happens, Republicans can advance their 
agenda by a judicious compromise -- on the question of who keeps score 
over the next few years. Under the President's budget estimates, 
Republicans could keep the full tax-cut package as passed by the House 
without sacrificing their goal of a zero deficit by 2002. In his ten-
year plan, the President uses the Office of Management and Budget's 
estimates of future growth. These are more optimistic than those of 
Congress's scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, which leave 
the President with a $200-billion recurring deficit in 2005. Since the 
CBO is unwilling to recognize the growth effect of tax cuts, 
Republicans should adopt OMB's projections, thereby making tax cuts 
affordable -- even for Senator Domenici. 
 

 
<H3>Last Rites for the IRS</H3>
 
THERE is a revolution going on in Washington after all. Anyone who 
doubts this missed the three days of hearings before the House Ways 
and Means Committee on replacing the income tax. Chairman Bill Archer 
of Texas forcefully restated his commitment to "pull up the income tax 
by its very roots." The Left is apoplectic.One of Mr. Archer's star 
witnesses was William Dakin, tax counsel for Mobil Corporation. Mr. 
Dakin brought along a 76-pound, 4-foot high stack of papers -- Mobil's 
tax returns for 1993. Dakin told the stunned congressional panel: "It 
takes Mobil 57 man years at a cost of $10 million to prepare these 
income-tax returns." In a perverse way, our income-tax system has 
become one of Washington's most successful jobs programs. Historian 
Charles Adams, author of For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the 
Course of Civilization, told Congress of the events that led Britain 
to abolish an income tax in the early nineteenth century. According to 
Adams: "When the British legislature voted to defeat the income tax, 
there was the loudest exultation ever witnessed within the halls of 
Parliament. A motion then followed to have all the records of the tax 
destroyed." The tax records were burned by the citizenry in a giant 
bonfire. (Unfortunately, the Chancellor of the Exchequer "kept 
duplicate copies of the tax records in the basement of the Exchequer 
Court.")The debate in Washington is now not so much over whether to 
replace the income tax, as how. Republicans are falling into two 
camps: flat-tax proponents want to eliminate all deductions, abolish 
the capital-gains tax, scrap withholding, and put in place a flat tax 
of 17 to 20 per cent with a postcard form that could be completed in, 
say, 15 minutes. That's the moderate position. Mr. Archer wants to 
bulldoze the corporate, personal, and estate taxes entirely and move 
to a national sales tax. Of the thirty or so witnesses before his 
hearings, only one defended the current tax system -- the Clinton 
Administration witness, Les Samuels of the Treasury Department. Archer 
asked Samuels repeatedly: "Will the Administration come forward with a 
tax-reform plan, and if so, when?" Mr. Samuels's roundabout answer 
amounted to this: No, the White House likes the tax system just the 
way it is. Even the Democrats winced.Don't look for the Spirit of '76 
in the woods, it's in the House. 
 

 
<H3>The Bear at the Table</H3>
 
BORIS Yeltsin's appearance at Halifax was little more than a temper 
tantrum over Chechnya. It coincided with a bungled "rescue" by the 
supposedly elite Russian Alpha Group commando force at a hospital in 
southern Russia where Chechen guerrillas were holding two thousand 
hostages. After two days of the abortive "rescue mission," Yeltsin 
opted for negotiations with the Chechens over the hostages, as his G-7 
interlocutors had urged.The West has no direct strategic interest in 
Chechen independence. Our stake is indirect: Russia's performance in 
Chechnya is an indicator of its general disposition as a presumably 
reforming ex-imperialist power. What we have seen is a Russia that is 
once again flexing its muscles geopolitically (at least within the 
confines of the old USSR), flirting with authoritarianism, quick to 
resort to force, and not fastidious about methods. This has obvious 
implications for Russia's future behavior outside its old borders. The 
fact that the Russians were incompetent in Chechnya is somewhat 
reassuring. But no great power tolerates humiliation indefinitely. 
Already the Russian military is claiming -- and getting -- a larger 
share of the national budget. Five years from now, Russia's military 
posture may be no laughing matter.The good news is that Russia's 
desire to become a full member of the G-7 is now less likely than ever 
to be fulfilled. The G-7 is, after all, the special fraternity of the 
industrial democracies. Chechnya has dispelled most remaining 
illusions about the nature of the bear. The otherwise boring Halifax 
meeting may have been a useful field trip. 
 

 
<H3>The G-7 Bails Out</H3>
 
WHILE squabbling over Bosnia and trade policy, the world's richest 
nations managed to agree on one idea -- a global economic bailout 
fund. The fund, managed by the International Monetary Fund, would 
provide instant cash to countries facing Mexican-style currency 
meltdowns. Such aid would not be free of strings: countries that 
deliberately strayed from "acceptable" economic policies in order to 
receive funds would not be eligible. To its credit, the G-7 admits the 
moral hazards involved in offering an open-ended entitlement.Sharing 
this burden with other industrial nations is at least better than the 
sort of unilateral rescue effort rammed through by President Clinton 
for Mexico. The Halifax proposal requires that nations disclose a 
great deal of financial information they now keep secret or release 
much later. But, as NR's Ed Rubenstein points out, the economics of 
the scheme are still questionable. Consider the numbers. Currency 
trading has grown by more than 50 per cent over the past four years, 
to an estimated $1 trillion per day. At the same time, the total funds 
stockpiled by all central banks in the world to stabilize their 
currencies amount to just $1 trillion, or one day's worth of trading 
volume. So even if all of it were made available for emergency 
borrowing, the task would be quite impossible. In fact, the G-7 is 
willing to risk only a "mere" $50 billion for the new credit facility. 
The idea is to prevent a replay of the Mexican crisis. There is a 
widespread perception that the bailout orchestrated by President 
Clinton and the IMF is working well. It isn't. The peso collapse wiped 
out more than 40 per cent of Mexico's economic wealth. In 1994 
Mexico's GDP totaled about $350 billion; today it has shrunk to $240 
billion. Although interest rates range from 60 per cent to more than 
100 per cent, Mexican inflation will exceed 30 per cent this year. The 
peso remains worthless, and U.S. taxpayers will likely shell out far 
more than the $20 billion already pledged.Although stable currencies 
benefit developing economies, international aid is not the way to 
achieve them. The key lies in sound domestic monetary policy. Mexico 
erred in printing too many pesos during 1994, an election year. The 
central bank should have soaked up the excess pesos by selling off 
assets such as government bonds. The Federal Reserve does this every 
day. So do other central banks; there's no rocket science involved.The 
problem is that central bankers are often under the thumb of 
politicians. There's a way out, however. Simply convert the central 
bank into a currency board such as those that now exist in Hong Kong 
and Argentina. Under a currency board, all currency growth has to be 
exactly matched by an expansion in foreign-exchange reserves, 
guaranteeing that the currency is fully convertible. Argentina endured 
inflation of 2,300 per cent in 1990, the year before it established 
its currency board. Today Argentina's inflation rate is under 4 per 
cent.Currency boards lack the glamor and excitement of bailouts. But 
make no mistake about it, bailouts are never what they seem to be. 
Messrs. Clinton and Rubin claimed to have the Mexican people on their 
minds, but the real winners were the American banks, mutual funds, and 
pension funds that held the debt and securities the bailout saved. The 
American taxpayer came in a distant last. That's where he'll come in 
under a global bailout fund. 

 
 
<H3>Lost in the Woods</H3>
 
THE nation had something to cheer about when Air Force Captain Scott 
O'Grady, whose F-16 was shot out of the sky over Bosnia on June 2, was 
rescued six days later by a daring helicopter raid by U.S. Marines. 
The heroism of all concerned was genuine. Less admirable was President 
Clinton's blatant exploitation of Captain O'Grady's rescue to salvage 
public support for the bankrupt policy that had put the captain in 
harm's way in the first place.The cause of the shootdown was not just 
an intelligence failure or a failure to communicate timely 
intelligence to the pilot. It was a political failure, at the highest 
level.It has been known since November that the Bosnian Serbs had 
acquired anti-aircraft missiles like the high-speed mobile SA-6 that 
hit O'Grady. The missile threat, indeed, had caused NATO to cancel air 
drops of humanitarian relief supplies late last year. Since that time, 
the U.S. Air Force has been arguing to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that 
NATO ought to eliminate the missiles as a threat to its "peacekeeping" 
operations. In northern Iraq, for example, U.S. air patrols like 
O'Grady's are accompanied by a robust capability for suppressing 
hostile air defenses by electronic jamming and radar-destroying 
counter-missiles. In Bosnia, however, at UN insistence, the Air 
Force's requests were repeatedly denied by higher authority, for 
political reasons, as an unacceptable "escalation." Until now, that 
is. The rules of engagement have been changed in the wake of the 
O'Grady drama.The captain won cheers with his tale of resourcefulness 
and his forthright declaration of religious faith. Given all the self-
defeating restraints that remain in the Western powers' Bosnia policy, 
nothing short of divine intervention will avert future losses of 
American or British or French lives. Captain O'Grady, once lost in the 
woods, has been rescued. The same cannot be said of his Commander-in-
Chief. 
 

 
<H3>John Finley, RIP</H3>
 
JOHN H. Finley Jr., a relic and type of Harvard's ancestors past, died 
last week. Scholar, classicist, and Master of Eliot House from 1941 to 
1968, Finley brought Harvard's house system to its pinnacle by 
investing Herculean effort into selecting each freshman who applied to 
live there. Master Finley defined the principles of a Harvard 
education in his 1946 "General Education in a Free Society." He 
expected the best from his students, and so they delivered it (a 
lesson in an age where grade inflation and personal-esteem enhancement 
predominate). A generation of men were molded by Finley and the 
college that he loved. Atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale.

(INAUDIBLE)
VPOTUS: Can you hear me? I had the Navy set up this AirLink. Rusty?

Telephone conversation 09:17 hrs:

(RINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE VOICE: Good morning, American Broadcasting 
Company.
VPOTUS: Robert Iger, please.
UFM: Certainly. 
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
UFM #2: Robert Iger's office.
VPOTUS: Is Mr. Iger in?
UFM #2: Whom shall I say is calling?
VPOTUS: Al Gore.
UFM #2: And you're with . . . ?
VPOTUS: Um . . . the executive branch.
UFM #2: Of . . . ?
VPOTUS: The federal government.
UFM #2: Please hold the line.
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
(ELAPSED TIME: 11 MINUTES, 23 SECONDS)
UFM #2: Go ahead, Mr. Iger.
ROBERT IGER, CEO -- ABC TELEVISION NETWORK: Newt?
VPOTUS: No, it's Al Gore.
RI: Al Gore? Al Gore? Oh! THAT Al Gore! Well, Mr. Vice President, this 
is indeed an honor. Hey, if you're calling about the nudity and 
violence on NYPD Blue you're too late -- Bob Dole already called! Ha 
ha! I'm kidding, of course. We here at the American Broadcasting 
Company -- and by extension our corporate parents at Capital Cities -- 
hold the nation's airwaves as a kind of a sacred trust. There's 
nothing more dear to use than the VHF band, as a viewing of, say, 
Family Matters or America's Goofiest Cops will attest to. And how may 
I help you, sir? 
VPOTUS: Well, I'm calling at the behest of the president. We're 
requesting thirty minutes of network airtime to present our budget 
plan.
RI: How many minutes?
VPOTUS: Thirty.
RI: Ouch. Mr. Veep, you're killing me! Thirty minutes which day?
VPOTUS: Tuesday.
RI: Tuesday? As in Roseanne? As in 33 share? 
VPOTUS: Wednesday, then?
RI: Oooh. Double ouch. Ellen. Grace Under Fire. 37 share. C'mon. Work 
with me, here. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking Thursday.
VPOTUS: Well, we tried that. NBC refused. 
RI: They did? Where's their sense of civic duty?
VPOTUS: Apparently, Seinfeld and Friends are pretty popular.
RI: I know, but by God! We're all Americans, after all. Hmmmm. I'm 
thinking here. I'm thinking here. 
VPOTUS: You know, in the past, it's been traditional for the networks 
to grant time to the president as a matter of course, without 
hesitation.
RI: Yeah, and with all due respect: A), in the past, the networks 
haven't had any competition; and 2) let's be totally honest, you're 
asking for thirty minutes now, but I remember a time when you folks 
down there told me to my face that the State of the Union wouldn't go 
past forty-five minutes, and I'm watching the thing go to an hour, 
then an hour and a half, eating up all of prime time on the east 
coast, taking a big chunk out of the west, and you guys are saying to 
me ``he's wrapping up, he's wrapping up,'' but hell, I KNOW when a 
guy's wrapping up and he wasn't even close -- and that's dollars down 
the drain, and don't quote me on this, but you didn't get the health 
care thing anyway, did you? 
VPOTUS: I hate to bring up the FCC here, but -- 
RI: Can I offer you a piece of advice? In my business, when a show 
isn't going as well as it should, or it's getting overlooked, or it 
needs re-tooling, we put it on something called ``hiatus.'' You guys 
should look into that option.
VPOTUS: You want us to put the executive branch of the federal 
government of the Unites States of America on ``hiatus?''
RI: Um . . . .yeah. Why? Is that bad?
VPOTUS: You know, CBS gave us the time with no argument.
RI: Of course they did! They're in fourth place! Their ratings are in 
the toilet! You offered them thirty minutes of free programming. What 
are they going to say? No? C'mon! They've got Murder, She Wrote, which 
skews way, way, way old, one of those really bad Linda Bloodworth-
Thomason shows -- hey, no offense -- and you! If I were them I'd offer 
you guys a whole series!
VPOTUS: This is unbelievable.
RI: Hey, if your guy just skewed a little younger. Not boomer, really, 
but younger. Somewhere between boomer and Gen-X. I can sell time for 
thirty minutes of that. 
VPOTUS: Sell time?
RI: Yeah, you know. Commercials? Pay the rent?
VPOTUS: The President of the United States doesn't ``break for a 
commercial.''
RI: Yeah yeah yeah. When he needs votes, he'll play the sax and talk 
about his underwear on MTV, but then suddenly it's all ``Mr. 
President'' this and ``Dignity of the Office'' that. I got news for 
you: you can't unscramble an egg, you know?
VPOTUS: Look, CBS and CNN and NBC said that they would give us the 
time. 
RI: Okay, okay. You twisted my arm. You win, okay! You win! We'll give 
you the time.
VPOTUS: Commercial free?
RI: You're killing me, here! Killing me! But, okay, commercial free.
VPOTUS: Thanks, Mr. Iger. Bill and I really appreciate it.
RI: Now there's something that you can do for me.
VPOTUS: What's that?
RI: You wanted thirty minutes, right?
VPOTUS: Right?
RI: Can you get it down to five? I've got a Circus of the Daytime 
Drama Stars special I just can't move.
VPOTUS: I'll see what I can do.

<H2><I>ON THE SCENE</I></H2>
<H3>Saving Gramm's Campaign</H3>

RICHARD BROOKHISER<P>

<I>Mr. Brookhiser is an NR senior editor.</I><P>
<BR>
NEW YORK<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE ="+2>P</FONT>HIL Gramm's film career bloomed and faded in Texas, 
and its dried petals were exhibited by The New
Republic in Washington, D.C., but the story found its home in Gotham. A PORN-AGAIN 
PREZ
HOPEFUL, shouted the Daily News. PORNO-GRAMM, squawked the Post. All that was 
missing was
TOPLESS BODIES FILMED BY BRAINLESS GRAMM.
<P>
The hinterlands made less of the tale. ``Not many people down here are interested 
in what The New
Republic has to say about Phil Gramm,'' said Bill Murchison of the Dallas Morning 
News.
Representative J. D. Hayworth (R., Ariz.), a strong Gramm supporter in the 
class of '94, compared the
impact of the flap in his district to a ``whoopee cushion -- it made a lot 
of noise, but the wind went out of
it quickly.'' In a few days, even the national-media pinball machine was flipping 
other news-bits.
<P>
The Gramm story shows yet again that while dirt is fun, presidential elections 
are serious affairs. The
weaknesses of the Gramm campaign are structural and intellectual. There is 
a limit to what he can do to
remedy them, but he can do quite a lot.
<P>
Phil Gramm came into 1995 trailing clouds of glory from last year's health- 
care wars. He raised more
money in one night in Dallas than most candidates see in a lifetime. He wins 
straw polls with dull
regularity. But the mountainous effort has so far produced mousey results in 
the polls. In a Zogby - New
York Post poll in late April, Gramm trailed Bob Dole by 47 points, and Pat 
Buchanan by 7.
<P>
Gramm's slow start is the result of difficulties with three Republican grouplets. 
The smallest, and
peskiest, is the guardians of New Hampshire's divine right to the first primary. 
Gramm encouraged
efforts by Arizona and Louisiana to jump to the head of the queue, and he attended 
a May convention in
Delaware despite stern warnings from New Hampshire Republicans that it was 
anathema. So, although
Gramm can show a New Hampshire senator in his corner (Bob Smith), the Manchester 
Union Leader has
sniped at him, and Stephen Merrill, the conservative governor, sits on the 
fence.
<P>
Gramm's night at the movies came in the midst of a push to shore up his standing 
with social
conservatives and the religious Right. Abortion was a symbol of his difficulties. 
Gramm has a pro-life
voting record, but he was reluctant to stress the issue in his campaign. ``Short 
of a moral reawakening in
the land, we are not going to have anything like unanimity'' on the issue, 
he had told the Washington
Times in 1993. ``I'm pro-life. I can't reach another conclusion in my heart,'' 
he told Human Events early
this March, but added that under Reagan the GOP ``attracted people who had 
many different views on
issues like abortion.'' When Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council complained 
that the ``in my
heart'' talk reminded him of the evasions of Mario Cuomo, Gramm met with him 
and James Dobson of
Focus on the Family. The meeting was frosty. ``At first there was a little 
filibuster'' from Gramm, Bauer
recalls. ``Then things went downhill.'' ``I'm not a preacher,'' Gramm told 
Dobson. ``That's your job.''
<P>
Early in May, Gramm went to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University to give the 
commencement address and
mend fences. He said that America was in the midst of an economic and a moral 
crisis, both having
``their roots in the explosion of a government'' that ``squanders the fruits 
of our labor'' and ``corrupt[s]
our values.'' The blue-movie episode that followed soon after was what they 
call ``off message,'' but
Bauer believes that it caused as little a stir as it did among social conservatives 
because Gramm had
already been out there, trying to address them.
<P>
Gramm's third problem is with a tendency rather than an organized lobby: the 
supply-side faith left over
from the Eighties. ``If we want to let people keep more of what they earn, 
we've got to not spend it,''
Gramm says. With a Republican Congress, that is now a possibility for the first 
time in decades. Would a
Republican President keep hammering the anti-tax, pro-growth message? Fear 
that neither Gramm nor
any of his current opponents would briefly encouraged supply-side publisher 
Malcolm Forbes Jr. to flirt
with running himself -- the most quixotic venture in a year that has produced 
Arlen Specter and Alan
Keyes. Forbes stayed on the sidelines, but supply-side doubts about the GOP 
field, including Gramm,
linger.
<P>
Gramm's strength is also his problem: he has a philosophy. ``He has been rock-solidly 
consistent,'' says
Jim Miller, former Reagan budget director, who went to college with Gramm at 
the University of
Georgia and taught economics with him at Texas A&M. ``When he first got into 
politics and started
calling up chambers of commerce, he gave a speech he called his 'government 
is the enemy' speech.''
He's been giving it ever since he arrived in Washington as a congressman in 
1979. You disarm the enemy
by cutting programs and cutting funding. Along the way, Gramm has made his 
share of compromises for
Texas pork -- the mohair program, the supercollider -- and in Bush-era debacles 
such as the 1990
budget deal and the 1991 Civil Rights Act. But this is where his music comes 
from. He is not going to
change it because some Beltway operatives ask him to. He is not going to change 
it because someone
shows him a better way. No one will, because Gramm's way is right. Gramm's 
knobbly personal
qualities -- abrasiveness, lecturing would-be advisors -- are not ``merely'' 
personal. They grow out of
his convictions and the pride with which, as a self-made academic, he holds 
them.
<P>
Social conservatives are looking for a soulmate. ``Something's wrong with the 
core of the country,'' says
Bauer, ``and it's not just the size of government. The size of government didn't 
make Mrs. Smith put her
kids in the lake. There is a coarseness, a depravity, a decay.'' Bauer's people 
want a leader who connects
with ``what they see in the headlines.'' Gramm won't be that leader. But he 
can show that he and they
have the same enemy in the explosion of government. Professor Gramm may think 
the connection is
obvious, but nothing is too obvious to be said one thousand times, especially 
in a presidential campaign.
<P>
Some staffers attuned to these things might help. Gramm has been dealing with 
the Bauers and the
Dobsons himself in part because he doesn't seem to have anyone around him who 
knows them.
(Compare Bob Dole, whose deputy political director is Judy Haynes, former deputy 
executive director
of the Christian Coalition.) New staff would offset some of the staff Gramm 
already has. Linda Dival, his
pro-choice pollster, will be reading the numbers through a socially liberal 
prism. She will also rub the
religious Right the wrong way every time she shows up on the box to spin for 
her man. Gramm needs
help fending off Buchanan. The Gramm campaign would prefer to ignore him, focusing 
on a battle of the
titans with Dole. But Gramm has temporarily lost titan status: his enemy of 
the moment is the man who
edged him in the Zogby poll. The shots are there to be taken -- on the Gulf 
War, on trade -- but Gramm
must understand that he needs to take them. In the meantime, the Liberty speech 
was a step in the right
direction.
<P>
Opposing Dr. Henry Foster for surgeon general will be another, if Gramm criticizes 
Foster on
philosophical grounds, namely that Foster is a bad nominee because of his record 
as a sex educator and a
supporter and provider of abortions, not because he told fibs about that record.
The supply-siders will have to grin and bear it. Phil Gramm is not Ronald Reagan. 
Gramm will not
promise morning in America. He wants high noon in Washington.

<H2>THE MISANTHROPE'S CORNER</H2>

<H3>Honey, I Shrunk the Attention Span</H3>
<P>

St. Martin's has just published The Florence King Reader, an anthology.
<P>

<FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>HE American attention span always has gotten a lot 
of attention. The
first to note our easy distractibility was Alexis de Tocqueville. His findings 
were echoed by Frederick
Jackson Turner, but being an American, Turner used the more tactful and romantic 
``restlessness.''
Other commentators were people with a stake in concentration, such as teachers, 
inventors, bridge
players, and Jobean old salts who made boats-in-bottles. These earlier critics, 
who tended to use words
like ``stick-to-itiveness,'' held that Americans could not concentrate because 
we could not sit still. This
opinion prevailed until the television age, when a new kind of critic announced 
that sitting still was
destroying our ability to concentrate.
<P>
Sociologists of the Fifties warned that TV viewers were falling into the habit 
of thinking in clumps of ten
or fifteen minutes, until a commercial came on and temporarily shut down the 
cognitive process.
Actually this was the Golden Age of the American attention span. Early TV had 
some meaty shows such
as Hallmark Hall of Fame and Playhouse 90 that were presented live within the 
traditional boundaries of
the drama, so the resultant thought-clumping was not very different from what 
playwrights had been
doing for thousands of years.
<P>
The logic-friendly format of the theatrical act went out of style around the 
same time that more artistry
went into commercials. Our attention span consequently shrank to about five 
minutes, according to the
sociologists. It went on like this, with a new official attention span announced 
every few years, until it
was down to thirty seconds. It stayed at that for a while, long enough to begin 
acquiring the cachet that
attaches to permanence, but then the soundbite came along and turned thirty 
seconds into an eon.
<P>
No one has announced our new attention span yet, but there are hints. Bill 
Clinton promised to ``focus
like a laser beam'' on the economy. A current bumper sticker, ``Practice Random, 
Senseless Acts of
Kindness,'' effectively says that if you help more than one old lady across 
the street, instead of leaving
the second one standing there while you rush off to hug the squeegee man, you 
are in a rut. Computers are
getting faster and faster, with each new speed advertised as ``blazing,'' and 
Internet messages of ``snail
f---!'' greet those who still use a 386.
<P>
Movies are becoming increasingly incoherent as scriptwriters strive for new 
ways to keep the restless
interested. Gone is the orderly approach that Old Hollywood called ``backstory'' 
-- filling us in on the
action up to the point where the movie begins. It's a technique as old as storytelling. 
Hamlet: the king has
died; Rebecca: the first wife has died; The Odyssey: the hero is setting off 
for home after a long absence.
This is all we need to know to follow the plot, but we need to know it right 
away.
<P>
Apparently feeling that logical narration is for snail fanciers, today's movie 
makers eschew both
backstory and the traditional flashback in favor of the staccato technique 
known as ``cutting in and out.''
<P>
The movie opens with a scene of bankers in conference. We barely know who everyone 
is, when
suddenly the dreary discussion of loans is interrupted by a split-second shot 
of a naked smooth leg
draped over a naked hairy leg. This means that an affair was had, but we have 
as yet no idea who had it.
Back to the bankers for a few minutes, then another split-second shot of a 
knife on a kitchen counter.
When the bankers adjourn for lunch we see the entwined legs again. This time 
the hairy leg fades out and
immediately fades in again, covered now in prison orange. The orange-leg shot 
is mixed with a shot of a
boys' baseball team in orange socks; back and forth, faster and faster, man's 
leg, boy's leg, bad orange,
good orange, while the soundtrack emits whirring, clicking noises to suggest 
someone snapping still
photos as fast as humanly possible.
<P>
Never mind the popcorn, the best accompaniment for today's movies is a surge 
protector. Other
cinematic devices designed to nail our elusive attention are the split-screen 
telephone conversation and
the zoom shot that pulls a human dot on the horizon into an extreme close-up 
so fast that our stomachs
turn over. But of all the techniques for concentrating the mind, the most ironic 
is the freeze frame. A
character who stops dead in his tracks and assumes a basilisk stare is probably 
supposed to remind the
audience to focus like a laser beam, but in fact it resembles nothing so much 
as that menopausal dilemma
of standing motionless in the middle of a room, trying to remember what it 
was you came in to get.
<P>
<FONT SIZE = "+2">M</FONT>UCH of our flagging attention is a natural reaction 
against the unnecessary tedium we create for
ourselves. As the country that enshrined the clarion call of ``quick 'n' easy'' 
and still believes ads
promising mastery of a foreign language in only ``ten minutes a day,'' wouldn't 
it make sense for us to be
on the parliamentary system? We could have got rid of Bill Clinton long ago, 
but no, we wait out the
whole grinding, nerdy, petulant four years, and then wonder why we can't keep 
our minds on anything.
<P>
Our distractibility is also the inevitable residue of our undisciplined feelings. 
The American proclivity
for leaving our emotional lights on has drained the battery of our attention 
span dry. The human spirit can
take only so much of 24-hour coverage, memorial services, ribbons, teddy bears, 
crisis counseling, and
moments of silence. We pay such obsessive attention to disasters and tragedies 
that we end up seeking
respite in forgetfulness. (Quick, name one Teheran hostage.)
<P>
Welcome to America the Flea Circus. We now have a new disease, Attention Deficit 
Disorder, and like
all democratic diseases, it does not discriminate. The good news is that by 
the time we run the gauntlet of
ADD resources, clinics, programs, workshops, seminars, CBS Specials, and Sally 
Struthers promos, no
one will remember what it is. J

<head><title>THE WEEK -- NR</title></head><body>
<H2>THE WEEK</H2>
<P>

President Clinton is reported to be contemplating a notion to develop an initiative 
to consider the
possibility of formulating an intention to assemble a framework which could, 
under certain
circumstances, be used to develop the foundation for a possible plan to devise 
a tentative policy on
Bosnia.
<P>

You don't have to be a weatherman to tell which way the wind is blowing -- 
you just need to look at Pete
Wilson. The California governor's executive order ending racial preferences 
not mandated by state or
federal law is reassuring: if Pete Wilson is out in front on affirmative action, 
there's no place safer to be.
Representative Charles Canady (R., Fla.) will soon join him there when he introduces 
his ``Civil Rights
Act of 1995,'' a measure (inspired by the California Civil Rights Initiative) 
that would wipe out
preferences at the federal level. Bob Dole will likely be close behind with 
his own version in the Senate.
It bears repeating that, in taking on affirmative action, jittery Republicans 
only have to cut through a thin
layer of media and establishment flak before meeting the broad sense of fairness 
of the American
people. Fortune, in this case, is forgiving; she doesn't favor the brave so 
much as those, like Wilson, with
elementary political smarts.
<P>

After watching House Republicans march with the precision of an honor guard 
through the first hundred
days, new-generation senators have rebelled at the stumbling on their side 
of the Capitol -- Mark
Hatfield's dissent on the Balanced Budget Amendment being the foremost example. 
So Connie Mack
(Fla.) has proposed a serious overhaul of the Senate Republican Conference. 
After each election Senate
Republicans would get together to set a policy agenda for the next Congress, 
a mini Contract with
America. Then, before electing their committee chairmen, senators could find 
out if a would-be
chairman disagreed with any of the items of this common-denominator, got-to-have-it 
agenda. If so,
would-bes might become also-rans. Moderates are screaming that this reform 
assails the ``diversity'' of
the party. But Mark Hatfield and his Old Guard soulmates would provide the 
same ``diversity'' as
ranking majority members of their committees that they now do as chairmen. 
They just wouldn't give as
much aid and comfort to the Democrats.
<P>

Telecommunications is the most thoroughly regulated industry in America, and 
it just might stay that
way. The telecommunications bill crafted by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman 
Larry Pressler
(R., S.D.) contains some ninety new rule-making functions for the Federal Communications
Commission, retains elements of the disastrous Cable Act of 1992, and raises 
the specter of new
telecommunications entitlements by possibly extending ``universal service'' 
requirements (which now
apply to phone service) to new technologies. Pressler has apparently been rolled 
by Senator Ernest
Hollings (D., S.C.), who has pulled the Senate bill ever closer to the two-hundred-page 
regulatory
monster he proposed last year. The House telecom bill is better, but it still 
suffers from timidity and the
close relationship of Representative Jack Fields (R., Tex.), chairman of the 
relevant subcommittee, to
liberal Democrat Edward Markey (Mass.). Bolder stuff comes by way of a new 
report from the Progress
and Freedom Foundation which calls for abolishing the FCC, slicing away huge 
swaths of regulation,
and privatizing the electromagnetic spectrum. It's time the Third Wave met 
the free market -- and
Republican committee chairmen met both.
<P>

Everywhere he goes, he says, people ask Colin Powell what he believes. We can 
tell you exactly what he
believes: that, ``You're not going to hear it today.''
<P>

Aliens who are convicted of felonies after coming to America are ``deportable'' 
under the Immigration
and Nationality Act. They are rarely deported, however, because they are able 
to seek endless judicial
review of the order of deportation. According to a 1995 Senate Report on Criminal 
Aliens in the United
States, a conservative estimate of the total number of deportable aliens in 
the country is 450,000. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot house this many, so most of them 
are released onto the
streets, with instructions to report several months later for an INS hearing. 
Needless to say, most of them
miss their hearings. They do not vanish for good, however. A recent study by 
the General Accounting
Office found that 77 per cent of non-citizens convicted of felonies are arrested 
at least one more time. In
Los Angeles County alone, more than half of incarcerated illegal aliens are 
re-arrested within one year
of their release. Under provisions of the Senate Republican anti-terrorism 
bill sponsored by Spencer
Abraham (Mich.), aliens would still have all the due-process protections afforded 
American citizens on
the underlying offense. There would still be a hearing before an immigration 
judge, which could still be
appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. All the Abraham provisions remove 
is the much-abused
process of judicial review of the order of deportation. But this is too much 
for Senator Edward Kennedy,
who has offered amendments to keep the status quo. If he succeeds, alien felons 
will continue to be
deported at the current pace -- about 4 per cent a year. Assuming no alien 
is ever convicted of another
felony, it would take 23 years to deport the current backlog. The first step 
to controlling our borders is
controlling Senator Kennedy.

<head><title>LETTER FROM AL -- NR</title></head><body>
<H2><I>LETTER FROM AL</I></H2>June 5, 1995
<P>Dear Rusty:
<P>

It's been pretty crazy around the Gore household these days -- the kids are 
out of school, Newt Gingrich
is dismantling the Clean Water Act, the rain gutters need to be cleaned out 
. . . it's a busy time.
<P>
Sarah and Kristin are actively seeking summer jobs. You were kind to offer 
to have them spend the
summer with you down on the Orinoco, classifying carrier ants, but after a 
long discussion, Tipper and I
decided that it would be best if they both spent the summer closer to home. 

<P>
The problem is that Little Al wants a summer job too -- he's bored mowing the 
lawn and selling
lemonade to his Secret Service detail -- but he's too young for most jobs. 
The girls couldn't be less
helpful. At every turn, they've accused Little Al of being part of the ``oppressive 
male patriarchy'' that
has kept women out of all of the ``really cool summer jobs.''
<P>
I'm starting to wonder about the National Cathedral School, Rusty. At dinner 
tonight, when I told the
girls that they couldn't spend the summer with you in Brazil, Kristin responded 
by going limp in protest
(splashing sorrel soup on Tipper's grandmother's tablecloth) and Sarah began 
scribbling furious notes in
her diary (which she has entitled: ``Sarah: A Slave Narrative''). Tipper reprimanded 
Kristin, who replied
that hand-rolled linen symbolizes an oppressive society that ``infantilizes 
women.'' And when Little Al
told Sarah that it's rude to write at the table, she shouted ``You will not 
censor me!'' and dashed out of the
room. 
<P>
I cleared the plates, made a pot of chamomile tea, and settled down to write 
you a letter. I had barely
finished writing ``Dear Rusty'' when the phone rang. An emergency National 
Security meeting at the
White House. Subject: Bosnia. 
<P>
When I arrived, the Situation Room was crowded: Bill, Tony Lake, ``Chris'' 
Christopher, Strobe Talbott,
and General Shalikashvili were missing, but Paul Begala, Ron Brown, Ron Brown's 
personal attorney
(who, it turns out, is Johnnie Cochran -- small world, no?), Stan Greenberg 
(the President's pollster),
and a lot of interns were there.
<P>
``It's grim, isn't it?'' I said.
<P>
``I'll say,'' Stan answered. ``The carnage, the loss of life, the breakdown 
of civilized norms, and worse
-- the inaction from the government. We keep saying we're going to do something, 
but we never do.''
<P>
Paul piped up. ``Let's do something,'' he said. ``Let's take off the gloves 
and get into the fight!''
<P>
``I agree,'' said Ron Brown. Cochran pulled him close and whispered in his 
ear for a moment or two.
Then Ron cleared his throat and spoke again. ``I refuse to either 'agree' or 
'disagree' or comment further
on these proceedings until the Special Prosecutor issues his report in full, 
at which time I will respond
and in detailed terms.''
<P>
``We have to do something,'' Stan said. ``The situation is starting to look 
like Bosnia.''
<P>
``Wait a minute,'' I said. ``Aren't we talking about Bosnia?''
<P>
``No. We're talking about the Republican budget,'' Begala said.
<P>
``And its 57% approval rate,'' Stan added.
<P>
``The Bosnia thing is down the hall.''
<P>
I ducked out of the room and headed down the hall. The minute I saw Strobe 
Talbott talking to Wolf
Blitzer, Michael Kramer, R. W. Apple, Brit Hume, Lesley Stahl, Joe Klein, Morton 
Kondracke, Sidney
Blumenthal, and Leon Wieseltier, I knew I was in the right place. I made my 
way through the throng of
people. ``I predicted this, you know,'' was all I heard Strobe say before I 
entered the room. 
<P>
``Hi, Al,'' Bill said.
<P>
``Sorry I'm late,'' I said as I took my seat.
<P>
``That's okay,'' Bill shrugged. ``We just decided to commit ground troops.'
<P>'
``We did?'' Leon Panetta asked.
<P>
``We did?'' General Shalikashvili asked.
<P>
``Didn't we?'' asked Bill.
<P>
``If I may, Mr. President,'' began ``Chris'' Christopher, ``I'd like to clarify 
and perhaps summarize the
sense of today's meeting by clasping my hands like so -- '' Chris folded his 
hands into a little steeple ``
-- and by looking very concerned indeed.''
<P>
As usual, we were all impressed by Chris's ability to get to the heart of the 
matter. The ground-troops
option was tabled for the moment, and in its place, finger-steepling and concerned-looking. 
I think
we've finally licked this thing!
<P>
At that moment, Strobe Talbott poked his head into the room and asked us politely 
if we'd mind moving
-- apparently, he had the room booked for a meeting with his biographers. So 
we hustled out.
This is all Top Secret -- I know I can trust you to be discreet. Plus, by the 
time you read this, I have a
feeling we'll have a new Bosnia policy. Or two.
<P>

The Business Leadership Council (BLC) is dedicated to free market principles, economic opportunity, private property rights, and individual liberty.  It represents businesses that are entrepreneurial, growth-oriented, and supporters of free enterprise, as



 opposed to those which want to protect the status quo or are seeking special government privileges.  Its members are business leaders who are willing to take bold, principled positions in support of issues such as limiting the size of government and expa



nding global economic freedom.
<P>
The Business Leadership Council has formed the Tax Alternatives Working Group (TAWG) in order to analyze each of the major competing tax alternative proposals currently under consideration and to provide input from a business point of view to the leading 



proponents of these reforms, to others in the Congress and to the general public.  The objective is to make a positive contribution to improving all of the alternative tax proposals; and to ensure that the various tax plans will be better able to meet the



 goals of promoting economic growth in a way that takes into account the practical concerns of the business community.

<title>Kerrigan:  Why state health-care reforms are failing -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Why state health-care reforms are failing</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center><hr><P>
 While President and Mrs. Clinton appear to have
put aside their interest in the nation's so-called &quot;health-care
crisis&quot; for now, the issue has not gone away - especially
for small businesses and entrepreneurs struggling to purchase
insurance for themselves and their employees.
<P>
Washington terms such as &quot;employer mandates&quot; &quot;community
rating&quot; and &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; have suddenly become
staple household vocabulary due to television commercials and
radio talk show hosts.  Ad ideological clashes still exist on
how to make health insurance more accessible and affordable for
all Americans.
<P>
The Clinton plan modeled previously enacted state-based reforms
to achieve universal coverage.  Opposing sides of the debate have
each provided their own analysis of what would occur upon implementation
of the state reforms on a national scale.
<P>
According to Clinton plan advocates, health-care heaven-on-earth
would ensue, while critics have claimed a massive case of the
health-care horrors.
<P>
With the passing of another year, though, the results of these
state reforms have become much clearer.  The reforms included
in the Clinton plan have produced distorted consequences for both
policy holders and insurance companies.
<P>
Experts point to two very specific reforms that have caused headaches
for state legislators and governors who believed making everyone
pay the same insurance rates, and letting consumers get insurance
whenever they needed, was sound public policy.
<P>
Community rating and guaranteed issue became the foundation of
these now-failing reforms.  Pure community rating requires that
everyone pay the same premiums for health insurance regardless
of their age or health risks.  So a healthy 28-year-old pays the
same rate as a 58-year-old smoker.
<P>
For most younger people, who have fewer health risks, logical
economic decision-making forces them to drop coverage.  The massive
decrease in policy holders, especially healthy ones, has driven
companies to jack their rates even higher, causing additional
budget-wary consumers to drop insurance.
<P>
Guaranteed issue essentially requires insurance companies to supply
health insurance to all individuals no matter what their medical
disposition at the time.  Under this scenario, the incentive for
individuals to avoid paying for health insurance until they are
confronted with a serious medical problem are clear.
<P>
The increased costs for insurers are substantial and obviously
passed along to consumers in terms of either higher insurance
rates of fewer insurance choices.
<P>
States have not found the promised utopian effect from these reforms.
 Instead, thousands are dropping their health-care plans altogether
because of skyrocketing premium rates.  In effect, fewer people
have health-care insurance and fewer are in the market to purchase
policies because of high rates as well as the incentive to buy
insurance only when needed.
<P>
States now find that health-care accessibility and affordability
problems have become far worse, not better.  For example:
<UL>
<LI> New York imposed community rating on the small and individual
insurance market in 1993.  Since then, several major insurers
simply stopped serving the market altogether, and by some estimates
more than 500,000 New Yorkers dropped their coverage due to skyrocketing
costs.    
</UL>

<P>
The New York Department of Insurance reported that in some cases,
rates for a single, 30-year-old male increased by 170 percent.
<UL>
<LI>In 1992, New Jersey passed guaranteed issue and a phase-in
to pure community rating by 1997.  This summer, more than 100,000
New Jersey also mandates that anyone who wants insurance must
buy one of five state-designated plans.
<LI>In Vermont, The Burlington Free Press is calling for the repeal
of health-care reform enacted several years ago, which included
community rating and guaranteed issue, and prohibited individual
insurers from charging healthy people low rates.
</UL>


<P>
Now, these 7,500 healthy Vermonters who thought they were part
of a safety net are getting hit with a 60 percent rate increase
from Blue Cross.  The result?  They can't afford their health-care
plans so they are hoping state taxpayers will pick up the tab.
<P>
Not all groups appear to be sold on the negative consequences
of such mandates.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
for example, is crafting model state legislation that advances
the implementation of these failed reforms.  According to a recent
draft of the legislation (called the Small Employer and Individual
Health Insurance Availability Act), community rating and guaranteed
issue will be a part of the model act that is supposed to provide
guidance to states.
<P>
Interestingly, the NAIC's draft bill notes that &quot;this act
is not intended to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem
of affordability of health care or health insurance.&quot;
<P>
In the state of Washington, the legislature repealed an entire
health-care reform act due to the market perversions and impact
it had on state policy holders and taxpayers.
<P>
In other states, market-based reforms such as medical savings
accounts - which allow smaller enterprises to pool for insurance
purchases - and state risk pools to capture those who may be uninsured
are the wave of the future.  To date, 30 states have adopted state
risk pools, and 15 have enacted medical savings account legislation.
<P>
Even Washington, D.C., has gotten the message - no heavy-handed
reform bills coming from this Congress.  The primary reform measures
coming from the new Congress are medical savings accounts, purchasing
pools for small employers and the self-employed, the move toward
tax equity for entrepreneurs to allow laid-off employees to keep
their insurance.
<P>
Elected officials at both the state and national level appear
to be listening to their constituents and those who favor market-based
solutions in health-care reform.  But one wonders, will the NAIC
actually have an audience when it comes to presenting its solutions
- after it's finalized the model bill for making health-care more
&quot;available?&quot;

</B></CENTER>
<P>
Meet Michela Alioto (D), one of the heirs to the
AFL-CIO's
$35 million "windfall"
from American workers that union bosses are using in their effort
to buy back Congress.  With the help of this special "education
fund",
Alioto (D) is mounting a serious challenge to Representative Frank
Riggs (R), who currently represents California's
first congressional district.
<P>
According to FEC reports filed between January and
June, 1996, Alioto (D) has received $74,125.00 in campaign contributions
from organized labor.  Describing the diversity of her contributor
base, Alioto said,<i> "To
be perfectly honest, we had labor and that was it."</i>
 She further candidly asserted that she is "very
proud of that, and <U>will never forget it</u>."
<P>
Should she unseat Riggs (R) on November 5, these
will no doubt be words for her to live by in the 105th Congress.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<CENTER><B>Contempt for New York Union<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The New York Sheet Metal Workers Local 28 has tried
for 25 years to blame its abysmal record of race discrimination
on everyone but itself.  The U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept
any more excuses and let stand a contempt of court citation. 
The union once again is ordered to stop discriminating against
minorities and to satisfy a court decree of reaching a goal of
29.23% minority membership.
<P>
The case stems from a suit filed by the federal government
in 1971 charging that the union discriminated against blacks and
Hispanics seeking union membership.  Minorities made up only 3
percent of the membership by 1974.  After constant legal challenges,
the union is currently subject to the order to raise minority
membership.
<P>
Over the past quarter century, the union has dragged
its feet and already been cited for contempt.  It has sought to
blame employers, the courts and the law itself for its failure
to provide equal opportunity.
<P>
As the national union bosses seek to portray the
labor movement as the champion of workers, once again we see that
that their own house is not in order. <BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<CENTER><I><B>In Style for 1996:</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The Union Yes-Man<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
For years unions have spent heavily on public relations
to promote its slogan, "Union
Yes."
 This year the AFL-CIO is sinking up to $500,000,000 dollars into
its effort to buy back control of government.
<P>
In addition to buying up television time and traveling
door-to-door, the unions have unveiled a fresh crop of political
candidates who are taking the union money in their run for public
office.
<P>
Inside-the-beltway political pundits are calling
these challengers "Union
Yes-Men."
<P>
How does a Union Yes-Man stand out from the rest
of the pack.  The following "test"
is provided by an avid reader of <I>Labor Watch</I>:<BR>
<P>
If your army of campaign "volunteers"
all have Washington D.C. license plates, you might be a Union
Yes-Man.
<P>
If the phrase, "Pardon me," is a campaign payback, not a Miss Manners' nicety, you might be a Union Yes-Man.
<P>
If you plan to dress up as a "ghost
employee"
for Halloween, you might be a Union Yes-Man.<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<CENTER><B>No, We Mean Other Oppressive Employers!<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
When it comes to watching out for the rights of workers,
AFL-CIO has a glaring blind spot-
its own employees!  The labor federation is under severe criticism
for forcing its "Union
Summer"
workers to put in excessive <U>unpaid</U> overtime.
<P>
In a complaint to the Department of Labor, Rep. Cass
Ballenger (R-NC) demanded an investigation into reports that participants
were given a weekly stipend of $210 and free housing and required
to put in 12-hour days.  The Workforce Protections subcommittee
chairman calculated that at least one participant apparently receive
an hourly wage of $2.76, without any overtime premium,
when the minimum wage was $4.25 an hour.
<P>
A response from the Labor Department may come soon,
but the union reaction to the charges was immediate.  
<P>
Deborah Dugan of the AFL-CIO in response to the charges
remarked, "We
feel very confident that we complied with the relevant laws,"
<I>The Washington Times</I> reported.
<P>
Why do union leaders always appear so defensive when
the Labor Department goes after them?<BR>

<P>
Michael Petyo, a Republican challenger running against incumbent
Rep. Peter Visclosky in Indiana, is proud of his union family
heritage.  His letterhead boldly states his credentials,
"Businessman,Union Man, Veteran."
<P>
But labor leaders have turned on Petyo, by distributing his positions
on issues that he says he was never contacted about.  In fact,
Petyo supports 7 of the 8 positions that the AFL-CIO claims he
opposes in their "voter"
guide.
<P>
Here is the text of a letter sent to Jerry T. Payne, Secretary
Treasury of the Committee on Political Education, Indiana AFL-CIO:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Per our conversation by phone this morning, please understand
that I am VERY disappointed that my brothers in the AFL-CIO would
choose to do something as irresponsible as to report my positions
on union issues incorrectly.  Saying you assumed negative responses
because I failed to send in a survey I never got is beyond insulting.
 This is particularly true in light of your "voter"
guide claim that "all
information contained [was] obtained from press releases, surveys,
and questionnaires."
 I consider this to be a small time, underhanded way to operate.
 I expect and demand more from my union brothers and especially
from my leadership.</I>
<P>
<I>As I said, my campaign received no survey.  Further, if I had,
I certainly would have responded quite differently from the false
information being sent out by the AFL-CIO about me.  I am a member
of Carpenter's Local
1005 out of Hobart, Indiana.  My son is also a member of 1005.
 My wife is a member of Foodserver's
Local 1 out of Chicago, Illinois.  My family is a union family.
 You have attacked something that I have worked to instill in
my family.</I>
<P>
<I>I can not begin to try to understand nor explain to my family,
my friends, my neighbors, my fellow workers, and others why my
own union brothers and sisters would want to publish such outright
lies about me.  I am at a loss with what to do or say.  Your actions
in printing <B>Stand Up: For Indiana's
Working Families: AFL-CIO Voter Guide by Issues</B> were absolutely
wrong.</I>
<P>
<I>John Sweeney said to me as a union man that weneed to support
our own.  As a union man, I agreed with him and decided it was
time to get one of our own elected.  As a union man, I feel my
working brothers and sisters should know the truth about both
me and my campaign.  I believe that this entire affair is a contrived
inaccuracy.</I>
<P>
<I>I expect to see from my union leadership a public retraction
of these statements.  I look forward to them showing their support
for one of their own.</I>
<P>
<I>God Bless You and thank you in advance for your help in correcting
this injustice.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In a letter to Petyo, the AFL-CIO representative Payne writes:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Our record indicated, prior to receiving your fax today, that
you had NOT responded in writing to our questionnaire.  Therefore
we assumed you were opposed to the issues or else you simply did
not wish to have a written record of where you stand on the issues.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
If Petyo was a Democrat, we have to assume that they would of,
in fact, supported one of their own.<BR>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
Striking workers continue to picket at the Frontier Hotel in Las
Vegas, Nevada in what is currently the longest strike in the United
States. Over 500 workers walked off the job on September 21, 1991
because the hotel was seeking a contract with terms different
from the pact agreed to by other Strip hotels.
<P>
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, Richard Trumka, during his annual
visit to the strike, said that the strikers "are
teaching workers of America what solidarity is all about."
 Trumka also boasts that during the strike, not one striker has
crossed the picket line and that they have maintained pickets
24 hours a day.  
<P>
Striker Stats: Strikers have been receiving three meals a day
(free); 101 babies have been born to strikers, and union leaders
have encouraged other union members to participate in the strike
when visiting Las Vegas.
<P>
Anyone care to wager an end date to this strike?<BR>

<CENTER><B>LIUNA PAC Money Flows Freely to Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Labor union leaders are "betting
the House" that Democrats
take control of Congress next year.  Their $35 million-dollar
ad campaign is augmented by over $40 million in PAC contributions.
<P>
  The Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA) 
(the topic of many <I>Labor Watch </I>articles dealing with its
ties to organized crime and its relationship to the White House)
is feeding the campaign
coiffeurs of 209 Democrats through its PAC, the Laborers Political
League.  To date, $750,000 of the PAC money has made its way to
Democrat incumbents and challengers to vulnerable Republicans
this election cycle.
<P>
Countless LIUNA officials have been convicted of state and federal
offenses during the past 20 years.  And, LIUNA has been described
as a "union with clear
ties to organized crime"
by New York's Organized
Crime Task Force and the President's
Commission on Organized Crime.  
<P>
In 1994, a Justice Department report stated that: "LIUNA
has been infiltrated at all levels by corrupt individuals and
organized crime figures who have exploited their control and influence
over the union for personal gain and to the detriment of the union.
 LIUNA union officers and employees at all levels, including the
general presidency, have been chosen, subject to the approval
of, and have been controlled by, various members and associates
of organized crime."
<P>
Recently, questions have been posed by the media and legal experts
regarding Arthur Coia's
(head of LIUNA) friendship with President Clinton and the First
Lady, and whether the Justice Department is giving LIUNA favorable
treatment because of Coia's
personal ties to the Clintons.
<P>
The legal cloud over LIUNA has not stopped  Democrats from taking
LPL's money.  
<P>
In the House, Laborers Political League money is being doled out
to key Democrats in the leadership, and those ranking members
who would chair committees if the Democrats take control of Congress
next year.  
<P>
Here is a list of those Democrats and the amount of money recieved
(so far) from the Laborers Political League in 1996:<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Democrat  Position  Laborers $ $ $ $</FONT></B>
<P>
Dick Gephardt Minority Leader $9,000
<P>
David Bonior  Minority Whip $10,000
<P>
Martin Frost  DCCC Chairman $10,000
<P>
David Obey  Appropriations $6,500
<P>
Martin Sabo  Budget  $3,000
<P>

<P>
John LaFalce  Small Business $2,000
<P>
James Oberstar Transportation $7,000
<P>
Charlie Rangel Ways and Means $7,000 <BR>

<P>
What type of Return of Investment will LIUNA get for its generosity?
 Good question.  Too bad the media isn't
paying attention.

<B>Christmas in October<BR>
</B>
<P>
October 3, 1996 will go down in the history books as a red letter day in the struggle to break free of the shackles of reactionary union leaders and their congressional lackeys.  On this day, the Senate broke the Kennedy fillibuster over a labor provision in the transportation bill, and the Labor Department erased its illicit and illegal striker replacement regulations.
<P>
The Kennedy fillibuster was designed to prevent a technical correction which would have clarified that Federal Express has always been, and shall continue to be, covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  Under the RLA, unions must organize all workers of a company in a nationwide system.  Union organizers have been trying to ignore that law and organize smaller portions of FedEx under the rival National Labor Relations Act.
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board has been considering this issue for almost five years.  Now that the AFL-CIO controls a majority of the votes on the Board, including the vote of former Kennedy staffer Sarah M. Fox, the agency was poised to reverse the law to favor the unions.
<P>
Also, on October 3, the Labor Department officially nullified regulations implementing the striker replacement executive order.  That order was blocked by a federal appeals court as an unlawful power grab by the President.
<P>
While the nullification of the rules closes the official book on this sordid story of special interest pandering, the theme remains alive in the Democrat platform for 1996.  That document states:  "We support the President's actions to stop the government from procuring goods and services from companies that [hire permanent replacements]."  The action, though deemed illegal by the courts, is still supported by the President and his side-kicks John Sweeney, Dick Gephardt, and Tom Daschle.
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Psst, the Law is Still the Law<BR>
</B>
<P>
Leave the Sweeney/Clinton Labor Board out of the case and the law remains the law.  In other words, a federal appeals court recently ruled that arbitrators still do not have the power to stick union contracts onto nonunion employers.
<P>
In the case involving Zcon Builders in California, the court upheld  long-standing precedent recognizing the separateness of different subsidiaries.  The union claimed that a nonunion firm was the alter ego of a unionized company, and sought to enforce its collective bargaining agreement against both.  An arbitrator issued an award of back pay against both firms, thus assuming power to act against the company that never signed the contract.  The appeals court rejected this power grab, ruling the arbitrator overstepped his authority.
<P>
The case is significant as a reaffirmation of the legitimate practice of double breasting, where businesses operate both union and nonunion subsidiaries.  It is symbolic because it comes only four months after the Sweeny/Clinton Labor Board issued its most pro-union decision to date on this or any other topic.  In the Board's Manganaro decision, reported in Labor Watch (5/17/96), the union activists on the Board ignored past precedent and ruled that unions can force contracts on nonunion subsidiaries.  The decision opened the door for imposing union membership and dues onto nonunion workers without a secret ballot election.
<P>
The good news is that the AFL-CIO policy machine has not yet annexed the federal courts.  Whether the NLRB can return to  neutral ground remains to be seen.
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Corporate Campaign Against Bridgestone/Firestone Hits the Information Superhighway<BR>
</B>
<P>
The United Steel Workers have expanded the venue of their corporate campaign against Bridgestone/Firestone from the traditional picket activities at subsidiary companies to the Internet.  The union's new world wide web site asks "cyber protesters" to send pro-union messages to the company.
<P>
Several municipal bodies, retailers and other companies have boycotted products and services of Bridgestone/Firestone.  Saturn reportedly is replacing Firestone Tires with another brand on all new cars at customers' request.
<P>
Despite the two year strike and corporate campaign, Bridgestone officials report that the company has maintained record sales and round the clock operations.  Late last month, Bridgestone/Firestone sent recall notices to all remaining strking workers.
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Labor Unions Top List of OSHA Training Grant Recipients<BR>
</B>
<P>
Labor unions have never shied away from the U.S. government money tree, and it seems that green-backs are ripe for the picking from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  OSHA will disburse over $2 million in training grants to 26 non-profit groups to fund training  and research programs, with emphasis on ergonomics, back injury prevention, and safety and health programs.
<P>
Labor unions can expect to receive over one million dollars of the grant money.

<B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>On September 1, 1996, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney wrote an op-ed in <I>The Washington Times</I> defending
the union's use of members dues to subsidize political activities.
 On September 10, a union member responded.  Here is a brief excerpt
from the letter:
<P>
<i>As a member of an AFL-CIO-affiliated union,
I found John Sweeney's Commentary article (&quot;Debating the
AFL-CIO's Campaign Role:  Resource Allocation,&quot;- Sep. 1)
misleading and untruthful.</I>
<P>
<dd>Mr. Sweeney errs by stating that &quot;no
individual is ever forced to pay the pennies it costs each month
for his or her union's political activities.&quot;  While the
assessed amount for the &quot;grass-roots action and advertising
in the media&quot; he speaks of are small, not all unions are
complying with federal law prohibiting the use of dues for political
purposes.  I demanded a refund from the national president of
my union;  he refused to even consider this, claiming it would
jeopardize the union's standing with the AFL-CIO.  Thus, Mr. Sweeney's
claim is a lie.  While the individual amount of money may be small,
the principle being violated is not. 
<P>
<dd>...Four years of Clinton/Gore has been too
much.  This union member will be voting for Dole/Kemp this fall
because the Democrats have nothing to offer but higher taxes,
fear, misery and less freedom.  Mr. Sweeney is another power-grabbing
liberal, like the man he supports for the White House this fall.

<B>Clinton Administration Finally
Gives Up On Its Illegal Power Grab<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>As<I> Labor Watch</I> reader's recall, on
March 8, 1995, President Clinton issued an executive order to
bar the government from contracting with companies that fire and
permanently replace their striking workers.  The order applied
to contracts over $100,000.
<P>
<dd>The President was temporarily blocked by a
federal judge, and a federal appeals court unanimously overturned
his order on February 2, 1996.  The judge in the case said that
Clinton's actions violated federal labor law &quot;which guarantees
the right to hire permanent replacements.&quot;  They also called
the administration's arguments &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;far-fetched.&quot;
 The President's order would have covered federal government contracts
totaling $437 billion or 6.5% of GNP.
<P>
<dd>According to the senior counsel at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce -- one of the parties that filed suit against
the order -- the decision &quot;means that when federal labor
law grants a business a certain right, the President can't just
come in and take it away by executive fiat.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<dd>The Administration decided this week not to
take the case to the Supreme Court, but Labor Secretary Robert
Reich loyally defended the President's action even though the
order was viewed as &quot;far-reaching&quot; by the courts.<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Mini Task Force on Health Care
Reform<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>All systems are &quot;GO&quot; for the Clinton
Administration's push for guaranteed (government-run) universal
health care coverage.  The President has tapped Secretaries Robert
B. Reich of Labor and Donna Shalala of Health &amp; Human Services
to lead the National Commission on Health Care Quality.  Membership
of the advisory panel is expected to include labor union leaders
and representatives from the health, insurance and &quot;business&quot;
communities.  The Commission, among other things, will &quot;study
the need for consumer protections, guarantee quality of care,
and assure access to health care services.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Reich and Shalala replace the dynamic duo,
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and guru Ira Magaziner, whose
failed top-to-bottom health care reform is credited as a key reason
why Democrats where voted out of Congress in 1994.  With labor
unions and the left elated with the new commission, it is projected
that the Reich-Shalala proposals will be reminiscent of the old
Clinton-health care plan.  Even with the passage of Kennedy-Kassebaum,
President Clinton's &quot;business agenda&quot; in his second
term, if reelected ,will focus heavily on health care reform.
<P>
Is it too early to dust off Harry and Louise?
<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Chicken Little<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich's nationwide
sweatshop sweep recently took him to DeCoster Egg Farm in Turner,
Maine.  With a media cadre and state Democrat legislators in tow,
the U.S. Department of Labor's investigation into housing and
labor violations resulted in a $3.6 million fine against the company.
<P>
<dd>DeCoster Egg Farms is no small-time closet
operations.  It is the town's biggest taxpayer and employer, with
360 employees.  According to a city official, &quot;The town's
own inspectors had long insured that the egg farm kept up to local
codes.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> However, DeCoster agreed to comply with the
DOL findings, including purchasing new housing for workers.  Unfortunately,
the story does not end here.  The Reich investigation-turned-media
expos&eacute; damaged company sales and tarnished the company's
image - despite quick compliance.
<P>
<dd>The Administration's &quot;reinvention initiatives&quot;
calling for partnerships between government and business to correct
labor violations have proven to be empty promises.  We can expect
the 1996 presidential campaign to showcase  Reich as he conducts
more inappropriate media-laden crackdowns to make the news - 
not a difference -  on companies that supposedly violate labor
laws<BR>

<B>Unhatched and Mobilized - </B>
<br>
<B>Federal Employees Gear Up for '96<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>With more than 3 million federal employees now &quot;unhatched&quot;
to fully participate in partisan political activities if they
want to, President Clinton has unleashed a tremendous political
force than can help him win this November with the liberalization
of the Hatch Act in 1993.  A diversity of interests have long
opposed overhauling the 1939 Hatch Act - a bill that bars federal
workers from participating in various political activities, and
in theory, protects them from political coercion.
<P>
<dd>The main assertion has been that liberalizing the Act would give
more power to unions, and thus Democrats.  Federal union members
who can now attend Chicago as delegates to the Democrat National
Convention have not been shy about sharing what they plan to do
with their new found freedom.  As quoted in <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Post</I> on August 26, Myke Reed of the American Postal Workers
Union (APWU) says, &quot;Surveys showed that 40% of union households
voted Republican in 1994...It's not going to happen again.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) also plans to flex
its partisan muscle.  The NTEU is targeting 39 congressional seats
- those who are &quot;anti-federal employee lawmakers.  The President
of the NTEU is quoted as saying that President Clinton's changes
in the law allow them to &quot;have a real opportunity this time
to influence the outcome of a number of elections.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Mean-Extreme Republicans are at it Again...First
They're Cutting Medicare, Now They're Raiding Pensions<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is encouraging
Democratic candidates to say that Republicans in Congress &quot;voted
to allow corporate raids of employee pension funds&quot; and &quot;voted
to allow companies to take the money without informing their employees
or retirees.&quot;
<P>
<dd>According a survey conducted by Stan Greenberg (oh great health
care pollster for President Clinton), the pension message tested
by him is the strongest campaign weapon yet.  A memo from the
DCCC states, &quot;The pension raids are the strongest reason
to vote against a GOP Member of Congress this fall.&quot;  The
second strongest message is &quot;Cutting medicare to pay for
tax cuts for the wealthy.&quot;  
<P>
<dd>Both claims are false, but truth has nothing to do with labor
leaders wanting a Democrat Congress next  year.  The AFL-CIO is
running ads pushing both messages.
<P>
<dd>In the DCCC memo, there is no mention of the specific &quot;pension
raid&quot; legislation to back up their claims for candidates.
 For the record, the Republican Reconciliation Bill eased the
tax burden for businesses which chose to use excess pension funds
above 125% of current pension liability for other business/economic
activity.  This minor adjustment to the tax law is &quot;the big
pension raid&quot; labor unions refer to in their rhetoric, and
in their multi-million dollar ad campaigns.  The change in law
simply encourages businesses to reinvest excess pension funds
into the company to create more opportunities for their workers.

<B>Media Reality Check -</B>
<B> Union Dominance of the Democrat Party<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>Most news surveys have found that union members made up approximately
34% of delegates to the Democrat convention - a figure kindly
passed over as trivial matter.  
<P>
<dd>According to the Media Research Center in its daily coverage of
media reporting on the convention, the media has reported that
union members dominate the delegate count in Chicago, but they
have failed to raise questions concerning &quot;who controls the
party.&quot;   The Center's <I>Media Reality Check '96</I> reports,
&quot;Only 21% of GOP delegates said they were part of the religious
right, but in San Diego, CBS worried about their having too much
influence.  On Sunday, August 11, Face the Nation guest gave five
ominous questions.&quot;  But television guests in Chicago have
not been asked similar questions about control of the Democrat
party relative to union influence. 
<P>
<dd> Here are the number of delegates that the major unions sent to
Chicago:  the AFL-CIO sent 811 delegates to the Democrat National
Convention; National Education Association sent over 400 delegates;
and the American Federation of Teachers sent 150 delegates.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The National Right to Work Committee mounted a challenge to organized
labor's $35 million campaign against Republican members of Congress
up for re-election by kicking off a national campaign called &quot;Operation
Liberty Bell.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> The National Right to Work Committee campaign will inform workers
of their <U>Beck </U>right to a refund of the portion of their
union dues that is used for purposes other than collective bargaining
- for example, political campaigns and lobbying activities.
<P>
<dd>An April 1996 Frank Luntz and Associates poll found that 62% of
union members opposed the use of their dues for negative political

their dues; and 78% did not know they could file a form to stop
payment of their dues for political purposes.

<b>Education Lobby Shifts Political Strategy --<br>
NEA Has New Presence at GOP Convention</b>
<p>
<dd>While the bulk of the education lobby's PAC money is dedicated to electing Democrats, the National Education Association ( NEA) claims that the '94 elections were a "wake-up call" that required their presence at the GOP convention in San Diego.
<p>
<dd>According to a new poll of NEA members, the union found that its rank-and-file is evenly split in its political affiliation -- one-third are Republicans, one-third are Democrats, and one-third are Independents. The poll also reports that union members feel that the NEA is too partisan.
<p>
<dd>Accordingly, the NEA held several events with Republicans this week at the Convention -- in order to build bridges.
<p>
<dd>A recent report showed that close to 99% of the NEA's political action funds are directed to Democrats, but nonetheless, the education lobby claims that they will not try to elect Democrats "but a pro-education majority."
<p>
<dd>There 34 NEA delegates to the GOP convention and the Republican Mainstream Coalition (liberal Republicans) hosted an event to discuss how to avoid "cuts in education." Republican members of Congress speaking at the program included Senator James Jeffords, and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and Jim Leach.
<p>
<dd>NEA president-elect Bob Chase says he came to San Diego in search of "common ground" -- but GOP insiders say the teacher's lobby can first begin with common sense, by ending their political attacks on Republicans.
<p>
<a name="reversal"></a>
<b>A Reversal of Fortune</b>
<p>
<dd>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was forced to practice-what-it-preaches, in a reverse discrimination suit against the Commission from an EEOC employee. A federal district court recently sided with the plaintiff, a white-male attorney for the EEOC, who charged that he was denied promotions 10 times between 1984-1992.
<p>
<dd>The EEOC and Justice Department continue to remain tight-lipped on the case. The plaintiff received outstanding job performance appraisals in addition to receiving certification from a management training course during his long tenure at the Commission. The federal district court awarded the plaintiff $150,000 in damages and $300,000 in back pay.
<p>
<dd>The EEOC initiates discrimination suits against employers, but was reminded in court that, "Federal agencies such as defendant EEOC are under a particularly compelling mandate to adhere strictly to the requirements of Title VII."
<p>
<a name="objectors"></a>
<b>Conscientious Objectors Have Rights, Too</b>
<p>
<dd>A public sector union must accommodate the religious beliefs of a Roman Catholic worker who opposes union stances on social issues, a U.S. District Court judge ruled earlier this month. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) must allow the union member to donate to charity, an amount equal to his mandatory union fees, so that he does not inadvertently contribute to causes he objects to on moral or religious grounds.
<p>
<dd>The worker objected to positions taken by the union on abortion and the death penalty, and also to "supporting an organization (AFSCME) that champion theses issues," according to the judge. Not only was the union ordered to allow the worker to pay an amount equal to his union fees to an "agreed upon" charitable organization, but it was ordered to refund his fees from 1991.
<p>
<a name="overhaul"></a>
<b>Time to Overhaul the NLRB</b>
<p>
<dd>The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new report documenting the bias of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law. The report also outlines reform measures to move both labor law and the NLRB into the 21 st century.
<p>
<dd>According to the study entitled "Time to Overhaul Labor Law and the NLRB," the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the extreme  blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently reversed by the courts who hear such cases. In addition, current NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -- an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial arbritor of labor law.

<CENTER>Union Money Well Spent - New Board's Decision Advances
Labor Agenda<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<P>
A new Administrative Review Board set up by Labor Secretary Reich
in June, has expanded the Davis-Bacon Act to include more workers.
 The Davis-Bacon Act requires government-determined prevailing
wages be paid to workers on taxpayer-funded construction projects.
<P>
Specifically, the panel ruled that <U>suppliers</U> to a federally-funded
construction project also must pay Davis-Bacon wages to their
workers even though those workers do not work at the construction
site.  In reaching its decision, the Review Board had to reverse
the decision of an administrative law judge, and evade a 1994
federal circuit court ruling that exempted off-site work from
the payment of &quot;prevailing wages.&quot;  
<P>
In this case, Bechtel Constructors was getting the raw materials
it needed (for a federal construction project) from a quarry which
did not pay prevailing wages to the quarry workers.  They must
now pay these workers back wages in accordance with the Davis-Bacon
Act.
<P>
 One ironic feature of the case is that the defendant, Bechtel
Constructors, is a big beneficiary of the Davis-Bacon Act and
opposes its repeal.   Building trade unions, which have contributed
heavily to congressional Democrats and to the Clinton-Gore campaign,
have long sought this specific change in the way the Labor Department
administers the Davis-Bacon Act.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<CENTER><B>There He Goes Again<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) should have greater
powers to penalize employers, according to its chairman, William
B. Gould.  In the same breath, the chairman then criticized the
Republican Congress for seeking to &quot;emasculate&quot; his
agency by threatening budget cuts.
<P>
Chairman Gould has never missed an opportunity to express his
view that labor laws should be tilted in favor of unions.  His
speech this week to the California Labor Federation was no exception.
 But the union theme of Republican bashing was an added feature.
 Gould was effusive in his expression of thanks to California
labor bosses and Democrats for their efforts to protect his budget
and their agenda.
<P>
Most Board watchers agree that members should not criticize the
very law they are sworn to uphold.  Chairman Gould has consistently
flaunted this rule of professionalism and decorum.  His partisan
attacks also continue to destroy any pretext of impartiality.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<CENTER><B>Non-Union Hotels and Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
A major Chicago labor union is upset that the Democrats have included
three nonunion hotels on the list of &quot;Democrat National Convention
Hotels&quot; for next month's big convention, <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Times</I> reports.  The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees'
Chicago local had issued a list of nonunion establishments to
be shunned at the convention, and apparently Democrat planners
were compelled to ignore the union directive due to a shortage
of room space.
<P>
The Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) recently conferred
official convention status upon two Marriott Hotels and  Swisshotel.
 Marriott hotels have long been prominent on every union blacklist
because its staff refuses to unionize.
<P>
Although Bill Clinton and Al Gore plan to patronize a union hotel
for the convention, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
are stunned and appalled at the DNCC's decision.  <BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<CENTER><B>Bond Assails Clinton Veto of TEAM Act<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
As expected, President Clinton vetoed the Teamwork for Employment
and Management (TEAM) Act, and one U.S. Senator took Clinton's
action to task. 
<P>
 Senator Kit Bond, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business,
said that political pandering by the President on behalf of organized
labor played a major role in Clinton's decision to veto the TEAM
act.
<P>
Bond said an alarming pattern had developed.  &quot;President
Clinton's message to small business is 'get to the back of the
line; what labor wants, labor gets,' &quot; he said.
<P>
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
to allow employees and managers at nonunion companies to resolve
workplace issues such as scheduling, safety and health, and even
things like free coffee and company softball teams.  The legislation
would not allow employee teams to act as unions since they could
not engage in collective bargaining or act as exclusive representatives
of employees.
<P>
&quot;Opponents and even some misguided individuals in the news
media have claimed that the TEAM Act would allow 'company dominated
unions,' an assertion that is absolutely false,' &quot; said Senator
Bond.  
<P>
Once again, President Clinton has proven that the only &quot;team&quot;
he'll play on is organized labor.<BR>

<b>D.C. Labor Unions Derail Health Clinic for At-Risk Residents</b><br>

The July 1 edition of <i>The Washington Post</i> reports that labor unions representing District of Columbia health workers have halted efforts to open a health clinic for low-income residents of the North Capitol Street area of Washington, D.C.
<p>
After hearing many complaints about the shoddy treatment at her neighborhood clinic, community activist Alverta Munlyn decided that her neighbors would benefit if they, along with private and public organizations, came together to operate the city's nearby faltering clinic.  Munlyn also figured out that the new clinic would save the financially-strapped city $700,000 initially, and $1.3 million annually in subsequent years.
<p>
Munlyn convinced Providence Hospital to manage the clinic, Georgetown University to provide the doctors; public health officials to close the faltering clinic to subsidize hers; and finally, Munlyn persuaded Mayor Marion Barry to support her efforts.
<p>
But then the labor unions stepped in. Labor leaders -- fearful that labor infested hospitals would close if too many low-income residents chose private clinics -- believe that the city's poor should be cared for through a network of union-supported services. And now, city officials who once proclaimed the clinic as the perfect model for public-private partnership, have backed off from their earlier endorsements and offer weak reassurances that Munlyn's idea will be achieved.
<p>
D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), outraged at the union's narrow position, says that labor unions should put their "interests aside for the better interest of the community."
<p>
But, the labor unions have not backed-off, putting their interests above the low-income residents in the District of Columbia. <i>Labor Watch</i> concludes that when labor leaders talk about universal health care for all, they only approve of such services when the jobs and money are fimnelled through them.
<p><br><b>
<a name="detroit">
If the Sweeney/Clinton Board Thinks It's Bad, It Must Be Awful
</b><br>
What is black and white, and walked all over? The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) settlement agreement with striking unions at the <i>Detroit News</i> and the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>.
<p>
Fed up with picket line misconduct, the NLRB is threatening Detroit's striking newspaper unions with a court injunction if the misconduct is not ended. Earlier in the labor dispute, the NLRB reached an "informal" settlement with the striking unions in which the "unions pledged not to block entrances to the newspaper's property, threaten or coerce replacement workers or employees who have crossed the picket lines, or engage in other strike misconduct." According to the Board's Detroit Regional Office, the agreement was breached "almost as the ink was drying." Unions however deny involvement in picket line misconduct, and say the violence is caused by the newspaper's private security.
<p>
The NLRB is currently seeking a "formal" settlement with the unions. If broken, the unions would be forced to end the misconduct and could force fines and other penalties.
<p><br><b>

<a name="love">
Labor-loving Republicans Snubbed by Labor
</b><br>
A two-term, labor-loving Republican will not receive the '96 endorsement of local labor leaders as he did in 1994.
<p>
But maybe someone forgot to tell Rep. Jack Quinn (R-NY) that he's not a Democrat. Nope -- Sorry! Buffalo Labor Relations Council President John Kaczorowski did in fact remind Quinn of his party status.
<p>
According to a July 15 article in <i>The Washington Times</i>, Kaczorowski said, "We even told him if he were a Democrat he wouldn't be having this problem." The Labor Council has endorsed Quinn's opponent -- a Democrat -- even though Quinn voted against NAFTA, against the TEAM Act, led the fight for the Family and Medical Leave Act, and authored the bill in the House to hike the minimum wage.
<p>
Quinn is appealing the local decision to the state AFL-CIO, but it looks bleak for a reversal. According to the state director, overturning the decision remains questionable. "Basically we don't feel that the labor agenda has progressed much this year," she said. The state AFL-CIO will announce their endorsements mid-September.
<p><br><b>
<a name="team">
Teamsters Will Be Teamsters
</b><br>
The Teamster's nominating convention at the Philadelphia Convention center was disrupted early on by shouts, jeers and rude chants by supporters of James Hoffa, the challenger to incumbent president Ron Carey. Carey's detractors claim that he has taken power from the locals, denied democratic process to reform-minded Teamsters, and drained the union's finances. At the convention, Carey refused to allow anyone to speak in opposition to his appointment of 120 unelected delegates. A voice vote on the issue was held, and Carey declared victory despite an apparent majonty of opposing votes. He ignored calls for a stand-up vote, and pandemonium ensued.
<p>
The booing, cheers, and catcalls drowned out the Pledge of Allegiance, Carey's speech, and those of everyone else who came to the podium with the exception of Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua's invocation. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) was invited to speak, but both his introduction by Carey and the Senator's attempted remarks were overpowered by the anarchy. Afler delivering a scathing criticism of the Teamsters' behavior, Specter left in disgust. When asked whether the day's disruption had discredited the union, one official responded, "We're Teamsters, we're not choir boys."

 <center><h2>Right-to-Work Law Goes Down in Senate</h2></center><p>
Twenty-one states have right-to-work rules, but the Senate didn't come close to applying the law nationwide.  The law would bar union contracts from requiring nonmembers to pay dues as a condition of employment.<p>
Sounding like a limited government type-of-guy, Senator Ted Kennedy used the following rationale in leading the charge to kill the bill.  He said:<p>
We do not want the long arm of the federal government interfering with the legitimate interests of the states.<p>

 <center><h2>Clinton: Not a TEAM Player</center></h2><p>

The Teamwork for Employees and Management (TEAM) Act was approved by the Senate (53 to 46) yesterday, with identical legislation overwhelmingly approved by the House last year.  <p>
But don't expect the President to sign the legislation even though he touts the concept of teamwork in the workplace. Organized labor deeply opposes the measure, and surely Clinton will veto it. <p> 
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Act to permit teams composed of employees and employers in nonunion settings to address mutual concerns in the workplace including scheduling, work assignments, health and safety issues, training, job descriptions and work rules.<p>
Clinton portrayed the TEAM Act as a vehicle for company-dominated unions to suppress workers and undermine employees rights to elect their own representatives.<p>
Many businesses have abandoned the workplace teams practice in fear that they may become the target of a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) complaint, with the Board ruling against them as they have with several companies.<p>
The only TEAM Clinton is on these days is big labor.  Another election-year payoff appears to be in the works.<p>

<center><h2> Labor Chat</center></h2><p>

A chatroom on the Internet found some rank-and-file members disillusioned with their former union.
In this case, former members of the Wisconsin State Employees Union were lamenting about the AFSCME (American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) judicial process.  Not happy with how their local union was operating, a union member thought AFSCME could help.  
According to the former union member:<p>
Anyone that's gone through AFSCME 'judicial process' knows it's essentially a political process designed to suppress union democracy.  That's true for the labor movement, and which is part of the reason there's only about a 16% national union membership.  Think about it: Who wants to pay dues to be suppressed?
Good question - and one which more union members are asking.<p>

 <center><h2>Another One Bites the Dust, Part III</center></h2><p>
Another union boss being ousted for corruption may sound like just another ho-hum story, but its big news for the 26,000 members of the Carpenters District Council in New York.<p>
The union took action against the local leadership after discovering well documented ties between several New York crime families and district council leaders, the preferential treatment of individuals tied to crime families at the expense of rank-and-file members, the use of union funds to pay the legal costs of defending council leaders against charges of corruption and the misuse of members benefit funds.<p>
One of the ousted leaders, Council President Frederick W. Devine, succeeded Paschall McGuinnes who is the current secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department.  Devine, who was earning $360,000 a year, allowed preferential hiring for mob-tied workers at a major New York City construction project, and attempted to establish a labor-management cooperation fund that would have paid him an additional $175,000.<p>

 <center><h2>An Inspector In Every Worksite</center></h2><p>

As reported in past editions of Labor Watch, the  Labor Party was founded in Cleveland, Ohio June 6 - 9.  Labor Watch promised to bring you more platform highlights that define the agenda of the new party.  In platform item #15, the Labor Party calls for an increase in the number of worksite inspections as well as the placement of in-house inspectors in all workplaces.  <p>
The platform reads:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>For starters, we need the right to act and to enforce any and all safety and health regulations.
We call for national legislation to train and deputize workers to be on the job inspectors in each and every workplace.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should be protected against corporate harassment and discrimination and should be able to do their job without fear of reprisal.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should have the power to shut down hazardous operations; enforce the right of every worker to refuse unsafe work;should have the power to investigate incidents to uncover their root cause; and to force the implementation of their findings.<p>
</i><ul><p>
In other words, the Labor Party is simply calling on business owners to allow the government and unions total management control of their operations.<p>

<P>
<a name="one"></a>
<B><i>The NLRB <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> Unabashed
Advocate for Big Labor<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Here is the ultimate proof that Organized Labor has received what
it paid for <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> a National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) that will satisfy the union agenda in every
instance.
<P>
Last week, NLRB Chairman Gould cast aside all sense of propriety,
decorum and lip service to impartiality by publicly denouncing
the TEAM Act, a bill to promote workplace cooperation.  Using
such rhetoric terming the bill &quot;classic Republican overkill,&quot;
 while renaming the measure the &quot;Employer Domination Act,&quot;
Gould left the arena of ideas and wholly joined the AFL-CIO propaganda
machine.
<P>
NLRB board members are judges.  The Labor Board is not supposed
to be the policy arm of the Clinton Administration, the Democratic
National Committee, nor the AFL-CIO. Gould has not only chosen
to embroil himself in a major legislative controversy, he's proven
himself an unabashed advocate of big labor rather than an impartial
judge of the law.
<P>
Just last month, as reported in <I>Labor Watch,</I> the Clinton
NLRB reversed long-standing law by giving unions the power to
shut down businesses in their effort to unionize separate companies.
 That case, involving a construction firm, established the new
rule of law that unions are free to strike, harass, and destroy
companies with which they have no bargaining relationship, so
long as the unions claim they are entitled to the type of work
in question; i.e., as part of a work preservation effort.
<P>
As Bill Gould showed last week, what John Sweeney and labor leaders
want from the NLRB, John Sweeney and the labor leaders get.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"> </a>
<i><B>Proposed Legislation Strengthens Beck Decision
<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Workers will have a right to know how labor leaders spend their
union dues under new legislation introduced by House Republicans.
 The Worker Right To Know Act, H.R. 3580, strengthens provisions
under the <I>Beck</I> decision, which allows workers to obtain
a rebate of the portion of their dues not related to collective
bargaining.
<P>
Key provisions under the Worker Right to Know Act:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT>Require unions to get annual
written authorization from each worker before accepting or demanding
payment of money  not spent for collective bargaining and contract
administration; i.e., for political purposes;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Establish an independent
auditor to determine the percentage of dues money that is spent
on collective bargaining or noncollective bargaining;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Prohibit unions from forcing
workers to join and pay dues as a condition of employment;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Allow workers to participate
in a union without paying the portion of dues that goes towards
non-collective bargaining activities; and
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Require unions to report
annually to the Department of Labor on how dues money is spent.
<P>
AFL-CIO President, John J. Sweeney labeled the new bill as &quot;a
calculated effort to chill our exercise of First Amendment rights
to inform members and the public about attacks this Congress is
leading against working families.&quot;
<P>
In reality, the legislation simply gives workers more protections
and say over how their union dues is spent.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B><i>The Little Theater that Could<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
A small, nonprofit children's theater in New York City could boast
of standing-room-only if not for the fact that the crowds have
been union pickets.  The New Victory Theater on 42nd Street has
been the target of big Broadway unions who are trying to muscle
their way on stage.
<P>
New Victor uses nonunion workers, which helps keep ticket prices
down.  The theater's practice has not received warm reviews from
the labor unions, including ushers, makeup artists, and press
agents.  They fear that potential new neighbor, Disney, will follow
New Victory's lead when they move in down the block.  In the meantime,
the show will go on, union pickets and all.<BR>

<i><B>New Labor Party Imports European Model for Economic
Disaster<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
As reported in the June 6 edition of <I>Labor Watch</I>, a new
American Labor Party met June 6 - 9 in Cleveland, Ohio.  The Labor
Party agreed to 16 principles that they would pursue as part of
their legislative and political agenda.  <I>Labor Watch</I> will
periodically list these principles <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
in this edition, we highlight Principle 6:
<P>
<CENTER>Less Work, More Money<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Labor Party calls for amending the Fair Labor Standards Act
to:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> A 32-hour, 4-day work week
(without loss of pay or benefits).
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Provide a minimum of double-time
pay for all hours worked over 32 hours a week and 8 hours a day.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Forbid compulsory overtime.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> An hour off with pay for
every 2 hours of overtime.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> 20 mandatory paid vacation
days plus all federal holidays.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> One year paid leave for every
7 years of work.
<P>
Together with the Labor Party's call for universal health care,
paid family leave, free child and elder care for all, and a constitutional
requirement that all Americans be guaranteed a job at (a minimum)
of $10 per hour adjusted for inflation <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
they claim these proposals will help create millions of new jobs.

<i><B>Taxpayer Outrage:  Union Officials' Salaries Paid with
</B></i>
<P><i>
<B>Medicare &amp; Social Security Trust Fund Dollars<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
And you thought labor unions were opposed to reforming  Social
Security and Medicare only because they cared about elderly Americans
being tossed onto the mean streets - hah!  The real reason has
recently emerged from scant media reports exposing blatant federal
subsidies to unions.
<P>
According to a June 6 editorial in the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>:
<P>
<I>The practice in question happens at the Social Security Administration.
 The federal agency pays the salaries of employees who work full
time or part time on labor union business.  It pays them from
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which most taxpayers
wrongly assume go exclusively to pay the retirements and health
care of U.S. workers.</I>
<P>
<I>It is all very legal.  Federal law requires it.  In fact, the
law also requires Social Security to provide office space and
administrative support services to its unions.</I>
<P>
According to the editorial, Social Security employees paid $4.8
million in union dues last year.  Still, taxpayers subsidize about
145 full-time and 1800 part-time union officials.  Under Clinton's
tenure (citing <I>Dallas Morning News </I>figures): <I>the amount
spent by Social Security on union business increased 83% to $11
million from 1993 to 1995...The number of employees who worked
full time as union representatives increased 81% during the same
period.</I>
<P>
Of course, the $4.8 million the unions collect in dues could easily
cover union officials' salaries <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
but why bother when the taxpayer is picking up the tab?
<P>
Recent studies show that Medicare will be bankrupt by 2001 and
Social Security by 2029.  And if unions keep pigging-out in their
share of trust fund money by beefing up both part time and full
time union staff, the trust funds will surely be empty sooner
than their anticipated bankruptcy in 2013.<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="two"></a>
<B>Irrational Labor Relations Board<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Once again the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been
slapped down by a federal appeals court for stacking the law against
employers.  The NLRB sought to force employers to hire union activists
who apply for positions that have  access to confidential and
sensitive labor relations information.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB required that an employer must produce objective
evidence showing that an applicant for a confidential job would
be disloyal to the employer.  Union membership or union activities
were not considered sufficient grounds.  The appeals court in
the Seventh Circuit rejected the NLRB position,  explaining that
the rule had &quot;no rational basis,&quot; that it &quot;is not
a <B>rational</B> construction of the Act,&quot; and &quot;requires
an employer to make an almost impossible showing.&quot;
<P>
The case was sent back to the Clinton appointees who no doubt
will make another stab at curtailing employer rights.<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="three"></a>
<B>Big Labor Getting On Democrat's Nerves <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
Columbus Mayor Seeks 'Management Rights'<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
The current Mayor of Columbus, Ohio <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
known throughout his six years in the state Senate as a liberal
Democrat <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> has apparently
had it with Ohio's &quot;obstructionist&quot; collective bargaining
law.  Mayor Michael R. White detailed his frustrations with the
law in a May 20 letter to Senate President Stanley Aronoff, a
Republican from Cincinnati.
<P>
The letter, also sent to Governor George Voinovich, comes as White
has attempted to privatize some city operations, and improve city
services in an effort to save money.  According to the <I>Cleveland
Plain Dealer</I>, White asked the state legislature to change
the 13-year old law.  The letter      contends that the law permitting
government workers to organize &quot;has become a tool of unions&quot;
and has caused the &quot;emasculation of meaningful management
rights.&quot;  White also criticized the State Employment Relations
Board because the collective bargaining law had been distorted
by the board's rulings.
<P>
While conservatives are jubilant over their newfound ally in Mayor
White, union reaction has been bitter.  The head of the Cleveland
Police Patrolemen's Association said, &quot;The guy's got a lot
of nerve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="four"></a>
<B>A Kodak Moment We Wish We Had<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Union summer &quot;Boot Camp&quot; unleashed the new generation
of union activists this week, and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
took an active role in training sessions.
<P>
In Boston, Sweeney role-played a &quot;hostile employer&quot;
with the young activists in order to prepare them for the organizing
campaigns of hospital workers, city employees and laundry workers.
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="five"></a>
<B>Union Rank-and-File vs. Labor Dictators<BR>
</B><i>
<P>
&quot;I've always been taught that unions are a brotherhood. 
To me this is more like the Mafia.  We are not supposed to come
out and use our own heads.  But this is not communism.  You don't
just vote for the party anymore.&quot;

<B>June 6, 1996<BR>
</B>
<P>
<a name="one"></a>
<i><B>An American Labor Party Will be Officially Launched
Early June<BR></i>
</B>
<P>
Some 1200 delegates representing local unions, central labor councils
and national unions will soon meet in Cleveland, Ohio to officially
announce the formation of an American labor party.  While the
name of the party has yet to be decided upon, its agenda and political
strategy has been well conceived.
<P>
The labor party will not endorse candidates (it believes the Democrat
Party has moved too far to the right) or run candidates for office
for several years, but it does intend to be a major political
force on issue advocacy and use the party to &quot;frame the nation's
political debate in terms of class <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
a broad working class against irresponsible, unacceptable corporate
power.&quot;  According to a May 27 article written for <I><B>In
These Times</B></I> (a twice-monthly left-leaning newspaper),
labor party advocates claim that its union supporters now number
over 1 million people <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> or
6% of the labor movement.
<P>
According to the article, the labor party's statements of principle
include the following <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> &quot;a
constitutional right to a job at a living wage; an income stability
fund to protect workers against job dislocation and downsizing
(see <I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> May 10, Issue 12 on New Jersey
proposal); free higher education for all; assurances of basic
social needs (single-payer health care, longer paid vacations,
affordable day care); and shorter work time.&quot;  The principles
also include union dominance in the workplace and &quot;just transition
to a non-polluting economic system and genuine equality of opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Interestingly, the party's chief organizers and advocates say
that they've made a major effort to &quot;minimize the influence
of small sectarian left groups.&quot;
<P>
Lastly, both labor party organizers and the AFL-CIO see their
goals as complimentary as the agenda of the new party is &quot;not
all that different&quot; from the unions.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B><i>Going Postal<BR></i>
</B>
<P>
A new theory behind workplace violence was unveiled at the recent
meeting of the National Academy of Arbitrators <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
and all indications are that attendees may be in need of having
their heads examined.
<P>
Psychologists and unions now attribute incidents of employee violence
to failures in the workplace <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
<U>not</U> &quot;bad people,&quot; or &quot;crazy workers.&quot;
 For example, workplace factors that lead to violence can include
an employee reaction to unbearable workplace stress, such as downsizing
or the interaction with a person, or a situation.
<P>
While unions were quick to pin the blame of this serious issue
directly on human resource managers and employers, they were slow
to provide helpful solutions to the problem.  Unions denounced
the use of preventative measures, such as psychological profiles,
to help identify potentially violent employees.  According to
an official with the public-employee union American Federation
of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), lots of profiles
of violent employees &quot;sound like the profile of a good union
steward.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Teaching Discord<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
At its 1995 convention, the National Education Association (NEA)
again defined itself as one of the leaders of the &quot;Big(ger)
Government Coalition.&quot;  Some of its resolutions include:
<P>
Endorsed single-payer Canadian-style health care;
<P>
Endorsed statehood for the District of Columbia;
<P>
Endorsed Gay and Lesbian History Month;
<P>
Denounced giving parents the right to choose their children's
schools;
<P>
Denounced home-schooling; and
<P>
Denounced a moment of silence in schools.
<P>
The NEA contributed $4.1 million in PAC funds to Democrats between
1993 and 1995.<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a><i>
<B> Stand for Clinton Rally Brings Out the Left<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Unions weren't the only members of the radical fringe working
the crowd at last Saturday's Stand for Children rally.
<P>
Mike Golash stood near the rally stage hawking <U>Challenge</U>,
a publication of the Revolutionary Communist Progressive Labor
Party.  Its headline: &quot;CAPITALISM NO PLACE FOR KIDS.&quot;
<P>
According to a <I><B>Washington Post</B></I> report, Golash said,
&quot;What I hope to see is millions and millions of people warming
to the communist ideals <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
abolishing the wage system, ending racism and sexism, ending child
exploitation.  I see people realizing that we can take power through
revolution from the capitalists, and we can build a new society
based on production for equality, not production for profits.&quot;
<P>
The <I><B>Post</B></I> goes on to quote Golash as saying, &quot;Oh,
in the revolution, most of those people [conservatives] will be
destroyed.  They'll take up arms against us <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
there'll be a war, a civil war.  And they will be, you know, gotten
rid of, basically.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="five"></a><i>
 <B>Minimum Wage Quote<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
&quot;I oppose not only an increase in the starting wage, but
a mandated starting wage period. It represents another death nail
in the coffin of the United States' free enterprise system.&quot;

<blockquote>
<B><i>LIUNA Turns to Print Campaign to Clean-Up It's Image</i></B>
<P>
<B>Blames &quot;Right-Wingers&quot; for Its Trouble</B>
<P>
Feeling a little sensitive about being exposed for a rich history
of corruption and its ties to organized crime, the Laborers International
Union of North America (LIUNA) was compelled to purchase a full-page
ad in <I>The Washington Post</I> this week to &quot;answer its
critics.&quot;  Of course, LIUNA officials charged &quot;right-wing
extremists&quot; for their own internal troubles.
<P>
In a lengthy discourse (1849 words) the full-page ad reveals LIUNA's
own wrongdoings.  Boasting that LIUNA has implemented &quot;a
tough new Ethics and Disciplinary Code with zero tolerance for
any form of misconduct,&quot; the union is also proud of the fact
that it has hired, full-time, &quot;a former top official in the
Justice Department's Organized Crime Unit,&quot; and a former
top official in the investigative unit of the FBI.
<P>
The full-page ad, in essence, documents the massive irregularities
and corruption which has plagued the union for years.
<P>
The ad then proceeds to blame Republican leaders (&quot;Opponents
of Change&quot;) and &quot;Moronic Media Coverage&quot; for making
fraudulent charges against LIUNA.  These &quot;charges&quot; just
happen to be the details of the facts so competently described
in LIUNA's lengthy full-page ad.  While LIUNA wrote extensively
in the ad about their own problems and the corrective actions
they were taking to clean up the union, the only charges of &quot;Right-Wing
Mud-Throwing&quot; detailed in the ad were that House Speaker
Gingrich and Majority Leader Armey &quot;are dusting off all of
the old, discredited myths and buzzwords: big labor, out-of-touch,
union bosses.&quot;  LIUNA also takes aim at a recent <I>Reader's
Digest</I> article that chronicles the history of LIUNA and its
current leader, Arthur Coia.  LIUNA, in the ad, had nothing to
say about Coia's questionable ties to organized crime, and only
took aim at the details of the ongoing investigation of the union
by the federal government.
<P>
In effect, LIUNA took out the full-page ad to report that it has
been forced to take massive and unprecedented corrective measures
to clean up its operation, and is blaming &quot;right-wing extremists&quot;
for further reporting on and exposing its problems.  LIUNA boasts
of its clean-up efforts, but the question remains:  If LIUNA were
accountable to its members, and ran the union in an ethical and
legal manner, would the full-page ad been necessary in the first
place?
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B><i>Teachers Plan Fall Agenda</i></B>
<P>
<B>'96 Elections - Not the Classroom - Focus of Meeting</B>
<P>
The National Education Association (NEA) just completed a three-day
meeting with congressional contacts to devise a strategy for teachers'
unions in the fall elections.  The NEA and the American Federation
of Teachers (AFT) are the two main unions, with over three million
members.
<P>
According to <I>Investor's Business Daily</I>, a study of the
NEA's liberal legislative agenda shows that they and the American
Federation of Teachers are firmly established in the liberal tax-and-spend
pro-union Democrat camp.  In 1994, for example, Democrats got
99% of its PAC money, and 99% of the AFT's.  Passage of everything
on the NEA's spending &quot;wish list&quot; that year would have
cost taxpayers an extra $702 billion a year.  That shakes out
to $10,544 a year in additional taxes for a family of four.  In
addition, the NEA's plan would increase the size of government
by nearly 40%.  Of course, most of the issues on their list have
little or nothing to do with education.

<i><B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney:</i></B>
<P>
<B>AFL-CIO &quot;Officially&quot; Against MSAs Despite Popularity
Among Membership</B>
<P>
An official publication of the AFL-CIO, the <I>Trade Union Courier</I>,
is publicly on the record in support of Medical Savings Accounts
(MSAs), but the union's president, John Sweeney, has made it official
that the AFL-CIO will help Senator Ted Kennedy, and oppose MSAs
in health care reform legislation currently moving through Congress.
<P>
At the same time that America's &quot;Leading Labor Newspaper&quot;
is advocating that &quot;Congress should pass MSAs right now&quot;
(and as 50,000 United Mine Workers in West Virginia enjoy the
benefits of their negotiated MSAs), AFL-CIO chief Sweeney and
other union leaders who apparently don't heed the call of rank-and-file
members have stated the union's staunch opposition to MSAs.
<P>
The article entitled &quot;Who's Making Your Healthcare Choices?
MSAs let you do what is best for you,&quot; reveals that perhaps
labor leaders are not representing what's in the best interest
of the rank-and-file.  The article states:
<P>
<I>You've heard the MSA arguments; its rich versus poor, healthy
versus the sick, Democrats versus Republicans.  But who is speaking
for you?</I>
<P>
<I>Maybe no one; or worse maybe they are putting words in your
mouth.  You are not alone in thinking this is a good idea.  A
lot of rank and file members feel as you do.</I>
<P>
<I>. . . Let them (members of Congress) know that it should be
up to you to pick your own doctor, not some politician or HMO.</I>
<P>
<I>Let them know that you are wise enough to make the decisions
that are best for you.</I>
<P>
During the past several months, those favoring government control
of the health care system (like Ted Kennedy, and his friends on
the left like John Sweeney) have been fighting against the inclusion
of MSAs in health care reform.
<P>
The total disregard that Sweeney has displayed for his member's
views was recently uncovered in a poll conducted by Luntz Research
for Americans for a Balanced Budget.  The poll concluded that,
overwhelmingly, union members want a balanced budget, and tax
cuts (among other initiatives pursued by the Republican-led Congress)
which Sweeney is fighting <U>against</U> in Washington, and through
a multi-million dollar attack ad campaign funded by his members'
dues.  The rift over MSAs is just another example of Sweeney taking
liberties with his newfound power as chief of the AFL-CIO - putting
the name of the union behind efforts to kill legislation that
is contrary to the wishes and views of his membership, and aggressively
bankrolling media and political campaigns to reinforce Sweeney's
leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat
control.
<P>
The <I>Trade Union Courier</I> is published out of New York City.
Its circulation is the 1.4 million members of the AFL-CIO.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback: NLRB Decision Allows Disruption of
Construction Markets</B></i>
<P>
Late last week, the Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
issued its most blatantly pro-union decision yet.  The NLRB ruled
that construction unions can demand, strike over, and enforce
so-called &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; clauses.  This decision could
force contractors to shut down nonunion subsidiaries, or impose
union membership on nonunion workers without a secret ballot vote.
<P>
The case arose over a decade ago when the Painters union sought
to block open shop (nonunion) encroachment into what it considered
union markets.  The same union that for years fought paint rollers,
spray painters and other labor-saving devices for its workers,
has tried to prevent union contractors from setting up &quot;dual
shop&quot; organizations.
<P>
Dual shops allow construction firms to operate both union and
open shop companies in order to compete in distinct markets for
construction services.  For example, government work, because
of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage law, has become a special market
niche for union firms.  Residential and most commercial construction
work across the country today is built nonunion.  In order to
compete for government and private work, a parent firm must operate
separate and distinct subsidiaries.
<P>
The NLRB ruled that &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; contract terms
will be considered legal <U>despite</U> the prohibitions in the
statute against imposing contract terms on neutral employers.
 The immediate result of the decision will be the immediate demand
by construction unions that contractors shut down open shop subsidiaries.
 While business spends the next several years fighting such crippling
demands, the courts must sort out the NLRB's shaky reasoning.
 The outcome of the Clinton NLRB's gift to unions will be higher
construction costs, major business disruptions and lost opportunities
for workers.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>No Comment from Clinton on </B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; Proposals</B>
<P>
At the White House Conference on Corporate Responsibility on May
16, President Clinton stressed good &quot;corporate citizenship&quot;
but was mute on his support for proposals advocated by Labor Secretary
Reich and leading Democrats that give special tax breaks and regulatory
favors to businesses that institute government-preferred employee
programs.
<P>
Honoring businesses (mostly large) that provide an array of benefits
for their employees, the President also announced the creation
of the &quot;Ron Brown Corporate Citizenship Award.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; proposals have been pushed
by the labor unions, Reich and key supporters in the Congress,
but the business community has been less enthusiastic about having
to adopt cookie-cutter employee benefits programs in order to
receive special tax breaks.  With the higher fixed labor costs
associated with such programs (as in the non job-producing economics
of Europe), such rigid programs will make it more difficult for
employers to hire new employees.  Interestingly, small businesses
(the job creating engines of the U.S. economy) were not featured
at the White House event.  According to Clinton, all of the very
financially healthy corporations featured at the event &quot;proves
you can do the right thing and make money&quot;  - but for many
small businesses, the Clinton tax increase and proposed minimum
wage hike won't even give small start-ups a chance.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Greed Crosses Union Lines</B></i>
<P>
Some members of the AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades
Department (BCTD) feel that the Laborer's International Union
of North American (LIUNA) is overreaching its jurisdictional boundaries
in its zeal to add new members to its declining rolls.
<P>
In a recent meeting of the fifteen BCTD union bosses, the Bricklayers'
chief John Joyce called for a censure on Arthur Coia's LIUNA &quot;for
its predatory objectives and behavior.&quot;  In LIUNA's &quot;expansionist
program,&quot; organizing methods allegedly have included cash
bribes and job offers to lure over representatives of other unions,
as well as negotiating to include the definition of other crafts
in their own collective bargaining agreements.  Joyce claims the
Plasterer's Union has had problems with LIUNA's encroachment on
their territory, and feels his bricklayers will be next.
<P>
Although members of the construction unions have for years bickered
and battled over jurisdictional issues, Joyce stated that the
censure was proposed because LIUNA &quot;has exhausted everyone's
patience.&quot;  But Joyce may have another motive in taking such
a hard line against LIUNA.  Coia supported the opponent of Joyce
ally, Robert Georgine, in the last BCTD presidential election.
<P>
Instead of censure, the BCTD gave LIUNA 30 days to resolve its
problems and make peace with the other unions to demonstrate solidarity.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>But Another Controversial Payback Struck Down Again by the
Courts</B></i>
<P>
Last week, the full court of appeals in Washington, D.C. refused
to cooperate in President Clinton's effort to tilt the balance
of power in labor's favor.  By a 9 to 2 vote the court rejected
the Administration's request for a rehearing of the decision to
invalidate the Clinton Striker Replacement Executive Order. 
<P>
That order would have prohibited federal contractors from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes and other labor disputes.
 If it had stood, a large group of employers would have been defenseless
against exorbitant demands by unions.  In February, however, a
panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals struck down the Executive Order
because it conflicted with clear, longstanding labor law principles.
<P>
The full court decision issued last week left no doubt that the
rule of law is superior to the President's wishes to pander to
unions. Terming the Administration's arguments &quot;far-fetched&quot;
and &quot;silly,&quot; the court refused to reconsider the earlier
decision of the three-judge panel.  The case in now likely to
go to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i> <B>Starting Wage Fact</B></i>
<P>
Within one year, more than 60% of workers earning the minimum
wage will receive a raise of at least 20%.  This is as much as
the Clinton Administration's proposal but without the job loss.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Unions Follow Corporate America's Lead</B></i>
<P>
Consolidation.  Efficiency.  Layoffs.  These facts of corporate
life have come to the union movement.  The Laborers Union has
ordered the consolidation of 10 of its locals in New York City.
 Emulating the best in the corporate public relations field, the
union spokesman announced:  &quot;We realize that this will cost
some local union officers their jobs, but...members were paying
too much for the services they were receiving.&quot;
<P>
The union's restructuring was a matter of survival, but not from
the forces of competition like businesses face.  The District
Council of the union has been operating under a Trusteeship since
settlement of a Labor and Justice Department lawsuit in 1994 alleging
corruption.  The New York reorganization was required because
an investigation found that the structure was &quot;organizationally
and financially inefficient.&quot;  More damning, the union setup
provided &quot;unacceptable opportunities for organized crime
to corrupt the internal operation of the locals.&quot;
<P>
<a name="two"></a><i><B>Union Sued By Workers - Broke &quot;Job Security Vow&quot;</B></i>
<P>
According to an article from the Institute for Global Communications
(a labor internet news group), forty laid-off workers from the
Bath Iron Works Corp. are suing the Industrial Union of Marine
and Shipbuilding Workers of America.  The workers are suing on
the grounds that the union assured them of continuous employment
through 1997.
<P>
The union's lawyers claim that the workers should be suing the
company, not the union.  But according to one worker, who is now
on  welfare and trying to feed his family of four on $242 per
week, a union rep. was present at each worker interview stating
that &quot;everything would be ok.&quot;
<P>
The workers are seeking damages for lost wages, emotional distress,
and want to be reimbursed for union dues collected during their
employment.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>NLRB Advocacy Put on Hold...For Now</B></i>
<P>
The Congress passed, and the President has signed, a significant
provision curbing an abuse of power by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB).  As part of the 1996 spending bill enacted recently,
the Labor Board cannot spend any money to finalize its infamous
&quot;single location bargaining unit&quot; rule.
<P>
That rule has been roundly criticized by small business owners
as a blank check for union organizers to more easily organize
retail shops, restaurants and other businesses across the country.
<P>
According to a recent article by Bloomberg Business News, it is
estimated that a unionization effort at a small business would
cost the business as much as $100,000 to hire a lawyer and labor
negotiator.
<P>
The recently enacted ban remains in effect through this fiscal
year, September 30, and NLRB officials have said no final action
would be taken until Fall.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>New Jersey and You - Downsizing Together</B></i>
<P>
A New Jersey union is launching a grassroots campaign to support
proposed legislation that would financially punish businesses
that downsize.  &quot;The Job Destruction Penalty Act&quot; was
introduced in the New Jersey Assembly on May 2.   It would require
companies of 100 or more employees to give 2 months of severance
pay (for each year of service) to permanently laid-off workers.
 In addition, a fine of $4,000 per employee, per lay-off would
be levied against the company, and (in theory) would be given
 back to the community to help off-set the job and tax revenue
loss.  The New Jersey Industrial Union Council is leading the
grass- roots mobilization efforts.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Clinton Asks Americans to Celebrate Labor's Rich Heritage</B></i>
<P>
On May 3, President Clinton proclaimed May 1996 &quot;Labor History
Month.&quot;  The President calls on all Americans to &quot;observe
this month with ceremonies, activities, and programs that encourage
reflection on the labor movement's heritage and its many contributions
to the creation and maintenance of a just America.&quot;
<P>
In his proclamation he extolled the virtues of unions and declared
that &quot;Each new generation of workers must embrace the activism
that has characterized labor's rich history...&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Americans will find a rich history, but unfortunately
the highlights of the labor movement are equally matched with
&quot;lowlights,&quot; including corruption, extortion and scandal.
 Of course, none of this is mentioned in the President's official
proclamation.
<P>
Could you imagine if &quot;each new generation&quot; embraced
AFL-CIO V.P.  Richard Trumka's  techniques?  <I>Labor Watch </I>readers
remember Trumka's kind remarks to those who don't see things his
way: &quot;...we'll knock you flat on your --.&quot;  
<P>
Traffice terrorism, hostile and unethical corporate campaigns,
violent strikes, bomb threats, and labor leader corruption are
other items looked over by the Clinton proclamation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<i><B>White House to Sponsor Conference on</B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot;</B>
<P>
On May 16, the White House will bring in its choice of the country's
&quot;best companies&quot; and sponsor a conference on good corporate
citizenship.  The CEOs that received the White House seal of approval
will breakfast with the President and participate in panel discussions
at Georgetown University.  Topics to be discussed will probably
include:  Family-Friendly Workplaces, Economic Security, Investment
in Employees, Partnership with Employees, and Safe &amp; Secure
Workplaces.
<P>
According to a copy of &quot;The President's Corporate Citizenship
Challenges&quot; distributed on March 23, ways that companies
can best help employees (in the above-mentioned areas) is by getting
them involved in the workplace, and by giving them a voice.  
<P>
Union organizing, as a way to help employees, is not mentioned.
 In fact, Clinton's &quot;Challenges&quot; sound very much like
the TEAM Act, legislation passed by the House and being pursued
by Sen Dole along with the minimum wage hike.  The unions strongly
oppose the TEAM Act.
<P><a name="seven"></a>
<i><B> Starting Wage Fact:</B></i>
<P>
<B>According to the National Governor's Association, a $1 increase
in the starting wage amounts to the largest unfunded mandate imposed
by the GOP-lead Congress</B>.

</blockquote>
<P>
These were just two of the quotes that Luntz Research received
in a recent survey of union members to gauge rank-and-file sentiment
regarding big labor's heavy investment in congressional races.
 The unions are targeting Republican members in order to help
return the Congress to Democratic hands.  Over 1,000 union members
were surveyed for Americans for a Balanced Budget from April 23
- 28.
<P>
Key findings include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an overwhelming 84% to 9% margin, union members want to force
their leaders to explain what happens to their dues, where the
money is spent and why.
<P>
<li>Campaigns and politics <U>are</U> <U>not</U> the priorities of
the rank-and-file - only 4% said engaging in political election
activities were important.  Preserving jobs came out on top at
58%; increasing wages and benefits was second at 27%; and improving
the image of unions was third at 8%.
<P>
<li>Who is John Sweeney?  The rank-and-file membership would like
to know too.  Only 18% knew of him well enough to offer an opinion
of him.  82% had no opinion or knowledge of him.
<P>
<li>Rank-and-file members are not aware that they have a right to
get a refund for dues spent on political activities, despite union
leaders comments to the contrary.  Only 19% knew of this right.
 More strikingly, one-fourth of those belonging to a union for
two or more decades know about their right to a refund. Needless
to say, the union leadership has not publicized the issue with
its rank-and-file.
<P>
<li>Union members reaction was hostile to the fact that $35 million
dollars of their dues is being used to defeat Congressional Republicans.
 Overall, 41% are &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to the effort while
21% &quot;somewhat oppose&quot; it.  Of those supporting the campaign,
15% &quot;strongly support&quot; it, while 16% &quot;somewhat
support&quot; the effort.
</ul>
<P>
On specific issues, the rank-and-file membership appear to be
more in line with Republican-led initiatives. In fact, the union
leadership has pumped millions of dollars into lobbying and media
campaigns that run counter to the wishes of their membership.
<p>
For example:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an 82% to 11% margin, union members support the Balanced Budget
Amendment.
<P>
<li>Welfare reform  that requires recipients to work is supported
by union members by 87% to 7%.
<P>
<li>The $500 tax credit pushed by the GOP is supported by 78% of those
surveyed.
</ul>

<i><B>Union Boss Lashes Out at Government Bureaucrats</B></i>

boss John T. Joyce recently complained, &quot;If the [Labor Department]
is going to keep coming up with new technicalities and making
decisions on the flip of a coin, it is futile to try to do it
the right way.&quot;  The reason for Joyce's outburst: A DOL lawsuit
challenging his reelection for a fourth five-year term as international
union president.
<P>
The lawsuit, seeking to rerun the election, alleges widespread
use of union funds for payment of campaign personnel, improper
electioneering, and use of union equipment and resources by the
Joyce campaign.  Joyce defeated challenger Gerald Carlisle by
1,995 votes out of 88,235 votes cast.
<P>
&quot;This is precisely the senseless misuse of bureaucratic power
that erodes public confidence in the federal regulatory process,&quot;
Joyce laments.  &quot;In the case at hand, DOL understands neither
the law they administer nor the organizations they regulate.&quot;
<p>
At last - we agree on something.

<i><B>Kennedy and Labor Bosses Fighting Against Tax Free MSAs</B></i>
<P>
Labor leaders have joined the chorus of those condemning medical
savings accounts (MSAs).  In the weekly edition of <I>Work in
Progress</I>, an AFL-CIO publication, MSAs are described as &quot;controversial&quot;
calling them tax breaks for the healthy and wealthy.  
<P>
As confirmed by the Luntz survey, labor leaders seem to be out
of touch with their rank-and-file membership.  This certainly
proves to be the case with  MSAs.  Case in point: the United Mine
Workers of West Virginia bargained to get a MSA prototype in their
contracts.  According to the <I>Courier-Journal</I> of Louisville,
Kentucky, &quot;Each contract year, the company gives members
$1,000 for out-of-pocket health care costs; $1,000 is the deductible.
 Members not using the money for health care can keep it.&quot;
 Sounds like a MSA to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.
<P>
Labor's &quot;hero&quot; Ted Kennedy is of course fighting against
MSAs - he prefers that the mine workers be taxed unfairly for
their health care benefits rather than giving them tax parity
with big corporations.

<i><B>Sweeney Youth Unleashed</B></i>
<P>
<i><B> &quot;Union Summer&quot; Campaign Begins June 1</B></i>
<P>
Political activism, union organizing and garden variety militancy
are the activities of AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney's summer internship
program.  Enlisting up to 1,000 young people from across the country,
Sweeney vows to put them to work &quot;planning, phone calling,
door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating.&quot;
<P>
At a press conference and barbecue on May 1, the union chief identified
the corporate campaign against the Detroit Newspapers as well
as Service Workers Union organizing drives as two of the projects
to which the interns will be assigned.  Sweeney also acknowledged
that the political activists will be put to work on grassroots
minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating
against the California Civil Rights Institute.
<P>
Sweeney Youth will be deployed to cities across the United States
for three-week stints. The activists will receive training, free
housing, and a stipend of $210 per week.
<P>
(For a list of cities the interns will be sent to, contact SBS

<i><B>AFL-CIO Grades It's Congressional Targets</B></i>
<P>
The  latest propoganda from an AFL-CIO mail campaign was given
to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.  The mailing, a &quot;report card,&quot;
targeted 33 House members who received mostly &quot;Fs&quot; from
the union -  31 of the targets were Republicans, and 2 were Democrats.
 At first glance, the direct mail campaign appeared &quot;bi-partisan&quot;
- until it was discovered by <I>Labor Watch</I> staff that the
2 Democrats are leaving Congress.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<I><B>Another Payback</B></I><B>: Clinton's Latest Agent for Unions</B>
<P>
Add the Security &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) to the list of
federal agencies dedicated to boosting the union agenda.  This
winter, the SEC ordered the Dupont Company to include in its proxy
statement, a proposal by its union to dedicate a seat on the board
of directors for a union member.
<P>
The company had opposed the election of a director that &quot;represents
a particular point of view or particular constituency other than
shareholders as a whole,&quot; reports the <U>Daily Labor Report</U>.
 The SEC ignored the management view and ordered inclusion of
the proposal that was drafted by the Independent Brotherhood of
Dupont Workers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Employers Are Fighting Back:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Field Hearings Focus on &quot;Salting&quot; as a Corporate
Campaign Technique</B>
<P>
Some of unions' most abusive campaign tactics came under fire
April 12 as contractors and their employees took their cases to
a congressional field hearing in Kansas City.  At issue was the
union scheme of &quot;salting&quot; - work sites with union organizers
who file discrimination charges with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), disrupt work, and run-up employer costs.  Union
manipulation of the law and NLRB complicity were the primary themes.
<P>
Gregory E. Hoberock's testimony was typical:  &quot;Forcing employers
to hire persons whose intent is to bankrupt the employer does
not make sense.&quot;  His family-owned business in Union, Missouri,
suffered dozens of frivolous charges filed with the NLRB at a
cost of $15,000 to $25,000 in legal fees.
<P>
The hearing was called by Rep. Harris Fawell (R-IL), Chair of
the House Opportunities Committee Employer-Employee Relations
Subcommittee, and Small Business Committee Chair Jan Meyers (R-KS).
 Rep. Fawell has introduced, H.R. 3211, the &quot;Truth in Employment
Act,&quot; addressing the problem of salting.  As he stated at
the hearing, H.R. 3211 &quot;merely seeks to alleviate the legal
pressure imposed upon employers to hire individuals whose overriding
purpose for seeking the job is not to become a bona fide employee,
but to organize the employer's workplace and/or otherwise inflict
economic harm on the employer.&quot;
<P>
The criticism of salting was not limited to business owners. 
Electrician Richard Oberlechner complained, &quot;We are tired
of the harassment tactics [by unions], both on a company basis
and against us individually.&quot; Echoing the concerns of many,
he stressed, &quot;We do not want our future jeopardized for the
monetary gains of others.&quot;
<P>
The message to Congress was compelling.  &quot;Right now it is
David facing not one, but two Goliaths...the unions with their
large coffers and the NLRB,&quot; said David Meyer of Meyer Brothers
Building Co., a Blue Springs, Missouri general contractor employing
50 workers.  He concluded, &quot;Small businesses are the backbone
of our country.  Please do not stand by and watch the small businesses
and our FREE ENTERPRISE system be destroyed by the unions and
a tax-supported branch of our government.&quot;
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>As John Sweeney Sees It </B>- </i>
<P>
<B>Labor <I>Can't</I> Do It On It's Own</B>
<P>
&quot;We're in the battle of our life,&quot; declares AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney.  &quot;If we don't change this Congress,
believe me, we've only seen a taste of what their agenda will
be.&quot;
<P>
With this rallying cry, Sweeney told a conference of the New York
State Labor-Religion Coalition that the key to labor's strategy
for the future is building coalitions with religious, environmental
and other groups.  Also key, according to Sweeney, is electing
a Democratic Congress.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Minimum Wage Madness</B></i>
<P>
Maybe Republican members of Congress supporting a $1.00 increase
in the minimum wage need to contact the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC) to get a primer on why the wage hike is bad for
business and bad for workers.  
<P>
According to the DLC, the &quot;moderate&quot; Democratic institution
once led by President Clinton, the wage hike is &quot;counterproductive,
raising prices for poor people while helping mainly middle class
families.&quot;  The hike would also &quot;reduce job creation
 for low- skilled people.&quot;
<P>
The DLC continues, &quot;Increasing the minimum wage would produce
a regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse
off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group
of people which is predominately non-poor.&quot;
<P><a name="six"></a>
 <i><B>Starting Wage Fact</B>:</i>
<P>
The 90-cent starting wage hike will directly cost business $12.3
billion over the next 5 years according to the CBO.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback Owed</i> - Clinton Coordinated Closely
With </B>
<P>
<b>Unions During Government Shutdown</b><P>
Led by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE),
the unions helped President Clinton develop his confrontational
strategy with Republicans over the budget, and were informed that
the shutdown, as well as a delay in increasing government's borrowing
authority, would not adversely impact government operations and
 social security,  or  other transfer payments.  At the same time,
the Treasury Dept. was telling the public exactly the opposite.
 According to an April 1, <I><B>Washington Times</B></I> story,
the AFGE did not tell members about Treasury's use of retirement
funds.  Instead it sent weekly alerts to its members warning about
the default's &quot;danger.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The Reich Report: Mixed Messages</B></i>
<P>
Is the U.S. economy creating high-wage or dead-end jobs?  The
answer depends on what soil Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is
standing.
<P>
In France earlier this month, Reich defended the 8.4 million jobs
that have been created while the Clinton Administration has been
in office.  Apparently, Europeans are under the impression that
these are low-skilled and low-wage jobs.  He and the Administration
boasted that &quot;the fastest growing job categories in the U.S.
are the highest paying ones...60 percent of those new jobs are
high-wage positions in areas such as finance, telecommunications,
and other high-tech areas.&quot;
<P>
At home, Reich follows the union cue and bemoans the &quot;anxious
class&quot; fearful of dead-end jobs.  The Labor Secretary's friends
at the AFL-CIO dictate a similar message.  A union resolution
declares:  &quot;Loaded with debt... threatened with downsizing
and outsourcing, and a growing pool of low-wage, no-benefit contingent
labor, American workers are frustrated, anxious and angry.&quot;
 
<P>
Except for some unwarranted credit taking, Reich was on the ball
while in France.  The next time he speaks on the issue in the
U.S., employers hope he speaks as glowingly about American jobs
as he does overseas.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>The Corporate Campaign: USA Today, Now More Than Ever</B></i>
<P>
It's official, reading<I><B> USA Today</B></I> is now politically
incorrect.  Top union boss John Sweeney has ordered unionists
not to buy or advertise in the national newspaper because its
owner, Gannett Publishing, has refused to yield to union demands
in Detroit.  A similar &quot;Do Not Buy&quot; order went out against
<I><B>The Miami Herald</B></I>, the flagship paper of Knight-Ridder.
<P>
The much publicized union strike against the<I><B> Detroit Free
Press</B></I> and <I><B>Detroit News</B></I> is going into its
ninth month.  Undaunted by formal complaints by the government
and by legal action arising out of the strikers' campaign of violence,
the union hopes to broaden public awareness of their dispute.
 As AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka vowed last month, &quot;We will
be moving on a rather nationwide basis to expose what Gannett
is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot;
<P>
The unions have recently gone into competition with the Detroit
papers by publishing their own &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; for
which they are soliciting advertisers.  No doubt the real Detroit
newspapers are not worried about the new weekly.  With union work
rules, featherbedding, and grievance procedures, it is highly
unlikely that the strikers' &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; will turn
a profit in this lifetime.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Labor Chat - Spiked AFL-CIO Survey From '94 Resurfaces on the
Internet</B></i>
<P>
According to a 1994 posting on Labor Talk, an on-line newsgroup
through the Institute for Global Communications, a '94 survey
commissioned by the AFL-CIO was too embarrassing to share with
the public - or its own members for that matter.
<P>
The survey, &quot;Being Heard,&quot; included these findings:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Of the 4 out of 5 Americans living in non-union households,
only 29% have positive feelings about unions, 39% negative, and
32% neutral.
<P>
<li> Only 25% feel that unions are concerned about all working
people - 65% say that unions are concerned only about their members.
</ul>
<P>
The authors of the report, a pro-labor consulting firm, also concluded
that the unions were perceived as &quot;undemocratic institutions,&quot;
increasingly irrelevant, and &quot;outdated, old-fashioned, hidebound
guardians of the status quo.&quot;  According to the Labor Talk
article, the report was published on March 21, 1994.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Union Money Making &quot;Fad&quot;</B></i>
<P>
Like a sponge to water, organized labor has taken to soaking money
from the U.S. Treasury.  According to the Federal Assistance Awards
Data System (FAADS), unions receive over $39 million per year
in grants through not-for-profit organizations, and the U.S. Department
of Labor.  The following unions and their affiliates were some
of the recipients during 1993-1994:
<P><pre>
AFL-CIO    				$2,038,000
<P>
AFSME       				$148,000
<P>
American Fed of Teachers     		$143,000
<P>
American Nurses Assoc.        		$965,000
<P>
Int'l Assoc of Machinists  		$1,770,000
<P>
National Education Assoc.       	$385,000
<P>
Teamsters       			$3,542,000
<P>
Service Employees Int'l Union		$137,000
<P>
United Auto Workers            		$805,000
<P>
United Brotherhood of Carpenters	$257,000

<HR><p><a name="one"></a>
<blockquote>
<i><B>Pressure from the Pressmen</B></i>
<P>
The Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has shown its
prounion colors, judging from a recent Court of Appeals decision.
 It appears that the union-packed NLRB has forgotten the violence
that marked the 1985 strike against the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
stirred by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike ended
in 1986, and by May, 1989 the process of reinstating striking
workers was well on the way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and the addresses of replacement workers who
are still employed at the <I>Tribune.</I>
<P>
The NLRB ordered the <I>Tribune</I> to furnish the names and addresses
of replacement employees to the union on the basis that the &quot;passage
of five years since the violence tilted the balance in favor of
disclosure.&quot;   A ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit has however, refused to enforce the NLRB order.
 Violence against replacement workers during the strike included
tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing of a delivery
driver. 
<P>
The <I>Tribune</I> offered to conduct a third party mailing to
the replacement workers, would permit communications during nonwork
times, the posting of union notices on company bulletin boards
and allow distribution of union notices in nonwork areas.  Replacement
employees could also choose to provide the union with their own
address.  This was not good enough though for the union or its
supporters on the Labor Board. The federal court disagreed with
both the NLRB and the union to ensure employee protections.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Whose Rights Are They Anyway? </B></i>
<P>
Employees have the right to object to union political activities,
but it is illegal for employers to tell them so.  That is the
argument behind a complaint filed by the General Counsel of the
Labor Board against nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises.
<P>
The company has been cited for breaking labor laws by notifying
employees of their rights under the Supreme Court's <U>Beck</U>
decision.  That case recognized the right to object to paying
the portion of compulsory union dues which is spent on political
causes opposed by the employee.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB recently ruled that unions are not required by
law to give their members effective notice of their <U>Beck</U>
rights.  If the Labor Board is successful in its case against
Beverly, employers will be prohibited from letting their employees
in on this secret.  That leaves to Clinton appointees the task
of spreading the word about rights the unions oppose.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>No Minority Rights</B></i>
<P>
Like all democratic institutions, union bosses are supposed to
represent the views of their constituents - the dues paying members.
 So if a large share of union members vote Republican, the elected
union officials pay heed, right?
<P>
You be the judge.  A recent Communications Workers of America
(CWA) union poll showed that its members favored President Clinton
over Bob Dole by 53% to 27%.  The union's executive council unanimously
endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket.  CWA President Mort Bahr says
&quot;our jobs is to make sure the 53% [favoring Clinton] stays.&quot;
 Bahr is also reported to have charged his members to work for
the election of  Democrats to the U.S. House in an effort to recapture
the chamber.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Attention Blue Light Shoppers -</B></i>
<br>
<B>Campaign Targets K-mart</B>
<P>
One of America's retail giants is experiencing a text book corporate
campaign.  The target: Kmart.  Unions are working every angle
to convert productive employees of the company into dues paying
members so they can attack every level of the company's operations.
<P>
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Union of Needletrades
Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) are seeking employee
representation on the company's board of directors.  They are
also pressing for annual board elections for all directors and
the elimination of retirement plans for nonemployee directors.
 The unions believe that their representation on the board will
also improve Kmart's stock value. 
<P>
The Teamsters represent a small percentage of Kmart employees
and own 500,000 shares of the company's stock.  UNITE is currently
seeking to organize over 500 Kmart employees in Greensboro, NC.
 Last fall, the union made allegations of discriminatory employment
practices and instituted a consumer boycott - standard tactics
in corporate campaigns.
<P>
The unions are backing Stephen Hester for Kmart's board.  Hester's
speciality is  employee stock ownership programs, and he is credited
with helping unionized employees of Northwest Airlines gain stock
ownership and representation on its board of directors.
<P>
The Teamsters and UNITE blame the lack of  an  independent voice
on the board of directors for the decline in Kmart's stock value.
 They see Kmart competitor, Wal-Mart, gaining  a significant share
of the market.  No doubt when the unions decide to take on non-union
Wal-Mart, they will  conclude that Wal-Mart's competitive edge
could vastly improve with union representation.

<B>Sweeney Youth to be Trained for &quot;Union Summer&quot;</B>
<P>
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney wants to train members of the
MTV generation to be union activists.  Desperate for new dues-paying
members, he has devised a plan to recruit the children of existing
members - and other young people - into service this summer. 
Participants will promote the joys of union membership under the
guise of social justice.
<P>
The three-month boot camp, called &quot;Union Summer,&quot; will
immerse young recruits in union rhetoric, teach the the principles
of union activism and put them to work on organizing campaigns
and union projects around the country.
<P>
In a recruitment flyer for &quot;Union Summer,&quot; the AFL-CIO
asks prospects to &quot;join hundreds of workers and students
making history.  Spend three weeks in the streets and neighborhoods,
organizing for workplace rights and social justice.  Make this
a summer America will never forget!&quot;
<P>
&quot;Union Summer&quot; applications are currently being accepted.
 Applicants are asked to &quot;describe a defining moment or life
experience that relates to your desire to fight injustice.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B>New Clinton Payback Revealed</B>
<P>
In a recent address before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House
Republican Conference Chairman, John Boehner (R-OH) revealed President
Clinton's latest payback to organized labor.  According to Boehner,
just two weeks before receiving big labor's endorsement, Bill
Clinton &quot;instructed the government's personnel office to
proved labor unions with the home addresses of all federal employees
in bargaining units - whether or not they are union members.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> pondered the potential uses of this
data:  re-elect Clinton campaign, political literature, mailings
of related union propaganda, and personal visits to the homes

<B>Cookie Monsters: Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The St. Louis Girl Scouts are the latest target of a union corporate
campaign.  Members of an electrical workers union local have threatened
a boycott, and are picketing two Girl Scout camps in Eastern Missouri
after a nonunion electrical contractor was awarded the work for
major renovations and construction at the camps.
<P>
Building and Construction Trades Council officials have warned
the area executive director of the detrimental impact upon her
organization over its failure to use union contractors.  She agreed
to try to change the decision.  The pickets remain camped out
while awaiting the final outcome, and plans to put the Girl Scouts
on the unions' &quot;We Do Not Patronize&quot; list were put on
hold.
<P>
The question remains as to whether union officials will issue
the ultimate boycott - a refusal to buy Girl Scout cookies.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<B>Union Backing</B>
<P>
A kindler, gentler union movement?  You decide.  Richard Trumka,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, recently whipped the Pennsylvania
union conventioneers into a frenzy with this rallying cry:  &quot;Our
message is that unions are back.  Get in our way and we'll knock
you flat on your (expletive).&quot;
<P><a name="five"></a>
<B>&quot;Government Stewardship&quot; of Unions  Lousy Says Union
Members</B>
<P>
Even Teamsters complain that government can't run anything right.
 In response to petitions from 12,000 rank-and-file members of
the union, two Members of Congress are seeking a review of the
effectiveness of the Independent Review Board (IRB), which oversees
the operation of the nation's largest labor organization.
<P>
In a consent decree with the Justice Department, the IRB was formed
in 1989 to root out organized crime within the Teamsters and monitor
its financial affairs.  Reps. Michael Flanagan (R-IL) and William
Lipinski (D-IL) report that union members &quot;contend the union's
financial condition has worsened in its years under government
stewardship&quot; and have called for an investigation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<B>Rights on the Left</B>
<P>
Some Rights are more right than others, in the union mindset.
 Beating the union drum at the March 25 AFL-CIO convention in
Washington, Vice President Gore blasted Republicans and demonstrated
the Administration's affinity with Big Labor as he declared: &quot;To
them, the right to strike is a luxury...but to us the right to
strike is a right.&quot;
<P>
The right to work, on the other hand, is considered an unsavory
concept by the AFL-CIO.  National Right to Work is high on their
hit list of proposed legislation in these days of frantic efforts
to shore up dwindling union rolls.  If workers could no longer
be forced to join unions in order to keep their jobs, the decline
in union membership might just go into freefall.

<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - &quot;Prevailing Waste&quot;</B></i>

<P>
&quot;We were caught abetting fraud and incompetence, so give
us more money.&quot; That is the unmistakable message from the
Labor Department as it tries to explain a request to spend $3.75
million more to administer the Davis-Bacon Act.
<P>
Last year the Department of Labor stonewalled every effort to
expose fraud in the calculation of &quot;prevailing wages&quot;
which federal government contractors must pay under the Davis-Bacon
Act. Until pressure came to bear, the Department refused to provide
access to public documents or even to disclose the names of union
officials who submitted bogus data - data which the DOL says it
relies on to calculate wages. Without the dogged determination
of Oklahoma Commissioner of Labor, Brenda Reneau, who uncovered
the fraud, and the outrage of Reps. Cass Ballenger (R-NC) and
Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), the federal Department would have denied
any problems existed.
<P>
In an investigation by Reneau and her staff, it was found that
&quot;certain parties&quot; submitted bogus projects to the DOL
including inflated wage rates of ghost employees.
<P>
This week the DOL admits in the Clinton Budget that &quot;the
current [wage determination] system's reliance on the 'third party'
data submissions has recently exposed the vulnerability to manipulation
through submission of false or selective data, and raises serious
questions about the accuracy of some of the wage determinations
that are issued.&quot;
<P>
The Labor Department's answer to those questions: Pour about $4
million more into the black hole of Davis-Bacon. In the near future
ABC t.v. program<I> 20/20</I> will air a special report on Davis-Bacon.
Investigative reporter, John Stossel produced the segment.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: </i>
<br>Clinton Appointee Fired for
Aiding a Corporate Campaign - Big Labor-Big Government Incestuous
Relationship Exposed</B> 
<P>
A top Department of Labor (DOL) appointee has been forced from
office because of his efforts to abet a union's corporate campaign.
Richard Sawyer, Labor Secretary Reich's chief representative in
the West, lost his job March 8 for contacting Hewlett-Packard
Co - threatening the company that the DOL would seize its products
- because its janitorial service, (which the Service Employees
union are attempting to organize) was &quot;going to get caught
doing bad things eventually.&quot; Mr. Sawyer is a former Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) local president.
<P>
The target of the corporate campaign was Somers Building Maintenance
in Sacramento, California. Board member for the company, Randy
Schraber, said, &quot;We were the subject of wrongdoing, and we're
pleased to see that it won't happen to another company.&quot;
<P>
Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-MI) had investigated the incident and concluded
that Mr. Sawyer had &quot;disclosed investigative information
which was damaging to Somers,&quot; and &quot;influenced the Department
of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division in an attempt to intimidate
Somers into recognizing the union.&quot; After Hoekstra made Sawyer's
action public, the DOL was forced to oust the presidential appointee.
<P>
An Inspector General's (IG) report investigating the California
incident confirms allegations that Sawyer threatened Hewlett-Packard.
The report also showed that no actions had been taken against
Somers in regards to charges that they violated wage and hour
laws. Half of California's wage and hour investigators had been
assigned to the Somer's case. According to Mr. Schraber, the investigators
found that the janitorial company actually <I>overpaid</I> its
workers between $300 - $600.
<P>
SEIU has quickly come to the defense of Sawyer by mobilizing California's
unions in a lobbying effort aimed at President Clinton and Reich
on his behalf. Hoekstra's subcommittee is planning to hold hearings
on the DOL's political motivation behind the Somer's incident
and other cases. The subcommittee will also look into alleged
politicization of OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO TO MEET IN WASHINGTON - </B></i>
<br>
<B>CLINTON ENDORSEMENT, SWEENEY TAX LIKELY</B> 
<P>
The AFL-CIO is expecting over 500 union delegates to gather at
the Capitol Hilton in Washington, D.C. next week. The union leaders
are expected to endorse President Clinton's reelection bid, and
ratify a special assessment on each union member to help subsidize
AFL-CIO Chief Sweeney's political and organizing agenda. Central
Council leaders will hold meetings on Sunday, March 24, and state
federation delegates will meet through Tuesday, March 26.
<P>
A key agenda item is the 15 cents monthly fee that each union
member will be charged, adding $2 million per month to union coffers.
The funds will go to pay for a $35 million dollar &quot;grassroots
campaign&quot; to heavily promote unions, as well as subsidize
an ongoing series of political ads targeting freshman Republican
members of Congress for elimination in this fall's elections.
The funds will also be used to step up the use of corporate campaigns.
Unions hope that the campaign will rally support for their political
agenda and establish a permanent pool of 100 union grassroots
activists in each Congressional district.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Time Out for Teamsters</B> </i>
<P>
Grand theft is a felony which carries hefty prison terms and loss
of voting rights for life; but for Teamsters bosses, it brings
a one-year suspension. That is the penalty imposed by Teamsters
President Ron Carey against three Minnesota Teamsters officials
who were guilty of embezzling funds from their local.
<P>
In addition to their suspension, the three will be barred from
holding any Teamster office for two years. A fourth official was
permanently barred from membership or holding office, and all
must share in fines totalling $189,000.
<P>
An internal report by a court-appointed Independent Review Board
found numerous questionable practices, including selling union
cars at markedly discounted rates, and charging members fees to
attend their own union meetings.

<i><B>The Reich Report</B></i>
<P>
Labor Secretary Robert Reich touts &quot;corporate responsibility&quot;
on the speaking circuit, but it appears he has been a little more
than irresponsible with taxpayer dollars.  According to a <I>Wall
Street Journal</I> article, the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP)
contends that  Reich sidestepped federal guidelines by rushing
a printing job to an all-night copying service without &quot;prior
approval.&quot;  The JCP has rejected Reich's request to pay Kinko's
of Washington for the unapproved printing job.  Labor officials
finished President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot;
too late they say to have the Government Printing Office (GPO)
do the job - the document was ready for printing late in the evening
on the eve of the State of the Union address last year.  The 18-page
document will reportedly cost taxpayers $31,380 - if Kinko's ever
gets paid - compared to the GPO price of $500.  Rep. Pete Hoekstra,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation
is apparently outraged by the waste.  The Labor Department contends
that the incident is turning into &quot;something political.&quot;
 
<P>
Perhaps the &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot; should have
included a section on the responsible use of tax dollars by government
officials who portend to represent the hard-working middle class.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA:</i><br>CORPORATE CAMPAIGN TARGET FIGHTS BACK
- VICTORIOUS OVER SEIU MILITANT TACTICS</B>
<P>
A Washington, D.C. jury may have stopped  a local Justice for
Janitors &quot;in-your-face&quot; campaign in its tracks.  The
decision may have an effect on similar cases nationwide according
to the winning attorney.
<P>
On October 21, 1993, Justice for Janitors invaded the headquarters
of United States Service Industries, Inc. (USSI), a janitorial
company that cleans office buildings in the D.C. area.  The nationwide
Janitors' campaign is the brainchild of former Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) leader John Sweeney who now heads the
AFL-CIO.  
<P>
According to a press statement released by USSI, Justice for Janitors
assaulted an officer of the corporation, and kept employees imprisoned
for several hours preventing them from leaving the building. 
<P>
Three USSI employees sued.  The Union settled with one employee,
and the other two went to trial.  A jury found there was an assault
and battery, as well as false imprisonment of both employees.
 One employee was awarded $1,000, and the other $2,000 in compensatory
damages by a jury verdict on March 11, 1996.  In addition, $30,000
in punitive damages were awarded on March 13, 1996, as a result
of clear and convincing evidence that the union demonstrators
were motivated by ill-will and willful disregard for the rights
of others.
<P>
USSI attorney, Joel Keiler, believes that future activities of
this kind could result in much larger punitive awards.  Keiler
also believes that individuals and companies nationwide will use
this verdict in their impending lawsuits, as will many of those
who were trapped by demonstrating SEIU &quot;Janitors&quot; who
blocked traffic on the 14th Street Bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge
in Washington, D.C.  last year.

<i> <B>NLRB's Gould Continues Campaign For Single-Site Rule</B></i>
<P>
Earlier this week in Tampa, Fla., National  Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) Chairman William Gould continued pushing for his proposed
single-site facility rule - a rule designed to help unions more
easily organize small businesses, and single units of multifacility
businesses such as fast-food restaurant chains.
<P>
The single-site rule would be a boon for AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney,
who wants to make good on his promise to more aggressively and
successfully organize the largely non-union service sector.  The
single-site rule applies one-size-fits-all standards to organizing,
applying illegitimate union organizing preferences over legitimate
market and business issues.  Opposition from the Republican Congress
and the business community has been fierce on the issue, but Gould
predicted that the NLRB would prevail.

<b><i>How</i> NOT <i>to Win Friends and Influence People</B></i>
<P>
Hoping to unionize thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers in North
Carolina, organized labor in that state has joined regulators
in denouncing the quality of care provided by the big HMO.  Criticizing
the product a company manufacturers may work in the case of bluejeans,
but a fatal flaw exists in the union's strategy  of attacking
the delivery of health care.  The unions are criticizing  the
very people they hope to organize - the HMO health care workers.
<P>
Of course, a &quot;fair&quot; contract is the cure prescribed
by the labor bosses.  They also hope it will undue any public
relations damage caused by the unions' smear campaign against
Kaiser Permanente workers.

<i><B>Minimum Wage Campaigns Take Off in the States</B></i>
<P>
As part of their multi-faceted election-year strategy to galvanize
union members to the polls, labor unions and allied groups are
aggressively attempting to put minimum wage increase initiatives
on the ballot in the upcoming November elections.  The AFL-CIO
is leading the signature gathering charge in most states with
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)
lending a hand.  Signature drives are up and running in Arizona,
California, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, and Oregon - with other
states targeted for activity soon.
<P>
On March 25, the AFL-CIO will hold a special meeting in Washington,
DC to kick-off their &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; road show
(while at the same time increasing their own rank-and-file union
membership dues.)  The 29-city tour will promote the minimum wage
issue.  States that are currently considering starting wage increases
in state legislatures are also targeted for a campaign stop. 
For a complete listing of efforts to increase the starting wage
at the state and local level, contact Ren&eacute;e Stikes at 202-785-0238.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Old Salt</B></i>
<P>
The career of the new chief organizer for the AFL-CIO, Richard
Bensinger, proves that unions are doing nothing new.  They're
just more blatant about it.
<P>
In the 1970's, while working as a paid union organizer, Bensinger
went undercover at a nonunion apparel plant in Colorado.  He was
quickly promoted into management, and was able to feed the union
valuable information on the company's response strategy to an
organizing campaign.
<P>
Today's unions, particularly those in the construction industry,
forego undercover work and opt instead to smother nonunion competition.
 The so-called &quot;salting campaign&quot; orders union members
to (1) apply for work at the target company, (2) make clear their
union affiliation, (3) organize other workers, if hired, (4) file
NLRB charges if not hired, (5) lure away good employees to work
for union contractors, and (6) generally create bedlam and other
problems on the job site - all at the direction of the union.
<P>
Bensinger is now directing the salting scheme nationwide that
he perfected in Colorado 20 years ago.  He serves as Deputy Director
of the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute.
<P>
Bensinger was quoted recently as saying: &quot;We're not crazy
radicals out to destroy a company; we're into cooperating with
a company...&quot;
<P>
The Electrical Workers are a little more honest about the real
purpose of salting campaigns: &quot;to threaten or actually apply
the economic pressure necessary to  cause the employers to...raise
his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business
activities, leave the union jurisdiction, go out of business,
and so on.<I> (IBEW Union Organizer Manual) </I>
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: Palming Off Jobs </B></i>
<P>
<B> An Update From the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
Anywhere but in labor relations, barely mustering a support rate
of 14% is considered an abysmal failure.  But the Palm Restaurant
of Boston knuckled under to &quot;public pressure&quot; when 27
of 200 local celebrities refused to let their caricatures be hung
on the eatery's walls due to union complaints.
<P>
<I>Labor Watch</I> readers may recall this latest corporate campaign
which discovered this  particular victim's unique charm and sought
to destroy it.  The restaurant's well-known &quot;wall of fame&quot;
honors local notables as its feature attraction.  Construction
unions waged their anti-caricature campaign because they were
offended that the restaurant selected an open shop contractor
who bid 38% below the union competition.
<P>
Of the 200 celebrities offered spots on the restaurant walls,
only 27 - or less than 14%  - sided with the union and refused
to participate.  One of those sympathizers, Boston Mayor, Thomas
Merino, negotiated a deal that requires the restaurant to rebid
up to $100,000 of work using union workers.  All future work is
slated to go to union firms.  Even as the country approaches the
21st century, organized labor continues to demonstrate that an
aggressive minority - 15% union membership in the work force,
14% of celebrities - can overcome market and economic logic.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Sweeny Predicts</B></i>
<P>
&quot;If Affirmative Action goes down, Davis-Bacon, the Service
Contract Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the minimum wage
bill will all follow,&quot; said AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney to
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.  Now those fighting labor's
agenda know where to start.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>The Check is Not in the Mail</B></i>
<P>
What is it about the Post Office that promotes antisocial behavior?
 Postal union presidents are lambasting Postmaster General Marvin
Runyon in the harshest of terms for &quot;stingily, crassly, and
greedily&quot; postponing a cost of living increase for two weeks.
 The amount withheld from employee paychecks?  Four dollars.
<P>
Postal worker unions typically tie up the legal system by filing
petty complaints - amounting to 7% of the National Labor Relation
Board's entire case load. Forget the rain, sleet, and dark of
night ... a national grievance over a delayed increase of $4.00
is now worth halting mail delivery. 
<P><a name="six"></a>
<i><B>AP Study Finds Unions Abuse OSHA</B></i>
<P>
Employee complaints to OSHA increase during labor unrest, according
to an extensive Associated Press (AP) analysis.  Over a third
of job site inspections prompted by complaints at unionized facilities
turn up no violations at all, says the AP study.  Complaints filed
by nonunion workers are more likely to lead to real safety problems
the study concludes.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - When Even 99% Is Not Enough</B></i>
<P>
The AFL-CIO is complaining about a recent decision by the Clinton
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which went 99% of the way
to gutting important employee protections from union abuses. 
Eight years after the Supreme Court ruled that workers <U>cannot
be forced </U>to pay for the political activities of unions, the
Board issued its first interpretation of the so-called <U>Beck</U>
decision.  Except in the clearest form of political bankrolling,
according to the NLRB, unions are free to spread out their costs
among all members.
<P>
What has the unions so upset is the one part of the case that
went against them.  As AFL-CIO attorney Jon Hiatt said: &quot;Perhaps
the most significant - and distressing - aspect of the decision
is the holding that unions have a legal obligation to affirmatively
tell employees that they do not have to become union members.&quot;
 
<P>
<B>The unions are outraged that employees must be informed that
union membership is a choice, not a mandate.</B>
<P>
National Right-to-Work Committee spokesman Tom McCorville had
these comments regarding the real victims of the case:
<P>
&quot;A string of Supreme Court precedents have been ignored.
 Instead, the Clinton-appointed NLRB has genuflected to Big Labor
in an election year - when employees are most in need of protection
against forced dues politicking.  As far as Big Labor's forced-dues
funded political activities goes, it's business as usual.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The High Price of a Sweeney Presidency</B></i>
<P>
AFL-CIO head John Sweeney promised to spend $35 million on political
activity this year to reportedly &quot;defeat Republicans,&quot;
but he never said where the money was going to come from.  It
now appears that Sweeney's &quot;American Needs a Raise&quot;
campaign will probably come out of the pockets of the rank-and-file
membership.
<P>
The high price of Sweeney's new campaign is in need of a new &quot;spending
stream.&quot; Consequently, a special convention has been called
for in late March to approve a new &quot;assessment&quot; on each
union member to subsidize Sweeney's political action agenda. 
The new &quot;Sweeney Tax&quot; is expected to cost members 15
cents per month (generating $20 million).  Each affiliated union
is expected to kick in a contribution as well.
<P>
Sweeney promised to recruit hundreds of thousands of new members
to invigorate the labor movement.  But it looks like he's going
back to the trough to further milk the rank-and-file membership
in order to subsidize an uninspiring union agenda.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda: Creating Some Havoc</B></i>
<P>
<B>Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The following is the first installment in a case study on how
unions today try to crush those companies that fail to cave in
to their demands.  The case - the seven month old Detroit newspaper
strike.
<P>
Until now, the strike against the <I>Detroit Free Press</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I> has utilized anticipated tactics:  replacement
workers have been terrorized, advertisers have been intimidated,
and NLRB charges have flowed.  The unions have proudly declared
that the newspaper companies have lost substantial amounts of
money, fostered bad will in the community, and the loss of newspaper
circulation will take a long time to rebuild.
<P>
The unions are now exploring ways to &quot;create some havoc -
to find leverage...,&quot; says Teamsters boss Ron Carey. Lately,
activists have been distributing propaganda at the headquarters
of <I>Detroit Free Press</I> parent Knight-Ridder, and its own
flagship paper, <I>The Miami Herald</I>.  Actions against <I>Detroit
News</I> owner Gannett are being promised at its <I>USA Today</I>
headquarters in suburban Washington.  As AFL-CIO leader Rich Trumka
vowed, &quot;We will be moving on a rather nationwide basis to
expose what Gannett is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot; 
<P>
What those moves will be is an indication of how far organized
labor will go in the 1990s to preserve featherbedding and other
rampant union abuses.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Achy Breaky Kneecaps</B></i>
<P>
Billy Ray Cryus' dad is living his own version of the country
singer's smash hit, &quot;Achy Breaky Heart.&quot;  Ron Cyrus
has a number of jobs.  The senior Cyrus is the head of the Kentucky
AFL-CIO, a state Representative for Flatwoods, and Chairman of
the Labor &amp; Industry Committee in the state legislature.
<P>
Ron's latest opus is a bill to prohibit employers from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes in the strike-happy state.
 Billy Ray may make his fans swoon, but Dad appears satisfied
with bringing companies to their knees.
<P><a name="five"></a>
 <i><B>Command and Control Corporate Welfare</B></i>
<P>
Senate Democrats unleashed a set of proposals this week to appease
every ally of their party, while providing a boost to themes echoed
by Labor Secretary Robert Reich and - not surprisingly - principles
found within Labor's &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; campaign.
<P>
The plan, called &quot;Building Allies for America's Working Families,&quot;
links business tax cuts and de-regulation to liberal, anti-business
precepts of class warfare, and statist ideals of  &quot;corporate
social responsibility.&quot;  Of course, the program is saturated
with union promotion.
<P>
In order to qualify for a tax cut, a company must limit CEO pay,
participate in a collectively bargained (union) pension plan utilizing
an employee trustee, invest in employee training on an ongoing
basis, and meet other standards that (for the most part) give
unions and the government control of participating businesses.
 The &quot;Building Allies&quot; program not only echoes AFL-CIO
themes, but is an integral part of the union's rebuilding effort.
 That is why &quot;Building Allies,&quot; in the name of economic
policy to help the struggling middle-class, also calls for treble
damages and debarment against businesses that violate labor laws.
<P>
As one commentator remarked, &quot;'Building Allies' is simply
more public relations gloss on the &quot;Unions Need a Boost&quot;
campaign by the new AFL-CIO leadership.

<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Putting Unions First</B></i>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore paid homage to assembled union leaders
at their annual Bal Harbour, Florida retreat last week.  Mr. Gore
promptly delivered the President's response to union demands.
 The following is a partial score card:

</pre>
<hr>
<P>
The AFL-CIO has set March 25th for its vote on whether to endorse
President Clinton for reelection.
<P><a name="two"></a>
 <B>A Dose of Democracy - Send in the U.N.?</B>
<P>
The Laborers International Union has a rich history of corruption.
 The Justice Department thinks it can change that with a healthy
dose of democracy.  The union has agreed to its first rank-and-file
election of officers, scheduled for September.
<P>
The Laborers leadership agreed to reforms in order to rid the
union of its tainted past of corruption and links to organized
crime, and to avoid a government takeover of its operations. 
The old system was so fraught with cronyism and fraud that a federal
overseer must now spend months devising election rules, teach
union members how to exercise rights they did not previously enjoy,
and monitor 500 local meetings where convention delegates are
selected.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Corporate Campaign Exposed</B>
<P>
Apparently organized labor's concerted effort to bring corporate
America to its knees devolves to the downright petty.  Construction
unions in Boston are trying to shame the Palm Restaurant into
paying prix fixe when a la carte makes more sense.
<P>
The unions are not picketing the site of the new restaurant. 
They are not attacking the company's building permits or filing
frivolous lawsuits.  They are not even trying to block financing
for the project by threatening local bankers.  Rather, <I>The
Wall Street Journal</I> reports that the building trades unions
are threatening the decor of the restaurant to force the Palm
to fire a non-union contractor and submit to build on the union's
terms (at a 38% premium).
<P>
Hoping to decimate the collection of celebrity caricatures which
adorn the walls of each Palm location, the unions are begging
local notables to pull their faces from the walls of the Palm.
 Several have acquiesced  - Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry,
<I>Atlantic Monthly </I>editor Jack Beatty, and legal beagle Alan
Dershowitz.  Some, less sympathetic types, might consider this
urban renewal.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Letter Carriers Are Big Winners in Oregon Vote-by-Mail Election</B></i>
<P>
According to a <I>Washington Times</I>  mention entitled &quot;Delivering
the Vote,&quot; the labor unions were quite pleased (in more ways
than one) with Oregon's recent special election.  The newspaper
notes:
<P>
&quot;The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), AFL-CIO
carried two headlines in its newsletter concerning Ron Wyden's
recent election to the Senate.  &quot;Letter Carriers Major Factor
in Wyden Oregon Senate Win,&quot; the NALC bulletin said.  &quot;Vote-by-Mail
Balloting Receives Praise.&quot;   
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO Charged with Crossing the Line in Campaign Activity</B></i>
<P>
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) filed a
complaint last week with the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
charging that &quot;PROJECT '95&quot; - an AFL-CIO special campaign
 - violated the law because its goals were to defeat House Republicans
using union members' dues.  The NRCC charges that the AFL-CIO
was engrossed in &quot;active electioneering&quot; in Federal
campaigns.  House Republicans on the PROJECT '95 target list were
saturated with radio and television advertising, and other outreach
activities in their congressional districts.  According to the
NRCC though, PROJECT '95 was coordinated with the Democratic Party
- the list of targeted House Republicans was distributed at a
key meeting of assembled House Democrats.
<P>
&quot;The AFL-CIO's PROJECT '95...misused the dues paid by the
hard-working men and women who belong to the member unions,&quot;
states a NRCC press release.  The NRCC also charges that AFL-CIO
chief John Sweeny's proclamation that the union will use $35 million
of its treasury to defeat Republicans in 1996 also violates federal
election law.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Fox in the Henhouse</B></i>
<P>
The name Sarah Fox is soon to become synonymous with the most
cynical form of union power grab.
<P>
Under attack for three years for politicizing the National Labor
Relations Board, the Administration pushed the envelope further
by naming Ted Kennedy's chief labor strategist to a recess appointment.
 Acting in the dead of night with questionable legal authority,
President Clinton installed the legislative specialist in the
role of labor law judge for a &quot;temporary&quot; appointment
for up to two years.
<P>
Control of the Labor Board gives the unions an opportunity to
revitalize their agenda.  Through selective enforcement of the
labor laws, complicity in union harassment campaigns and abolition
of long-standing employer protections, the pro-union NLRB will
seek to shift the balance of power clearly in favor of labor.
 Not to mention the fact that the Board rules on allegations of
unlawful union conduct as well.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Reich Rhetoric</B></i>
<P>
The key solution to &quot;our greatest remaining challenge&quot;
is a strong union movement.  That is the declaration of Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich in an official publication from his
Department.
<P>
Citing a host of newly discovered evils in the economy, Reich
declares, &quot;Closing the gap between paychecks and profits
is our greatest remaining challenge.&quot;  In addition to the
usual liberal solutions of raising the minimum wage and spending
more on training, Reich offers these telling steps:  <B>Enforcing
the Nation's labor laws</B> (against employers) and <B>Maintaining
a strong labor union movement.</B>
<P>
He states, &quot;Building strength through numbers is perhaps
the most important way workers can boost their bargaining power
in order to earn a family wage.&quot;  <I><B>Translation:  </B></I>Pandering
to union leaders in official Labor Department documents is perhaps
the most important way for Bill Clinton to secure labor's endorsement.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Big Labor's Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B> Corporate Campaigns . . . Extortion by any other name</B>
<P>
Anywhere else but under the labor laws, actions to disrupt work,
run up costs and intentionally drive the company out of business
would be considered both criminal and tortuous.  But because unions
are considered &quot;special,&quot; the rules of law do not apply
to their so-called corporate campaigns.
<P>
The Electrical Workers describe their goal as follows:  &quot;to
threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to
cause the employer to...raise his prices to recoup additional
costs, scale back his business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction,
go out of business, and so on.&quot;  (<I>IBEW Union Organizing
Manual)</I>
<P>
Again...extortion by any other name. 
<P><a name="four"></a>
<I><B>Two Wrongs Make a Filibuster</B></I>
<P>
Remember the scene in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;
in which Jimmy Stewart filibusters for hours <U>against </U>corruption
and wrong.  On behalf of the unions, Democrats are filibustering
the Labor Department funding bill in <U>support</U> of wrongdoing.
<P>
That bill in the Senate has a provision that would block enforcement
of President Clinton's Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors
from hiring permanent replacements for strikers.  The Order was
recently ruled <U>illegal </U>by a federal court - but organized
labor's friends keep filibustering.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Unions Decline Further, </B></i>
<P>
<B>Except When Government is There</B>
<P>
Union membership continues to decline, this time by 300,000 workers
in 1994 to below 15% of the work force.  Where do unions remain
strongest? In industries with the closest relationship to government.
<P>
Federal, state and local governments employ about 6.9 million
union members, or about 37.8% of public employment.  In the private
sector, heavily regulated industries such as transportation and
public utilities had the highest level of unionization at 27%.
 Construction followed with 18%, helped in large part by the Davis-Bacon
Act and other laws which inflate public construction costs and
protect unions from competition.
<P>
Labor's former stronghold, manufacturing, continued its rapid
decline, suffering fully one-fourth of the overall loss in union
members for the year.  Not surprisingly, manufacturing in recent
years has moved further away from cohabitation with government
toward free competition.

<h2>
 Clinton probably won't be a TEAM player<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen kerrigan</a>

<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- By far, the most effective and beneficial trend
in recent decades has been the empowerment of workers through
participation in quality circles, safety committees and other
&quot;teams.&quot;  While hundreds of businesses use the team
approach -- which allows managment and employees to confer over
issues of mutual concern and interest -- recent rulings by the
National Labor Relations Board have many employers concerned that
teams violate existing labor laws.
<P>
To correct the bias of the Depression-era law, both Houses of
Congress passed the TEAM, or Teamwork for Employees and Managers
Act -- legislation that creates a safe harbor for workers and
management to confer over issues of shared interest.
<P>
Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it an
unfair labor practice for an employer to &quot;dominate or interfere
with the formation or administration of any labor organization
or contribute financial or other support to it...&quot;  The purpose
of the law then, was to outlaw sham unions created by a company
to avoid true unionization of the employer's workplace.
<P>
In the ensuing six decades since the law was written, the workplace
has experience tremendous changes, thus making the Depression-era
law outdated and restrictive.  In 1992, the NLRB ruled that many
cooperative teams are illegal in nonunion settings.  Critics claim
that the board ignored the fact that teams are established to
address important business concerns such as quality or production.
 Worker-management cooperative teams that took up topics such
as wages, hours and working conditions, traditionally the domain
of labor unions, were treated under the law in the same manner
as if managment had created a full-blown company union.  Numerous
other decisions have further narrowed the usefulness of teams.
<P>
Organized labor opposes the TEAM Act, claiming it allows for the
formation of company-sponsored unions while hindering union organizing.
 Supports of the act vehemently disagree.  They say it provides
an outlet for employees to express their concerns and offer opinions
when no union is on the scene.  And, with only 11 percent of the
private work force represented by unions, the number of workers
who could participate in the team concept is considerable.
<P>
David Thompson, Workplace Counsel for the Washington-based Business
Leadership Council, says passage of the TEAM Act by the Congress
represents a clear turning point in workplace policy.
<P>
&quot;We are glad to see that the House and Senate both rejected
the charge of union leaders that company efforts to solve problems
through consensus were part of a vicious plot to institute company
unions,&quot; says Thompson.
<P>
According to Thompson, labor leaders will oppose any effort to
modernize the law because it weakens their political influence
and sends them down the road to irrelevancy.
<P>
&quot;Workers and management understand the need for companies
to prosper in order to stay competitive in this highly-competitive
global economy.  That is why workplace cooperatio through the
team approach is so popular,&quot; adds Thompson.
<P>
Sen. Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond, Rmo., chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, hailed the passage of the TEAM Act by
the Senate as a major victory for small business.
<P>
&quot;This is a common-sense measure that provides those 90 percent
of employees in America who do not belong to labor unions a stronger
voice in their workplace,&quot; he noted.
<P>
The TEAM Act will make its way to the White House, but President
Clinton has promised union leaders that he will veto the bill.
 The business community has responded that the veto would represent
more political pandering to labor leaders in exchange for the
exorbitant sums of money they are putting into key congressional
races to defeat Republicans.
<P>
Thompson of the BLC says it's a sad commentary on the state of
political affairs when the president of the United States would
hold back the growth, productivity and competitiveness of American
business in order to appease special interests.
<P>
Bond agrees and adds that President Clinton's failure to sign
the TEAM Act into law would prove beyond any doubt that he is
no friend of the small-business entrepreneur.

 Business Would Suffer Under Chemical Weapons<BR>
</h2>
<p>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- On or before September 14, 1996, the U.S. Senate
will vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) -- a
treaty with lofty goals to rid the world of chemical weapons.
 Meanwhile, thousands of American businesses are still unaware
that they will be forced to help end the production and stockpiling
of these treacherous weapons.  
<P>
For the first time in U.S. history, businesses using chemicals
for legitimate commercial purposes would be subject to international
inspections conducted by an agency falling under the umbrella
of the United Nations.
<P>
Opponents of the CWC are not only concerned that thousands of
small and medium-sized businesses would have to comply with extra-stringent
reporting requirements, but also question whether the treaty would
stop the proliferation, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
<P>
It is not only the big chemical companies that fall under the
treaty's new regulatory requirements, but small and medium-sized
ones that will be required to fill out burdensome paperwork and
host international bureaucrats through on-site inspections.
<P>
 Paint manufacturers, distilleries, automotive, biotechnology,
pharmaceutical, textiles, food processing and cosmetic companies
for example, could fall under the CWCW as a result of the chemicals
they use for legitimate manufacturing purposes.
<P>
According to information supplies to the Senate by the Arms Central
and Disarmament Agency, between 3,000 and 8,000 companies will
be affected by the treaty.
<P>
While several government agencies reviewing CWC document the cost
of the new treaty at $200 million per year, many experts conclude
that the costs will be much higher.  
<P>
Baker Spring of the Heritage Foundation suggest that the indirect
costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential
information are difficult to estimate, but &quot;billions in losses
are not out of the question.&quot;
<P>
Businesses covered by the CWC treaty would have to submit reports
to a new U.N. body called the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons on each chemical they use.  It is estimated
that the paperwork will take a firm about nine hours for each
&quot;Schedule 1&quot; chemical its production process uses, 7.2
hours for each &quot;Schedule 2&quot; chemical, and 2.5 hours
for each Schedule 3 chemical it uses.  
<P>
Many businesses both large and small use hundreds if not thousands
of chemicals in their manufacturing process.  Under the CWC, affected
businesses will be subjected to two types of inspection -- routine
and challenge.  The Defense Department estimates that large companies
could incur costs as high as $500,000 per inspection and small
firms may incur costs between $10,000 - $20,000.  Each business
inspected also must pick up the tab for the inspectors meals and
lodging.  
<P>
The inspectors would represent various countries signing the CWC,
but not the United States. 
<P>
 Besides sharing proprietary business information with international
inspectors, inspections may also involve production shutdown.
 Private businesses just learning of CWC implications are concerned
that such visits may compromise confidential business information
and produce significant costs.  
<P>
One medium-size company alerted the Senate that they use over
5,000 different chemicals in their production process of household
products and that the reporting system would impose a significant
administrative burden.  
<P>
Most disconcerting, though, is the claim by foreign policy experts
that rogue countries that harbor chemical weapons are not planning
to sign the treaty.  As non-signatories to the treaty, countries
such as Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, Syria and the Republic of China
will not be bound by CWC's provisions. 
<P>
 At the same time, American businesses will pay a huge price and
suffer real losses for a treaty whose goals cannot be met because
rogue countries will continue to stockpile and produce chemical
weapons.

<blockquote>
<hr>
The one thing that annoys business owners about Washington, D.C.
is the fact that they often find out about a new rule or regulation
well after it has been signed into law.  Most recently, thousands
of small and medium-sized businesses have been receiving notices
from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about a new law passed
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which requires
more businesses to start filing their payroll taxes electronically
by January 1, 1997.<BR>

<P>
An unrelated provision to the 1993 NAFTA legislation required
that the federal government build a nationwide Electronic Federal
Tax Payment System (EFTPS) in order to receive federal depository
taxes electronically.  The new program began with 800 of the largest
U.S. businessses on January 1, 1995, and 800 more were added to
the mandated system at the beginning of 1996.  On January 1, 1997,
1.2 million more businesses were slated to become mandated electronic
filers.  That deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 due to
the efforts of Senator Kit Bond (R-MO), Chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, and other business allies on Capitol
Hill.<BR>

<P>
According to phase-in requirements of the IRS' EFTPS, businesses
whose aggregate federal payroll tax deposits exceding $50,000
must begin depositing these taxes electronically.  The IRS began
informing small companies of the requirement with the following
notice: &quot;YOU MUST ENROLL AND DEPOSIT ELECTRONICALLY.&quot;
 To all the recipients of the IRS mailing, the notice came from
out of the blue.<BR>

<P>
When small businesses started complaining to members of Congress
about the surprise notices, Senator Bond and others stepped in
to help those targeted by the fast approaching deadline.  In a
July 24 letter sent to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and IRS
Commissioner Margaret Richardson, Sen. Bond wrote that many small
busineses did not understand what the IRS notice meant in practical
terms.  Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-AK), ranking minority member of the
committee, co-signed the letter.<BR>

<P>
Senator Bond said that some small businesses in response to the
notices thought that the IRS would start &quot;debiting bank accounts
without taxpayer permission, while others believe that they must
invest in new computer and telephone systems in order to conduct
the transfers.&quot;<BR>

<P>
In another letter to Senator William Roth (R-DE), Chairman of
the Senate Committee on Finance, over thirty business organizations
-- including the American Payroll Association -- expressed concern
that the EFTPS system will not be prepared to handle over 1.3
million new electronic filers.  In addition, the business groups
assert that the IRS is not adequately education those obligated
to electronically file.<BR>

<P>
For example, the letter points out that in a recent meeting of
over 600 Certified Public Accountants held in Boston, not one
of the attendees knew of the mandate.  In addition, a survey city
by the letter confirms that most of the businesses falling under
the next phase-in are unaware of the new filing commitment --
over 70% of &quot;soon-to-be mandated taxpayers are not aware
of these requirements.&quot;  Also, spot calls of IRS district
offices have revealed that the tax-collecting agency's employees
are not even aware of the new requirements.<BR>

<P>
According to Sen. Bond, the need for the IRS to communicate more
effectively with small business taxpayers falls under the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) which became
law in March.  Under SBREFA, federal agencies are supposed to
publish regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot; so that small
businesses can comply with the law.<BR>

<P>
Following the various letter writing campaigns to the IRS and
key committee chairman, the IRS published a Legislative Fact Sheet
on July 29.  In that four page summary, the IRS provides an overview
of the EFTPS in a question &amp; answer format.<BR>

<P>
Even so, for some business groups and others opposed to the phase-in
requirement, the new mandate will create a major new cost burden
that will disrupt many businesses.  Also, of the two options offered
by the IRS for electronic payment -- Automated Clearing House
&quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Debit&quot; -- many small businesses
may not be able to select the credit option because local and
rural banks are not equipped to offer it.<BR>

<P>
Most problematic however is the fact the IRS and the Treasury
Department will not test the system first to determine if it will
properly work.  The business organizations writing to Congress
estimate that about 2 million businesses will be required to enroll
in the system, which means that financial agents will be processing
16,600 enrollments per day.  And if each taxpayer has two questions,
the IRS will be answering about 33,000 inquiries per day.<BR>

<P>
Under the new Small Business Jobs Protections Act passed early
August (the bill that hiked the minimum wage), the January 1997
deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 so that businesses
can more fully understand how to comply with the new electronic
filing law.  The extension also gives the IRS more time to fully
educated small business, banks, payroll processors, and accountants
about the procedure.<BR>

<P>
Those businesses with less than $50,000 in payroll taxes may want
to take this opportunity to find out more about the requirements
-- 1999 the requirement drops to $20,000.<BR>

<P>
Is the IRS capable of answering questions that hundreds of thousands
of businesses will have about filing electronically, and will
they be prepared to fully implement the program on July 1, 1997?
 According to question #14 on their recent Legislative Update,
if a taxpayer does not understand the enrollment process, form
or instructions, they can call 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-945-8400.

<h2>Chairman of House Small Business Committee A True
Champion<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr>
<br>
 Recently I had the opportunity to talk with the
Chairman of the House Small Business Committee. The topic was
the accomplishments of the 104th Congress regarding small business
issues.  Chairman Jan Meyers (R-KS) was proud of the record of
the 104th Congress, but expressed frustration with President Clinton
as many of the small business initiatives fell victim to his veto
pen.<BR>
<P>
The frustration stems from the fact that key tax
and regulatory reforms had &quot;enough support to pass both Houses
of Congress.&quot;  In addition, all of the reforms were priorities
that were recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business
-- an event called for by the President.  For example, legislation
to cut capital gains taxes, tort reform, increased expensing for
small businesses, and estate-tax reform, were passed by the House
and Senate (some by large margins with bipartisan majorities)
but rejected by the President.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers identified several reasons why more ground
wasn't won on behalf of small business.  For one, the Republicans
lost the media battle on key issues.  Also, the President portrayed
small business legislation as dangerous and unfair.  &quot;It's
difficult for us to respond to his type of bullypulpit,&quot;
stated Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Many members of Congress feel that both the press
and the President successfully depicted Republican-led reforms
as &quot;extreme.&quot;  The multi-million dollar ad campaigns
sponsored by organized labor and environmental groups echoed this
theme.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The tax issue is especially easy to demagogue,&quot;
says Meyers.  The Chairman refers to the fact that it is easy
to communicate in a ten-second sound bite that something &quot;benefits
the rich&quot;  According to Meyers its more difficult to quickly
articulate how cutting capital gains taxes provides job-creating
small businesses with access to capital to help start or grow
their enterprises.<BR>
<P>
Despite some of the criticism that Meyers has for
the President, she's more upbeat than critical and feels that
the Congress has indeed advanced the small business agenda on
Capitol Hill.  For one, she has changed the focus of the Small
Business Committee to actually focus on small business issues.
 The Committee's agenda is not random or personal, but one driven
by the needs of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;We went to the small business community to
see what is important to them -- then we went after these issues,&quot;
says Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Small business owners and various groups in Washington
representing the small business community feel welcome in Rayburn
2359 -- the committee hearing room where all the action takes
place.  Scores of small business owners and entrepreneurs have
been invited to testify before the Committee to deliver their
personal accounts of how they have been impacted by regulation
and taxes, or how they would benefit or possibly be hurt by legislation
before the Congress.<BR>
<P>
 And Meyers is proud that some pieces of legislation
originating in her Committee were signed into law by the President.
 For one, the Regulatory Flexibility Act has been strengthened
to protect small businesses from burdensome regulations.  The
strengthening of the Act will make, &quot;regulatory agencies
look more closely at rules and regulations and their impact on
small businesses before they put them out,&quot; states Meyers.
<BR>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Meyers, the health care
tax credit given to small businesses was increased from 25% to
30% and made permanent.  &quot;It was wrong for small businesses
to come to Congress each year and beg to have this credit extended.
 They couldn't plan for the future,&quot; she says.<BR>
<P>
 The Paperwork Reduction Act was also signed into
law requiring that the federal government reduce the paperwork
burden on Americans by 10% in its first year, and 5% annually
thereafter.<BR>
<P>
 The Committee has jurisdiction over the Small Business
Administration (SBA), and Meyers reports that they have been able
to trim the size of the agency &quot;without taking away a single
program of vital importance to small business.&quot;  The SBA's
budget was trimmed from $800 million to $500 million with its
popular loan programs intact.  The Chairman's goal was to provide
diligent oversight of the SBA loan program to ensure it remains
sound with a relatively low loss rate.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers has served on the Committee since 1985, and
admits that their are tough challenges ahead both for the Congress
and small business.  Earlier this year, she announced her retirement
from Congress and hopes to tackle one more issue before her departure..
 That issue is the SBA's 8(a) program -- a program that awards
contracts to minority-owned business noncompetitively.  Meyers
feels the program is riddled with fraud and abuse, and directly
contradicts the recent <U><I>Adarand</I></U> decision by the Supreme
Court.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers believes that the program began with good
intentions, but is now out of control.  According to Meyers, of
the $4.37 billion awarded in 8(a) contracts, only 9% are awarded
competitively.  The government can save taxpayers over $1 billion
if these contracts were competitively bid.  The Government Accounting
Office (GAO) reports that the 8(a) program has failed to foster
self-sufficiency for its small business participants.  According
to a GAO report, &quot;SBA's success in helping disadvantaged
firms to become self-sufficient and competitive was minimal...many
firms relied on 8(a) contracts and viewed the program an end in
itself.&quot;<BR>
<P>
 Meyers admits that because she has decided to tackle
this issue -- her preference is to abolish the 8(a) program --
she may leave Congress on a controversial note.  But Meyers feels
she has an obligation to address the issue.  &quot; I don't feel
comfortable leaving Congress without addressing this costly problem&quot;
she says.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Whatever note she happens to leave on, the small
business community in Washington is unanimous that Chairman Meyers
has been a champion of small business during the 104th Congress.

<H2>Cost Of Government Makes July 3 A Special Day</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr><p>
<blockquote>
On July 4, the United States celebrates its independence from Britain. On the same day, a Washington-based group says, Americans can celebrate their independence from having just paid their share of the cost of government.
<p>
Americans for Tax Reform, a government watchdog and taxpayer advocacy organization, figures that Americans spend more than half the calendar year working for the government. Cost of Government Day according to ATR, "is the date of the calendar year on which the average American has earned enough gross income to pay off all his or her direct and hidden taxes" - hidden taxes being the cost of regulation.
<p>
AU federal, state and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in Cost of Government Day. Although much of the public has become familiar with Tax Freedom Day - calculated by the Tax Foundation as the date when the average American's  earnings cover her tax bill - ATR believes it is important to include regulatory costs as well.
<p>
Cost of Government Day is calculated to help people understand the combined cost of the tax and regulatory burden. "The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes. Regulations are essentially hidden taxes," says ATR President Grover Norquist.
<p>
According to the group, regulations are passed on to the consumer in the  of higher prices. Also, most economists acknowledge that regulatory costs are passed along from employers to employees in the  of lower wages while constraining a business's ability to invest and grow.
<p>
ATR has calculated the cost of government in 1996 at $3.38 trillion. That breaks down to $13,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Of that total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and state regulation. The federal government alone accounts for more than $739 billion in hidden regulatory costs (more than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America).
<p>
According to ATR, the total cost of state and local regulations is vastly underestimated because no quantifiable data has been assembled to account for all costs. For example, the costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety and consumer protection are not included.
<p>
The cost of federal regulations, however, has been calculated by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins, a leading authority on regulatory costs. Recently Hopkins conducted a study for the U.S. Small Business Administration documenting the impact of regulations on smaller companies. Hopkins found that the average federal regulatory cost per worker in smaller firms is three-quarters higher than for larger businesses.
<p>
And when businesses are surveyed, they consistently bemoan the burdensome nature of regulations. For example:
<ul>
<li>In March, the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis reported that 52 percent of midsize companies surveyed said government regulation is their biggest challenge.
<li>In a recent survey of small manufacturers conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers, nearly half reported that regulations had prevented their hiring new workers.
<li>The SBA says that small-business owners spend 1 billion hours each year filling out government forms at a cost of $100 billion.
</ul>
Although most surveys have found that Americans believe federal regulations do more harm than good, this sentiment has not translated into a major regulatory overhaul in the federal government.
<p>
In fact, just the opposite has occurred. The Clinton administration's regulatory budget has
grown much faster than federal spending. And between 1989 and 1992 - during the Bush administration - the government burden on small business increased more than 34 percent, according to the House Joint Economic Committee.
<p>
Not only are businesses saddled with higher costs due to increased regulations, but county governments will be forced to spend almost $3 billion by 1998 to comply with mandates imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to estimates by the National Association of Counties.
<p>
Still, the ATR's Norquist believes Cost of Government Day will eventually roll backward instead of forward.
<p>
"While the new Congress has been attacked by defenders of the status quo for wanting to reform regulations and cut taxes for working families and small businesses, ATR believes we have only seen the beginning of the debate to overhaul the tax system, trim the size of government, and relieve Americans of burdensome regulations."
<p>
The 1996 elections will be a referendum on the size and scope of government, he believes.
<p>
While most Americans will be observing the country's independence on the Fourth of July, ATR hopes they also will observe what the government has cost them on July 3. According to Norquist, being informed is the first step to helping his group move Cost of government Day several days backward each year.

<blockquote>
What government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by many groups. And it's beginning to get even more attention.
<p>
According to the Washington-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this Year. That date marks the point at which the average American's earnings covered his or her tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person has not finished paying the government until July 3. Now, a Michigan-based group wants to remind workers how much government costs each pay period by including the information on payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups have warned that increased regulation and taxation mean employers must pass costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The right-to-know form shows how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts for each employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Beyond the usual pay-stub information of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes:
<ul>
<li>The employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
<li>The employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs.
<li>The costs of administering the taxes.
<li>The costs of complying with state and federal personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
</ul>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So, for most businesses, the right-to-know effort hits only the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community has responded positively to the Mackinac project. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to implement the.system right now."
<p>
The center launched their effort on Tax Freedom Day and continues to recruit employers to use the system.
<p>
In addition to employers in the private sector, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan. Starting in July, more than 60,000 state employees will receive revised pay stubs documenting how much money it takes to keep them on the payroll.
<p>
The new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the data for a right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions shown on the typical pay stub, the form lists all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative cost of compliance are included.
<p>
The employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the right-to-know program; both employers and employees benefit. 
<p>
Workers understand better how government-imposed mandates affect job creation and growth. Employers understand better how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay.
<p>
For small companies, this is especially critical because they feel more harshly the effects of mandates and taxes.

The amount that government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by a variety of groups.
<p>
According to the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this year.

"Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending.

<p>
Now, a Michigan-based group, wants to remind workers how much government costs them each pay period by including this information on employee payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
The Mackinac Center says that workers will benefit from the new pay stub because it shows employees the cost of government programs and mandates.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups lamenting the size and scope of government have warned the public that increased regulation and taxation mean that employers have to pass these costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The Right to Know Form breaks down those costs by showing how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts per employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Although pay stubs already show the employee's share of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes other costs. These unseen costs include the employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes; the employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs; the costs of administering such taxes; and the costs of complying with state and federal, personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
<p>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So for most businesses, the right to know effort only hits the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community's response to the Mackinac project has been positive. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to
implement the system right now."
<p>
The Mackinac Center launched the effort on Tax Freedom Day and is actively recruiting employers. Although many employers in the private sector have called the center to pledge their adoption of the payroll form, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan.
<p>
Starting in July, more than 60,000 employees of the state will receive revised pay stubs, which will document how much is paid to keep them on the payroll. While Michigan did not include all Right to Know Payroll Form recommendations, the new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the cost data to use for a firm's own right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions that are shown on the typical pay stub, the Right to Know form extends payroll accounting to include all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative burden of complying with such costs are included.
<p>
Firms participating in the program have used accountants and tax and benefits managers to calculate these costs to determine the average cost per employee. Once the costs are estimated, they are added to the gross pay to produce an Estimated Payroll Allocation.
<p>
On the form, the employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the Right to Know program, both employers and employees benefit. Workers will better understand how government-imposed mandates impact job creation and growth.
<p>
Also, employees will better understand how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay. For small firms, this is especially critical as mandates and taxes are more harshly felt by this sector of the economy.

<H2>Wage Hike Won't Help The Poor But Will Hurt Business</H2><br>

<p>
<blockquote>
Who would have thought our nation's small businesses would be facing a mandated increase in their labor costs under a Republican-controlled Congress? President Clinton had the opportunity to push through a minimum-wage increase during his first two years in office, but chose not to.
<p>
But the politics of an election year are shifting into high gear, and each party is looking for ways to shore up its base of support. For the Democrats, an increase in the minimum wage is the perfect way to show the American public that they care about the working class. It also ensures that the labor unions will continue to support the Democrats' campaign to win back control of Congress.
<p>
Increasing the minimum wage will do little to help the working poor in America, but the emotional appeal of the issue obviously benefits the party that is pushing it. To that extent, the Republicans don't want to appear uncaring, so they're working to craft a package they feel will more adequately respond to the needs of the working poor.
<p>
But first, some of the facts regarding who benefits from an increase in the minimum wage:
<ul>
<li> According to the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group of Democrats that Clinton once headed, more than 70 percent of minimum-wage workers are in families that are well above the poverty level. Nearly 40 percent of the workers are in families with incomes in the top half of the income distribution.
<li>Of the 1.96 million workers who earned the minimum wage in 1995, 59 percent were 24 years old or younger, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<li>Analyzing the 12 million workers who make between $4.25 and $5.15 an hour (the proposed new wage), the Employment Policy Institute found that only 9 percent of these workers are married and their families' sole wage earner. Only 3 percent are single parents.
<li> Also, according to Employment Policy Institute, the average wage of minimum-wage workers increases from $4.25 to $6.08 an hour within a year.
</ul>
Wage-hike proponents say that the minimum wage is at a 40-year low. But this declaration, made often by Labor Secretary Robert Reich, compares apples to oranges. Forty years ago, the minimum wage applied mostly to skilled jobs in manufacturing and transportation - restaurant and retail jobs were exempt. Reich and his fellow wage-hike crusaders are essentially comparing the pay of skilled workers yesterday to unskilled workers today.
<p>
Of course, the small-business lobby in Washington is not surprised that it must continue to fight wage-hike proposals. According to an industry representative fighting against the wage increase, "The American public continue to support an increase in the starting wage because it's a feel-good proposal. Unfortunately, most Americans do not understand the harmful effects of artificial wage hikes - they cost jobs and cause price increases for the working poor."
<p>
The Democratic Leadership Council appears to agree. In a recent position paper on the wage increase, the council asserts that "the costs of an increase ... would be borne disproportionately by lower-income families" because they would be forced to pay higher prices. The council calls this a "regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group of people that is predominately nonpoor."
<p>
Recognizing this dynamic, one Republican freshman has come up with a creative idea to allow minimum-wage workers to keep more of their pay rather than allowing the government to eat away at their wages.
<p>
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., proposes allowing minimum-wage earners to keep the payroll taxes that are currently withheld from their paychecks. McIntosh is calling his increase proposal the Minimum Wage Tax Cut. According to the freshman member, the proposal would increase the take-home pay of those earning the minimum wage without causing the job losses that a government-mandated wage hike would produce. It's estimated that an increase in the minimum wage would cost the economy 300,000 to 500,000 jobs.
<p>
McIntosh's proposal would cut federal taxes for workers earning between $4.25 and $5.25 an hour by allowing them to keep federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes - now deducted from their paychecks. The proposal would raise workers' net hourly rate to $4.57, compared with the current $3.76 when federal withholdings are deducted.
<p>
"What proponents of raising the minimum wage to $5.15 don't tell you is that after federal taxes are deducted, workers will only take home $4.56 an hour," McIntosh said. "By avoiding government-mandated wages, taxes can be cut for minimum-wage earners and their weekly paychecks will increase," he added.
<p>
Early estimates of the McIntosh proposal by the Congressional Budget Office show that it could cost $8 billion to $10 billion annually. To make up the difference, McIntosh proposed cutting federal welfare by 10 percent, amounting to $9 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 90-cent wage increase will cost businesses about $12.5 billion over five years.
<p>
But whatever the wage hike will cost the business community, most of the evidence proves that the real losers would be lower-skilled workers who become priced out of the labor market.

<H2>Small Businesses Fighting For Medical Accounts</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
Another health-care reform battle is brewing on Capitol Hill. But rather than fighting against employer mandates, small-business organizations and their allies are fighting to include medical savings accounts in health-care legislation this year.
<p>
What is an MSA? An employer takes a portion of funds currently spent on health insurance and deposits it into an MSA - up to $2,000 for an individual or $4,000 for a family.
<p>
The money can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Some can be used to purchase a catastrophic policy covering all medical expenses after a deductible is met. And, at the end of the year, the insured can keep any unused MSA funds.
<p>
This provides an incentive for the insured to shop around for healthcare needs - injecting much-needed competition into an industry in which the third-party payment system has left the consumer with no incentive to spend less.
<p>
Under the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996 passed by the House of Representatives, individuals and the self-employed could deduct from their federal taxes 100 percent of the funds deposited in their MSAs. This would be in addition to the 35 percent of a catastrophic policy premium they are already allowed to deduct.
<p>
This feature, say MSA advocates, would make individual taxes fairer in comparison to what corporations pay. And tax equity, combined with the portability feature, would help
solve the "job-lock" problem experienced by so many Americans who want to change jobs.
<p>
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in the Senate does not include an MSA provision. Key Democrats have said MSAs were too controversial to include, and they are aggressively working to make sure that MSAs are kept out.
<p>
MSAs have long been supported by small business. At the White House Conference on Small Business in June 1995, the adoption of MSAs was a key recommendation delegates sent to the president and Congress. In fact, it's estimated that nearly 3,000 businesses - mostly small and medium - are currently using an MSA prototype.
<p>
Evidence reveals that MSAs help reduce health-insurance costs for businesses, while giving employees greater physician choice and control over health-care spending.
<p>
That's why MSA supporters are baffled at flip flops-taken by politicians who have been long-time supporters. In particular, minority leaders Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., in the House and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., in the Senate are leading the charge against MSAs, despite the fact that both were champions of MSAs in the previous Congress.
<p>
Less than two years ago, when asked about the prospect of MSAs being included in health-care reform, Gephardt responded, "Absolutely. This is an idea the Ways and Means Committee has worked-on for three or four years. It's very popular . . . I think it's a great option."
<p>
In fact, MSAs unanimously passed the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress. Every member of the committee, with the exception of one Democrat, voted for them. In the current Congress MSAs were included in the bipartisan balanced-budget package sent to President Clinton, which he subsequently vetoed.
<p>
Just recently, Sen. Daschle referred to MSAs as the "Dr. Kevorkians of health reform, but in the last Congress he cosponsored the Medical Cost Containment Act of 1992, which according to the legislation, "would allow employers to provide their employees with an annual allowance in a Medical Care Savings Account to pay for routine health-care needs."
<p>
MSA advocates say the flip-flops exhibited by Daschle and Gephardt smack more of partisan politics than a newfound skepticism of MSAs.
<p>
"This is what the American people hate about Washington," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a longtime advocate of MSAs.
<p>
"Because some Democrats view this as a simple case of Republicans getting credit for a popular reform, they are stonewalling with the hope of receiving some sort of partisan gain," Norquist added.
<p>
With recent reports showing that proposals like Kennedy-Kassebaum have been an abysmal failure in states that have enacted similar reforms - such as the total collapse of the health-insurance system in Washington state - antics on Capitol Hill to kill MSAs may backfire.
<p>
According to MSA advocates, a grassroots revolution is brewing in favor of the reform, especially among small businesses and the self-employed. Indeed, President Clinton is attempting to reach out to constituencies that he has not been too popular with in the past. The support of MSAs may be one of those issues he finally embraces.

<H2>'A-Corps' Plan Would Hobble Small Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Democrats and Republicans are both marketing themselves as job creators and wage boosters, placing American business at the center of their policy prescriptions. Their proposed solutions, though, are ideological opposites.
<p>
To Republicans, the key to robust economic growth, higher wages and more jobs lies in providing businesses with significant tax and regulatory relief.
<p>
Their solutions also include giving individuals the widest options available for obtaining financial security, education and training, and benefits such as health care through the equalization of tax benefits.
<p>
Democrats believe American business won't help workers on its own and that the federal government must provide the incentives to encourage business to do so.
<p>
According to Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, "If we want companies to do things which do not necessarily improve the returns to shareholders, but which are beneficial for the economy and society as a whole . . . we have to give business an economic reason to do so."
<P>
But rather than provide all businesses with across-the-board tax and regulatory relief, proposals being offered by Reich and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate would reduce taxes and regulations only for companies that achieve "certain minimum requirements."
<p>
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Task Force on High Wage Jobs, recently released a package of proposals aimed at alleviating economic insecurity and wage stagnation.
<p>
The report, titled "Scrambling to Pay the Bills: Building Allies for American Working Families," would provide businesses with favorable tax and regulatory treatment if they meet certain tests established by the federal government.
<p>
"A-Corps" businesses would be required, for example, to meet some of the following standards: 
<ul>
<li>Contribute an amount equal to at least 3 percent of payroll to pension plans.
<li>Commit an amount equal to at least 2 percent of payroll for employee training.
<li>Offer all U.S. employees a health-care plan approved by the government. Employers would have to pay at least 50 percent of the plan's cost.
<li>Give employees the option of participating in a profit-sharing, stock option or stock ownership plan. An employee-elected trustee would manage the plan.
<li>Place caps on compensation for the chief executive officer and other employees.
<li>Make sure at least 90 percent of plant and equipment purchases, and employment costs resulting from product and service production, delivery and consumption in the United States occurred in the United States.
<li>Meet or exceed all occupational, safety and environmental standards.
<li>Pay dues and belong to an industry association approved by the Department of Commerce.
</ul>
Businesses meeting the criteria would be given a favorable tax rate, their current corporate income tax replaced with a "business activities tax." Under a BAT plan, payments companies make to other businesses, including the purchase of new equipment and plant construction, are subtracted from taxable income. Only imports would be taxed.
<p>
A-Corps participants would receive a lower tax rate than nonparticipating businesses, though the proposal doesn't specify what those rates might be. However, under the BAT system, small businesses with gross annual receipts of $100,000 would be exempted from the tax.
<p>
In terms of regulatory relief for A-Corps participants, businesses would still be required to meet all federal laws, but could get quicker review and decision-making from federal agencies; participate in voluntary compliance programs; and take advantage of safe-harbor provisions from certain regulatory requirements.
<p>
Qualified A-Corps companies would also be given special treatment in bidding on government contracts.
<p>
Critics of Bingaman and Reich's approach charge that the "most-favored" corporate method is flawed in that businesses could not possibly participate in the A-Corps program without giving up control to the federal government.
<p>
In addition, they say, the proposal assumes businesses do not value workers - a predisposition that runs counter to reality. An economic policy update issued recently by the Senate Joint Economic Committee contends the "corporate responsibility" proposals would "make workers more dependent on their current employers at a time when public policy should be encouraging individual responsibility through upward mobility and portable benefits."
<p>
In addition, the IEC report argues that these policies would discriminate against small businesses and the self-employed.
<p>
According to the report, "because [small businesses] need to invest in building the business, they're less likely to have the free cash to spend on 'corporate responsibility.'
<p>
Also, says the study, a more prudent course would focus tax benefits on individuals, whether or not they receive health insurance, pension plans and worker training from their employers or elsewhere in the marketplace.
<p>
The best way to help the economy and individuals would be to expand individual retirement accounts, make pensions truly portable by allowing individuals the same tax benefits as company-sponsored plans, enact medical savings accounts and lower the marginal tax rates for all.
<p>
As Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail and in Washington struggle to articulate their competing messages to the American people, small businesses already know what needs to be done to allow their businesses to grow and succeed. Entrepreneurs need help competing against global competitors.

<H2>Finally, Congress Moves To Limit Tax Increases</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Most analysts agree that reviving tax cuts is a political nonstarter this year. Congress approved a balanced-budget package coupled with tax cuts for small business, but it stopped short at President Clinton's desk.
<p>
With April 15 fast approaching millions of small business owners and taxpayers look at the annual ritual with anger and frustration. But certain members of Congress are banding together to make sure that raising taxes will be just as difficult as cutting them.
<p>
On April 15, the House of Representatives will vote on a Tax Limitation Amendment to the Constitution that would require a two-thirds majority vote of each house of Congress to increase taxes. The effort is being led by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, along with a bipartisan group of House members including Pete Geren, D-Texas; Ralph Hall, D-Texas; and John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
<p>
On the same day, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights will hold hearings on a companion resolution to the tax-limiting amendment, introduced by Sen. Jon Kyle, R-Ariz.
<p>
Proponents of the amendment contend a constitutional requirement is absolutely necessary to protect taxpayers from the unending tax increases that followed the adoption of the 16th Amendment in 1913. Before the 16th Amendment was enacted, no income tax was allowed. Since then, federal tax collections have climbed more than 175,000 percent.
<p>
Tax-limitation amendments are not untested. Already, 28 states have some form. Ten have adopted the majority legislative vote to approve higher taxes, and one-third of states require more than a majority, according to Americans for Tax Reform.
<p>
Studies have shown clearly the effect of higher taxes on economic growth. A 1993 study by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress tracking state economies during 1989 to 1993 found:
<ul>
<li>The top 10 income tax-increasing states lost nearly 200,000 jobs from 1989 to 1993. The top 10 income tax-reducing states created nearly 1 million.
<li>Unemployment rose by 2.3 percent in the states that increased taxes the most, but only by .3 percent in the income tax-cutting states.
<li>Income per family of four fell by an average of $600 in the tax-increasing states, and rose $150 in the top 10 tax-cutting states.
</ul>
Tax increases are especially hard for the small-business, entrepreneurial sector, which the United States depends on for creating jobs.
<p>
The 1993 tax hike, for example, was sold as a plan to soak the rich but the majority of those affected were small businesses. A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey found that 28 percent of respondents raised prices, 26 percent postponed expansion plans, 14 percent terminated one employee, and 9 percent were forced to take two of the actions.
<p>
Tax-limiting proponents say the 1993 tax hike never would have made it into the history books if the two-thirds majority requirement had been in place. The increase passed by only one vote in the House and Senate.
<p>
According to Americans for Tax Reform four of the last five tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds majority. They added $666 billion to the tax bill of American taxpayers.
<p>
Does a tax limitation requirement have the support of the public? In 1992, a National Taxpayer's Union Foundation survey found that 78 percent of respondents favored "a constitutional amendment that would- limit the growth of federal taxes."
<p>
More recently, delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business recommended to the president and Congress that a two-thirds majority requirement be adopted.
<p>
Taxpayers may want to tune into C-SPAN April 15 to see which members of Congress argue to limit increases and which members argue for unlimited power to dig deeper into their pockets.

<H2>Immigration Reform Taking Center Stage</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
If anyone forgot that the immigration issue is emotionally charged, Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan is aggressively reminding America about the issue's volatility.
<p>
Among other measures, Buchanan proposes to erect some type of stronghold along the southern border of the United States and impose a five-year moratorium on legal immigration.
<p>
Congress, meanwhile, is prepared to take action on immigration reform legislation, and the business lobby in Washington is gearing up to oppose provisions that would put employers at the center of enforcing the nation's immigration laws.
<p>
American Business for Legal Immigration - which was formed to protect legal employment immigration - recently held a press conference in Washington to announce its opposition to Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson's immigration proposal, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995. Simpson's legislation calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>A 35 percent cut in business-related immigration each year, equating to a reduction of 50,000 employment-based visas (from 140,000 to 90,000);
<li>requiring employers who hire legal immigrants to subsidize training programs for U.S. workers;
<li>new taxes - each employer would be required to pay either $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreign worker's annual compensation package (whichever is higher) to the U.S. government;
<li>more regulations, restrictions and paperwork.
</ul>
Simpson's bill attempts to tackle both illegal and legal immigration reform in one sweeping measure. But ABLI contends that it is misguided to combine the two issues, blurring the distinction between the value that skilled legal immigrants bring to the U.S. economy versus a different set of concerns Americans have with illegal immigration.
<p>
"Although Simpson's proposal does seek to address the issue of illegal immigration in the U.S., it confuses legal and illegal immigration and unreasonably threatens the competitiveness of American business in today's global marketplace," says ABLI Director Jennifer Eisen. ABLI strongly supports differentiating between the problems posed by illegal immigration and the benefits of legal immigration.
<p>
ABLI members defend their need to search for and hire skilled talent where they can find it to boost U.S. competitiveness. The coalition also contends that in a highly competitive global economy, it is unrealistic for U.S. policy leaders to attempt to hinder and micromanage employer personnel decisions on top of the current requirements in the legal immigration system.
<p>
According to Kirby Dyess, corporate vice president of Intel Corp., his company already wades through six inches of government forms to comply with regulations and paperwork for each foreign professional it hires. The cost per employee is approximately $7,000 to $10,000. "We don't go through all of this time and expense to displace U.S. workers," Dyess says.
<p>
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, agrees with Dyess. Miller explains that the overhead costs associated with hiring a foreign worker today are sufficient to make it the last resort for most employers. As a result, the current ceiling for business visas is not being reached. ABLI says that employers use about 93,000 of the 140,000 employment-based visas available.
<p>
ABLI also asserts that legal immigrants stimulate domestic job growth by bringing much-needed expertise, technological skill and patented concepts to the nation's industries and economy. Innovations by legal immigrants have propelled American companies to new successes and have allowed these companies to capitalize on new product inventions and technologies.
<p>
ABLl and its members agree that illegal immigration is a problem that must be addressed. Although efforts to split the legislation to address legal and illegal immigration may win out, the business lobby is also concerned about provisions that attempt to stop illegal immigration.
<p>
For example, both House and Senate legislation include proposals to put into place a centralized employment verification system operated by the federal government. Employers would be required to call a government toll-free number to identify the worker as eligible and give the prospective employee's Social Security number.
<p>
During this big political year, politicians and U.S. presidential hopefuls are reacting to hot emotional issues. But quick and rash policy prescriptions for the nation's illegal immigration problem could end up hurting the U.S. economy more than it will help if both legal and illegal immigration are "reformed" in one sweeping measure.

<H2>OSHA Reforms Winding Through Congress</H2>
<p><br>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Despite the first session of the 104th Congress marking a historic change in the direction of the federal government, far-reaching legislative initiatives have been stalled by the ideological and procedural differences in the House and Senate.
<p>
The House can successfully boast of many tax, regulatory and fiscal reforms it passed in 1995. But without-similar action in the Senate, Congress can't claim a long list of legislative accomplishments, which provide the conventional yardstick by which the media and public measure a productive Congress.
<p>
As Congress-bashers contend that a "do nothing" Congress is the best kind, political analysts predict that President Clinton may exploit Congress' record and pull a page out of campaign history books in his attempts to secure a second term in the White House.
<p>
Just as Harry Truman ran successfully against a "do-nothing" Congress in 1948, President Clinton is considering that strategy in 1996. The "do-nothing" label is something Congress will try to avoid, so congressional leaders are taking a second look at their unfinished 1995 agenda.
<p>
Plenty of opportunities exist to pass meaningful tax and regulatory reforms without stirring up too much of a special-interest hornets' nest. The re-evaluation, say observers, will match targeted legislative opportunities with 1996 political realities.
<p>
OSHA reform is one such area where Congress may accept modest legislative gains. The President and Congress agree that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) needs to be reformed. Differences arise, of course, when the degree of reform is discussed.
<p>
Republican Rep. Cass Ballenger of North Carolina proposed an OSHA reform bill last year in the House, and it appears that the Senate may soon act on a lighter version of his bill.
<p>
Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas is resurrecting the reform effort in the Senate, with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., taking lead roles through co-sponsorship of S.R. 1423, the Occupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act.
<p>
"Since OSHA was created 25 years ago, the agency has expanded its authority far beyond the original intent of Congress," Hutchison said. "As a result, companies must worry about compliance with standards and regulations that have little or nothing to do with real safety issues."
<p>
S.R. 1423 strives to address real safety issues instead of penalizing business owners for paperwork violations and minor infractions.
<p>
The costs of these so called violations can add up to big fines, as one small roofing company in Houston learned.
<p>
The company was fined 23 times for a total of $13,000 for the following violations: A cut in the insulation of an extension cord that was no longer in use, a bent rung on the bottom of a ladder and a splintered handle on a discarded shovel.
<p>
The Senate reform bill redirects OSHA's energy to consultation programs and voluntary compliance. The bill would codify the Voluntary Protection Program, which exempts employers from general inspections if they have excellent safety and health records.
<p>
There would also be a reduction in penalties for nonserious violations (for example, nonserious hazard citations would be lowered from $7,000 to $100), and penalties waived for nonsignificant violations. Warnings would be issued in lieu of citations, and OSHA inspector quotas would be prohibited.
<p>
Employees would be encouraged (not required) to complain to their employer before they call OSHA. Employee involvement in safety committees is also encouraged through federal labor law modifications.
<p>
Most critically for business, the bill recommends that the employer should not be held responsible if a trained employee disregards health and safety rules.
<p>
OSHA itself has recognized the need to change.
<p>
If there is general agreement on basic principles, is it possible that an OSHA reform bill could move through both houses of Congress and on to the president for his signature?
<p>
Perhaps, but organized labor could deal a blow to even minor reform efforts. Labor unions are opposed to OSHA tinkering, which puts the president in a pickle if a reform bill makes its way through both chambers of Congress. The president is dependent on labor's support and big money for the '96 election.
<p>
Signing an OSHA reform bill backed by the majority of Congress could prove to the electorate and small businesses that the president indeed is governing like a "New Democrat." There's a good chance, though, that election-year friends like the "Old Democrat" much better.

<i>Karen Kerrigan is president of the Small Business Survival Committee in Washington. Her column appears twice-monthly. Write to her at the Washington Business Journal, 2000 14th St. North, Suite 500, Arlington, Va. 22201 or send e-mail to (bizchron@mindspring.com).</i>
<p>
If you ask most small-business owners, every politician talks a good game of making our
nation's tax system less burdensome. The immense task of overhauling the system, though, keeps most politicians talking. Tax reform is again taking center stage, and perhaps in the near future, tax system overhaul may actually become a reality.
<p>
Many small businesses agree with Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes when he says we need to "drive a stake" through the current tax system.
<p>
The small-business sector - responsible for most of the dynamic growth in the economy - fares the worst under the current system. Not only do high taxes inhibit small business growth and job creation, but compliance costs can be financially draining.
<p>
According to a 1991 Tax Foundation report, small companies spent at least $382 in compliance costs for every $100 paid in taxes.
<p>
In addition, it's estimated that businesses squander 3.4 billion hours in tax-related paperwork. And the cost of compliance is big business; more than $200 billion is spent on complying with tax laws.
<p>
Forbes advocates a "pure" flat tax, while . Dole's vision of reform is a "fairer and simpler" type of system.
<p>
Bold tax reform efforts received a big boost from an economic soul mate of Forbes. Jack Kemp, chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, released a long-awaited report whose aim is to help guide and shape the debate to overhaul the system. With such high-profile attention given to the issue, tax reform is destined to become a major election-year issue.
<p>
Kemp's Tax Reform Commission begins the report by recommending to Congress and the president "that the current Internal Revenue Service Code be repealed in its entirety."
<p>
No mincing of words there. The principles guiding the new tax code would have to stand up to the TRC "tax test:"
<p><ul>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to work, save and invest;
<li> fairness for all taxpayers;
<li> neutrality that lets people and not government make choices;
<li> visibility to let people know the cost of government;
<li> stability so people can plan for the future.
</ul>
The TRC advocates that the "failed system" be replaced with a single low rate, taxing income only once with a generous personal exemption and full deductibility of the payroll tax.
<p>
The TRC stops short of advancing one type of tax system over another and does not suggest what the single low tax rate might be. (Forbes suggests a 17 percent rate starting at income above $36,800 for a family of four - below that income level, no taxes would be owed.)
<p>
To end the current tax code bias of rewarding consumption over saving and investing, the report says that the tax system "either must let savers deduct their saving or exclude the returns on the saving from their taxable income. It must also end double-taxation of businesses and their owners and permit expensing of investment outlays."
<p>
The report also recommends that capital gains taxes be abolished. Although the commission recognizes that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," it does not call for the elimination of such taxes, which prove particularly burdensome for family owned businesses.
<p>
The commission strongly endorses full deductibility of payroll taxes for employers and employees. If federal payroll taxes are tax-deductible, taxes would be determined on a worker's real net income.
<p>
Once a tax rate is set into place, the commission recommends that a two-thirds majority vote in Congress be required to raise taxes. For most tax reform advocates, this is critically important. As the law now stands, it only takes a majority vote in Congress to raise taxes and a supermajority to lower them.
<p>
Although many business organizations cheered the results of the TRC recommendations, most concluded that the real work lies ahead. The commission's report is not long on details, and the political realities of implementing such reforms depend on whether those in public office in 1997 will defend the current tax system by tinkering around the edges or totally dismantling it.

<h2>Rhetoric throttles aid for small businesses</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
While some people would have you believe otherwise,
the small-business provisions within the Contract With America
amounted to only minor changes.  Now, even the small-scale tax
and regulatory reforms proposed within the contract have been
watered down.
<P>
Many of the contract's key provisions, such as regulatory relief
and legal reform, have either died in the Senate or have been
put on the back burner until after the protracted budget battle.
<P>
Special-interest groups opposed to tax and budget cuts, as well
as reforms that would make bureaucrats more accountable, have
painted the contract as extreme.  Labor unions alone have pumped
more than $2 million into media ads to decry proposals that &quot;drastically
cut&quot; Medicare and pare back safeguards that protect worker
safety and the environment.
<P>
Medicare reform is a perfect example of how the public has swallowed
distorted ad campaigns without checking the facts.  According
to a recent survey by Public Opinion Strategies, most Americans
are woefully misinformed about the basic facts regarding Medicare
reform proposals.
<P>
Under the GOP plan, Medicare's budget would undergo a slower rate
of growth in spending than under current law.  In fact, if Medicare
reform were left up to the 1,000 Americans who responded to the
Public Opinion Strategies survey, reform opponents would have
had a severe problem on their hands.
<P>
For example, when it was explained that the GOP plan would increase
spending for Medicare by 45 percent over the next seven years
--- twice the projected rate of inflation --- 80 percent of those
polled believed the increase was too high.
<P>
The GOP plan increases spending per recipient from $4,800 to $7,100
over the next seven years.  But when asked what they thought the
GOP plan would do, 27 percent said that the plan would cut spending
below $4,000; 24 percent said spending would remain the same;
and only 22 percent most accurately portrayed the plan --- that
it would increase spending per recipient.
<P>
The problem, according to Medicare reform supporters, is that
the American public has been consistently exposed to misleading
ads and political rhetoric.
<P>
According to Pam Bailey, president of the Healthcare Leadership
Council and co-chair of the Coalition to Save Medicare, President
Clinton's plan was not very different from the GOP's.  Under the
plan approved by Congress, the government would spend $1.65 trillion
on Medicare over seven years.  Under the president's plan, it
would spend $1.682 trillion.
<P>
Political rhetoric can be blamed for the demise of many tax and
regulatory changes that would have benefited millions of small
businesses.   Interest groups supportive of the status quo were
quick to distort Republican proposals, which were supported by
many Democrats as well, as giveaways to big business.
<P>
Sure, big companies would have marginally benefited from the changes
proposed by Republicans.  But small businesses would have been
the main beneficiaries.
<P>
Small businesses will see <I>some</I> tax relief and incentives
soon, but according to most small-business groups, the results
are a big disappointment compared with original expectations.
 Small businesses can probably expect a $25,000 expensing provision,
a capital gains tax reduction and targeted estate tax relief for
family-owned businesses.  The final agreement, however, will mandate
that the tax provisions be phased in over seven years.
<P>
Home office users can say goodbye to efforts this year to clarify
the home-office deduction.  But on a more positive note, the self-employed
will see an increase from 30 percent to 50 percent in the amount
they can deduct for health-care expenses (phased in over seven
years).
<P>
Distortion and political rhetoric may help guardians of the status
quo avoid passing reforms that put the country back on a track
of fiscal stability, while helping millions of small business
owners and entrepreneurs create jobs.  But for these millions
of small business owners, the truth is generally reflected in
their bottom lines, which the government plays a big part in helping
or hindering.

<title>Kerrigan:  Balanced budget means bottom-line gains -- SBSC

<h2>Balanced budget means bottom-line gains</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 &quot;Balanced budget means bottom-line gains&quot;
Will balancing the federal budget have a real
impact on our economy, or is it merely a populist issue that picks
up votes at the ballot box?
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton bicker over the details of a
seven-year plan to balance the budget, recent public opinion figures
still show widespread support for the effort.
<P>
An early November survey conducted by Alexandria-based Public
Opinion Strategies showed 83 percent of 1,000 registered voters
said it was important to balance the federal budget in the next
seven years.
<P>
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was predicting
wholesale chaos in the financial markets if Congress didn't increase
the federal debt limit.  But 69 percent of those surveyed said
the debt limit should not be increased without a balanced budget
in place.
<P>
Of course, the November deadline passed, Congress and the White
House reached a temporary agreement to re-open government after
a brief shutdown, the country's debt obligations are being paid
and the financial markets appear robust as ever.
<P>
In the end, you may ask:  Does a balanced budget really matter?
 And more importantly, how will a balanced federal budget affect
the livelihood of American families, businesses and individuals?
<P>
A recent crop of economic reports has concluded that balancing
the federal budget will have broad economic benefits and tangible
bottom-line gains for families, individuals and almost all sectors
of the American economy.
<P>
Economists at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank
in Washington, conclude that GOP plan to balance the budget --
with tax cuts -- will lead to greater business investment, higher
earnings per hour and faster economic growth than under current
law.
<P>
Heritage economists found the following would occur  with a balanced
budget in place:
<UL>
<LI>Gross Domestic Product would grow by $10.8 billion more than
under current law in the year 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable
income from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $66.2 billion in consumption
expenditures from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential
fixed investment from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be and additional 104,000 housing starts from
1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be a decrease of .4 percent in the conventional
mortgage rate --- meaning that a homeowner would save about $10,000
over the life of a $100,000, 30-year mortgage;
<LI>auto sales would increase by 600,000 units over the next seven
years --- that's $10 billion worth of cars.
</UL>


<P>
Another report has more good news.
<P>
With the government taking a smaller bite out of the economy,
interest rates should fall dramatically, according to the Senate
Joint Economic Committee.
<P>
A report from the Committee showed that a typical American family
could save nearly $1,800 a year in loan payments if the Republican
plan to balance the budget passes.
<P>
For example, a family with a $75,000 mortgage, a $15,000 auto
loan and an $11,000 student loan could save $1,800 a year if interest
rates drop just one percentage point.
<P>
The national debt of all consumer borrowing for home mortgages
and auto debt is $4.8 trillion --- a 1 percentage point drop in
interest rates would save more than $48 billion per year.
<P>
&quot;Clearly, the benefits of a balanced budget would extent
to all Americans,&quot; says Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform.  With the public still on the side of balancing
the budget, observers believe that the President will accept most
elements of the Republican plan.

<title>Kerrigan:  Are union leader's tactics too divisive? -- SBSC
</title>

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Are union leader's tactics too divisive?</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>

</center><hr><P>
The power wielded by labor unions has deteriorated
in recent years.  Even labor officials admit their political clout
is not what it used to be.
<P>
Lower membership combined with labor officials' inability to aggressively
advance their agenda has caused severe rifts within the labor
movement.  These same factors led to the unprecedented election
of a new AFL-CIO president and probably will lead to more aggressive
organizing strategies.
<P>
On Oct. 25, John Sweeney - then president of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) --- defeated acting federation leader
Thomas Donahue for the AFL-CIO presidency.
<P>
Sweeney's win marked a historic moment for the AFL-CIO; his run
for the presidency was the only contested election in the federation's
40-year history.
<P>
As head of the SEIU, Sweeney increased its membership by 37 per
cent.  The SEIU under Sweeney also enjoyed a reputation for effective
organizing and activism --- points labor sees as critical to rebuilding
its political clout.
<P>
While Sweeney's performance at SEIU was striking in comparison
to other unions' activity, the methods used to bolster both its
membership and effectiveness have been questioned not only by
those who were the target of its tactics, but fellow union heads
as well.
<P>
During and after his election, Sweeney forcefully stated that
he will embrace civil disobedience and militancy &quot;if necessary.&quot;
 Sweeney found it necessary to use such tactics at the SEIU and,
based on his past success using such methods, is expected to employ
militant activism at the AFL-CIO.  Sweeney will also have a bigger
budget to work with.
<P>
While most unions spend about 5 percent of their budget on organizing
activities, the SEIU spends five times that amount.  Sweeney promised
to do the same at the AFL-CIO and committed $20 million of its
budget to union organizing efforts.
<P>
In addition to a strategy of funneling money directly to local
unions, Sweeney's goal is to train 1,000 union organizers over
the next two years to assist AFL-CIO members nationwide.
<P>
Metropolitan areas already have a taste for Sweeney's brand of
activism, and union watchers warn that businesses, as well as
local governments, should prepare for this larger campaign of
&quot;in your face&quot; activity.
<P>
For example, the SEIU and its local unions have tried to disrupt
businesses and local governments in the following manner:
<UL>
<LI>To protest cuts in Washington's budget, Justice for Janitors
(a campaign arm of the SEIU) blocked three main highways during
morning rush hour, delaying commuters for two hours.  Other cities
have also experienced this traffic tactic.
<LI>A Detroit SEIU Local protested the popular North American
International Auto Show because it &quot;portrays life in Detroit
as better than it actually is.&quot;
<LI>Noted real estate developers in major cities, including Atlanta
and Washington, have been targeted by the SEIU's Justice for Janitors
because their agenda demands they pay more of their &quot;fair
share&quot; of taxes.
</UL>

<P>
Sweeney has promised to use the &quot;corporate campaign&quot;
with greater frequency to get concessions at the collective bargaining
table that ordinarily would not be forthcoming without outside
pressure.
<P>
The strategies used by unions in corporate campaigns include targeting
a business with intense media pressure --- both earned media and
paid advertising; thwarting critical business plans by organizing
coalitions around their defeat; filing frivolous charges against
a business with government agencies (local, state and federal);
and helping to pass stock-holder resolutions that promote union
crusades.
<P>
The AFL-CIO and Sweeney can also count on the support of the Clinton
Administration and U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich to aid the
AFL-CIO's resuscitation and agenda.
<P>
Clearly, President Clinton must rebuild bridges with labor and
will show a marked interest in its agenda during the upcoming
election year.  Sweeney has promised to punish all elected officials
-- including Democrats -- who do not support labor's objectives.
<P>
Whether Sweeney will succeed in his new role is questionable at
best.  His grand promises to win labor back the political clout
it once had, while simultaneously adding 250,00 workers to its
membership rolls, appear to be a tough road indeed.
<P>
More importantly:  How much is Sweeney willing to alienate labor
from the general public through the use of militant tactics to
achieve short-term objectives?  Not all of labor's rank and file
agree with Sweeney's tactics.
<P>
As former AFL-CIO president Donahue stated in his keynote address
at the convention where he lost the election:  &quot;We must worry
less about building bridges to the rest of society.  We must enlist
the support of the public, not inconvenience as many as possible.&quot;
<P>
The acceleration of unions' decline could indeed quicken under
the AFL-CIO leadership of Sweeney if he chooses the opposite course.

<title>Kerrigan: Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup -- SBSC</title>

<h2>Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 
With broad-based regulatory relief probably on
hold for this year, members of Congress are selecting the most
egregious agencies and programs to reform.
<P>
Superfund  --  a super wast according to its critics  --  is one
such program that has been particularly troublesome to small businesses.
<P>
In its 15-year history, and despite tens of billions of dollars
of both private and public expenditures, only a fraction of the
waste sites targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency under
Superfund have actually been cleaned up.
<P>
The federal government has spent $10 billion on Superfund and
forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  According
to a 1994 report in BusinessWeek, only 49 out of 1270 waste sites
&quot;have been completely cleaned up.&quot;
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the
EPA's National Priority List.  The EPA then tracks down &quot;potentially
responsible parties&quot; and assigns responsibility for waste
site cleanups.
<P>
Often, though, the EPA forces parties to undertake the cleanup
from the start.  Noncompliance without &quot;sufficient cause&quot;
results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.
<P>
Who are these responsible parties?  Superfund extends the liability
for cleanup to practically any entity that may have a disposed
of waste in the specified EPA site.
<P>
They include large and medium-sized companies.  But they also
include dry cleaners, automobile dealers, butcher shops, pizza
parlors and more.  Nonprofit groups and public entities have also
been caught in the Superfund web -- hospitals, schools and local
governments have been casts as polluters.
<P>
Here are a couple examples of small businesses put under the gun
by the EPA's Superfund program:
<P>
&#183; Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Okla., was notified
by the EPA that it would be held responsible for the cleanup of
a local Superfund site because it paid someone $14 in 1972 to
haul trash to the site.
<P>
&#183; Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork
over $11,000 originally destined for store improvements, because
the glue from cardboard boxes that he shipped to Ludlow Sanitary
Landfill in New York was deemed hazardous.
<P>
The current liability scheme remains the root of the problem,
according to critics who want to overhaul Superfund.  In determining
liability, the EPA uses illogical criteria.
<P>
Superfund, for example, allows for strict liability that holds
parties accountable regardless of intent or negligence.  The liability
is also retroactive, meaning actions taken before the law was
enacted still apply.  Even if firms were in full compliance of
the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.
<P>
Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore,
the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire cleanup,
without regard to the degree of its own contribution to the waste
site and without total consideration tot the total number of contributors.
<P>
No concept of fair share exists under Superfund.  A business targeted
 by the EPA for cleanup naturally files lawsuits against other
businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties then tend
to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of by a firm is not factored
into the liability scheme.  A firm depositing fairly innocuous
materials may still be held liable.
<P>
Lawyers benefit handsomely from the Superfund quagmire.  It's
claimed that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for
legal fees alone.  
<P>
Several congressional committees, including the House Small Business
Committee, are starting their hearings on Superfund reform.
<P>
The &quot;Superfund Liability Equity and Acceleration Act,&quot;
which repeals the law's retroactive liability provisions and replaces
the joint and several liability standard, was recently introduced.
 Parties will be held liable for the amount they contributed and
no more.
<P>
Small businesses and taxpayers may begin to rest easier at night
knowing that the weekly task of putting out the garbage may be
less of a liability with forthcoming congressional action.  Perhaps
the environment will actually get cleaned up as well.

<title>Kerrigan:  Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<i>October 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2> Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
A cut in the capital gains tax is almost assured
this year.  Both the House and Senate are committed to the reduction,
and despite President Clinton's &quot;tax cuts for the rich&quot;
rhetoric, even he has hinted at supporting a capital gains tax
cut.  The House has passed legislation reducing the capital gains
tax from its current top level of 28 percent to 19.8 percent and
indexing the rate for inflation.  The measure calls for prospective
indexing (calculated from Jan. 1, 1995) on assets held for at
least three years.
<P>
It's expected that the Senate will pass a similar bill calling
for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income.  However,
it's unknown whether the Senate's version will allow taxpayers
to index for inflation.
<P>
According to investment experts and economists who favor cutting
(and eliminating) capital gains taxes, a huge expanse exists between
non-indexed and indexed capital gains tax rates.
<P>
Inflations can be a tax in itself by eroding purchasing power,
savings and investments.  The current nominal capital gains tax
rate is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is factored into
the capital gains equation, the real capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.
<P>
For example, on an investment with a one-year return of 10 percent,
assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the non-indexed 28 percent
capital gains tax rate jumps to an inflation-adjusted rate of
40 percent.
<P>
Even with the proposed non-indexed rate of 19.8 percent, the real
rate on such an investment leaps to 28.3 percent.  And if inflation
reaches 5 percent, the rate doubles from 19.8 percent to 39.6
percent.
<P>
&quot;Lower rates of return and/or higher rates of inflation will
translate into even higher real capital gains tax rates,&quot;
says Ray Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival
Foundation.  &quot;These real capital gains tax rates act as severe
disincentives to investment and entrepreneurship,&quot; Keating
adds.
<P>
Without indexation, the government ends up taxing illusory profits.
 In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital
losses.  That is, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gain.
<P>
An investor's willingness to invest is substantially hindered
by taxing capital gains.  According to Keating and other economists,
indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination  --  equalizing stated and real capital gains tax
rate.
<P>
The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty and generate investment,
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
If non-indexation is so unfair, they why isn't its passage guaranteed
as part of a capital gains tax reduction?  The apparent roadblocks
are money and complexity.
<P>
Although history has shown that reducing capital gains tax rates
actually yields higher revenue for the U.S. Treasury, budget leaders
in the Senate are advocating an agenda of &quot;revenue neutrality&quot;
 -- meaning that for every dollar of tax cuts, a dollar of spending
cuts must be enacted in order to balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
Accordingly, indexing capital gains tax rates for inflation will
cost the government more money, meaning political leaders will
have to cut spending more deeply.
<P>
Opponents also claim that indexing is too complicated for taxpayers
to figure out.  In reality, indexation would require merely one
additional step of multiplication for taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;If taxpayers in Great Britain and Australia can deal with
indexing, I'm sure U.S. taxpayers can as well,&quot; responds
Keating.  Keating adds that if the complexity of indexation is
so troubling to our elected officials, then the most simple reform
is still available -- elimination of the capital gains tax.
<P>
Since late last year, investors have been counting on the capital
gains tax proposal offered by the House.  According to investment
experts, the failure to deliver on the tax cut would be a blow
to capital markets.
<P>
Keating points out that start-up and high-growth companies would
particularly be hurt, noting that the potential returns on high-risk
investments would be lower --- therefore, so would equity prices.
 Trillions of dollars of locked-up capital would not be available
for investment opportunities.
<P>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends
or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding
for entrepreneurial  enterprises.
<P>
More often than not, small-business funding comes from someone
the entrepreneur knows.
<P>
Although lowering capital gains tax rates provides an additional
incentive to investors in prospective high-risk ventures, inflation
still remains a silent force working against an entrepreneurial
boom.
<P>
With a new majority in Congress advocating &quot;tax fairness,&quot;
indexing capital gains for inflation is not only fair, but good
for economic growth as well.

<title>SBB:  Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</title>

<h2>Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</h2>
                                                     </center>
<hr>

October 1995 --  The communications revolution has played a pivotal role in how America does business and impacts the personal lives of most Americans.  As Congress looks for ways to reduce the federal deficit, a debate has surfaced over the use of our nation's airwaves -- otherwise known as the "spectrum." 
<P>
Only twenty years ago, the average person could probably only identify a few uses of the spectrum -- namely broadcast television and  radio.  With technological advancements, though, have come more uses of the spectrum.  For example satellite TV, wireless computer networks and cellular phones all utilize the nation's airwaves.  And, the technological boom has caused the spectrum to jump in value.
<P>
Recognizing a handsome revenue source for the federal government, Congress in 1993 mandated that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction all licenses for new spectrum uses.   Recent auctions for the Personal Communications Services spectrum have raised more than $8 billion.  And, as budgetary pressures continue to bear down on the 104th Congress, spectrum auctions are being closely examined because of their revenue potential.
<P>
House and Senate Commerce Committees in the 104th Congress have been charged with raising $14 billion to help balance the budget by 2002.  Over the past several weeks, congressional hearings have revealed several areas that can be targeted to meet these tight revenue requirements.
<P>
A controversial but lucrative target for auctions are the airwaves now set-a-side for television broadcasters to develop high-definition television (HDTV).  In 1991, the FCC allocated six megahertz of extra spectrum for the broadcasters to make the transition to HDTV.  
<P>
After the switch, the broadcasters would then hand back their current channel, now used for analog TV transmission.  	But technology and the market outsmarted bureaucrats in Washington.  With technological gains, broadcasters can now provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves.  In other words, rather than providing just one channel of HDTV, the broadcasters have the capability for multiple channels of digital television, while leaving space for other lucrative services.      
    
<P>
While the broadcasters still maintain that they will continue to develop HDTV with the allocated airwaves, they have also asked for "spectrum flexibility."
<P>
The flexibility will allow them to use the extra airwaves for any number of telecommunications services:  Six new channels of television, or 72 compact-disc quality radio signals, or cellular phone services, or interactive data services, or they can mix and match.
<P>
This proposal, however, does not sit well with telecommunication companies that have been required to purchase airwaves through auctions.  They view spectrum flexibility for broadcasters as a special government giveaway.
<P>
In a recent letter to Congress, the president of Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), Thomas A. Wheeler, expressed "shock and dismay as the broadcasters seek to ram through the Congress a special deal" that allows them to obtain new spectrum for free, while the wireless industry has had to pay $8 billion.
<P>
Like the broadcasters, members of CTIA did receive their initial spectrum allocation for free, but all subsequent wireless telecommunications spectrum has been acquired through auctions.    The broadcasters claim that they have been singled out, and the government has plenty of warehoused spectrum that should be auctioned off first before the broadcasting industry is disrupted.
<P>
The broadcasters also weigh in with their public-service responsibilities as an argument to exempt them from auctions.  And, they claim financial hardship in competing with other telecommunication industry players.
<P>
"If the spectrum earmarked for the transition to digital is auctioned, it will destroy the ability of local television stations to stay in business as the communications market moves to digital technology," Robert Wright, CEO of NBC, told the Senate Commerce Committee.     
<P>
Faye Anderson, Executive Director of the Council of 100, a national network of African-American Republicans, questions the broadcasters' claim of financial hardship, and the assertion that the government is sitting on a valuable reserve of spectrum.
<P>
Anderson points to the multi-billion dollar deals involving Disney's purchase of ABC/Cap Cities, and Westinghouse's bid for CBS to counter the argument that the broadcasters will not be able to compete in spectrum auctions because of a lack of capital.
<P>
Just how much money can be raised from the sale of the HDTV airwaves?    According to John Reidy, a managing director at the brokerage firm Smith Barney, Inc., who testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, $30 billion could go to the U.S. Treasury from the auctions.  Other experts say $30 billion is conservative.
<P>
With other important matters budgetary matters before Congress (such Medicare and welfare reform), industry observers and advocacy organizations are carefully following the spectrum issue as a barometer for "true change" in the Congress.

<title>SBB: Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



September 1995 - Almost three years ago, then presidential candidate Bill Clinton stated that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earners."  The wrong way back then, but the right way now as increasing the minimum wage is viewed as a politically popular strategy to reconnect with the Democrat's traditional base of working class Americans.
<P>
While most economists agree that minimum wage increases do more economic harm than good (both for workers and the economy), President Clinton has proposed a 21 percent increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.
<P>
Democratic party leaders in the Congress are also working feverishly to include a minimum wage hike into welfare reform proposals, presumably to be acted upon this fall.
<P>
Studies conducted over the past 25 years have consistently concluded that with each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, a corresponding 1 percent to 2 percent decline in entry-level employment results.  The General Accounting Office, the Brookings Institution, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and various Presidential Commission's have all reached this universal conclusion.
<P>
Even the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the "New Democrat" organization once led by the President, declared that "the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history."
    <P>
As minimum wage hike proponents pose the issue as improving the living wage of lower-income workers, most businesses and their workers view minimum wage jobs as entry-level positions -- by which the majority of workers gain skills to move onto higher-paying work.
<P>
An independent study in 1992 demonstrated that within a 12 month period, 63 percent of American workers at the minimum wage earned higher wages.   Not surprisingly, about half of minimum wage employees were either young adults under the age of 21, or teenagers.
<P>
According to a study by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington, D.C., raising the minimum wage emotionally appeals to most Americans, but doing it would be a mistake.
<P>
According to the foundation study:
<P><ul>
<li>Raising the minimum wage will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and destroying entry-level job opportunities.
<li>Raising the minimum wage does not generally help low-income households -- the increased income from minimum wage jobs would mostly go to families far above the poverty level, not to poor minimum wage workers.
<li>Employers will respond to a minimum wage increase by cutbacks in hiring, reducing workers' hours, or lowering pay and benefits and skipping pay raises -- responses that hurt, not help, workers.
<li>A $5.15 increase in the minimum wage will result in approximately 400,000 lost entry-level jobs.  A wage increase may result in more skilled workers being enticed into the job market, but fewer unskilled job opportunities (entry-level jobs) would be available.</ul>         
<P>
Grant Maloy, a small business operator from Orlando, Fl., testified earlier in the year before the Joint Economic Committee on the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage.  As the owner of a wholesale foliage nursery, Maloy stated that his industry pays $5.24 for entry-level work, well above the minimum wage.
<P>
"Wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.  How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay?  The answer is they can't," says Maloy.
<P>
According to Maloy, minimum wage policy is insincere.  While the government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, the owner himself may be making much less.  Maloy estimated that he was making about $2.00 an hour when he started his business.
<P>
Surveys of the American public continue to show widespread support for increasing the minimum wage, and in 1989 Congress overwhelmingly backed the last minimum wage increase -- more than 90 percent voted in favor of the hike.
<P>
Political experts agree that if a proposal to increase the minimum wage makes its way to the House or Senate floor for a vote, it may pass.  No member in Congress wants to be labeled as "anti-worker" despite the widespread research showing the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage on those it purportedly is supposed to help.
<P>
On the other hand, the public's dissatisfaction with Washington and misguided government attempts to solve every problem may indeed resonate with the minimum wage issue as well.
<P>
More importantly however, is how the public will view the President's proposal.  Is the President proposing to raise the minimum wage to truly help the working poor?  Or will the public perceive his proposal as a political ploy to gain votes in 1996.
<P>
What remains certain though, is the growing universal belief that the minimum wage does little for increasing job opportunities for those who need it most.

<title>SBB:  FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs                                                                                                </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center>
<h2>FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs</h2>                                                 </center>
<HR>
September 1995 -- The 104th Congress is leaving no stone unturned in terms of its examination of federal government agencies.  OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, EEOC, and other agencies are being probed for inefficiency and counterproductive impact on American business.
<P>
Included in this review is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- long held in high regard by the American public.
<P>
The FDA has squandered its goodwill with the industries it regulates, as well as with patient groups and politicians from Democratic and Republican camps for its growing inefficiency and unaccountability.  One major criticism, concerns FDA's severe shortcomings in approving new drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Breakthrough medical devices, for example, face lengthy approval times.  Although FDA guidelines maintain that the approval process is supposed to be completed within 180 days, independent studies have revealed that actual approval periods take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.
<P>
In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee in 1994, Robert DeHaven of the American Electronics Association (AEA) testified that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the AEA found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.
<P>
Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), notes that medical technology firms invested about $321-$333 million abroad annually from 1989 to 1991.  In 1992, though, "when the FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."  
<P>
Along with the export of capital to international shores goes American innovation, entrepreneurship, high-paying jobs and our best growth industries say critics.
<P>
"The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices," says Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee.
<P>
U.S. pharmaceutical companies also face the same regulatory maze and bureaucratic gridlock as medical device companies.  Although established drug companies have learned how to deal with the FDA's red tape, longer approval periods mean higher development costs, which translate into higher drug prices for consumers.
<P>
Between 1986 and 1993, the median approval time for generic drug applications increased from 12 months to 38 months.  These time periods exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.
<P>
In a study conducted by researchers at Tufts University for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  drugs originating here often are available in foreign markets many years before becoming availability in the U.S.  For example, of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for six to 10 years, and another 9 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
Despite the drug approval lag, safety does not appear to be enhanced in the U.S.  According to the Tufts study, although Great Britain gets drugs to market quicker that the U.S., safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug introductions are similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
As reports and criticism mount against the FDA, its staff and defenders contend that the agency is in dire need of more funds to keep up with its workload.  A look at the FDA's budget growth over the years shows that from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.  FDA's 1994 budget was just more than $900 million.
<P>
During those same years, the number  of employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent, totaling more than 9,000.   Critics claim American taxpayers are paying more to get less.
<P>
Of course, a multitude of other industries are impacted by FDA regulation:  food, cosmetic, restaurant, retail druggist, manufacturers of medical devices and now the tobacco  industry has its own gripes about the FDA's heavy-handedness.
<P>
The key for Congress is balancing the concerns of the American public that the FDA preserve and protect the public health, with the concerns of business that the FDA's inefficiency has gone to far -- costing Americans jobs, as well as access to breakthrough drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Critics claim that FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler has spent too much time on aggressive enforcement and investigation of businesses rather than cooperating with the industries he regulates to move the approval process along in a timely manner.
<P>
Former FDA officials also cite Commissioner Kessler's obsession with regulating tobacco at the expense of other agency responsibilities.   A former chief FDA investigator sent a letter to the U.S. House Commerce Committee stating that, for example, the FDA's foreign inspection program was a "disaster waiting to happen."
<P>
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, the same official said that he attempted to meet with and contact Kessler several times on important matters " and was told by his secretary that if my topic was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."        
<P>
    With the FDA under attack from industry, Congress and patients groups who want faster approval times for life-saving drugs and medical devices, the agency may begin to change course and reinvent itself.   However, under mounting criticism from these constituencies, Congress itself may devise an FDA reform bill that forces  Kessler and his staff to put their time and resources into more productive efforts that save lives, American jobs and entire industries.

<title>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</title>
</head>

<h2>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - Early this summer, the National Policy Forum, a Washington-based
Republican think tank, released its Agenda for Small Business  --- a seven-point plan to ensurethe vitality and prosperity of the small-business, entrepreneurial sector.  The plan includes tax and regulatory relief, capital access measures, tort reform and several other proposals near and dear to small business.<p>
Item No. 7 on NPF's agenda is a very specific reform aimed at helping small businesses compete for federally funded construction projects.  It calls for the elimination of the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage" be paid to all workers on
federally funded construction projects in excess of $2,000.  The U.S. Department of Labor sets these wage rates for thousands of job classifications in scores of regions across the country.<p>
The Coalition to Repeal Davis-Bacon, a coalition of nearly 70 organizations ranging from the National School Boards Association to Citizens Against Government Waste, claims that prevailing wage rates are vastly inflated and generally reflect union rates.<p>
And the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 1995 that the Davis-Bacon act raises construction costs by at least $2.7 billion over five years.<p>
What's more, according to David Thompson, a Washington attorney specializing in labor law, Davis-Bacon creates an artificial market in which only large companies can compete.<p>
"Excessive paperwork requirements, arbitrary work rules and classifications and bloatedpay scales block access for small companies.  The law creates an unrealistic environment in which small local companies cannot afford to participate," says Thompson.<p>
Union leaders say wage rates set by the Labor Department do reflect market wage rates.  However, an investigative report done by the state of Oklahoma suggests that the wage surveying process itself may be corrupt.<p>
The report concludes that fraudulent wage data was submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor to "influence the outcome of U.S. Department of Labor wage surveys and, consequently, to take advantage of the taxpayers."<p>
In the voluntary wage-surveying process, any group or individual can submit completed
projects to help the Labor Department make its wage decisions.  In one example of fraud, asurvey claimed that 20 employees, compensated at $21.05 per hour, worked on a $2 million underground storage tank.  The investigation found that tank was never built.<p>
According to Oklahoma officials, if this type of fraudulent practice is occurring in one
place, it's probably occurring in others.<p>
"The prevailing wage law is premised on the false assumption that the government can
accurately determine what wage is prevailing.  There's no reasonable way to obtain true
prevailing wage information and therefore the entire system must be scrapped," says Ike Casey, executive vice president of Independent Electrical Contractors Inc.<p>
Members of Congress who support repealing Davis-Bacon contend that the market is the best determinant of wage rates.  That's why efforts for repeal are quickly moving through the House and Senate.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) has pushed a repeal bill through the Labor and Human Resources Committee, while legislation moving through the House is on an identical track.<p>
Repealing the Davis-Bacon will not be easy.  Labor unions and other beneficiaries of
Davis-Bacon will aggressively lobby Congress with a very effective argument  --- a vote to repeal Davis-Bacon is a vote to "cut our wages."<p>
Labor unions believe keeping Davis-Bacon is in all workers' interest, while supporters of
repeal feel it protects a privileged few at the expense of taxpayers.<p>

<title>A New Test For Independent Contractors</title>
</head>

<h2>A New Test For Independent Contractors</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - There is plenty about the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that raises the ire of small business owners and entrepreneurs.  The 20-factor test utilized by the IRS to delineate between independent contractors and employees is one such issue causing both confusion and agitation.<p>
Clarifying the status of independent contractors has long been a concern for small
businesses and the self-employed.  The need for the IRS to provide a more concise, objective standard for independent contractors was the priority issue voted on by thousands of delegates at The White House Conference on Small Business earlier this summer.<p>
Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the Small Business Committee, recently held hearings on the complexity of the issue as well as proposed legislation to amend the criteria used by the IRS.<p>
"For too long, the IRS has been retarding job growth and business expansion because of fear it will re-classify independent contractors as employees," said Smith in announcing her hearings.<p>
Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) agrees with Rep. Smith, and testified on legislation he
sponsored, the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act -- a bill to modify and simplify the 20-factor test.<p>
"Almost everyone will agree that the 20-factor test is unclear and far too subjective.  It is quite possible to take two seemingly identical situations and find employee status in one, and independent contractor in another.  Nevertheless, in recent years the IRS has bludgeoned small businesses over the head with the 20-factor test," said Christensen.<p>

     Indeed many individuals who prefer to work as independent contractors have had their status challenged by the IRS.  Even though it may be an individual's choice to work autonomously, the test used by the IRS may re-classify them as an employee, causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting with the individual.<p> 
According to one recent study, the IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent workers
since the mid-1980s, resulting in the collection of $678 million in taxes and fines.  The IRS simply states that it is only doing a very tough job -- it attributes about $2 billion in lost revenues to employers who wrongly misclassify workers.<p>
Christensen's bill would not eliminate the 20-factor test, but simply provides an
alternative for those who comply with all income reporting requirements.  Rather than attempting to determine who is an employee, Christensen's legislation defines who is not an employee.<p>
"It establishes distinct, clear and objective criteria for those seeking to perform services as an independent contractor," says Christensen.<p>
The three-part test established by Christensen requires that an independent contractor
demonstrate independence, investment in his or her business, and a written agreement between the parties.<p>
While Part Three of the test, Contract, is easy to establish, demonstrating independence and investment each have several sub-tests.  The independent contractor is required to meet only one criterion of the sub-tests to satisfy that portion of the test. <p>  
For example, Part One of the three-part test is Investment.  The individual would have to satisfy one of the following sub-tests to satisfy Part One.  Does the individual:<p>
(1)  have a significant investment in training or assets; or<br>
(2)  incur significant unreimbursed expenses; or<br>
(3)  agree to work for a specific time or complete a specific result, and is liable for<br>
damages for failure to perform; or<br>
(4)  receive compensation primarily on a commission basis; or<br>
(5)  purchase a product for resale?<p>     
Under Part Two of the test, the independent contractor would also be required to meet 
one of several subtests to satisfy his or her independence.  <p>
If, however, the independent contractor and the business for whom services are being
provided do not comply with income reporting rules, the 20-factor test would apply to their business relationship.<p>
Acknowledging problems with worker classification, the IRS has developed reforms of
its own to deal with the controversial issue.  On August 2, it released a set of initiatives.<p>
"I've spent a lot of time talking with small businesses who believe this is a big
problem...We can do better, and will do better in handling worker classification issues," said IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson in a statement.<p>
In order to improve the administration of worker classification, the IRS would provide
greater training for their auditors, consolidate the review process when employers challenge the status of worker determinations, and better coordinate national enforcement to ensure consistency of worker classification by industry and region.  Anything else, says the IRS, can only be implemented through legislation.<p>
Critics contend the IRS initiatives are weak and meaningless.<p>
"I'm very concerned that the administrative programs the IRS may wish to strengthen, are actually part of the problem because there are still no clear rules for implementing them," said Chairman Smith.<p>
As technology and corporate downsizing continue to shape the independent workforce, the IRS will eventually be forced to simplify and clarify the status of independent contractors.  If the IRS doesn't, it will literally take an act of Congress to change the bias against independent contractors.  That change, is well under way.<p>

<title>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</title>

<h2>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Business owners who've experienced an OSHA inspection get very emotional when talking about the government agency whose job it is to ensure that America's workplaces are safe and hazard-free.  According to many of these businesses, inspectors create a no-win situation by playing a "gothcha-game," with OSHA finding fault no matter how safe the work environment.<p>
Critics of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) claim that the agency has
completely turned away from advising on, and promoting workplace safety and health.  OSHA, claims business, is a complete adversary of business.<p>
According to Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Chairman of the Workforce Protections
Committee of the U.S. House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, OSHA's mission is enforcement driven -- find violations and issue penalties.<p>  
"In my view, nothing illustrates how OSHA has gone off the track more clearly than the
fact that today few, if any, employers would ever call OSHA and ask for assistance or advice on workplace safety or health," said Ballenger when introducing H.R. 1834, an OSHA reform bill. <p>
Called the "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Act of 1995," Ballenger
thoroughly aims to change the way OSHA operates.<p>
A key reform of H.R. 1834 allows businesses to correct violations found by OSHA,
without paying a penalty when the citation is issued.  If a business fails to take corrective action, only then will a fine result -- not the situation today.<p>   
"It does not matter whether the violation is not threatening to any employees.  Nor does it matter whether the employer knew of the regulation -- he or she is presumed to know all of what is printed in the Federal Register, and the unending "compliance directives" from Washington," said Ballenger.<p>
Many businesses hire OSHA consultants in preparation for an inspection.  Even so,
inspectors generally find something wrong and a monetary fine is usually issued.  This is unfair according to Ballenger, and under his plan OSHA will work with employers to identify and correct hazards.<p>
Ballenger's subcommittee recently began holding hearings on OSHA reform, and heard from both supporters and detractors of  H.R. 1834.  Business organizations were extremely supportive of the measure, while representatives from organized labor were not pleased.<p>
Thomas Donahue, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO ripped apart the measure by
calling it a "cruel and regressive measure that puts workers' lives in danger."<p>
"It [H.R. 1834] presumes that employers will act responsibly on their own, without
government oversight or intervention, in the best interest of workers, despite a long history demonstrating this not be the case for many employers," testified Donahue.<p>
Ballenger's bill does not remove enforcement, but shifts the balance 50-50 with non-enforcement efforts to be phased-in over three years.<p>
Expansion of non-enforcement programs in H.R. 1834 include:<p>
<ul>
<li>State consultation grant programs for on-site assistance to small businesses in high hazard industries.
<li>Increasing OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP)  -- which recognizes employers with exemplary safety programs and records, and grants exemptions from enforcement inspections.
<li>An emphasis on training and education to promote safe work practices for both
employers and employees.
<li>A new certification program to allow individuals to conduct workplace inspections.  A
business would not be inspected by OSHA as long as the business remained 
accident-free and had no employee complaints.<p></ul>
The Clinton Administration has also heard an earful from both employers and members
of Congress regarding OSHA's heavy hand.  In response to political pressure, and criticism from the business community, OSHA lowered financial penalty rates that were vastly increased by Labor Secretary Robert Reich.  OSHA assistant secretary Joseph Dear will not pursue controversial ergonomic rules which the agency has been preparing for years.<p>  
And, the Administration has put forward its own reform initiative that would "reinvent"
OSHA.  While recognizing the need for changes in OSHA, President Clinton believes
Republican plans go way beyond reform. <p>
"They're [Republicans] not trying to reform the system of worker protection as we are,
but instead to dismantle it," said Clinton.<p>
The Congress is scheduled to have more hearings on OSHA reform -- not soon enough for business groups who must deal with sometimes silly and outrageous regulations. <p>
The National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), for example, has its own top-ten list of "favorite" roofing regulations.  Eight out of ten are OSHA inflicted.  For example, OSHA's rules:<p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibits gum chewing while roofing. 
<li>Require the posting of signs saying respirators are required even when they are not. 
<li>Require employers to train employees on hazards of exposure to deadly materials like chalk, lumber and dishwashing detergent.
<li>Fines employer if a roofer smokes on the job. <p></ul>
...and the list continues.<p>
According to Washington business leaders, the time has come to reform OSHA.  Craig
Brightup, Vice President of Government Relations at NRCA, says changes are long overdue.<p>
"Over the past 20 years, the very foundation of OSHA has held business completely in
the pejorative. They believe business cannot be trusted to implement meaningful health and safety programs themselves, and this is simply not true," says Brightup.<p>   
According to Brightup, H.R. 1834 is designed to reward and support businesses who
make a good faith effort, which most employers do.
While everyone, except organized labor, believe OSHA must be reformed, the question
remains as to how far the President will go to make the agency less burdensome.  With the '96 election cycle moving quickly upon us, the Administration needs the support of labor at the ballot box making business groups wary of the President's intentions.<p>

<title>Is It Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</title>
</head>

<h2>Is it Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher recently referred to his old Department as "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  Presumably, Washington budget-cutters agree and have decided that its time to clean out the Department of Commerce's closet. <p>
The U.S. House and Senate recently passed balance budget resolutions that would erase the deficit in seven years.   The budget-cutting ax has been broadly wielded, cutting and eliminating many government programs and agencies which have traditionally  benefitted American business.  The Department of Commerce is one such program targeted for elimination by both the House and Senate budget plans.<p>
The Commerce Department has long been a target of conservative budget cutters who see the department as wasteful, inefficient and duplicative of other programs.<p>
The government's own watchdog agency, the Government Accounting Office (GAO),
uncharitably describes Commerce as well.  GAO reports that the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" sharing its "mission with at least 71 federal department, agencies and offices."  More than 60 percent of its budget is allotted to programs entirely unrelated to its mission.<p>
Legislation proposed in the House and Senate would eliminate most  of Commerce, while transferring, consolidating and privatizing its useful functions.  Rep. Dick Chrysler (R-Mich.) recently introduced "The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995" in the House, while Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) introduced a companion bill in the Senate.<p>
"This is not just a reckless effort to slash programs for the sake of cutting government," said Chrysler.  Chrysler chaired a three month effort in the House to study and examine the Commerce Department.<p>
"If we found that a program was duplicative, we consolidated it.  If a program was better performed by the private sector, we privatized it.  If it was beneficial, we streamlined it," added Chrysler.<p>
In addition, programs found wasteful were eliminated.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that both Senate and House Commerce Department elimination measures would save taxpayers more than $7.765 billion over five years.<p>
What parts of Commerce would be eliminated, while others salvaged under the
Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995?  Highlights include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative functions of Commerce and the Office of the Secretary, General Counsel and Inspector General -- eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $250 million.</b>
<li>Minority Business Development Agency -- eliminated.  Found to be duplicative of the functions of the Small Business Administration and private sector.<b>  Estimated savings -- $1.139 billion.</b>
<li>United States Travel and Tourism Administration -- eliminated.  Promotional activities already considered performed by the private sector, states, localities and public sector organizations.<b>  Estimated savings -- $75 million.</b>
<li>Technology Administration.  Gone are programs that specifically fund applied research  programs, and invest taxpayer dollars in new technology promotion.  The National Technical Information Service is privatized while the weights and measure functions of the National Institutes for Standards and Technology is transferred to the National Science Foundation.<b> Estimated Savings -- $1.872 billion.</b>
<li>Patent and Trade Office.  Transferred to Justice Department and supported through fees.<b>Estimated Savings -- $375 million.</b>
<li>Economic and Statistics Administration.  Bureau of Census transferred to Justice.  Bureau of Economic Analysis transferred to the Federal Reserve System. <b> Estimated Savings: $827 million.</b>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Commerce's budget, would have its various functions privatized and
transferred to more appropriate agencies. <b> Estimated savings:  $2.338 billion.</b>
<li>Export and Trade Administration functions would largely be transferred to the Office of Trade Representative while other miscellaneous duties eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $385 million.</b></ul><p>                   
The threat of closing Commerce's door has not brought with it a firestorm of protest from the Washington business lobby.  While some business leaders see the elimination of Commerce as the price to pay for a more fiscally sound government, others have remained silent on the prospects of its closure. <p>
A recent private survey conducted by Business Week magazine, however, found that 69 percent of  business CEO's  it polled favored eliminating the department.<p>
Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown remains the biggest advocate of preserving the
department.  In his efforts to save Commerce, Brown contends that the department is crucial to business and U.S. competitiveness.  Brown also believes that eliminating Commerce would leave a void for business in the Administration.<p>
"These plans to cut Commerce would eliminate business' voice at the Cabinet table just when we have created the most successful public-private partnership relationship in history," remarked Brown.<p>
Critics of  the Clinton Administration do not view Brown's presence during Cabinet
meetings as having been beneficial for business.<p>
Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Business Leadership Council remarked that "It's a sad commentary on the Clinton Administration when only one cabinet member thinks he represents the interests of business.   Secretary Brown is a spokesman for only a fraction of the business community.  All Cabinet members should have a shared agenda of economic growth and job creation through policies that include lower taxes and reduced regulations, a real pro-business agenda -- an agenda we have not seen from Mr. Brown or the Clinton Administration." <p>
With hardly a whimper from the business community to keep the doors of Commerce open, elimination may happen.  But President Clinton and Secretary Brown have made several political friends through Commerce Department activities (such as private trade missions abroad) and may ask those who benefitted to turn up the heat on Congress to stop its door from shutting for good.<p>

<title>SBB:  Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</title>
</head>

<h2>Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</h2>
<p>
</center>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Nearly 4 million illegal aliens are living permanently in the United States. In response to a growing problem, momentum is building in Congress to create a national worker database which would verify the employment eligibility of all U.S. citizens and eligible immigrants.<p>

	Critics of the proposed system have voiced concern that a worker registry would cost taxpayers billions while adding an expensive regulatory condition on U.S. businesses.<p>

	At a time when elected officials are aiming to lift regulatory burdens on U.S. business, the critics say a worker registry would create more paperwork, cause more delays interfere with hiring decisions and spawn legal concerns because of unchartered civil rights issues.<p>

	The national worker registry was recommended by the Commission on Immigration Reform -- more widely known as the Jordan Commission -- chaired by former Rep. Barbara Jordan. The worker registry would be created by merging the databases of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<p>

	Legislation proposed by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, would require employers to call the worker registry system to verify that an applicant is legally authorized to work.<p>

	A forthcoming proposal in the House by Lamar Smith (R-TX) is expected to call for the establishment of a national worker identity card. The ID system would consist of a single tamper-proof card modeled after the social security card.<p>

	The Clinton administration has favored such an approach, as well as the national computer registry. In his proposed 1996 budget, President Clinton included $28 million to start integrating various government databases so the work registry can be developed.<p>

	The administration has also been testing its own program, the Telephone Verification System (TVS). With this system, businesses would be required to purchase special equipment to comply with worker verification.<p>

	For two years, nine companies have participated in the TVS project. The companies call
the INS to verify that non-citizens who apply for work are eligible for employment. A review of this project found that the INS could not accurately rely on the computer information 28 percent of the time and had to perform a manual search of its records.<p>

	According to a special report by the Justice Department, which evaluated the TVS project, secondary verifications were very burdensome to employers. Businesses, which already complain about the burdensome nature of the current employee verification system (the I-9 form), would have more forms to complete as part of the hiring process with a national computer registry. Employers would have to maintain authorization receipts on each employee they check through the new system. Employees subject to secondary verification will require yet another form.<p>

	Of serious concern to business groups and those involved with civil liberty issues, is the federal government's ability to competently manage the immense database. Accuracy of data will be critical to making the registry work, and both the INS and SSA have been widely criticized for inaccuracy in record keeping.<p>

	In California, for example, the INS admitted it lost 60,000 green-card applicant files. And the INS has experienced error rates as high as 30 percent. SSA has estimated that cleaning up its database would initially cost $122 million, and each year thereafter $30 million to maintain.<p>

	According to a 1988 General Accounting Office report, of about 210 million Social Security numbers active "at least 75 percent issued without proof of the individual's identity or citizenship."<p>

	With 65 million Americans changing jobs or entering the job market each year, even a 1 percent failure rate could be problematic -- 650,000 workers could be affected by even minimal errors.<p>

	In addition, those concerned about privacy have speculated that a centralized system would spur the government to include more information about individuals.<p>

	A key feature of the proposed is a monitoring system that tracks which companies access the system. The government would then have the ability to track business's hiring practices, as well as the individual employment history of every American.<p>

	With other major issues before the Congress such as deficit reduction and tax cuts, the proposed national worker registry has received little attention from the news media or the Congressional leadership in either the House and Senate. However, as such legislation makes it way through committees in both chambers, more Members of Congress are beginning to pay attention to the ramifications of a centralized worker registry.<p>

	Will Congress enact a data system affecting 100 percent of the population to combat the problem of 1.5 percent who live in the United States illegally.<p>

	Given the momentum to limit the size and scope of the federal government, the worker registry will indeed be put through a rigorous examination process in Congress. As more business groups learn about the proposed system, the debate will become even more rigorous.<p>

	Karen Kerrigan is president of the Small Business Survival Foundation in Washington. Her column appears twice monthly.<p>

<title>SBB: The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



 June 1995 - This time last year, small business organizations were fighting against President and Mrs. Clinton's plan to radically overhaul our nation's health care system. The employer mandate, the centerpiece of the failed proposal, did not sit well with small businesses.  The "crisis" rhetoric seems to have toned down, but high health care costs along with the inability of many businesses to provide health care for their employees still remains a priority issue for our  nation's smaller employers.
<P>
The magnitude of the problem was recently confirmed at the White House Conference on Small Business where nearly two thousands elected delegates from all corners of the country gathered in Washington from June 12-15 to develop a national small business agenda for the Clinton Administration and Congress.  The dominant health care issue was tax equity.  Small businesses and the self-employed only want what corporations already have -- the ability to deduct 100 percent of their health care insurance expenses.
<P>
Is health care reform dead under the leadership of the new Republican controlled Congress?  The answer is no.  But rather than big government schemes and mandates, health care proposals are emerging from the new Congress that are more market-based.  One idea, that has been tried and tested in the private sector is tax free Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  The concept has taken Capitol Hill by storm, and it seems that all serious proposals to reform our nation's health care cost problem include an MSA provision.

<P><b>Health Care's "Sick" Underlying Structure</b><P>
   The MSA, say its supporters, will re-establish the buyer-seller relationship between consumers and suppliers of health care services.  Under the predominant third-party system of payments, neither consumers nor providers have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.
<P>
The two veins to the third party system, government involvement in the health care market (especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare) and an expanded definition of "insurance," have perverted health care costs while shielding the health care industry from real market forces that produce competition.   By definition, insurance is supposed to cover catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predicable expenses.
<P>
Such an expansion of the definition of health insurance, says Small Business Survival Foundation Chief Economist Raymond Keating, "would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the lawn, trimming bushes and painting the house."
<P>
Third-party payments have drastically increased over the past three decades.  In 1950, for example, government financed 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percent was covered out of pocket.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</I>, by 1991, government financed expenditures equalled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and only 19.2 percent was out of pocket.  
The effect of the usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been steadily rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditure between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer index of 332 percent.

<P><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b><P>	The most common MSA scenario would shift standard health care plans to a split system of an MSA combined with a catastrophic plan.  A standard plan costing $5,000, for example, could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.
<P>
The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee now has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he or she does not use by year-end, the employee has an incentive to comparison shop for health care purchases and needs.  As consumers become more concerned with costs, MSA supporters contend that health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services -- in other words real competition will be injected into the health care market.
<P>
According to Dan Perrin, Executive Director of the Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, a 1.6 million member coalition of business organizations that support MSAs, lower income individuals would especially benefit from the reform.  "Under the current system, most people must shell out money until they reach their $500 deductible.  With an MSA, employees have immediate access to funds, easing financial concerns which makes them more happy," says Perrin.
<P>
The MSA account is also owned by the employee, and therefore portable.  Individuals can also build savings in their MSA accounts, which in turn helps offset health care costs in case the employee loses their job.

<P><b>MSA Legislation</b><P>
On June 13, Reps. Bill Archer (R-TX) and Andy Jacobs (D-IN) introduced the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act.  The centerpiece of the legislation includes the creation of MSAs.   At a time when the new Congress is working to be more budget conscious, detractors of MSAs contend that the bill will "cost" taxpayers too much.
<P>
However, Perrin claims that whatever the bill will cost (according to some Capitol Hill sources estimates have been placed at $1.18 billion over five years), it is as close to revenue neutral as you will get, but with dramatic results for our nation's health care system in terms of making health care more affordable for all Americans.  Businesses, too, will benefit from MSAs as administrative costs are reduced according to Perrin.  Forbes, Inc., using an MSA plan since 1991, has reduced its insurance premium costs by 27 percent.  
<P>
Perrin predicts that MSA legislation will be enacted by early fall.  According to other supporters, the current Republican leadership in Congress is anxious to address the health care reform issue, and believes that MSAs will empower individuals while providing incentives to save for expenses not covered in their health plans.  Businesses will be given an opportunity to participate or shift to a system that is more consumer-oriented and puts employees directly in control of their health care purchases.
<P>
The new Congress may not immediately give small businesses and the self-employed the equal tax treatment they are looking for, but perhaps they are giving Americans the opportunity to be consumers once again in the health care market.<P>

<title>Small Business and the Flat Tax</title>
</head>

<h2>Small Business and the Flat Tax</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - While a hot, mid-summer debate is expected between the U.S. House and
Senate regarding the size and scope of tax cuts (if any at all), both chambers are moving full speed ahead on hearings to study a complete overhaul of our nation's tax system. <p> 
Committees in the House and Senate have already held hearings on the "flat tax"  -- a
simplified postcard system popularized by Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey.  The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a three-day marathon session from June 6-8 on all leading alternative tax systems.   The main plans for replacing the current income tax system include a flat tax, a national sales tax, a consumed-income" tax, or a value-added tax (VAT).  <p>
Hearings on the flat tax and its impact on the small business and entrepreneurial sector were held by the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the House Small Business Committee.  Chairman, Linda Smith (R-WA), a freshman who operated a tax consulting business, is particularly interested in determining the effects of the flat tax on small business.<p>  
"We are placing them [small businesses] at the forefront of the debate on revamping the federal tax system to ensure their voice is heard," said Smith.   <p>
The Subcommittee heard from a diverse group of economists and business organizations, as well as Majority Leader Dick Armey and Senator Arlen Specter (R-Penn) who testified on their respective flat tax proposals.  The Armey Flat Tax plan includes the following elements (after being fully phased in over a three year period):<p>
<ul>
<li>all wages, salaries, and pensions would be taxed at a flat 17 percent rate (begins at 19 percent);
<li>capital gains, earnings from savings, and dividends would not be subject to taxation.
<li>a personal exemption of $13,000 would be permitted for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, and $26,200 for a married couple filing jointly, and $5,300 for each dependent.  Exemptions would be indexed for inflation.
<li>business owners would pay a 17 percent rate on the difference between revenues and  expenses, assuming of course that revenues exceed expenses.  The tax would be levied on gross revenue minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest, or payments to owners.<p></ul>
Concerns of members of the subcommittee ranged from transitional issues -- eg: how will small businesses be impacted as the federal government moves from the current tax system to the flat tax? -- to questions about what deductions small businesses may lose under the flat tax scenario.  Economists as well as business leaders agreed that transitional issues are important because business owners have made long-term business decisions based on the current U.S. tax code.<p>
In terms of the impact on business deductions, economist Alvin Rabushka (author of the notable book The Flat Tax) stated that all costs associated with operating a business are fully deductible as business expenses.  According to Rabushka, home offices, advertising costs, and business meals, for example, are qualified business expenses.<p>    
Raymond Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
outlined his criteria for members of Congress to consider upon designing a tax system:<p>
<ul>
<li>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>No Taxation of Capital
<li>The Inflation Factor (its effects should be factored into a system's design)
<li>Clarity
<li>Simplicity
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>Minimum Incentives For Tax Avoidance
<li>No Additional Boost to Government Spending<p>
</ul>
In his overall assessment of the flat tax before the subcommittee, Keating stated that the flat tax scores high as measured against these standards.  The main downside according to the SBSC economist was that the flat tax was still an income tax which historically has been "high-octane fuel for government spending." <p>
While most small businesses agree that the current tax code is a convoluted mess, the race is still on to convince them that elected officials can design a more fair, less-taxing system.  But as recent surveys show, the flat tax is becoming more popular with business owners and entrepreneurs.  In a recent nationwide survey of 500 small business owners sponsored by SBSC, 56 percent of respondents supported the Armey flat tax proposal.<p>
Powerful interest groups lay waiting in the wings, however, firmly convinced that they
will be severely impacted by the flat tax.  The housing industry, realtors, bankers, accountants and tax attorneys feel they have much to lose under a flat tax system.   Under the Armey flat tax plan, the home mortgage interest deduction would be abolished.  Specter's flat tax (a 20 percent rate) retains the home loan benefit up to $100,000.<p>
To some Washington observers, overhauling the nation's tax system will be politically
impossible.  To others, just being in a political environment where hearings are actually
occurring is a miracle in itself.  Still yet to come is the bottom-line analysis of how the various tax proposals impact the engines of economic growth -- the nation's small businesses.<p>

<title>The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2><a href="http://www.accf.org">The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</a></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - The debate of the 1980's is back, and it is focused on a cut in the capital
gains tax and who benefits from it.  Opponents say it's a big tax cut for the wealthy and will drain the U.S. Treasury.   Supporters contend the cut will benefit everyone by increasing investment, savings, the availability of capital, and tax revenues for the government while decreasing the cost of capital for business investment.<p>
The Republican's Contract With America proposes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income, and indexing the rate for inflation.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  The capital gains tax cut in all likelihood will pass the U.S. House of Representatives, but is expected to meet stiff resistance in the Senate.<p>
Partisan sparks flew on the first day of  the Ways and Means Committee tax bill mark-up in the House of Representatives setting the stage for a series of heated and lively debates when the bill hits the floor for a vote.  Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) warned that "the Republican tax cuts amount to a massive perk for the privileged, while hard-working middle-class families barely benefit at all."  <p>
Responding to Gephardt, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) said that the Minority Leader was conducting a "misinformation campaign."  The capital gains tax cut measure, included within a $188 billion tax cut proposal for families and businesses, passed the powerful tax writing committee by a 21-14 party-line vote.<p>
What do the experts say about the capital gains tax?  Is it really a tax cut for the rich? 
And, even if it is, does that mean that every one else loses?<p>
<center><b>Economic and U.S. Job Growth</b><p></center>
The U.S. is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business sector for new job creation.  Over 80 percent of the new jobs in 1993, according to Duns and Bradstreet, were created by small businesses.  But many business owners and entrepreneurs still face a major obstacle to start-up, growth and expansion -- the daunting task of raising capital.  The business advocacy groups in Washington, D.C. favor a capital gains tax cut because it will encourage investment in the small business and entreprenuerial sector. <p>
According to the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) Center for Policy
Research, the favorable tax treatment of capital gains is critical to start-up businesses which tend to be riskier investments.  The ACCF Center, in a special report entitled Questions and Answers on Capital Gains, states that most start-up money comes from the family and friends of entrepreneurs.  Lower capital gains taxes encourages these potential investors to risk their savings due to a return in appreciated stock.<p>
High capital gains tax rates significantly cut into potential returns thereby diminishing
incentives to invest.  In the real world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the opportunity for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in high-risk ventures, even in new and existing businesses of families and friends.<p>
A examination of venture capital investment in the United States over the past decade has shown a deep decline.  Venture capital was on the rise up to 1986 as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked from 20 percent to 28 percent in 1987 (see chart).  Supporters of reducing and eliminating capital gains tax rates claim that capital would be unlocked, and more capital access to budding and expanding businesses with lower rates.<p>
Critics of  lowering the capital gains tax rate say it will do little for the market,  and
doubts the cut will "free up" capital for investment.  In a paper entitled Another Tax Break for the Wealthy, Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute writes that lower tax rates create incentives to hide other income in tax shelters.  Rather than increasing investment in business, a reduction would only add to the tax shelter industry.<p>
<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Spectrum</b><p></center>
A review of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) individual income tax returns show that
capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe, or what is reported.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Total incomes of $100,000 or less claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

<title>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</h2>  
</center>                                 
<hr>
<br>
April 1995 - Many newly-elected members of the 104th Congress campaigned on a pro-business agenda.  These mostly Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, many of whom are small business owners themselves, used the Contract With America as the centerpiece of their campaigns.  What's in store for the business community according to the new Republican majority?  A less-meddlesome, less-regulating, less-taxing federal government.<p>
Already the U.S. House has enacted many of the "Contract" reforms they promised. 
Quite remarkably, most of the legislation to date has easily sailed through the House with the solid support of pro-business Democrats.  But, the most contentious parts of the "Contract" remain, as the House turns to a comprehensive tax relief and spending cuts package.  U.S. Senate passage of many "Contract" provisions also remain in doubt, as Senate leaders say they have their own agenda and timetable for legislation. <p>
Special interests opposed to the "Contract," such as environmental groups, consumer
organizations and the trial lawyers to name a few, have largely focused their lobbying efforts and resources on the upcoming battle in the Senate.<p>
<center><b>Regulatory Relief</b></center><p>   
A comprehensive regulatory reform package,  and a year-long moratorium, or "time-out," on newly proposed regulations easily swept through the House.  Nearly 4,500 new regulations proposed by the Clinton Administration are subject to the moratorium.  The Senate's version of the legislation gives President Clinton the authority to exempt regulations he views as needed to prevent an "imminent" threat to the health and safety of the public.  The Clinton Administration opposes the moratorium. <p>
     Highlights of regulatory reform legislation enacted by the House include:
<ul>
<li>Cost-benefit analysis and risk-assessment standards to be applied to proposed regulations.
<li>The paperwork burden on businesses to be reduced by 10% annually.
<li>Stepped up protection and compensation for private property owners when government regulations reduce the value and use of property.
<li>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law already on the books to protect small businesses from excessive regulation, to be strengthened to give small businesses the right to take legal action against the government to enforce the law.
</ul><p>
At a press conference celebrating the passage of reform in the House, regulatory pointman, Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-TX), said the legislation is "the first step toward freedom for millions of individual Americans and hundreds of thousands of job-creating businesses and industries."  <p>
<center><b>Legal Reform</b></center><p>
It seems that if your business involves any risk (which inherently it does) it's not a matter  of when you'll get slapped with a lawsuit, but how much it will cost.  Business interests in Washington played a key role in passing the Common-Sense Legal Reform Act in the House.  The goal behind the legislation, say its supporters,  is to stem the tide of  frivolous law suits, and give business more freedom to do business and pursue innovation.<p>  
Major components of the legislation include:<p>
<ul>
<li>A "loser-pays" rule whereby the losing party in the law suit pays the attorney's fees of the winner.  The amount, however, is limited to the total cost of the loser's own legal fees.
<li>Product Liability:  joint liability for noneconomic damages are abolished under the Act, and a $250,000 cap on punitive damages. 
<li>Lawyer accountability strengthened and "junk-science" testimony disallowed.
<li>Greater protection for growth companies against class-action shareholder law suits.
<li>Written notice must be given to the defendant at least thirty days before a plaintiff can bring suit.  
</ul><p>
<center><b>Tax Relief? What's on the Line for Your Bottom-line</center></b><p>
Remaining "Contract" items of direct consequence to the business and entrepreneurial
sector include a comprehensive tax relief package, coupled with deep spending cuts.  It is shaping up to be the most contentious battle to date in the House.  What's on the line?  Tax cuts for business include:<p>

<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Cut</b></center><p> 
Supporters of the 50 percent cut in, and indexation of the capital gains tax say it will spur economic growth, reduce the cost (while increasing the amount) of capital for investment in small business, and bring in more tax revenues to the federal treasury.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  Detractors say its a tax cut for the rich, and will drain the treasury.  With class warfare heating up, and widespread support for reducing the deficit, a cut in the capital gains rate may squeak by the House, but looks dimmer every day for passage in the Senate.<p>

<center><b>Home-Office Deduction</b></center><p>  
The tax laws concerning home offices are contradictory and confusing according to many home-office users.  The "Contract" proposal clarifies the deduction for home-offices.  A business owner will qualify if the office is essential to the user's business, is used on an exclusive and regular basis and when tasks in the office cannot be performed elsewhere. <p>

<center><b>Business Expensing</b></center><p>  
The amount small businesses can deduct for equipment purchased in its first year would double to $35,000.  The proposal includes competitive depreciation rules for all businesses under the Neutral Cost Recovery System.  The top-tax writer in the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-CA), also determined that the alternative minimum tax should be repealed on a phased-in basis.<p>
<center><b>Estate Tax Exemption</b></center><p>  
The proposal calls for an increase in the exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 to help small businesses pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation.  Quite often, the heirs to the family business are forced to sell the business to pay estate taxes under current law. <p>   
<center><b>Paying for the Cuts</center></b><p>
While business likes what it sees on the tax relief and regulatory reform end of the deal,
Republican leaders are bracing for an onslaught of direct lobbying when the spending cuts program is unveiled.    Federal government subsidies to large corporations and industries, as well as the Small Business Administration and other government agencies, are on the chopping block to "pay for" the tax cuts package. <p>
With the public calling for fiscal accountability in government, and many business
owners irked that they have to balance their books to stay in business, lawmakers in  Washington, they contend, should be forced to do the same.  The questions remains as to whether the majority of members in the 104th Congress believe they can reduce the deficit, while providing Americans and businesses with much needed relief.<p>

<P>
Dear Senator ____________:<BR>

<P>
As a small business owner heavily burdened by taxes, I am writing
to urge your support of Senator John Kyl's efforts to eliminate
the federal estate, gift and generation&#173;skipping taxes. 
His &quot;Family Heritage Preservation Act&quot; is long overdue.
 Death taxes must be abolished, nothing less will suffice.<BR>

<P>
I work hard for my family and my employees.  Along the way, I
seem to pay almost every tax imaginable, including income, payroll,
sales and property taxes, not to mention a wide range of fees.
 Naturally, these taxes make it very difficult for me to build
up savings and make additional investment in my business.<BR>

<P>
On top of all this, the government imposes various death taxes.
 It is incomprehensible to me that after paying taxes all my life
&#173;&#173; both personal and business &#173;&#173; the government
could take up to 55% of my buinsess and personal assets.  <BR>

<P>
Please tell me what kind of an incentive I have to continue investing
in and expanding my business?  Indeed, as I get older, why should
I continue in business at all?<BR>

<P>
It is my hope that the business I built will continue on after
I'm gone, hopefully under the guidance of one of my children or
grandchildren.  The federal government's death taxes make this
dream less likely.  It is my understanding that 60% of businesses
fail to make it to a second generation, and 90% don't survive
to a third.  No doubt taxes are a major cause for this dismal
survival rate.  <BR>

<P>
In addition, for all the trouble caused, federal death taxes apparently
count for only 1 percent of federal revenues.  It seems to me
that the government would be far better off getting rid of these
taxes, and thereby encouraging more investment.<BR>

<P>
Again, I urge you to support the &quot;Family Heritage Preservation
Act.&quot;  I don't think it is fair to pay taxes all your life,
and then have the government ask for even more at death.  I believe
that the inherent unfairness of the tax is something reasonable
members of both parties can agree on.  I urge you to repeal this
punitive job-killing tax.<BR>

<htmL><HEAD><title>SBSC Issues:  Davis-Bacon Repeal</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2>Davis-Bacon Repeal</h2><p><hr size="4" width="45%"></center>
<P>SBSC has fought hard for the repeal of the notorious Davis-Bacon Act.  This Act was enacted six decades ago in an effort to reduce the influx of black southern workers into northern federal construction projects.  The Act grants the federal government power to determine an area's "prevailing wage."  This anti-market provision has resulted in driving the costs of construction up, thereby increasing costs to taxpayers, while simultaneously creating a large paperwork burden.  Davis-Bacon has prevented small construction firms, who cannot afford to pay the inflated prevailing wages, from competing for federal construction projects.  Davis-Bacon has also prevented many contractors from hiring minority and unskilled workers, who are denied employment opportunity due to hiring preferences resulting from Davis-Bacon.
<P>
Davis-Bacon repeal was recently taken out of the Republican budget bill, and some members of Congress wish to strengthen Davis-Bacon (which they mistakingly call "reform") by applying it to off-site construction. The Department of Labor recently imposed Davis-Bacon wage and paperwork requirements on those who build ships for the federal government.  Obviously, it is important that we step up the fight for Davis-Bacon repeal.  
<P><i>See Karen Kerrigan's testimony "<a href="/sbsc/ct2-15-5.html">Repeal of the Davis Bacon Act</a>", or Raymond Keating's "<a href="/sbsc/reg1-5.html">Repeal the Davis Bacon Act</a>" for more information.</i>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Immigration Reform</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3> Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S. 1394
<P>
Immigration in the National Interest Act, H.R. 2202</h3><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
In the name of immigration reform, the House immigration subcommittee
recently passed H.R. 2202 sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith
(R. TX).  Contrary to the smaller-government principles espoused
by the Republican Congress, H.R. 2202 and similar Senate proposals
(S.269 and S. 1394), increase federal government spending, expand
governmental control over businesses, and will ultimately weaken
the United States' economy.  
<P>
The latest statistical report from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) noted a drop in United States legal immigration
for the fiscal year 1994.  Ironically, our nation's legislators
and presidential hopefuls believe that illegal immigration and
legal immigration are pressing national problems requiring immediate
and drastic measures.  
<P>
The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup of
Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal immigration proposal, S.
1394.  Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal immigration legislation
intensifies the restrictive measures of H.R. 2202.
<P>
Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire foreign
workers.  Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign help would have
to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of the employee's annual compensation
including wages and benefits.  In addition, employers would be
forced to pay that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion
of the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act).
<P>
  Moreover, H.R. 2202 and S. 269 (a similar Senate <I>illegal
</I>immigration proposal authored by Senator Simpson) mandate
another costly regulation on businesses -- employment verification
system.  Analysts estimate that this latest government-imposed
absurdity, will costs U.S. businesses approximately $4.4 billion
dollars.  And analysts predict the system will do nothing to halt
illegal immigration.
<P>
Furthermore, economists predict U.S. businesses will feel the
force of the mandate at least three times: first, when taxes are
raised to pay for the creation of the database; second, when employers
are required to purchase the machinery to operate the verification
system; and third, when employers are denied eligible employees
because of flawed data. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration and sponsors of the immigration reform
measures are expanding big government to unimaginable levels.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the majority of persons who will get caught in
the system will be American citizens, whose right to work should
never be hindered, and the employer, whose right to employ should
never be relinquished to a government entity.
<P>
For more information on the telephone verification system, see
Karen Kerrigan's Small Business Briefing article Worker Database
Could Cost Businesses Billions.

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Independent Contractors</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Independent Contractors</h2><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
On June 30, 1995, Representative Jon Christensen (R-NE) introduced
H.R. 1972, the &quot;Independent Contractor Tax Simplification
Act of 1995.&quot;  This piece of legislation seeks to establish
clear criteria for defining the tax status for the self-employed
as independent contractor.  Currently, the IRS subjects numerous
individuals who work autonomously to an infamous 20-factor test.
<P>
 This test challenges the tax status of many of those who choose
to work independently.  Additionally, the ambiguous, subjective
20-factor test may reclassify independent contractors as employees,
causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting
with the individual.
<P>
Rep. Christensen's bill would clearly state who is not an employee,
and it allows independent contractors to avoid the 20-factor test.
<P>
 Currently H.R. 1972 is in the House Ways and Means Committee.
<P>
Despite large support from the small business community and many
legislators, this bill requires a continuous effort to ensure
passage.  For more information, see Karen Kerrigan's article &quot;IRS
should revise contract-worker tests.&quot;

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Minimum Wage</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Minimum Wage</h2><hr width="45%" size="4">
<p></center>
Congress is once again considering a minimum wage hike.  The Senate recently approved a procedural motion that will bring a minimum wage increase vote within the next several months. The minimum wage, which is politically popular, is most harmful to small businesses.  Most employers pay above the minimum wage, and many determine wages according to the minimum wage.  Thus an increase in the minimum wage will have a ripple effect on the wages paid by businesses - many small firms simply cannot absorb such a budget impact.

<h3>
Time to Overhaul Labor Laws and the NLRB<BR>
</h3>
<P>
<b>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
<br>
Small Business Survival Committee
</b>
<hr>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Since its creation in the midst of the Great Depression and the
New Deal, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been a
source of great controversy.  Depending upon which political party
controlled the White House, therefore controlling the appointment
of the NLRB's five board members, accusations would fly regarding
the NLRB leaning too far in favor of either the rights of workers
or management.  <BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, the controversy created by the NLRB perpetuates
the outmoded notion that business managers/employers and their
employees must always be in conflict.  Under its current modus
operandi, the NLRB hurts both workers and businesses &#173;&#173;
and therefore, the economy in general.<BR>
<P>
The Unfair Labor Practices Controversy.  The NLRB was established
under the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) of 1935.
 The Board is empowered to conduct and certify elections to determine
if employees desire to be represented by a union, and to prevent
unfair labor practices by both employers and unions or their agents.
 <BR>
<P>
While the Wagner Act and other pieces of federal labor legislation
over the years are usually portrayed as benefitting employees,
in a very real sense, such legislation takes away the individual's
right to contract.  In congressional testimony on February 7,
1996, Richard L. Trumka, Secretary&#173;Treasurer of the AFL&#173;CIO,
asked: &quot;Are we still committed to the right of working men
and women to associate freely?&quot;  Unfortunately, the answer
to this question is &quot;no,&quot; and has been &quot;no&quot;
for decades.  Labor laws &#173;&#173; supported by Mr. Trumka
and his union &#173;&#173; require individuals to join unions
and/or pay union dues, who otherwise would not choose to do so.
 The interests of labor's leaders win out over the interests of
non&#173;union workers and individuals who have no interest in
joining a union.<BR>
<P>
More prominent controversies arise related to the NLRB function
of preventing unfair labor practices.  As James Bovard puts it
in his book Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty:
&quot;In reality, an 'unfair labor practice' is whatever displeases
a majority of the five political appointees to the National Labor
Relations Board.&quot;  Not surprisingly, a body carrying the
title the &quot;National Labor Relations Board&quot; carries an
inherent bias in favor of labor unions.  A cursory examination
of NLRB decisions reveals just such a bias:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Earlier this year, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed an NLRB decision which created, according to the Court,
the &quot;imprimatur of industrial anarchy.&quot;  In the Earle
Industries case, the NLRB sanctioned an employer who had disciplined
an employee for escorting a trespasser, activist Jesse Jackson,
through the plant during a union organizing campaign.  The Court
ruled that the employee's interest in unionizing could not override
the employer's interest in protecting its property.1  <BR>
<P>
<li> Again in Lost Rights, James Bovard notes stark differences
in how the NLRB treats employer and union actions: &quot;NLRB
officials have a very expansive concept of coercion when it comes
to management behavior; companies have been found guilty of 'unfair
labor practices' for merely criticizing unions or for offering
raises to their workers before the workers vote on whether to
join a union. ...  Yet the NLRB ruled in July 1993 that a Teamsters
union local affiliate's filing of a $20 million class&#173;action
lawsuit against an employer just before an election was not objectionable
conduct or an unfair labor practice.&quot;  In addition, Bovard
outlines various cases of union violence and the lack of response
by the NLRB.  Bovard concludes:<BR>
</ul>
<P>
&quot;Picketing routinely degenerates into a simple economic blockade
&#173;&#173; an effort to cutoff entrances and exits of the picketed
site.  Thus, it is surprising that the NLRB finds excuses or pretexts
to discount the reality of picket&#173;line violence.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Indeed in certain ways, the NLRB has become a means for perpetuating
union violence and threats.  For example, as reported in SBS Foundation's
Labor Watch (Issue 8), the NLRB apparently forgot the violence
associated with the 1985 strike against the Chicago Tribune stirred
by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike came to a close
in 1986, and by May 1989, the process of reinstating striking
workers was well under way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and addresses of replacement workers still employed
at the Tribune.  The NLRB ordered the Tribune to hand over the
information.  Fortunately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit ensured employee protections and refused to enforce the
NLRB order.  Violence against replacement workers during the strike
included tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing
of a delivery driver.<BR>
<P>
The Clinton NLRB.  President Clinton's NLRB has exhibited overt
favoritism toward the labor union agenda.  Indeed, the NLRB now
has crossed the line from a largely judicial body into the realm
of public&#173;policy advocacy and politics.<BR>
<P>
For example, NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV has publicly declared
his support for banning the employer's right to hire striker replacements.
 Gould also has denounced the TEAM Act, which would allow employers
and employees to form committees to work together on workplace
issues &#173;&#173; a simple act of teamwork and cooperation that
the NLRB deems in many cases as illegal under the Wagner Act.
<BR>
<P>
Also, the NLRB has proposed implementing a single&#173;site rule,
which carries huge potential benefits for labor unions.  The rule
presumes that a single facility of an employer is the appropriate
bargaining unit under most circumstances.  This makes union organizing
efforts far easier for smaller entities such as restaurant franchises.
 <BR>
<P>
Other recent pro&#173;union NLRB decisions include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> In Manganaro, the NLRB legalized anti&#173;dual shop clauses
which could allow unions to shut down non&#173;union subsidiaries
or impose union membership on non&#173;union workers without a
secret vote.<BR>
<P>
<li> In California Saw, the NLRB virtually neutered employee
Beck rights by letting the unions themselves to decide what are
and are not union political expenses.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Elliott Turbomachinery, the Board gutted property and
ownership rights by ignoring contract language granting an employer
exclusive discretion in relocating its facilities.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Shepard Convention Services, the Board ruled against
its own regulations and ordered a mail ballot election, and then
certified a union even though it was endorsed by only 9 percent
of eligible voters.  This decision was reversed upon appeal, however.
</ul>
<BR>
<P>
In addition, President Clinton made clear the political nature
of the NLRB.  Late last year, the President formally nominated
Senate staffer Sarah M. Fox (Sen. Ted Kennedy's chief labor counsel
on the Labor and Human Resources Committee) to the Board.  Ms.
Fox's pro&#173;union credentials are quite formidable.  She has
been a union lawyer and a key strategist for pro&#173;labor union
legislation.  Knowing this appointment was in grave danger, the
President added Ms. Fox to the Board through a recess appointment
in January.<BR>
<P>
The President reportedly now seeks two Republican appointees to
bring the Board to full complement.  Though, the strong union
ties of the three current Democrat members are no way in doubt.
<BR>
<P>
Reform Measures.  Labor law and the NLRB are in desperate need
of reform in order to protect the rights of individual workers
and business owners.  Ideally, the federal government should extract
itself from involvement in labor issues altogether.  However,
chances of repealing federal labor laws and leaving matters to
the states are currently quite remote, to say the least.  Therefore,
the following principles should lie at the center of labor reform
efforts:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> No individual's right to contract should be subjugated
to other individuals' desires for union representation.  A National
Right to Work law stating that no one should be required to join
a union, nor be forced to pay dues to a union, needs to be passed.
<BR>
<P>
<li> Severe consequences should result from union violence.
 Some argue that the pro&#173;union labor laws of the early half
of this century were implemented in response to employer violence
against union organizers.  In the second half of the twentieth
century, union violence against non&#173;union workers and employers
calls for clear and severe penalties against unions and their
members who participate in and promote violence.  Clearly, the
NLRB should not establish acceptable levels of violence permitted
on picket lines before action is taken (as the Board currently
does).  No degree of violence is acceptable.  The law should be
unequivocal, including decertification of unions involved and
jail time.<BR>
<P>
<li> The NLRB has been reluctant to put an end to union &quot;salting&quot;
campaigns, whereby union organizers apply for jobs at non&#173;union
sites with the intent of either bringing discrimination charges
against the employer to the NLRB, disrupting the workplace, or
running up employer costs.  Such individuals do not seek legitimate
employment, but instead seek to organize and inflict economic
damage.  Clear laws against salting are needed.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Put an End to Activist Regulators.  The NLRB is an example of
judicial activism taken to the extreme.  Politically appointed
&quot;judges&quot; have a documented history of making decisions
based on their own views of the world, rather than according to
laws.  The NLRB also exemplifies the general problem with Congress
and the White House delegating powers to regulators and rule&#173;making
bodies.  Indeed, the time has come for our elected officials to
take direct responsibility for the federal regulatory apparatus,
including the NLRB.  The powers of regulators should be clear
and limited, and all rules, regulations, and fines approved by
Congress and the President.<BR>
<P>
In the end, as for the NLRB, its blatantly political and activist
decisions call into question its very existence.  If the federal
government is to remain intertwined in labor issues, then oversight
of elections and initial prevention of unfair labor practices
are reasonable duties that can be carried out with some degree
of objectivity.  However, Congress should give serious consideration
to allowing disputes arising from this process to go directly
to federal courts and eliminating the NLRB's judicial role altogether.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Economic Fallout from Reduced Advertising and Promotional Expenditures</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>
Under the generalship of Commissioner David Kessler, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared war on a host of businesses and industries.  Recent FDA battles include raids on vitamin clinics and orange juice producers, a pseudo-science attack on silicone breast implants, and a bureaucratic assault on the nation's health and economic vitality through long delays in drug and medical device approvals.1  By outflanking its original mission, now the FDA adds an attack on the tobacco industry to this seemingly ever-growing list.  A question remains: Is this a "just" regulatory war?<p>Considering that tobacco products always have been legally produced and sold in this country and that individual freedom and choice is rightfully cherished in a land of liberty, clearly makes this new FDA regulatory war just as unjust as the battles listed above.  Simply because a handful of elected officials and federal government bureaucrats do not like certain products does not give them the right to rage a regulatory jihad in response.<p>In addition, any just war theory calls for no direct attacks on or injuries or fatalities to non-combatants.  Hence, during wartime, attacks on civilian targets usually generate moral outrage.  In regulatory wars, noncombatants of the economic type always suffer.  The FDA's move against tobacco will have a real and significant impact on noncombatants -- lending even greater weight to the charge of the FDA waging an unjust regulatory war.  Numerous among these noncombatants will be a host of small businesses, including convenience and grocery stores, advertising companies, a variety of manufacturers, print shops -- the list goes on and on.  <p>FDA's Proposed Tobacco Regulations.  According to the Federal Register, the FDA proposed tobacco regulations include prohibiting cigarette vending machines, free samples, mail-order sales, and self-service displays; limiting advertising and labeling "which children and adolescents are exposed to" to black-and-white, text-only formats; no advertis
ing within 1,000 feet of a school or playground; banning the sale or distribution of branded non-tobacco items such as hats and t-shirts; and restrict sponsorship of events to the corporate name only, not the tobacco product brand name.  Also, the proposed regulations would federalize 18 years as the legal age for purchasing tobacco products and require that manufacturers fund anti-smoking educational campaigns.  <p>Specifically, the FDA's stated goal is to cut youth smoking by half within seven years, and if not achieved, then taking unspecified, additional steps.  Of course, the impact of these measures would reach well beyond any youth market and raises worrisome questions about the FDA's long-term goals relating to the tobacco industry.  After all, an August 1995 report by the FDA declared "that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products is a drug, and that these products are drug delivery devices within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."  If true, the criminalization of tobacco products production and distribution must be a real possibility.  One has to wonder: Is the FDA seeking prohibition with all its commensurate woes?<p>For the short term, though, this FDA effort is essentially based on the highly questionable notion that advertising has a significant impact on youth decisions to smoke -- much more so than the more likely influences of peer pressure and family life.  The FDA also assumes that the federal government should, and can, direct the personal tastes and habits of Americans.  As in other cases where the nanny state runs amok, real and significant economic costs are incurred.<p>
<b>FDA Faulty Estimates</b>  According to an economic analysis performed for the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation by the American Economics Group, Inc.2,  the FDA's projections of potential job losses due to these regulatory proposals are grossly underestimated.  The FDA asserts that approximately 1,000 jobs annually would be lost in the tobacco warehouse, manufacturer, grower, and wholesaler sectors for about 10 years.  While a ten-year total of 10,000 jobs lost is nothing to gloss over, the American Economics Group report notes that this amounts falls far short of the actual numbers: "Incredibly, the FDA does not include a job loss estimate for the sectors that would be most vulnerable to its regulations -- the advertising, manufacturing and retail industries."<p>Substantive Cost Estimates.  The American Economics Group study for SBS Foundation examined the sales, employment, and wage impact of promotional and advertising expenditures by tobacco firms and found the following:<p>
<ul>
<li> Based on 1993 numbers, direct spending on advertising and promotion by tobacco companies employs an estimated 78,836 workers in the United States, and by the time you factor in the additional activity generated by these individuals, "the cycle of buying, all begun by tobacco advertising and promotion, continues until ... 209,112 persons are employed as a result."<p><li> Direct advertising and promotion purchases by tobacco firms amounted to more than $6.1 billion in 1993, with total generated purchases topping $17.9 billion.  Direct wages and salaries amounted to more than $1.9 billion, and "subsequent activity" generated more than $3.2 billion for a total of over $5.2 billion in wages and salaries in 1993.<p>
<li> Direct advertising and 
promotion expenditures by tobacco firms fall into 11 major industry categories -- food products and tobacco, apparel, printing and publishing, rubber and leather products, instruments and related products, miscellaneous manufacturing industries, transportation, wholesale trade, retail trade, business services, and miscellaneous services.  Subsequent derived expenditures impact 37 different industry groups.<p>
<li> The proposed FDA tobacco 
regulations place much of these advertising and promotional expenditures at risk, and therefore, the businesses -- many small, entrepreneurial firms -- tied into such activity as well.  <p>
<li> In terms of lost jobs, the report concludes that about 45,000 full and part time direct jobs and at least 65,000 derived jobs could be lost over a three to five year period.  This job loss estimate is 11 times the FDA's estimate.  And it should be remembered that these American Economics Group estimates only count jobs related to a decline in advertising and promotional expenditures by tobacco firms due to the proposed regulations, and not additional job losses due to any kind of decline in the purchase of tobacco products.  <p>
</ul><b>Excess Regulation Hurts the Economy</b><p>
  If a federal government agency is going to declare war on any industry with increased oversight and regulation, then a full accounting of the potential damage should be undertaken.  Increased federal regulation is not a costless endeavor.  Regulations have the same impact as taxes -- raising the costs of investing, risk taking, and generally "doing business."  These costs translate into less investing and entrepreneurship, lower profitability, increased chances of business failure (especially for smaller firms operating on a razor's edge), and less employment.  Therefore, federal agencies like the FDA have a responsibility to realistically examine the costs and benefits of their regulatory initiatives.
  <p>Unfortunately, when 
undertaking a regulatory jihad, FDA officials fail to even concern themselves with proper jurisdiction -- tobacco regulation has never fallen within the FDA's regulatory domain -- never mind real costs.  Orange juice producers, vitamin clinics, medical device firms, drug companies, and now tobacco-related businesses -- more and more industries are being sucked into the FDA's unjust regulatory wars.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Attack on Vending Machines, An Attack on Jobs and Small Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

In the <a href="/sbsc/rw-fdaw1.html">first installment</a> in this three-part series, it was noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) proposed tobacco regulations could cost the economy -- at minimum -- an estimated 110,000 jobs over a three to five year period.1  This far outpaces the FDA's own estimate of 10,000 jobs over ten years.  The FDA failed to account for the full cost of its proposed legislation.
<P>One industry hit particularly hard by the proposed regulations is vending services.  Under the proposed FDA tobacco regulations, the sale of cigarettes through vending machines would be completely banned.  
<P>In a recent Wall Street Journal article ("If Cigarette Industry Coughs, Remote Areas Expect to Catch Cold," October 26, 1995), Mark Stomel, the owner of a vending machine company, noted who would be hurt by such a ban: "The man that fills the vending machines, the mechanic that fixes them, the people who do the maintenance of the vehicles. ... It spreads like wildfire."  He also reported that 25 percent of Stomel Vending Co.'s sales would be wiped out.
<P>The National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) reports that cigarettes and tobacco sales represent 7.1 percent of sales by automatic merchandise machine operators, and a ban on these sales would mean thousands of lost jobs.
<P>The FDA claims that it has undertaken this regulatory assault on tobacco in order to cut youth smoking in half in seven years.  The FDA assumes that an end to cigarette distribution through vending machines will greatly assist this effort.  However, NAMA's numbers tell a different story.  <P>
<ul>
<LI> Cigarette purchasing habits of individuals ages 13 through 17:<P>				Convenience stores		43%				Gas stations			29%				Grocery stores			11%				Vending machines		  9%				Drug stores			  6%<P>

<LI> Location of vending 
machines:<P>		Locales rarely frequented by minors		77.5%			Bars, cocktail lounges		31%			Industrial plants		27%			Offices				12%			Hotels/Motels			  4%			Universities/Colleges		  3.5%		
Other Locales					22.5%			Restaurants			13%			Terminals, Rec - Bowling Centers, misc.	  9.5%			   <P>These numbers raise serious questions regarding the FDA's efforts.  Meanwhile, such a highly questionable undertaking presents real risks to an industry completely dominated by small businesses.  Vending Times reports that 26 percent of vending service providers are one-person (or family-only) establishments; 15 percent have only one part-time employee; another 28 percent claim 1-3 full-time employees; and 10 percent have 3.5-5 full-time employees.  In total, an incredible 90 percent of all vending firms employ less than 20 employees.  The survival of many of these firms is placed in jeopardy due to the proposed ban of cigarette sales through vending machines by the FDA.  </ul>
<P>While the FDA should not be involved in tobacco regulation at all, the aforementioned numbers addressing the purchasing habits of young smokers and the location of vending machines, show that little, if anything, would be gained on the youth smoking front by banning vending machines and throwing small businesses into turmoil.  The job of stopping youth smoking -- a goal worth supporting -- falls to parents, not federal government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  Governmental social engineering always fails -- and at great cost to the taxpayer, business, and the economy.<P><hr><P><center><b>End Notes</b></center><P>

<h3>FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become the model of a plodding, costly, and even deadly government bureaucracy.  The agency remains infamous for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.	The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.	
<p>
FDA Responsibilities.  The FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.	
<p>
To implement this ambitious agenda, the FDA staff totaled 9,217 in 1994, up from 1,678 in 1960 -- an increase of 449 percent.1  In 1994, the FDA's gross budget authority equaled $935.7 million.2	
<p>
<b>FDA vs. Entrepreneurs</b>
<p>
  As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on the food, pharmaceutical, and medical device industries -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading industries.	Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the agency's counterparts in Europe."  The impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."	
<p>
Henderson also noted, "The average time it takes a drug company to develop and gain approval of a new drug has almost doubled over the past 30 years -- from 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.  And, reports the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ... more than 60 percent of new drugs and biologics (genetically engineered pharmaceuticals) approved here in the 1990s were first approved in another country."<p>

<li> Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of regulation."	Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.<p>

<li> Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."<p>

<li> Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.	In addition, Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."<p>

<li> One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer competitors for established firms.<p>

<li> A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."3  <p>

<li> In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.<p>

<li> A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.4  <p>

<li> FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 126 days.5  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.6   These applications are supposed to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  		Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.7  New device approvals, however, are supposed to be completed within 180 days.	Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 months between 1986 and 1993.8  Of course, all of these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.<p>

<li> The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.9  <p>	

Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost tens of thousands of lives annually, as products and treatments are being denied to American consumers.	Export Restrictions.  Adding insult to injury, the FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval process is needed in order to export.10  	

The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... So we had to export our manufacturing plant."11  	
</ul>
<P>
<b>Entrepreneurs in the Regulatory Process?</b>
<P>
  One can at least be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives recognizes the many woes of the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.12  Under the FDA's yoke, entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations and jobs out of the country, or close down operations altogether.	
<p>
Congress needs to take bold steps.  Reports about FDA incompetence, abrasiveness, gridlock, intrusions, and costs are so numerous that they lead one to believe that more than mere reform is required.  Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan pointed in the right direction when he wrote in the June 27, 1995 Washington Times: "Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."	
<p>
According to economist James Bovard writing in the December 8, 1994 
Wall Street Journal: "Rep. Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a government agency, the sentiment is correct.  In addition, this addresses a nagging question regarding the FDA: Can regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound judgments regarding such dynamic industries as biomedical companies?  Tapping medical entrepreneurs is a good idea, but would be better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake FDA safety approvals.  Meanwhile, efficacy should be left to the marketplace.	
<p>
>b>Global Competition</b>
<P>
  The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime is operating within an increasingly competitive global environment.  An agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does ensures that U.S.-based firms operate at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.  	
<p>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.

<h3>FDA Facts: Strong-Arming American Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee<p></b></center><hr>
<p>		
In the previous Small Business Reg Watch 1995, "FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee examined many of the costs and delays that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) imposes on firms in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries.  As a result, enterprises have either cut back on research and development, moved operations out of the country, or simply closed their doors.	However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly aggressive and intrusive.  One might say that the FDA has been strong-arming U.S. businesses.	FDA Intrusions.  Reports abound of the FDA's move to more aggressive and confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."<p>

<li> In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reports: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to confiscate the merchandise."<p>	

Naturally, the orange juice was perfectly safe, not to mention healthy.  Dr. Kessler action was meant to send a message to American businesses that the FDA was calling the shots.<p>

<li> Bovard noted another, similar raid.  This time it wasn't orange juice, but vitamins the FDA was after: "On May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."<p>

<li> Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush.  Refusing to resign from his post under a directive given to all presidential appointees during a normal transition to a new administration, Kessler worked hard to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the following excerpts:<p>"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health regulatory agency."<p>"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."<P>"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."<p>"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."<p>"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week at a federal law enforcement training 	center in Georgia."<p>"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."<p>	Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.<p>

<li> This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-level FDA employee."<p>

<li> In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against vitamin and natural product manufacturers."<p>

<li> One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According to published reports, on Wednesday, July 12, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  	

<p>Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of tobacco products by the FDA.  	Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the control of the nanny state.	

<p>Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?  I'm overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages.  Will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?<p>	

As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  If Dr. Kessler and the FDA truly cared about the public's health, they would improve the efficiency of their medical device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.<p>	
</ul><P>

<b>A Return to Safety Approvals and Education</b>
<P>
  The list of FDA abuses continues.  The time has come to rein in what has become largely a personal crusade. Much to the chagrin of FDA Commissioner Kessler, the FDA indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-zealousness, arrogance, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to other firms.  Instead, it should be one of cooperation with some of America's most dynamic and crucial industries.  	

<p>In light of potential litigation costs, lost profits, and the possibility of going out of business, firms in the medical device, food, and drug industries possess every incentive to produce safe products.  As usual, the market offers its own system of checks and balances.	

<p>Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries are meeting the most essential human needs -- food and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products in such areas remain substantial.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions, as touched upon in this paper.    Entrepreneurs are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new products and services -- not the FDA.  	

<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he recently observed in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA "seems incapable of reform."  The FDA needs to be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education, with  a food, medical device, and pharmaceutical safety approval process largely contracted out to private-sector firms.<hr>

<h3>FDA Facts: Spending More to Get Less</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

Delays in  medical device and drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have become infamous.  As noted in the <a href="rw-fda1.html">first installment</a> in this short series, for example, new device approvals now take anywhere from 437 days to 840 days, and approvals for mere changes in existing products take an average of 173 days to 213 days.  These periods compare with the required approval times of 180 days and 90 days, respectively.  Median time for approving new drugs tops three years -- 38 months in 1993 vs. 12 months in 1986 -- with the average time stretching out even farther.  Meanwhile, the total time to develop and gain FDA approval of a new drug has risen from an average of 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.	When confronted with such a dismal and costly performance record, FDA defenders will say that the agency is in need of more resources.  A quick look at FDA budget and employment levels tells quite a different story.	FDA Budget.  Figure 1 provides a glimpse at the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-adjusted 1994 dollars.  To say the least, budget growth at the FDA has been robust.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 
52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars since 1955 of more than 76 percent cannot be justified.<p>
</ul><P>

<b>FDA Employees</b>
Figure 2 illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does not seem to plague the agency.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.	
</ul><P>

<b>Incentives Problem</b>
<P>
 Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem quite a stretch of the imagination to believe that the FDA lacks sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.   Also, given the fact that the FDA suffers when an approved product fails, but garners little attention for the woes brought on by its own delays, the agency's incentives to prolong its approval process remain clear.   Taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, bigger budgets, and overly aggressive regulators are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.  Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  Such an outcome can only materialize if private-sector involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices is enhanced.<p><hr><P>

<h2>Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
<h3>by Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
"By imposing high wages and restrictive work practices on nearly any federally funded construction project, the Davis-Bacon Act costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in excess construction fees every year -- and freezes tens of thousands of unskilled workers out of jobs."<p>
 
--Eugene H. Methvin, "<i>A Scandalous Law That's Costing Taxpayers Millions</i>," Reader's Digest,  December 1994
<p>
"Davis-Bacon increases costs to such an extent on federally-funded construction contracts that most small businesses are effectively precluded from bidding -- limiting competition and further raising costs for taxpayers."<p>
  --Karen Kerrigan, President, SBSC<p>
<hr>
<p>
Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims some racist origins; increases costs to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?  Of course, the answer should be a resounding "yes."  The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore, should be repealed.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act requires that contractors on federally-funded construction contracts in excess of $2,000 pay workers what is termed "prevailing wage" in the region.  Supporters claim that Davis-Bacon was passed to ensure that local labor standards prevailed and local wages were not driven lower.  Most others tell another story.<p>
 
<h3>Pandering to Organized Labor and Racism</h3>

In a December 1994 Reader's Digest article, Eugene H. Methvin writes that Davis-Bacon was a "cruel relic of the Jim Crow era."  He points out that Davis-Bacon "was born in the Great	Depression year of 1931, after an Alabama contractor had submitted the low bid to build a veterans hospital on New York's Long Island and hired black laborers who had been largely shut out of the higher-wage construction unions."  New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill to block lower wages, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>
Just as was the case in the 1930s, low-income earners, limiting competition especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such inndividuals.<p>

<h3>Damaging Small Business</h3>

Small businesses are particularly hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Government-determined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area.  In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts.  Of course, these estimates tend to be arbitrary, dated, and/or rely solely on union rates.  Many small businesses cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates.  In particular, small businesses in inner-cities, who are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers, are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

In addition, the paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors.  In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or contracting agency on a weekly basis.  This requirement forces many small contractors to higher additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules.  The result: higher costs that discourage small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>


<h3>Costs to Taxpayers and the Economy</h3>

This lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages, of course, translate into higher costs for taxpayers and the economy.  Various estimates of the increase in total construction costs due to the Davis-Bacon Act have been made, including:<a href="#foot1">1</a><p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1993, if Davis-Bacon were repealed and Copeland Act requirements lifted, federal taxpayers would have saved $3 billion over the following five years.                                                         
<li>The Department of Defense estimated in the mid-1980s that Davis-Bacon induced an added cost premium of 5 percent.
<li>In 1979, the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated an average cost inflation of 3 percent to 10 percent tied to Davis-Bacon.
<li>Some local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent.  Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.
<li>The GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.
</ul>

In addition, part of the Davis-Bacon rationale was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region.  Yet, as noted in a 1986 study by Armand J. Thieblot for the Wharton School, local contractors have gained a larger share of private contracts than they do Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

Also, the Davis-Bacon Act spawned numerous state-level imitators -- placing similar requirements on state and local government contracts.  Just as does the federal Davis-Bacon Act, these state acts raise costs for taxpayers, deny economic opportunity to many less-skilled workers, and damage small business.<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from Department of Labor bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al.  The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distorts the marketplace -- artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers independent of job criteria.  Costs rise; the entrepreneur suffers; unemployment increases; and taxpayers foot the bill.<p>

The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) supports the straightforward remedy proposed by U.S. Representative Tom Delay (R-Tx.) to the many problems created by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Rep. Delay's bill simply reads: "Davis-Bacon of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act) is repealed."<p>

Raymond J. Keating serves as economics advisor to the Small Business Survival Committee, and is the co-author of D.C. By The Numbers: A State of Failure (University Press of America, 1995)<p>

<center><h3><I>Small Business</I> Budget Watch</h3> 
<i>November 1995</i> 
<P>
<I><B>Talking Points on H.R. 2472 (Davis-Bacon Expansion)</B></I>
<hr size="3" width="45%"></center>
<UL>
<LI>H.R. 2472 expands the coverage of Davis-Bacon off-site. This
bill applies inflated Davis-Bacon wage rates to <I>&quot;laborers
and mechanics employed by the contractor or subcontractor to work
directly upon the site of the work, including work at fabrication
plants, batch plants, tool yards, rock pits, or similar facilities

... that are not located on the project site, but the principal
purpose is to provide construction materials for the project;
and laborers and mechanics employed by a contractor or subcontractor

... to transport debris, materials, supplies, and equipment to
or from the site of the work...&quot;</I> 
<P>Obviously, this will
dramatically increase the cost of federal construction as other
industries are drawn into the Davis-Bacon wage trap. This bill
also would apply Davis-Bacon to all federally-assisted construction
(presently, Davis-Bacon applies only to contracts entered into
by the federal government or through related acts). Small firms
which materially support and transport material to/from federal
projects and those who perform work on federally assisted projects
would be severely burdened by the expansion of this harmful law.
<P>
<LI>While this bill would raise the Davis-Bacon threshold to $100,000,
it fails to produce any real cost savings. Although roughly two-thirds
of the total number of federal contracts will be eliminated from
Davis-Bacon requirements, less than 4% of the dollar volume of
federal contracts will be eliminated, resulting in minuscule savings
for the taxpayer. The renovation and repair threshold, which would
apply to <I>&quot;repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or alteration,
including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public
works of the United States...&quot;</I> is set at $25,000 -- this
creates a bifurcated threshold, which will increase legal and
administrative burdens.
<P><LI>This bill would allow any &quot;laborer, mechanic, or organization&quot;
to petition the Secretary of Labor in order to determine the applicability
of Davis-Bacon. This provision would increase the likelihood of
legal squabbles. Many small firms cannot absorb such litigation
costs.
<P><LI>This &quot;reform&quot; does not even significantly reduce
the Davis-Bacon paperwork requirements imposed on contractors.
</UL>

<P>
This bill is not reform, it's a ploy to increase the applicability
of the Davis-Bacon Act. Actually, Davis-Bacon is not reformable
-- it has no place in American government. This law, which has
cost taxpayers billions of dollars and denied opportunity to small
firms and minority workers, can prove useful only if eliminated.
Reports of fraud indicate that as long as Davis-Bacon exists,
it will continue to impose unjust, wasteful costs on taxpayers.
Time is running out on the Davis-Bacon Act, as Congress and the
public are beginning to realize it is beyond repair.

"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the
growth and survival of small businesses, taxes will be a priority
for each and every small business person who votes on November
5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill  at a press conference
supporting the <I><B>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</B></I> -- an
effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), a 60,000 member
national taxpayer organization.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead
middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax
increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise
to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  The <I><B>Pledge</B></I>
separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax-and-spenders,"
said Kerrigan.
<P>
There are 2 versions of the <I>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</I>:
state and federal.  Signers of the state pledge promise to oppose
and vote against <U>any and all</U> efforts to increase taxes
while federal pledge signers promise to oppose increases in marginal
income tax rates and reductions or elimination of deductions and
credit.
<P>
 To date, GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole, Libertarian Presidential
candidate Harry Browne, 210 U.S. House of Representatives, 35
U.S. Senators, and over 700 candidates or incumbents for state
legislators have signed the pledge.

Update on a Few Issues<BR>
</b>
</center>
<P>
First, a quick thank you for those of you who weighed in to help
us defeat the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).  As you know, both would have placed
new regulatory burdens on business.<BR>
<P>
<B>CWC</B> -- In the end, the Senate did not have enough votes
to pass the CWC so supporters decided to pull it from consideration
for ratification.  What this means is that our CWC victory is
temporary.  The bad news is that the CWC will probably rear its
ugly head next year.<BR>
<P>
<B>ENDA</B> -- The same can be said for ENDA.  While ENDA was
defeated in the Senate by only one vote, the legislation will
continue to come before the Congress as long as Ted Kennedy remains
a member of the United States Senate.  Stay tuned and prepared.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Immigration </B>-- Legislation to curb illegal immigration
will be voted on soon.  We remain strongly opposed to the voluntary
employee verification program due to the burden it will place
on employers and employees alike.  The &quot;voluntary&quot; system
will most definitely become mandatory in the future.  SBSC believes
that the new system is flawed in that it will be riddled with
errors thus delaying the hiring process.  Please call SBSC to
receive more information so you can contact your member of Congress
with your concerns.

Newt Gingrich at the ceremony, and 60 members of Congress who

the event.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>&quot;While we are pleased that President
Clinton signed several of the initiatives target to help small
businesses, unfortunately he vetoed or stood in the way of other
reform priorities recommended by his own White House Conference
on Small Business,&quot; added Kerrigan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage
of health insurance reforms to help small business including the
phasing-in of deductibility to 80%, and passing Medical Savings
Accounts.  In addition, regulators are now more accountable to
small businesses because Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.
 Regulators must also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain
English&quot; and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations
and vote to reject them.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>President  Clinton vetoed the following small
business initiatives:  capital gains tax reduction, estate tax
reform, legal reform, the TEAM Act and a balanced budget.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress
began to chip away at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful
government spending to balance the budget,&quot; said Kerrigan.</FONT>

CALL TO ACTION: Chemical Weapons Treaty Nears Scheduled Vote
</b>
<P>
 September  6, 1996<p>
 Issue No. 20<BR>
<hr>
<P>
 The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)<BR>
</center>
<P>
The United States' Senate has scheduled a  ratification vote of
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) before September 14, 1996.
 
<P>
Ratification of the CWC - a treaty to supposedly end the production
and stockpiling of chemical weapons - would risk the United States'
national security,  expose U.S. private industry to international
industrial espionage, and cost U.S. private firms billions in
regulatory costs associated with treaty compliance.
<P>
The treaty risks United States' national security because rogue
nations like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea have not signed
the treaty and thus are not bound by the CWC's provisions.  For
other countries such as Russia and China who are signatories,
their ratification of CWC is uncertain.
<P>
Secondly, treaty compliance would be difficult to ascertain. 
Former Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey, stated before
the Foreign Relations Committee in June 1994 that &quot;The chemical
weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective
that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.&quot;  
<P>
<U>The CWC is a nonverifiable, nonenforceable treaty.</U>  The
United States would set a dangerous precedence ratifying the CWC
given that the treaty's provisions would strip the United States
of its ability to protect itself,  while allowing nations  hostile
to U.S. forces the ability to continue their production of chemical
weapons unabated.  
<P>
 In order to detect the production of chemical weapons, the treaty
institutes <U>a time-consuming verification program that is applicable
to a wide range of U.S. companies, that use certain chemicals
in the manufacturing process including - pharmaceutical companies,
textile mills,  paint manufacturers, food processing companies,
breweries, and distilleries.  </U>  The verification system  assigns
regulated chemicals  to &quot;schedules&quot; based upon what
is believed to be their relative usefulness for chemical weapons
production.  Each schedule has reporting requirements which include
copious amount of paperworks for each chemical and inspection
liabilities for the producing and consuming firms.  The U.S. Department
of Commerce estimates that filling out the paperwork will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours for <B>each</B> chemical depending
on its schedule classification.  
<P>
Instead of committing precious hours to operating a profitable
firm, business owners - many of whom are small business owners
- would be required to spend countless hours filling out paperwork
to prove that a chemical regulated by the treaty is used for their
legitimate business purposes.   
<P>
The CWC would be the first treaty in U.S. history to subject U.S.
industry to international authority.  
<P>
There would be 2 kinds of inspection: routine and challenge. 
Routine inspections would be directed at sites producing chemicals
that are perceived to present the greatest risk of diversion to
weapons use.  A firm could be subject to up to 20 routine inspections
per year.    Challenge inspections would be conducted when requested
and can take place within a 12 hour notification period.  There
is no limit on the number of challenge inspections a firm can
be subjected to.  
<P>
Inspectors would be permitted to interview site personnel, inspect
records, photograph on-site apparatus, take samples, record equipment
readings and use instruments to monitor processes.  <U>The company
 would be expected to comply completely with the inspectors' demands.
 The company is  also responsible for bearing the full cost of
the inspection - including  meals and lodging of the inspectors,
as part of the &quot;cost of doing business&quot; in chemicals.
 The Defense Department estimates that U.S. private industry would
pay anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000 for &quot;hosting&quot;
each inspection.  </U>
<P>
The figures given are just an estimate, but the cost to business
could be substantial given the costs associated with the loss
of confidential, proprietary information.  Furthermore, distinct
possibilities exist that due process rights could be violated
in relation to warrantless searches and personnel being compelled
to answer questions, and provide information and access.  
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan asserted, &quot;By all accounts,
the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge the U.S. Senate to
take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an honest assessment
of the treaty will reveal that the costs to U.S. businesses, the
loss of our economic freedom, and the compromising of rights protected
by the United States Constitution do not justify ratification
- especially since the treaty will threaten United States' national
security.&quot; 
<P>
<B>Please call or write your Senators immediately and urge them
to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  </B>A
sample letter follows:  <BR>
<P>
<I>Dear Senator:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I urge you to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) when it is considered by the Senate in September.</I>
<P>
<I>Chemical weapons can be inexpensively and secretly manufactured
and no treaty is going to change that fact.</I>
<P>
<I>What this treaty will do is make it significantly harder for
thousands of Americans to operate their businesses.  Small businesses
- unable to afford the thousands of dollars involved in new paperwork
- will be especially hard hit by the CWC's regulatory and administrative
requirements. The loss of trade secrets will add countless loses
to business operations.  Our economy will suffer irreparable harm.</I>
<P>
<I>Please vote to spare American businesses this unjustifiable
burden by defeating the Chemical Weapons Convention</I>.

<P>
1994 saw a record number of entrepreneurs and successful small
business people elected to Congress.  
<P>
 With 32 of 86 Congressional freshman former (or current) small
business owners heralding the economic advantages of small business
growth, the 104th Congress shifted from an anti-business to a
pro-entrepreneur agenda.   See Congress Becoming More Friendly
to Small Business.
<P>
Small-business Congress members have helped lawmakers focus on
fiscal and tax policies that aid small businesses in creating
new job opportunities for Americans.   
<P>
According to a 1995 March U.S. News &amp; World Report, there
are now 191 representatives who used to work in business-related
occupations, compared with 170 who worked in law.  
<P>
 This week <I>Small Business Hill Alert </I>highlights a speech
by small business woman, Sue Wittig, a candidate for New York's
 26th congressional district.   Ms. Wittig's speech typifies SBSC's
freemarket, limited government ideology. 
<P>
Sue Wittig's address was delivered to GOP delegates at the Republican
convention on August 12th, 1996.  <BR>
<P>
<I>My name is Sue Wittig, and I'm running for Congress.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I'm a small business woman from Saugerties, New York.  Along
with my husband, I run a paint and wallpaper store, a family business
that was started by my Dad over thirty years ago...<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Together with my Mom, [my Dad] built a business - and a family.
 And [he] taught me the value of both.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the value of families...
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the marketplace.  It
is the small businesses of Newburgh, Kingston, Ithaca, and Owego
who are creating tomorrow's jobs.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand limited government.
 Congress was designed to be a citizen Legislature, for people
to ..., serve their community and country, and</I> <B>go back

<P>
<I>...From the small business owners...and the mothers and fathers

<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new <I><B>Small
Business Reg Watch</B></I>  documenting the bias of the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law.
 The report also outlines reform measures to move  labor law and
the NLRB into the 21st century.
<P>
According to the study entitled &quot;Time to Overhaul Labor Law
and the NLRB,&quot; the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the
extreme - blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently
reversed by the courts who hear such cases.  In addition, current
NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or
opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -
an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial
arbritor of labor law.

<P>
The 104th Congress has improved markedly over the previous Congress
in terms of its votes on legislation to help small business and
enhance entrepreneurship. 
<P>
 &quot;Especially during its first term, the 104th Congress was
enthusiastically pro-entrepreneur.  Tax and regulatory relief
legislation, combined with proposals to cut the size and scope
of government all comprise the small business agenda,&quot; said
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan continued, &quot;The change in Congress marked a tremendous
shift in the direction of the small business agenda on Capitol
Hill.  Rather than small business being on the defensive, we were
able to consistently support legislation being considered on the
floor of both Houses.&quot;
<P>
 However, while Congress passed an unprecedented level of legislation
supported by small businesses and entrepreneurs, these measures
were largely vetoed by President Clinton.
<P>
&quot;Unfortunately, the bulk of legislation aimed towards the
growth and survival of small business was rejected by the President,&quot;
Kerrigan noted.
<P>
At the time of the release of SBSC's <I>Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>,
Congress was preparing to send the minimum wage hike amendment
to the President's desk for approval. 
<P>
The ratings were completed prior to the wage hike vote.  Its consideration
would have proven damaging for many members ratings.
<P>

<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</b>
<p>
August 19, 1996<p>
Issue No. 18<BR>
<hr>
<P>
<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur<BR>
</B>
</center>
<P>
With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are
back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.
 And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this
is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business,
entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put
forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Cutting the capital gains tax.</U>  The Dole plan calls
for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals
from 28 percent to 14 percent.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will
do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment,economic growth,
and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax
rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business
remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are
high&#173;risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity
for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half
and you enhance the potential returns from risk&#173;taking.<BR>
<P>
A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide
a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes.</U>
 A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income
tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in
three key ways:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
1) Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and
take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument
&#173;&#173;as the old saying goes, the less you tax something,
the more of it you get.<BR>
<P>
2) Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government
to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals
operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money
far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<BR>
<P>
3) Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either
sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being
corporations), then an across&#173;the&#173;board personal income
tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.
 Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment,
additional employees, et al. <BR>
</ul>
<P>
<li> <U>Additional measures.</U>  The Dole plan calls for other
tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs,
including: <BR>
<ul>
<P>
&#173;<I>Unrestricted tax&#173;free medical savings accounts (MSAs)
and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self&#173;employed.</I>
 MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health&#173;care
system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on
an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Estate tax reductions</I>.  The estate tax amount to
nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.
 All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path
to complete repeal of the estate tax.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.</I>
 Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources
in the private sector.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs</I>.  Such
measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds
available to business.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Regulatory reform.</I>  Requiring peer&#173;reviewed,
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for
new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every
four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting
ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some
much&#173;needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling
businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Legal reform.</I>  Measures such as limiting punitive
damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability
for non&#173;economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency
fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of
the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy
countless businesses and the jobs they create.<BR>
</ul>
</ul>
<P>
U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief,
and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting
new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once
fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would:
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and
entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.<BR>
<P>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment
are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats
(assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results
from too much money chasing too few goods &#173;&#173;faster growth
means more goods and services.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.
<BR>

<P>

<i>July  29, 1996 <p>
Issue No. 17</i><p></center><p>
<i><center> Call to Action : Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),  Institute for Justice Study Participation</i></center>

<hr>
 <center><h2>Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</center></h2><p>

<u><b>On or before, September 14</u></b>, the Senate will consider ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that is supposed to ban the stockpiling and production of chemical weapons.   <p>
Grave  concerns about  the treaty's effectiveness, and its cost  to  national security and business have been raised by defense and policy experts.  <p>
<b>One of the biggest concerns regarding ratification of the CWC is the threat to national security.</b>  Few countries possessing chemical weapons are likely to cease buildup of their chemical weapons program because of the treaty.  In fact, six of fourteen countries suspected by the U.S. of possessing chemical weapons have not signed the treaty.  <p>
Rogue nations like Libya, North Korea, Iraq, and Syria continue production of chemical weapons unabated while China and Russia  - countries with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world - provide inconsistent and contradictory data on their chemical weapons program.  <p>
CWC poses a threat to national security because noncompliance can not be easily detected.  Since the CWC allows ample time for inspected facilities to conceal their activities,  noncompliance  would be impossible to detect.   Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), James Woolsey, testified that the CIA lacks high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.  Noncompliance is therefore unverifiable.  <p>
Signing and ratifying a treaty which is unverifiable sets a dangerous precedent for future arms control agreements and threatens the United States national security.  <p>
<u><b>Another major concern regarding CWC ratification is the direct and indirect cost to U.S. industry.</u></b>   Under the treaty, U.S. private industry would be subject to foreign inspection, thus exposing American businesses to the real threat of international industrial espionage.  Long-held trade secrets and other proprietary information could be compromised in a matter of seconds.  International inspectors  located in the Hague, Netherlands would be responsible for carrying out inspections of U.S. companies.<p>
In addition, American firms - such as distilleries,  breweries, and insecticide, pharmaceutical, ceramic, nylon, paint, textile, soap, detergent, and electronic manufacturers  -  which produce or use a scheduled chemical  would be required to fill out additional paperwork under a new four-tiered process.  (The additional regulatory burden is estimated to take administrators 9 hours for every Schedule 1 chemical, 7.2 hours for every Schedule 2 chemical, 5.3 hours for each Organic Chemical and 2.5 hours for every Schedule 3 chemicals.) <p>
It is estimated that roughly 8,000 businesses currently do not have compliance mechanisms in place.  These businesses and smaller businesses will be hardest hit by the increased regulatory burdens treaty ratification will bring.  (Past studies have shown that the per employee cost of federal regulations is 50% higher for firms with fewer than 500 employees.)  Right now it is estimated that the cost of hosting an inspection is $10,000.  If the inspection is challenged, the cost could be $200,000 - $500,000.   
The CWC is riddled with problems that should concern all Americans.  It will be voted on by mid-September.  Please call or write your United States Senators immediately and tell them not to ratify the CWC in its current form. A sample letter follows:<p>

<i>The Honorable ______<br>
United States Senate<br>
Washington, D.C.  20510<p>

Dear Senator _______:<p>

I am writing to express my serious concerns with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC, in its current form, will seriously damage United States national security and impose a massive, new regulatory burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses.<p>
The CWC will do nothing to reduce the chemical weapon arsenals of terrorist countries and other nations hostile to the United States.  In fact several countries of most concern to the United States have not signed or ratified the treaty.  <p>
I am also concerned with the treaty because it  is unverifiable. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director, James Woolsey, testified that noncompliance of the treaty will be virtually impossible to detect.  
And finally, ratification of the treaty will create another bureaucracy costing U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and imposing costly regulatory burdens on thousands of U.S. companies.<p>
I urge you to preserve our national security and protect U.S. businesses by voting against ratification of the CWC.<p>

For more information on the CWC, please call SBSC at 800-223-7526.<p>

<b>Davis Bacon Update<p></b>

Recently, the Coalition to Repeal Davis-
Bacon met privately with Oklahoma 
Department of Labor Commissioner, Brenda 
Renau.  At issue were cases of fraud and 
abuse that she and her team of investigators 
have discovered.  Because of the U.S. 
Department of Labor's unwillingness to 
cooperate in reform, it is likely that more 
cases of abuse are entrenched throughout the 
U.S.  The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that $7.3 billion in government 
funds could be save in just five years 
without the act which establishes "prevailing 
wages"that employers must pay, usually at 
much higher-than-market prices.  Call 
Representative William F. Clinger, Jr., chair 
     of the House Oversight Committee at     
202-225-5074 to voice your concern.<p>

<b>Starting Wage Hike<p></b>

As you now, both the House and Senate 
recently voted to mandate an increase in the 
starting wage by $.90.  The Senate measure 
is strikingly similar to its House counterpart 
but includes a number of tax breaks for 
small businesses, among them: an increase 
in the spending limit of small businesses 
under Section 179 from $17,500 to $25,000; 
a simplified pension plan for small business 
employers; and deductible contributions to 
individual retirement accounts by non-
working spouses.  Since the bill is not in its 
final stage however, Sen Kennedy and 
others anti-business congressmen are still 
threats.  An amendment offered by Sen. 
Kennedy that would have shortened the 
duration of the subminimum wage ($4.25) 
from 90 days to 30 days failed.  Call your 
Senator or Representative to express your 
strong desire that the small business tax 
credits stay in the bill despite any last 
minute deals by Sen. Kennedy and the like.  
We must remain vigilant if we are to prevail. <p>

<b><a href="http://politicsusa.com/cvc">CAFE Standards</a></b><p>

The CAFE standards will prove to be a hot topic 
on the Hill later this summer.  If President 
Clinton has his way and the standards are 
increased, small business owners could see a 
dramatic increase in the cost of doing business.  
Please write or call President Clinton to express 
your support for the current CAFE standards.  
The following is a sample letter to serve you as 
a guide.<p>

Sample Letter to the White House<br>
Small Business Owner<p>
Sample #1<p>

President William J. Clinton<br>
The White House<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>
Washington, D.C.  20500<p>

Dear President Clinton:<p>

In the last election, voters sent a message to 
Washington:  "Cut excessive Government 
regulation."  As a small business owner, I can 
tell you how important that is.<p>

Several recent news articles blamed the owners 
of light trucks for recent gas price increases.  
They also suggested the answer was increased 
governmental regulation of motor vehicle fuel 
economy.  I disagree.<p>

Higher gas mileage standards would hurt small 
business owners in two ways.  First, the price of 
the larger pickups and vans like we use would 
probably go up to encourage sales of smaller 
vehicles.  Or the manufacturers would have to 
reduce the size and weight of those vehicles-- 
which means I'd have to buy an even bigger, 
more expensive vehicle than I need to support 
my business.<p>

President Clinton, don't let that happen.  We 
need less regulation, not more.  Say that you 
will leave vehicle fuel economy standards right 
where they are.<p>

Sincerely,<p>
<p><br>

<P>
Marking the start of National Small Business Week, the Small Business
Survival Foundation formally released a report that provides a
measure of government-related costs affecting the business decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses across the United
States.  The report, the <B>Small Business Survival Index</B>,
combines nine major costs (whether rates, ratios, or indexes)
levied on small businesses and entrepreneurs into one comparative

<P>
 All businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> including
small businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> face additional
regulations through the proposed adoption of the employment verification
measure.  It passed in both the House and Senate versions of the
immigration proposals. San Diego employers currently using a toll-free
verification system similar to House measure report that the system
can take up to &quot;three calls, several minutes, and sometimes
several days to verify a Social Security number...&quot;  At this
point, the verification system will be voluntary, but SBSC believes
it will eventually become mandatory.
<P>
SBSC's position:  The verification system does not recognize the
administrative and regulatory burdens associated with operating
a business.  Illegal immigrants who show remarkable deftness at
skirting U.S. laws will continue to do so even under the system.
 Hence, the law-abiding employer using the proposed system (and
American citizens) will be the only persons &quot;caught&quot;
by this intrusive system.
<P>
       <B> Time still exists to make your voices heard</B>.  Call
your Representatives and Senators, tell them to say no to additional
regulations  -- &quot;voluntary&quot; or not.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Starting Wage Proposal in the Senate <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Senate will soon offer their version of the starting wage
bill.  It is expected to closely parallel the House proposal and
increase the starting wage by $0.90 by 1997.  The following provisions
have been added: (1) tipped employees would have the federal cash
wage frozen at $2.13 per hour, instead of 50 percent of the current
federal starting wage and (2) new hires would be paid an &quot;opportunity
wage&quot; during their first 90 calendar days of employment.
 
<P>
It is probable that Senator Kennedy will offer an amendment to
strip these provisions - thereby attempting to force a straight
starting wage bill with the $0.90 increase.  
<P>
<B>Small business owners still have time to weigh-in with the
Senators.   </B>Let them know that you oppose any increase in
the starting wage, but if an increase is unavoidable, then include
the small-business provisions passed by the House.  <U>Most importantly,
tell your Senators not to support any amendment that strips the
tip credit or the opportunity wage language.<BR>

<P>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Backed Into a Corner?</b>
<P>
If the budget negotiations were to be decided by who has 
compromised more, the Republicans would be victorious.  
The GOP Congress has compromised $68.5 billion more 
than President Clinton since the beginning of budget talks, 
as the chart below outlines.  (Budget figures are the most 
recent offers of 1/9/96 in billions of dollars.)
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE>
	GOP Compromise		Clinton Compromise

Medicare	+ $58		- $27

Medicaid	+ $48		- $22

Welfare		+$3.5		- $3

EITC		+ $12		- $3

Tax Cuts	- $51		+ $20

Discretionary	+ $60		- $89
---------------------------------------------------<P>
$232.5 toward the Pres.		$164 toward Congress
</pre>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Republicans have compromised more than the  
President in every disputed area with the exception of 
discretionary spending.  The President's latest tax cut 
proposal, which does not provide for a cut in capital gains 
taxes, shows that he has moved less than half than the GOP 
in the area of tax reduction.
<P>
Recent reports suggest that a capital gains tax cut is likely to 
be included in a budget deal.  The Clinton Administration 
may formally propose a 7.5% cut in the cap gains rate for 
individuals with a 17.5% cut for Americans in the lowest tax 
bracket.  Separately, Congressional Democrats have 
continued to rail against a cap gains tax cut, and Vice 
President Gore reportedly has said that opposition to cuts in 
cap gains taxes was "a theological issue" for Democrats.
<P>
Language within the first continuing resolution (CR) to fund 
parts of the government allowed for "protecting our 
priorities" -- which may well mean increased spending 
levels for those politically sensitive areas the President does 
not want to cut.  That vague language has come back to 
haunt the GOP and other proponents of meaningful spending 
and tax reduction.  And, it appears that the compromises by 
the GOP have gone unnoticed.  Republican leaders have 
suspended the budget negotiations, denying them airtime to 
advance their position on the negotiations.  Pres. Clinton 
will use the State of the Union address on January 23 to try 
to bolster his.  Republicans may attempt to move forward by 
enlisting the help of conservative and moderate Democrats, 
though some GOP leaders (including Newt Gingrich) doubt 
that a budget agreement can be reached this year.
<P>
<b>Kemp Commission Points the Way to Tax Reform</b>
<P>
Citing the current tax code's "oppressiveness," "complexity," 
and "intrusiveness," the National Commission on Economic 
Growth and Tax Reform - chaired by former Congressman 
and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp - recommended scrapping 
the entire code.  The Commission advocated a new 
beginning for the American tax code, and laid out a set of 
principles to advance strong economic growth, small 
business expansion, and job creation.  House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-
KS) voiced support for the findings of the Commission.
<P>
Despite a lack of specificity in its final report, the 
Commission has established a strong, meaningful start for 
tax reform.  The Commission called for a flat, fair tax rate 
that embraces simplicity and stability.  The 
recommendations pointed toward abolishment of capital 
gains taxes, full deductibility of the federal payroll tax, an 
end to double taxation, a two-thirds majority to raise the flat 
rate, and expensing of investment outlays.
<P>
The crux of the Commission's report is that the tax code 
should be submissive to the public, particularly small 
business owners.  An unruly IRS is no longer tolerable.  
There is little doubt that the findings of the Commission 
fulfill promises of tax system overhaul, and SBSC supports 
the general guiding principles of the Commission.  As noted 
in an SBSC press statement, however, the report: "is not 
long on details.  Now comes the heavy lifting of making 
detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality."
<P>
Although the Commission recommended including a 
generous personal exemption in tax reform proposals, critics 
attacked the report's embracing of a fair flat tax rate as a 
giveaway to the rich (surprise, surprise).
<p>
The Commission's report is expected to have an  impact on 
current tax reform proposals in Congress.  One leading 
Republican, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer 
(R-TX), was critical of the Kemp Commission's findings.  
Archer supports a tax based solely on consumption and felt 
the report said nothing new.

<I>The New York Times</I> has reported that budget officials expect
to strike a deal by Friday (December 22).  The budget negotiations
began late November, and since that time little progress has been
made in deciding our country's fiscal fate for the next seven
years.  Unfortunately, it has been &quot;politics-as-usual&quot;
at the negotiation table, particularly for the Clinton Administration.
 As the federal debt approaches a massive $5 trillion dollars
with annual deficits of $192 billion (and as anemic economic growth
continues), you would think circumstances would dictate substantive
spending cuts.  Instead, secretive budget negotiations have us
asking whether Santa will bring us a seven-year balanced budget
with pro-growth tax cuts.  Bah Humbug.
<P>
<B>CBO: How Many Billions Can We Spare?</B>
<P>
Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its revised
economic projections - the result of a compromise between President
Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders.  The latest CBO
numbers paint a more positive forecast for the U.S. economy, and
the CBO projects that under the Republican plan, an additional
$135 billion in revenues will be available by 2002.  Washington
insiders rejoiced at this news.  The Administration budget negotiating
team felt that the additional $135 billion would bring Congressional
Republicans closer to the President's spending demands.  Economic
forecasts have failed to live up to expectations in the past.
 While CBO numbers are the most accurate, SBSC was disappointed
that the &quot;expected&quot; additional revenues will be sacrificed
on the negotiating table instead of applied to spending cuts --
which means tax cuts will more than likely be sacrificed as well.
<P>
The more Republicans negotiate behind closed doors with the Clinton
Administration, the more we are likely to see the President's
type of &quot;investments&quot; emerge- a code word for more spending.
 The gross federal debt is over 70% of the Gross Domestic Product
($4.96 trillion).
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Invest in the Future By Cutting Spending
Now and Giving America $245 Billion in Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>The Minimum Wage Hike Returns</B>
<P>
President Clinton included a minimum wage hike in his recently
proposed budget.  The President proposes to raise the minimum
wage to $5.15 (a 21% increase) by July 1, 1997, with an interim
increase to $4.70 in July, 1996.  President Clinton's proposal
is driven by  politics  rather than economics.  As one of his
officials said earlier this year: &quot;There are few of us who
actually think it is good economic policy, but more than a few
think it might be good politics.&quot;
<P>
An increase to the minimum wage is definitely not 'good economic
policy.'  Numerous studies and sources, including the General
Accounting Office  and Brookings Institution, have concluded that
a 10% increase in the minimum wage results in a 1%-2% decline
in overall entry-level employment.  <I>President Clinton's proposal
is  projected to cost 400,000 jobs.</I>
<P>
Only 4.7% of the workforce earns the minimum wage.  Minimum wage
workers are four times more likely to be young, single, and inexperienced
when compared to other hourly employees.  Economists estimate
that only about 11% of minimum wage increases go to individuals
at or below the level of poverty.
<P>
The President's proposal should be treated for what it is - an
unfunded mandate for America's small business owners.  Considering
63% of minimum wage workers get a raise within twelve months (with
an average wage increase of 20%), wage rates would be better left
to small business owners - rather than the President.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: No More Unfunded Mandates Like Minimum
Wage Hikes- Cut Regulations and Taxes For the Best Pay Increase.</B>

<B>Public Voices Support for Seven-Year, Tax-Cutting Balanced
Budget &amp; The Case for Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)</B>
<P>
<B>Poll Indicates Voter Support for a Seven-Year Balanced Budget
with Tax Relief</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
After hearing some of the provisions of the Republicans' seven-year
balanced budget, 57% of those polled said that they had a very
positive/somewhat positive impression of the plan, according to
a poll commissioned by The Coalition for America's Future and
Coalition for a Balanced Budget: 7,200 voters were surveyed between
Nov. 29-Dec. 2.  86% said that the Congress and President Clinton
should deal with the federal budget issue this year: 47% percent
of those surveyed support a balanced budget with spending cuts
<i>and tax relief</i> compared to 39% who support a balanced budget
without tax relief.
<P>
<B>Financial Officers, Greenspan Point to the Need for a Balanced
Budget</B>
<P>
A poll of chief financial officers by the Financial Executives
Institute (FEI) found strong support for a balanced federal budget.
 FEI stated that a balanced federal budget this year will prevent
increased interest rates, falling stock prices, reduced sales,
and higher unemployment.  77% of the financial chiefs said the
economy would take a downturn if there is a failure to reach a
budget agreement this year.
<P>
Similarly, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Capitol
Hill that the recent fall in interest rates, which lowers mortgage
rates and boosts housing and automobile sales, was caused by the
market's anticipation of an agreement between the president and
Congress to balance the budget over a determined period of time.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Continue to Contact your Member of Congress in
Support of a Seven-Year Balanced Budget with Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts - Good for Small Business and Health
Care</B>
<P>
Tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs), which have been praised
by the many businesses that have adopted them as the health care
vehicle for employees, are included in the GOP's Balanced Budget
Act.  MSAs end burdensome paperwork requirements for consumers,
doctors and insurance companies.  And MSAs are portable - each
MSA plan belongs to the employee.  The market dynamics of MSAs
inject cost-consciousness into the health care system.  Thus,
MSAs directly benefit small businesses constantly faced with spiraling
health care costs.
<P>
The congressional budget plan allows MSA tax-free savings of up
to $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.  The accumulated
interest is not taxed under the Balanced Budget Act.  There is
a 10 percent penalty for non-medical withdrawals to MSAs.  (Please
call SBSC for more information on MSAs and how they work.)
<P>
<I>Concord Management, a real estate management firm which employs
nine people, uses MSAs as a health plan.  One Concord employee,
Richard Norton, suffers from asthma.  After obtaining his MSA,
Norton shopped around for the cheapest asthma medication.  Consequently,
he now pays one-fourth the amount of the medication provided by
his employer under Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage.  At the
end of the year, Norton received a check for $750 -- the unspent
balance in his $1,500 MSA.</I>
<P>
The GOP budget plan includes medical savings accounts.  The president's
plan, offered on Wednesday, does not.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Write or Call (202-456-1111) President Clinton
to Include MSAs in the Budget Package. (fax: 202-456-2461, e-mail:

<P>
<B>The Congress' Balanced Budget Act Addresses the Security of
Family-Owned Businesses and Spiraling Growth of Entitlement Programs</B><P>
<B>Why We Must Cut Estate Taxes</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles to the generational transfer of family-owned
businesses is the estate or inheritance tax.  Approximately 60
percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second
generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.
 Are estate taxes the cause?  They are a major contributor.  Nine
out of ten successors to a family-owned business cited trouble
paying estate taxes according to a 1993 survey.  Family-owned
businesses generate about 60 percent of our GDP, and during the
1980s they were essential to the increase of more than 20 million
private sector jobs.
<P>
The Republican budget would &quot;phase-up&quot; the estate tax
exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 each year from 1996-2001.
 The Budget Act would begin factoring in inflation after 2000,
and provide for a total amount of exclusion per decedent for qualified
family-owned business interests equal to $1.75 million.  Although
the modifications stop short of a repeal of the estate tax, SBSC
was pleased to have seen the Congress take steps to turn back
the harmful effects of the inheritance tax.
<P>
It is ludicrous that government claims under the estate tax up
to 55 percent (or any percent) of an individual's assets upon
death, considering that individual had established a business,
worked hard, and paid taxes over a lifetime.  What is even more
ludicrous is the fact that this act of class envy is a big money
loser for the government!  In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted
for a mere 1.2% of total federal receipts ($15.2 billion).  At
least 75% of that revenue is eaten up by compliance and litigation
costs of the IRS and Treasury.
<P>
A cut in the estate tax, besides being morally correct, is good
for the economy.  A 1993 study estimated that without an estate
tax by the year 2000, the GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000
more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and
capital would accumulate.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Don't Give in to Class Warfare Rhetoric!
 Stand by the pro-job, pro-growth Estate Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Capitol Hill Switchboard 202-225-3121
<P>
<B>&quot;Cutting&quot; Medicare and Medicaid</B>
<P>
Unless the President and Congress tame Medicare and Medicaid spending,
the two programs will eventually consume all federal revenues
and/or collapse.  If left on present course, entitlements and
interest on the debt will devour all federal revenues by 2012.
 Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest growing entitlement programs.
<P>
The Republican plan proposes to cut the <i>growth</i> of Medicare
and Medicaid, not the actual programs.  Yet this fact has been
deafened by shear political demagoguery.  The plan would hold
the growth of Medicaid to 5.2% and the growth of Medicare to 7.2%.
 The programs would still experience a major funding increase
between now and 2002.  Medicare outlays would increase from $158
billion to $244 billion.  The chart below illustrates the growth
differences between the Republican plan and the status quo. (CBO
estimates)<HR>

<P>
If left untouched, payroll taxes would have to be hiked to 4.23%
(from 2.9%) in order to preserve Medicare over the next 25 years.
 Cuts in the growth of these two entitlement programs are necessary
if we intend to restore America's fiscal security.  Politics should
not get in the way of reforming these programs.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Medicare and Medicaid Spending are out
of Control - Americans Know the Difference between a Real Cut
and a Cut in the Growth - Keep Cutting!</B>

<B>Economic Growth Through Tax Cuts and a Balanced Budget are
Truly at Stake</B></center>
<P><hr>
As President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders reconcile
their budget differences, it is important to reiterate your support
to your Senators and U.S. Representatives for a seven-year balanced
budget using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) numbers.  While
the president signed an agreement saying he supports a seven-year
balanced plan, already he is backing down from his word.
<P>
<B>ISSUE #1 - A Balanced Budget</B>
<P>
A balanced budget with tax cuts means we will keep more of what
we earn and spend it the way we see fit, rather than government
bureaucrats and politicians.  Will  a balanced budget translate
to a stronger U.S. economy where everyone wins?  Numerous economic
studies say yes.
<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, a balanced budget
will lead to the creation of 6.1 million more jobs in 10 years,
and will boost real per-capita income 16.1%.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A balanced budget means lower interest rates on home mortgages,
car loans, and student loans.  This, coupled with the tax credit,
could mean a &quot;balanced-budget bonus&quot; of up to $2800
a year for a family of four.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to a Heritage Foundation simulation, moving to a
balanced budget between 1996 and 2002 will result in the additional
construction of 104,000 homes and additional sales of 600,000
automobiles over the next seven years. <B>The simulation showed
an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income through
2002.</B>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
It is obvious that a balanced budget within the next seven years
will have tremendous economic benefits for our economy and American
families.  But it is important that the president stick to the
seven-year agreement and use what he said were the most truthful
figures - CBO numbers.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Pass a 7 Year Balanced Budget Using CBO Numbers
<P>
Capitol Hill Switchboard (202) 225-3121
<P>
<B>ISSUE #2 - Capital Gains Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Despite class warfare rhetoric from congressional Democrats and
President Clinton, capital gains tax cuts will benefit all Americans,
not just the rich.  According to SBSC Chief Economist Ray Keating,
the Republican proposal for a 50% exclusion on capital gains income
is the most &quot;pro-growth&quot; step Congress can take this
year.  Firms will pay a top rate of 28%.
<UL>
<LI>A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill found that a top capital
gains tax rate of 25% coupled with indexation of cap-gains taxes
for inflation and retroactivity of the cuts to Jan. 1, 1995 would
reduce the cost of capital by 12% and increase the GDP by 1.7%
from 1996-2005.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, 83.7% of the returns
claiming capital gains came from families with incomes less than
$100,000.  The remaining 16.3% of claims were from families with
incomes over $100,000.  The largest segment of the population
claiming cap-gains (56.9%) have incomes below $50,000 -- the so-called
&quot;rich.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to Economist and SBSC Board Member Richard Rahn,
&quot;The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and
entrepreneurship...the lifeblood of a vibrant economy...the current,
non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on cap-gains remains
a formidable obstacle to economic expansion...and small business
growth.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
President Clinton says he wants a capital gains  tax cut as long
as &quot;it creates jobs and promotes economic growth.&quot; 
The Republican proposal meets that criteria.
<P>
Please make your voice heard and support capital gains tax reduction.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: A Broad-Based Cut in Capital Gains Taxes Benefits All Americans, Not Just the So-Called &quot;Rich.&quot;

<i>November 1995</i>
<P>
<B>The Reconciliation Bill -- What Does it Mean for Small Business
Owners?</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
The House and Senate are finishing work on an enormous budget
package which includes many provisions helpful to small business
owners.  Though the budget plan doest not reduce spending and
taxes as much as SBSC had hoped, we believe the plan is a significant
and necessary step toward fiscal security.  This seven-year balanced
budget proposal faces an imminent veto upon reaching the President's
desk.  Despite strong support for the package within both chambers
of Congress, many lawmakers are feeling the heat from the special
interests.  <B>We encourage all interested small business owners
to contact their elected officials, including President Clinton,
and voice their support for a seven-year balanced budget.</B>
 Some of the pro-small business elements of the package are outlined
below.  Your representative or Senator may be reached at 202-225-3121.
<P>
<B>Capital Gains Tax Cuts -</B> The budget bill would cut taxes
on capital gains (profits from the sale of stock, property or
other assets) $35.7 billion.
<P>
The proposed maximum capital gains tax rate is 19.8% for individuals
and 28% for corporations.  The proposal would make these cuts
retroactive to January 1, 1995.
<P>
The indexation of capital gains to inflation will take effect
in 2001.  Both individuals and corporations would have reduced
capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small business
stock.
<P>
SBSC feels these measures are a step in the right direction as
we fight for elimination of the highly regressive tax on capital
gains.
<P>
<B>Expensing</B> - The expensing amount would be raised for small
businesses.  The amount, currently $17,500, would be increased
gradually to $25,000 by 2002.
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B> - Medical savings accounts (MSAs)
are included in the congressional plan.  Under the plan, individuals
would be allowed to make tax-deductible contributions to an MSA.
 Earnings would be tax free and distributions would also be tax-free.
 Maximum tax-favored contributions for individuals would be $2000,
for families the maximum would be $4000.
<P>
<B>Family Tax Relief</B> - The plan grants a $500 tax credit for
children under age 18 ($125 in 1995) for families earning less
than $110,000, reduces the marriage penalty, and allows for breaks
for those who adopt children or provide custodial care for the
elderly.
<P>
<B>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</B> - The plan would
expand eligibility for traditional deductible IRAs, while also
creating a new IRA in which contributions would be taxable but
earnings would be tax-free.  Also, the plan allows for penalty-free
withdrawals from deductible IRAs.
<P>
<B>Estate and Gift Taxes</B> - An estate tax relief proposal was
included in the package.  The unified credit would be phased up
to $750,000 and a portion of small business assets would be excluded
from the estate tax.
<P>
<B>Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction</B> - The bill would
raise the health insurance deduction of America's self-employed
to 50% by 2002.
<P>
While not perfect, the congressional package of tax cuts and debt
reduction is a fine way to approach fiscal security for America's
future generations.  The Small Business Survival Committee encourages
its members to congratulate Congress on a job well done and to
urge their representatives to stand by the proposal's tax-cutting,
spending reduction measures.

<title>Unleashing America's Potential -- Introduction -- TRC</title>

<h3>SETTING THE EAGLE FREE</h3><br>
<HR>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</center><p><blockquote><blockquote>
<I>&quot;In short, it is a paradoxical truth
that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low,
and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is
to cut the rates now...The purpose of cutting taxes now is not
to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous,
expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.&quot;</I>
<P>
John F. Kennedy<BR>
Economic Club of New York<BR>
December 14, 1962</blockquote>
<P>
These words of President Kennedy were a great inspiration to me as the tax reform movement was 
launched in the early 1980s with the Kemp/Roth tax cut.  Kennedy's vision and
courage can serve as examples for all Americans as we struggle
to make this nation better for our children and grandchildren.
 His remarks from the Economic Club of New York ring as true today
as they did in 1962. 
<p>
 At the first meeting of our commission back in June, I held up a blank sheet of paper and said, &quot;This
is what we start with.&quot;  That was our charge: Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed the
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to study
the current tax code, listen to the suggestions and ideas of people
from around the country, and submit to Congress our recommendations
for comprehensive reform.  
<P>
A very diverse and dedicated group of 14 people, with the help of an invaluable, overworked, and
underpaid staff, set out to design an entirely new tax system
for America's 21st century; one which would promise a booming
economy, promote job creation, and ensure the greatest possible
opportunity for all Americans to work, save, invest, and reach
their potential.  We operated under the premise that an economic
growth rate of 2.5% is unacceptable to the American people.
<p>
This commission was empowered not merely to offer superficial reforms,
to trim a rate here and close a loophole there, but to begin with
a <I>tabula rasa</I> and map out a totally new tax structure for
America's next century.  We also wanted to help inform the whole
world, particularly the emerging democracies, that the goal of
tax policy is raising revenue, not redistribution of wealth. 
<p>
Our nation has arrived at a unique moment in history.  With the
passing of the Cold War, we are standing at the edge of a new
millennium with extraordinary possibilities.  Our country is poised
to help lead the world into a new era of economic growth fueled
by an information-age technological revolution that can yield
unparalleled expansion in jobs, productivity, innovation, and
prosperity.  We must embrace this opportunity and challenge. 
However, such an embrace will prove difficult, perhaps impossible,
if we remain saddled with our current tax code.  The current system
is indefensible: it is riddled with special interest tax breaks,
and it overtaxes both labor and capital.  We must construct a
tax system that reflects our highest values and unleashes our
greatest potential.
<p>
  The comments and concerns we heard from the
American people over the last several months, coupled with a systematic
review of the current tax code, helped us establish certain principles
to guide us to our conclusions.  Surely, a tax code which is simple
and fair must generate sufficient revenue so that the federal
government may carry out its legitimate tasks.  Second, it must
not place a tax burden on those members of society least able
to bear one.  And, perhaps most important of all, it must not
restrict the innovative and entrepreneurial capacities of Americans
upon which rising living standards and our general prosperity
so greatly depend.  Our proposals are in keeping with these principles.
<p>
Wildly excessive and unjust taxes have locked away access to capital
and credit necessary for lower-income Americans to launch the
next generation of entrepreneurship.  Today, sadly, we see the
American people's sense of dynamism and hope, their ability to
strive and compete diminished by a tax code which penalizes success,
retards investment, and sends capital fleeing overseas.  The commission
is united in the belief that only a pro-growth tax code can restore
America's confidence at home and her greatness abroad.  We want
a tax code and an overall economy that will liberate the American
dream and remove the barriers to upward social and economic mobility.
 The American ethos of entrepreneurship and optimism made America
great once before.  We believe these proposals will bolster that
ethos again and help restore integrity and honesty to our system.
<p>
The author John Gardner has observed that there are many contributing
factors to the rise of civilization - accidents of resources,
geography, and military power.  But whatever other ingredients
comprise the greatness of nations, he writes, &quot;There occurs
at breathtaking moments in history an exhilarating burst of energy
and motivation, of hope and zest and imagination, and a severing
of the bonds that normally hold in check the full release of human
possibilities.  A door is opened, and the caged eagle soars.&quot;
 That eagle, the symbol of our nation, represents the creative
spirit, talents, and aspirations of the American people.  The
charge of this commission and the intent of our recommendations
is to open the door and help set that eagle in all of us free.

<p>Ive admired over the years the fine work that the Foundation has done, in terms of its college campus work... its support of student activities, these national conferences during the summer, and the many other things that they do to bring conservatives to campuses, providing an opportunity to balance the debate.  On most of our campuses you dont always have the opportunity to have conservative speakers as readily as people representing other points of view.  What the Foundation does to balance that out, even it up, is certainly a very important thing.</p>

<h2>Regional Confrence Galvanizes Activists</h2>
<h4>Over 400 Eager Students Hear North, Evans, Robinson</h4>

<img alt="Students.gif" src="students.gif">
<hr><i>Egar Texas students turn out in force for Young America's Foundation regional confrence in Dallas.  Over 400 students came to hear from <b>Ollie North, Michael Williams, Stan Evans, Ron Robinson, Senator Steve Symms, Floyd Brown</b> and others during the two-day event.</i>
<hr>

Taking its campus road trip to the heart of Texas, <b>Young America's Foundation</b> headed to Dallas for a conference with over 400 college students in attendance on February 17 and 18.<p>

<b>Colonel Oliver North</b> kicked off the event Friday night with a rousing speech to students about the future of the conservative movement. He said that while conservatives had a great victory in Novernber, they need to stay true to their principles and keep their word to the American people. He called the Contract with America "something unique in American political experience." This is the first time government has established a "set of parameters" on which to govern and by which individuslc will be judged. Colonel North encouraged his primarily student audience to get involved in public policy
and make a difference.<p>

<img alt="Ollie North" src="north.gif"><br>
<hr>
<i><b>Ollie North</b> joins students during the cofrence, urging them to be active on their campuses and to make a difference.</i><hr>

Saturday began with a lecture by former <b>Senator Steve Symms</b>, president of Freedom Alliance, on the ability of young people to have a voice in policy making. He cited his career in politics which began at
age 34, when as a virtual unknown in the political world, he ran for and won a seat in the United States
House of Representatives.<p>

<b>Michael Williams</b>, assistant secretary for civil rights for the Department of Education during the Bush Administration, followed with a lively discussion on political correctness and racial issues on campuses. He encouraged students to seek support in the black student community. He said, "You will put out your hand and they will slap it; that will happen again and again. But if you persist, you will reach them."<p>

<img alt="Michael Williams" src="mwill.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Michael Williams</b> talks with a student following his remarks on political correctness and racial issues on campus.</i><hr>

Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> and Director of Program Development <b>Kate Obenshain Griffin</b> talked to students about the urgency and opportunities of campus activism, saying now that conservatives have taken over Congress, liberals are turning their attention to the campuses and the next generation with renewed vigor. In order to challenge their leftist professors, Mr. Robinson urged students to take the initiative in educating themselves about conservative ideals by reading conservative journals and books. He told student activists to surround themselves with supportive people who would work with them in promoting conservatism on campus. And he encouraged students to "be enthusiastic about your ideas and convictions. Only then will you capture the interest and imagination of your fellow students whom you are trying to reach."<p>

Mr. Robinson warned students to remember as they seek to reach other students that a perfect audience is never assembled and that they need to reach out to a broad audience. And finally, citing the examples of <b>William Buckley</b> and <b>Rush Limbaugh</b>, Mr. Robinson told students, "Start your own organization if your conservative voice is not being heard through existing ones." Instead of working for the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Mr. Buckley started up his own publication, <i>National Review</i>. Similarly, instead of working his way up with ABC and CBS news Limbaugh started his own radio show.<p>

Following an introduction by Foundation board member and Texas native <b>Wayne Thorburn</b>, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> delivered the luncheon address, discussing his book, <b>The Theme Is Freedom</b>. He chroIlicled and corrected the fallacies of the liberal history lesson students are taught regarding the development of our nation and the roots of the freedom we enjoy.<p>

<b>Floyd Brown</b>, president of Citizens United, spoke on the Clinton presidency, detailing the Whitewater controversy and providing insights on the Mexican bailout. He chided Mr. Clinton for misleading the American people and disgracing the office of the president.<p>

<b>Tom Pauken</b>, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, closed the conference discussine the continuation of the Reagan Revolution. He also talked about his book <b>The Thirty Years War</b>.<p>

<img alt="Michelle Sharp" src="sharp.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Michelle Sharp,</b> Young America's Foundation's program officer for lectures, speaks to students about bringing prominent conservative speakers to their campuses.</i><hr>

University of Dallas student and Young America's Foundation activist <b>Tom Lagarde</b> said, "We need more events like this one. Conservative students from across the region have the chance to get together with one another and find out how students are coping with different situations. And we get to hear from more great conservative speakers in one day than most would hear from in four years at school."<p>

Each year, Young America's Foundation hosts regional student conferences in several states around the country.<p><p>

<title>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</title>

<h2>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</h2>
<h4>Salvatori Speaker Urges Understanding of Our Founding</h4>

Before a packed house of 400 college students from across the country, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> urged students to remember the religious roots of our liberty as understood by America's Founding Fathers. The student event was sponsored by Young America's Foundation and the Fund for American Studies at  the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C on February 18. Mr. Evans is the Henry  Salvatori Distinguished Lecturer for 1994-1995, and will be sponsored by Young America's Foundation to  speak before twelve college audiences during the current academic year.<p>

Refuting what he calls "the liberal history lesson, " Mr. Evans said his latest book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, deals with the origins of freedom in the United States and the role faith and religion played in establishing that freedom.<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans1.gif"><hr>
<i>Mr. Evans signs his book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, for students following his speech.</i>
<hr>

Specifically, he dealt with three interrelated issues: first, where our freedom comes from; second, why we have freedom in America; and finally, how we sustain freedom.<p>

The issue of the role of faith in our founding has implications for modern political dilemmas such as prayer in school, abortion, and the so-called Religious Right.<p>

Liberals argue that faith and freedom are in conflict and that if we want freedom, we must keep religion out  of the public sphere. That line of reasoning, Mr. Evans said, is the premise for recent court decisions  banning prayer in school and forbidding any form of religious observance from public settings.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, such rulings, as well as the theory that faith and freedom are at odds, "are products of the way we are taught political and intellectual history-that is, through what I call the liberal 
history lesson."<p>

The liberal history lesson posits that freedom, philosophy, drama and other worthy practices existed in the ancient world, prior to Christianity. Mr. Evans said we are taught that in the early 5th century, the fall of classical antiquity "was followed by 1000 years of nothingness.... The Christian church ruled in an era of oppression and dictatorship."<p>

During the Renaissance, the liberals teach, classical antiquity was rediscovered, the institution of the 
church was rejected and there emerged what became the modern era's secular, rational basis for democracy,  freedom and the nation-state. Our Constitution, and the resulting rationalistic free system, is a product of the Enlightenment, according to the Left.<p>

"This is the framework," said Mr. Evans, "in which most of us, for decades, have learned our intellectual history." American history is being taught, for the most part, as a "subset" of the larger world history lesson.<p>

That lesson, according to Mr. Evans, is a "complete misstatement of the facts and of the record. It is an effort to impose secular liberal concepts on our system."<p>

There is no validity to the argument that faith and freedom are in conflict, and in reality, "They must go together, both conceptually and as a matter of history."<p>

Conceptually, Mr. Evans said, liberals argue that relativism, or the belief that there are no absolute standards, is necessary for a tolerant and just society-that a society can only be free when judgment is suspended. If that were the case, according to Mr. Evans, and there were no moral absolutes, no right or wrong, then a society could not pass judgment on Adolph Hitler. "How does one condemn any atrocity?" he asked. "All totalitarian regimes were relativist."<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans.gif"><hr>
<i>As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> speaks during a student luncheon, hosted by Young America's Foundation, at the Conservative Political Action Confrence.  Mr. Evans said the modern interpretation that prayer has no place in the public sphere is a travesty.  "it is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."</i><hr>

Faith and freedom must go together according to historical fact as well. In the Declaration of Independence, for instance, Thomas Jefferson wrote that it is  "self evident" that human beings are created equal. But Mr. Evans said, "If it was so evident to Jefferson, and to us, why wasn't it self evident to Aristotle, arguably the smartest man who ever lived? " Aristotle believed that some are born to be slaves and that all citizens belong to the state.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, the notion of limits on governmental power that stems from the Bible did not exist in Aristotle's time. Our Founding Fathers derived the notion that people should seek freedom rather than the bondage of a king from the Book of Samuel.<p>

Mr. Evans notes that both the Magna Carta and the Mayflower Compact are religious documents which were fundamental in the formation of our free form of government. Revisionists often say that the pilgrims who wrote the Mayflower Compact in 1620 found their inspiration for the document in John Lockerather than the Bible. Locke, however, was not born until 1632. The document is based purely on covenental theology, and subsequently, had a major impact on all of our governmental institutions with which we are familiar today.<p>

The First Amendment, Mr. Evans said, has suffered most grossly the inaccuracies of liberal revisionism. Modern history lessons, and in turn, the Supreme Court, now declare that the First Amendment was intended "to banish relizion from the public order."

According to Mr. Evans, that notion is "Orwellian and a complete inversion and falsification of our history."<p>

At the time the First Amendment was written, states established churches and even imposed religious requirements for holding pub- | lic office. We are told that Congress adopted the First Amendment in order to prohibit tax-supported prayer. Yet on September 25, 1789, one day after Congress passed the First Amendment, it passed a resolution calling on the president to declare a day of prayer and thanksgiving, which President Washington did.<p>

The modern interpretation of the Constitution, which states that prayer has no place in the public sphere, is a "travesty," according to Mr. Evans. "It is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."<p>

Mr. Evans said it is up to conservatives to recover the true history of our nation. While liberals have embraced revisionist history, conservatives must "get the basics right about the principles from which our freedoms developed."<p>

As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, Mr. Evans' campus appearances have included, among others, <b>Canisius College</b> in New York on February 23, <b>Regent College</b> in Virginia on March 23, <b>Fordham University</b> in New York on April 5, and <b>Princeton University</b> on April 18.<p><p>

<h2>On the Home Front</h2>

<img src="cartoon.gif"><hr>
<i>In February, Young America's Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> called on Rutgers University President <b>Francis Lawrence</b> to resign.  After enacting a speech code which threatened students with expulsion or suspension if they made a statement likely "to cause annoymance ... even if communicative in nature," Mr. Lawrence violated it.  Students were outraged when he stated that minorities don't "have the genetic, hereditary background to have a higher [SAT] average."  While Young America's Foundation is unalterably opposed to speech codes designed to restrict the free flow of ideas, Mr. Robinson said that college administrators who impose these regulations should abide by them.</i><hr>

<title>Campus Crisis</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<h2>Campus Crisis</h2>

<h4>Deceiving Donors</h4>

Having misled alumnus <b>Lee M. Bass</b> on its plans to develop a program on Western Civilization, Yale University has agreed to return Mr. Bass' $20 million gift to the school. While the program was scheduled to begin in the fall of 1993, it was not until the spring of 1995 that Yale informed Mr. Bass that they were prepared to go ahead with the program. In the intervening years, however, Yale had scrapped the original implementation plan for the Western Civ program and appointed a new advisory committee to develop a scheme more acceptable to leftist critics. This shift occurred unbeknownst to Mr. Bass, who had been assured by Yale President <b>Richard Levin</b> that he would be kept abreast of the program's development. A skeptical Mr. Bass, aware of Yale's move toward a more multicultural approach to teaching history, asked to approve the professors scheduled to teach the course. Yale refused and has agreed to return the gift. Student <b>Pat Collins</b> said, "I'm disappointed that the university wasn't able to conduct itself in a  trustworthy way to allay the concerns of the donor."<p>

<h4>PC Strikes Again</h4>

Ironically, one week before the Supreme Court was set to hear the case of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a University of Virginia publication denied funding due to its Christian perspective, UVa struck again. This time the Student Council defunded the conservative student magazine, the <i>Virginia Advocate</i>. According to Student Council, the <i>Advocate</i> represented a "political activity." Student Council appropriates funds to leftist political organizations such as the National Organization for Women, Gay and Straight for Equality, and the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay Student Union. UVa also funds decidedly liberal student newspapers such as the <i>University Journal</i> the <i>Declaration and Pride</i>. Student editors of the Virginia Advocate are appealing the decision to defund the paper and plan to take their case to court if necessary.<p>

<h4>Objections Raised To Communist Chair</h4>

<b>Angela Davis</b>, tenured professor of the history of consciousness at the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been named to the prestigious Presidential Chair by Jack W. Peltason, president of the university system. Her appointment has raised objections by California state senators who are concerned about Ms. Davis' "reputation for racism, violence and Communism."  As chair, Ms. Davis will have an additional $30,000 a year at her disposal, which she plans to use to develop an ethnic studies program.<p>

<h4>Strange Course Requirements</h4>

At Virginia's Tidewater Community College students taking a course in human sexuality have the option of reading five books other than their textbook or they may undertake one of the following: watch an X-rated movie, visit an adult bookstore, go to a gay bar, visit a family-planning center or an STD clinic, or speak to a member of the clergy concerning the church's philosophy regarding sexuality issues.  When a student objected to the activities the course was encouraging, the state's associate director of the State Council for Higher Education said the course sounded "perfectly legitimate" and said, "I can't imagine any student has the right to complain."<p><p>

<title>Conservative Black Speakers Hit the Campus</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<h2>Conservative Black Speakers Hit the Campus</h2>

<h4>Foundation Program Countering Black Racist Speakers on Campus</h4>

In response to the overwhelmingly leftist bent of Black History Month on campuses, Young America's 
Foundation initiated the Alternative Black Speakers Program. The program enables Young America's Foundation to send conservative black speakers to college campuses across the country, giving students an alternative to the often radical and irresponsible message of black lecturers appearing on campuses as part of official university programs.<p>

Young America's Foundation is offering the Alternative Black Speakers Program to students who are 
disappointed in the liberal, divisive message being promoted by their schools during Black History Month. Radicals such as <b>Joycelyn Elders</b>, former surgeon general under <b>President Clinton</b>, who recently stated that students should be taught about masturbation at an early age, and <b>Anita Hill</b> are frequent speakers on college campuses. Rap musician, <b>Ice T</b>, who sings about killing police, brought his message to Radford University in Virginia. During a lecture at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, <b>Khalid Muhammad</b> told students, "Now is the time to stand up and fight back.... There are no good crackers [white people], and if you find one, kill him before he changes. " At the University of Pennsylvania, <b>Louis Farrakhan</b> accused Jews of -"using God as a shield for [their] dirty religion.<p>

<img alt="William Allen" src="allen.gif"><hr>
<i><b>William Allen</b> talks candidly with students at Young America's Foundation's 1994 Summer Confrence.</i><hr>

<b>Stokely Carmichael</b> called for a complete revolution during a speech at the University of California at Irvine. He urged African Americans to overthrow the American capitalist society. Mr. Carmichael said, "No human advances are possible without the shedding of blood.... Student movements must have a strong wational base," he said. "They must be clear and precise. One must be willing to kill and die for it."<p>

The Foundation's experience with the Alternative Black Speakers Program has shown that there is great demand for conservative black speakers, and, while the project is entering its second year, that demand continues unabated. Young America's Foundation receives calls daily requesting information on this program.<p>

Young America's Foundation has sponsored twentyfour speeches by black conservative :-speakers. Speakers include <b>Walter Williams</b>, an economics professor at George Mason University, who speaks on free market issues; <b>Star Parker</b>, a former welfare recipient who broke free of dependency and became highly successful in business; and <b>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas</b>, who will speak at two schools in the fall.<p>

<img alt="Star Parker" src="parker.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Star Parker</b> talks with a student at Florida State University following her remarks during Black History Month.</i><hr>

Young America's Foundation's Alternative Black Speakers Program has provided thousands of students with an opportunity to hear conservative speakers during Black History Month and throughout the year. Star Parker's appearance at Swarthmore College in December was highly successful. and
students were able to obtain cosponsorship with the "Women of Color" organization on their campus. During the speech, Ms. Parker said, "Capitalism is opportunity, it gives people vision, structure,
absolutes and order.... The American dream does not involve socialism, it involves capitalism." She 
explored the pitfalls and disincentives of the welfare state, saying, "Where else can you go that you get 
$500 a month for getting pregnant? "<p>

Florida State University conservative student activists also hosted Ms. Parker during Black History
Month. Young America's Foundation activist and FSU student, <b>Stephen Slivinski</b> said, "Star Parker was bright and articulate -- a glittering personality. She spoke with the conviction and compassion that liberals claim conservatives don't have. The audience was diverse in ideology as well as race-something that would make the affirmative action proponents proud, save for the fact that the audience showed up to be enlightened and challenged, not by dint of some governmental program."<p>

Walter Williams spoke to 650  students at Texas A&~~M University during the College Republican "Rush Week." He addressed the role of government in a free society, saying, "Expanding government is not the answer; the free market should determine where the dollars go." His address was featured an the front page of the school newspaper.<p>

Over 350 students turned out at the University of Arkansas to hear Dr. Williams, who said that the nation is headed toward more totalitarianism and governmental control. Our problems as a nation, according to Dr. Williams, are caused by "a significant departure from the principles of individual freedom that made us a rich nation to begin with Dr. Williams said that this diagnosis could carry us part of the way toward solving our national problems. "One good thing about Americans is that they never do the wrong thing for a long time." He said he is expecting the American people to change their present economic course.
At what students called the best attended lecture in years, over 400 students at Penn State University heard Dr. Williams speak. He has also spoken at Iowa State University and the University of 
Wisconsin - Milwaukee.<p>

Through the Alternative Black Speakers Program, Young America's Foundation has identified dynamic black speakers who are eager to bring a conservative message to the campuses for years to come. While 
colleges and universities instinctively bring liberal speakers to their school, Young America's Foundation is 
working daily with students to offer an alternative, conservative message from black speakers.<p><p>

<h4>BAUER BLASTS VALENTI FOR &quot;MORAL POSTURING&quot; 
SAYS NEW SYSTEM WILL ENSURE THAT TV WILL &quot;PUMP MORE 
TRASH INTO AMERICA'S LIVING ROOM&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The parental TV ratings system unveiled
Thursday by Motion Picture Association of America's President Jack Valenti
is &quot;an insult to parents everywhere, and a clear sign that
Hollywood has no intention of curbing sex, violence and foul language
on television,&quot; Gary Bauer, President of Family Research
Council said.  &quot;At best, this moral posturing promises no
changes in programming and turns parents into garbage goalies.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti said that content-based ratings are impossible
because no one could distinguish hugs and kisses on <I>Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman</I> from Sharon Stone's sexual explicitness in
<I>Basic Instinct</I>.  And these are the people who will rate
the shows?  Somehow I have trouble working up a lot of faith in
this system.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti offers lots of flowery rhetoric about parents'
concerns, but he never once has suggested that Hollywood should
curb the production of sex, violence and swearing that are common
during prime-time, even in the 'family hour,'&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;The net effect of this system will be to pump more smut
into America's family rooms.

<p>

&quot;I personally find the TV-14 rating the most revealing category.
Mr. Valenti said, 'We're ratcheting up now.'  I think he should
have said, 'We are ratcheting down -- toward the gutter.'  TV-14
says that programs suitable for 14-year-olds contain 'sophisticated
themes, sexual content, strong language and more intense violence.'
In their manufactured polls, I bet they didn't ask parents whether
they thought 14-year-olds ought to get a TV diet of sexual content,
foul language and 'more intense violence,'&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Even the TV-PG category shows Hollywood's true intent.
'Infrequent coarse language, limited violence, some suggestive
sexual dialogue and situations' are supposed to be suitable for
more children.  What planet is Mr. Valenti living on?  I'll tell
you -- Planet Hollywood.&quot;

<p>

Bauer called on Hollywood to &quot;quit hiding behind this phony
ratings ploy and pledge to clean up your act.  Be the good citizens
that you want parents to believe you are -- stop the trash, don't
just rate it.&quot;

<center><h2>PENTAGON DRAGS ITS FEET TO KEEP PORN<br>
IN MILITARY STORES</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Military must show that it's serious
about sexual harassment and obey the new law banning porn sales,&quot;
Maginnis said</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Military Readiness
Project Director Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis criticized the Pentagon
Wednesday for not following the law signed by President Clinton
three months ago banning &quot;the sale or rental of sexually
explicit written or videotaped material on property under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.&quot;  Although the
law is scheduled to go into effect December 22, Maginnis said
&quot;the smut will likely remain on the shelves for now because
the Pentagon is more afraid of pornographers than Congress.&quot;

<p>

Claiming the ban will hurt porn sales, Bob Guccione, publisher
of <I>Penthouse</I> magazine, filed suit in New York asking for
an injunction to stop the Pentagon from removing his magazines
from military bookshelves.  Military lawyers' main objection to
the law is that it raises &quot;serious constitutional and administrative
problems,&quot; however Maginnis said the issue is not about constitutional
rights but about money.  Although customers pay less than the
market price for pornography in military stores, the Pentagon
earns over $4 million in annual sales.

<p>

&quot;The major constitutional obligation in this area is for
Congress to protect the military's combat fitness,&quot; Maginnis
said.  &quot;Congress has declared that selling pornography is
bad for readiness, and the military should obey.&quot;

<p>

Research shows that there is a direct association between exposure
to pornography and sexual misconduct.  The 1986 Attorney General's
Commission on Pornography cites studies which show that over half
of rapists say they were &quot;incited to commit an offense&quot;
by pornography and that 42 percent of child molesters &quot;implicated
pornography&quot; in their crimes.

<p>

&quot;The Pentagon must show that it is serious about sexual harassment
and military readiness,&quot; Maginnis said.  &quot;While Aberdeen
Proving Ground's sexual harassment hotline continues to ring off
the hook, pornography will remain on its shelves.  If the Pentagon
won't read the research, they must listen to female U.S. Army
officers based in Bosnia who complain about the 'rampant presence
of pornography, which is offensive to women, degrading to the
command atmosphere and encourages misconduct.'&quot;

<center><h2>TV RATING SYSTEM CALLED<br>
AN &quot;END-RUN AROUND PARENTS&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>Hollywood Looking for &quot;Excuse to Pollute,&quot; 
Bauer says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The TV industry's proposed age-based rating
system is &quot;an excuse to pollute the airwaves,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council on Wednesday,
one day before the industry prepares to release its ratings system.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement: &quot;Parents ought to be
able to tell whether a television program contains explicit sexual
scenes, vulgar language, violence and graphic murder portrayals,
or homosexual themes and references. What parent, in their right
mind, would accept a package at the front door labeled simply;
'Suitable for your 10-year-old,' and hand that package to their
child without checking further?  Parents need to know the contents
of the programming that Hollywood wants to give to our children.

<p>

&quot;What Hollywood thinks is acceptable is not the issue. The
entertainment industry should help parents make intelligent decisions
for their children with content-based ratings. Any claims that
more informative labels are not possible ring false when you consider
that many cable stations already provide information on program
content before a movie or show.

<p>

&quot;The age-based ratings constitute an end-run around parents,
who will be told that it is up to them to be monitors at all times
and in all places their child might be affected.  A similar system
was unveiled in 1965 for the movie industry, and it freed film
makers from any sense of responsibility.

<p>

&quot;You be the judge:  In 1965, <I>The Sound of Music</I> was
awarded the Oscar for Best Picture.  Four years later, the X-rated
<I>Midnight Cowboy</I>, about a bisexual hustler, won for Best
Picture.  Hollywood's attitude seems to be, as long as we rate
it, we can make anything we want and parents should shut up.

<p>

&quot;The new ratings system will perpetuate, not clean up, a
culture already soaked with sex, violence and foul language,&quot;
Bauer continued.  &quot;It's like setting a bunch of drunk drivers
loose on the streets while telling motorists that, in return,
they'll get upgraded bumpers and seat belts.  The industry needs
to clean up its act, period.  And content-based ratings could
help in that effort.&quot;

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW COMPUTER PORN RULING</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court announced Friday
that it will review the <i>Reno v. ACLU</i> decision to enjoin
the Communications Decency Act made earlier this year by a three-judge
panel in Philadelphia.

<p>

Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver
said that the Department of Justice's appeal of the Philadelphia
ruling is the right thing to do, and that now the Supreme Court
has the opportunity to &quot;reverse the radical ruling which
gave Bob Guccione the right to give his <I>Penthouse</I> magazine
to our children on the Internet.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Laws against selling porn magazines to
kids are not unconstitutional.  Why should we have to tolerate
the same degrading images of women being given to those same kids
on-line?&quot;

<p>

Family Research Council presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief with the Philadelphia judges in <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> defending
the cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  Cleaver
said the Philadelphia decision contradicts previous Supreme Court
decisions on the distribution of indecent material through the
media.

<p>

The Communications Decency Act:

<p><ul>

<li>Prohibits adults from using a computer to send indecent pornography 
directly to a known child

<p>

<li>Prohibits adults from knowingly displaying indecent pornography to 
children

<p>

<li>Defines &quot;indecent material&quot; as material, which in context, 
depicts or describes sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently 
offensive manner

<p>

<li>Imposes fines, prison sentences (up to 2 years), or both on violators

<p>

<li>Exempts those who merely provide access to a network or system over 
which they have no control

<p>

<li>Provides limited defenses for employers and those who make a reasonable 
and effective effort to restrict children's access to pornography

<p>

<li>Expands telephone harassment prohibitions to include harassment by 
computer

</ul><p>

Arguments will likely be heard in early spring.  Family Research
Council and other pro-family and anti-pornography groups will
be filing briefs in support of the Justice Department's defense
of the law.

<center><h2>Judge Chang Has &quot;Ravished the Rule of Law<br>
in Hawaii,&quot; FRC's Knight Says

<p>

Calls Marriage Ruling a &quot;slap in the face of Hawaiians<br>
-- and Americans everywhere,&quot; and Asks for Judge's<br>
Removal from Office</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;In striking down Hawaii's state
law that preserves marriage as the union of one man and one woman,
Judge Kevin Chang has ignored the wisdom of the ages, the will
of the Hawaiian people, and ample evidence of the state's compelling
interest in preserving this vital institution&quot; said Robert
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;His ruling legalizing the fiction of homosexual 'marriage'
essentially destroys the rule of law in Hawaii, and is a slap
in the face of  the Hawaiian people, who have made abundantly
clear their wish to resist judicial tampering with society's foundational
institution,&quot; Knight continued.  &quot;It is also a slap
in the face of the American people, who overwhelmingly support
marriage as a union reserved to one man and one woman.&quot;

<p>

Knight asserted that the Hawaiian Attorney General's office deliberately
underargued the case by &quot;ignoring a  mountain of evidence
that homosexuality is destructive to individuals, families and
society and that homosexuality is a changeable condition.

<p>

&quot;The state hung its case on a single factor -- the possible
effects on children -- which Judge Chang apparently has ignored,&quot;
Knight continued.  &quot;Concern for children, all by itself,
should have been enough reason for a sitting judge to uphold the
rule of law, of nature and of nature's God,&quot; Knight said.
&quot;No law that contradicts the fundamental moral law is legitimate.
This means that the court has now acted lawlessly, and the people
of Hawaii, who have spoken repeatedly and clearly about this issue,
would be well justified in seeking Judge Chang's removal from
the bench.

<p>

&quot;This decision underscores Congress' wisdom in enacting the
Defense of Marriage Act, which protects other states from the
Hawaiian courts' reckless activism.

<p>

&quot;It's time for Americans to examine and to exercise ways
to nullify the actions of judges who flout the law.  This is no
small legal matter but an assault on morality and the rule of
law itself.  Hawaiians can assist the entire nation by ending
the judicial arrogance that has precipitated this national threat
to marriage.&quot;

<center><h2>POLL FINDINGS ARGUE AGAINST NEW<br>
WELFARE ROLE FOR HILLARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</B> First Lady Hillary Clinton recently
touched off a firestorm (even within her own party) when she revealed
that she intends to take on a &quot;formal&quot; role on welfare
issues in the coming months.  Apparently, Mrs. Clinton envisions
leading an effort to reverse some of the key features of the welfare
reform legislation passed last year by the Congress and signed
by the President.

<p>

<b>But a new poll commissioned by the Family Research Council
finds that most Americans strongly support the new welfare bill
and do not want to see it reversed</b>. The survey, which was
conducted in November, 1996 by the Voter/Consumer Research polling
firm, found that only 12 percent of the 1,000 registered voters
surveyed felt that welfare reform &quot;has already gone too far.&quot;
Another 11 percent said that President Clinton and the Congress
&quot;have done enough&quot; to reform welfare, and a whopping
<b>72 percent said that the President and the Congress &quot;should
do more to reform welfare.&quot;</b>

<p>

In addition, another question in the FRC survey found Americans
quite unwilling to return to &quot;the era of big government.&quot;
When asked whether &quot;President Clinton and the Congress should
return to a greater role for the federal government in addressing
the country's domestic problems or should they continue cutting
back the size of the federal government,&quot; 62 percent called
for further cuts in government spending.  Only 26 percent supported
an increased federal role.

<p>

&quot;These poll findings make it clear that Hillary Clinton's
objectives on welfare are at odds with the will of most Americans,&quot;
FRC President Gary L. Bauer said today.  &quot;If the First Lady
wants to carry out the people's wishes on welfare reform, she
should be shouting, 'Charge!,' rather than 'Retreat.'&quot;

<center><h2>CENSUS STUDY PRESENTS MIXED PICTURE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Sr. Writer
for Cultural Renewal William Mattox on Tuesday called the results
of a new Census Bureau report on household and family characteristics
a &quot;mixed picture.&quot;  He said the new Census numbers show
that:

<p>

<li><b>Reports of the traditional family's death are greatly exaggerated.</b>
The report begins by asking, &quot;Are 'traditional' households
dead?;&quot; and then gives great attention to the fact that &quot;married,
with children&quot; families  now comprise only 25 percent of
all households.

<p>

But buried within the report is an acknowledgment that more than
half of all households are headed by a married-couple (some of
whom have yet to have children while others have already raised
children) and an acknowledgment that much of the growth of non-family
households is due to the rise in the number of elderly people
living alone after the death of their spouse.

<p>

Moreover, when one looks only at the universe of <I>families</I>
-- rather than all households -- more than three-fourths (77 percent)
of all families are headed by a married couple, and seven in ten
families with children are headed by a married couple.  Thus,
to a certain degree, the more things change, the more they remain
the same.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in single-parent households continues to be a cause
for concern.</b> While we should not overlook the prevalence
of married-couple families, neither should we ignore the significant
rise in single-parent households.  Clearly, the dramatic rise
in the number of single-parent households is the most disturbing
demographic change of the last 25 years.   While it is reassuring
to know that most families are still headed by a married couple,
the fact that single-parent households have nearly doubled in
number over the last quarter-century is a clear sign that all
is not well on the home front.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in unmarried households should not be a cause for
celebration.</b> Unlike the spin doctors in the Census Bureau's
public relations department, many Americans are troubled by the
rise in unmarried households.  Among those most likely to view
recent trends as a cause for concern are children being raised
without the benefit of two parents (a group we know to be growing
in size) and single women who would like to be married (a group
that appears to be growing in size -- if the fact that <I>The
Rules</I> stands atop the current best-seller list is any indication).

<center><h2>FRC TALKS TURKEY</h2>
<h3><i>OFFERS RESULTS OF RECENT POLL<br>
OUTLINING MENU FOR ACTION IN 105th CONGRESS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Just as the Pilgrims and the
Native Americans learned to live harmoniously together, the American
people definitely want Congressional Republican leaders and the
Democratic President to work together in the coming year,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer on Tuesday as Family Research Council released
its 1996 post-election poll.

<p>

But after being served bland mashed potatoes day after day for
most of the 1996 presidential campaign, Americans responding to
a recent Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family
Research Council want to make sure the menu for action in the
105th Congress includes:

<p>

<h4>1. THE MAIN COURSE:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>A Pro-Family Tax Cut Big Enough to Put a Turkey in Every
Pot.</b> Seventy-two percent of the 1,000 Americans responding
to the FRC survey say they favor a cut in federal income taxes.
In the 104th Congress, the House and Senate passed (but President
Clinton vetoed) a tax cut bill which included a $500 per-child
tax credit.  When the 105th Congress convenes in January, this
pro-family tax measure should be at the top of the economic agenda.

<p>

<h4>2. THE TRIMMINGS:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>More Carrots for the States to Continue Welfare Reform.</b>
One of the major achievements of the 104th Congress was the passage
of a welfare reform bill which, among other things, offers states financial
incentives for lowering their out-of-wedlock birth rate.  When
asked about the welfare reform issue, 72 percent say President
Clinton and the Congress &quot;should do more to reform welfare,&quot;
11 percent say their elected officials in Washington &quot;have
done enough to reform welfare,&quot; and only 12 percent say that
&quot;welfare reform has already gone too far.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Balanced-Budget Peas that Must Be Eaten.</b> Seventy-one
percent of Americans responding to the FRC poll say they &quot;strongly
favor&quot; balancing the budget.  Another 22 percent say they
&quot;somewhat favor&quot; this policy objective.

<p>

<li><b>Sweet Potatoes -- with No Artificial Sweeteners Added (Not
Even for Medicinal Purposes).</b> Seventy-one percent of the
public say they &quot;strongly favor&quot; increased federal efforts
to fight drug trafficking. Another 15 percent &quot;somewhat
favor&quot; this objective. Moreover, 71 percent say President
Clinton and his top officials have failed to pull their weight
in America's war on drugs. Only 24 percent say the Clinton adminstration
has &quot;been doing what could be expected.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Educational Choice of Whole Apples, Cut Apples, Cooked Apples,
Applesauce, Apple Pie, Etc.</b> Seventy-one percent of the public
say they support education vouchers that would give &quot;parents
the ability to choose the private or public school their children
attend.&quot;  Apparently, this support is not only broad, but
is also quite deep -- two-thirds of those who favor school choice
say they do so &quot;strongly.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Fat-Free Desserts (since the Era of Big Government Is Over).</b>
Sixty-two percent of the respondents say they believe
the President and the Congress should &quot;continue cutting back
the size of government.&quot;  Only 26 percent say they want their
elected officials to &quot;increase the federal government's role&quot;
in addressing American's domestic problems.

<p>

<h4>3. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS (Table Rules, Manners, etc.)</h4>

<p>

<li><b>Extra Seats at the Table for Babies Saved by Abortion Restrictions.</b>
Seventy-three percent of the respondents say they favor efforts
to require &quot;the consent of parents before a teenager is given
abortion counseling or referrals.&quot;  A similar majority (60
percent) express support for parental consent &quot;before teens
are given condoms, pills, or other forms of birth control.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>No Seconds (or Other Special Privileges) Until Everyone Is
Served.</b> More than four out of five Americans (83 percent)
say that gays and lesbians in the workplace should <i>not</i>
&quot;be given special protections, like those given to minorities
or the disabled.&quot;  Only 13 percent say they support measures
to extend job protections to gays and lesbians (like the legislation
Senator Ted Kennedy championed in the 104th Congress).  Moreover,
64 percent say they think the news and entertainment media devote
&quot;too much attention to homosexuality.&quot;  Only eight percent
say there is &quot;not enough&quot; coverage of these issues.

<p>

<li><b>A Prayer of Thanksgiving Acknowledging God's Providence.</b>
Nearly half of all Americans (44 percent) say the news and
entertainment media devote too little attention to the role of
religion in American life.  Thirty-seven percent say the amount
of media attention given religion is &quot;about right.&quot;
Only 14 percent say &quot;too much&quot; attention is devoted
to religion by the news media.

<p>

The Voter/Consumer Research survey for the Family Research Council
was conducted by telephone from November 6 through November 10,
1996, under the direction of FRC policy analyst Bill Mattox.
The sample of 1,000 registered voters was selected by using random-digit
dialing procedures.  The margin of error was roughly plus or minus
three percentage points.

<center><h2>BAUER ISSUES CHALLENGE TO GOP</h2></center>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council and a 
Republican strategist challenged the Republican Party today to 
find its voice on values and to redirect its economic policy toward 
working class and middle class families. Here are some exerpts from 
his speech at the Heritage Foundation</i>.

<p>

"The great danger facing America is not from barbarians at the gates, 
but the sickness of our own hearts. What is at stake is whether this 
great experiment in ordered liberty under God can survive. That was 
the great issue that should have been central to the presidential 
election. Instead, in some bizarre role reversal, the party most 
associated with the permissiveness of the last thirty years constantly 
talked about values, while the party, <b>my</b> party, that counts on 
the votes of millions of Americans worried about our virtue deficit, 
instead seems obsessed with our wallets ...

<p>

"The warning signs of the failure of the 1996 campaign were these 
from the beginning. Our unelected party leadership was obsessed for 
the last four years with the mantra of 'big tent'. A big tent for 
what? To what end? To change America how? To improve the prospects 
for our families and children in what way? We can mock Bill Clinton's 
bridge to the 21st century, but it at least signals ideas. Big tent 
signals that when it comes to ideas we don't care enough to make a 
case for what we believe ...

<p>

"The key fact of the American economy is this: It is getting harder, 
not easier, for working families to make ends meet. Yet the elite of 
my party often seem not to recognize the problem. It isn't just a 
problem of slow economic growth. The real problem is that the take-home 
pay of workers has fallen behind the growth of the economy. They get to 
keep less and less of what they earn. Here's a stunning fact. We have 
created 10 million-plus new jobs, but only eight million more workers 
are now employed. Every three workers are holding down four jobs. One 
income used to provide for a family. Then it took two. Now, increasingly, 
it takes three! ...

<p>

"The days are over when a few Washington think tanks can be allowed 
to make elite economic policy for a party that is increasingly the 
party of small businesses, entrepreneurship, and Main Street. There 
is much to be done, from pro-family tax reform to placing entitlements 
on a sound footing. But the goals of these efforts can be summarized 
in a single phrase: we must be, we <b>will</b> be, for working families. 
We must support families that 'work' in that they are able to support 
themselves with the fruits of their labor ...

<p>

For way too long now both political parties have been guided by 
political consultants, pollsters and focus group gurus who substitute 
media manipulation for a governing philosophy. We need to look no further 
for the growing cynicism of the American people. I have little influence 
on the Democratic Party, so this advice will be to my fellow Republicans. 
Save your donors a lot of money by jettisoning the whole political clique 
of Washington manipulators. You don't need them to tell you what to 
believe. This is the party of Lincoln. Appeal to the better angels of 
the American people and trust them to respond as they always have when 
they hear the truth."

<center><h2>'A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE':<br>
MILITARY'S POLICY ON WOMEN IN COMBAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> &quot;Sexual harassment and criminal
misconduct should be strongly condemned and the guilty must be
prosecuted.  But anyone who has worked with mixed gender settings
in a 24-hour per day, high stress and away-from-home environment
knows such settings are ripe for sexual improprieties even under
the best leaders,&quot; said Robert Maginnis, Director of Family
Research Council's Military Readiness Project, and retired military
on Thursday. &quot;But the result is a two-fold problem.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The first issue, and most important, is a moral one. The
incidence of outright coercion by officers against the women in
their command shows that character does matter. The breakdown
of values and lack of moral character are creating a debt that
men and women are paying and will pay well into the future. The
vulnerable become victims of the ruthless.

<p>

&quot;The Armed forces must make sure that those responsible for
misconduct receive swift and sure punishment. American parents
must be assured that their daughters who serve their country will
not be raped or forced into harmful, sexual situations.

<p>

&quot;The second issue is a different kind of problem -- that
of consensual sex within the military ranks. Because of the pressure
to ignore the differences between men and women in the name of
political correctness, we are creating a recipe for national disaster.
Our attempts to incorporate women are nothing like the successful
polices that integrated the races because the two issues are completely
different. With gender policies, problems will continue as long
as men and women are sexually attracted.

<p>

&quot;These radical changes came without Congress answering the
question, 'Does removing most exemptions for women promote military
readiness?' The answer for many commanders is no! We have created
sexually tense situations.

<p>

&quot;Consider this sad situation: Calls to Aberdeen's sexual
harassment center have exceeded 3,100 and involve all services
reaching back to World War II. So far, 341 cases are under
criminal investigation.

<p>

&quot;As planes begin to lift-off for Zaire for yet another deployment
of soldiers to primitive and wrenching places, <B>it's time to
rethink why we have saddled the military with a mission impossible</B>.
Sex happens when men and women stay long enough in forced intimate
situations. It happened in Haiti and Somalia, aboard dual gender
ships and in Bosnia. It will happen in Zaire, too. Sexual relationships
in units hurts effectiveness.

<p>

&quot;The goal of the military is to protect and defend the Unites
States of America. But social experiments are weakening the men
and women on whom we all depend. Those guilty of sexual impropriety
must be punished, and the status of  women in the Armed Services
must be reviewed to protect those who serve.&quot;

<center><h2>'96 ELECTION A WIN FOR CONSERVATIVES --<br>
REAL AND PRETEND, SAYS BAUER</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Bill Clinton's
victory began when he recast himself as a pro-family conservative
and modeled Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign,&quot; Family
Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said Wednesday about
the election. &quot;As the President moved to the right, many
people were led to believe that his pro-family speeches meant
he had abandoned his liberal agenda. What we're more likely to
see is the same Bill Clinton of the last four years who will appoint
liberal judges, advance gay rights and insist on abortions even
in the ninth month of pregnancy.&quot;

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;Once again, we see the winning formula.
Those candidates that support lower taxes, smaller government,
family values and respect for life get elected. Those who focus
on economics alone lose. Our hope is that the Republican leadership
finally understands this.

<p>

&quot;Throughout the campaign the true heart of the Republican
resurgence was evident in the conservative tone of the issues
supported and the race for the right. 'Liberal' was a dirty word
... even Bill Clinton took time on the stump to help redefine
Paul Wellstone as a conservative.

<p>

&quot;The big mistake the media and pundits make now is to ignore
the mandate the newly elected congress has to pursue principled
economic and family policy. Despite millions of dollars spent
by the labor unions and the Democratic Party, the vast majority
of the freshman House members survived -- strengthened by their
values.

<p>

&quot;This Congress has a mandate to act on behalf of the family
-- to support genuine family tax relief, to reenact the Partial
Birth Abortion Ban Act -- a critical issue that helped to bring
Ann Northup to the House -- and to act aggressively on the drug
problem that threatens our children. And since <I>everyone</I>
now claims to be a pro-family conservative, perhaps some of these
things can be achieved.&quot;

<center><h2>&quot;PORNOGRAPHY AWARENESS WEEK&quot;...<br>
BATTLING PORNOGRAPHY IN THE<br>
INFORMATION AGE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;From protecting minors from on-line
pornography to eliminating the government's role as pornography
salesman, the 104th Congress took significant steps in waging
the ongoing war against pornography in the changing environment
of the Information Age,&quot; Family Research Council Director
of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Thursday.  &quot;Celebrate
these victories during this year's <B>'Pornography Awareness Week'
(Oct. 27 - Nov. 1)</B>, but keep in mind that the cable and cyberporn
battle is far from over.&quot;

<p>

<h4>PROGRESS MADE....</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family support made passage of the Communications Decency
Act (CDA) possible. With a strong provision to combat cyberporn,
the CDA prohibits adults from knowingly sending or displaying
indecent material to minors on the Internet.

<p>

<li>Additional protection for children came in the Child Pornography
Prevention Act of 1996.  It extends existing child pornography
restrictions to include any visual depiction that <I>appears to
be</I> a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct.  In other
words, it prohibits &quot;simulated&quot; pictures created by
computer programs, &quot;morphing&quot; images together, artistic
renderings which look like real children, and pictures of young
adults who are made to look like and are advertised as children.

<p>

<li>Congress also passed an amendment to the 1997 Defense Authorization
Act that prohibits the sale or rental of pornography by the government
anywhere on U.S. military property.

</ul><p>

<h4>THE ROAD AHEAD FOR CYBERPORN...</h4>

<p>

The Department of Justice
this month appealed to the Supreme Court a Philadelphia federal
court's ruling against the CDA. (<I>ACLU v. Reno</I>)  The court's
decision allows adults to knowingly send and display pornography
to minors on the Internet and maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. FRC filed a brief
defending the cyberporn provisions in the CDA and will continue
at the Supreme Court level to support ways to protect children
from on-line pornographers.

<p>

Cleaver said, <b>&quot;Cyberspace is our children's new playground,
and it is a world where pornography knows no bounds.  Failure
to defend strong laws would be like leaving a loaded gun in that
playground.  Families report that this is a serious problem, and
the burden of protecting children from exploitation should not
rest solely on them.&quot;</b>

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT &quot;KNOWS A SOLID RULING<br>
WHEN IT SEES ONE,&quot; FRC SAYS

<p>

FRC COMMENDS COURT'S DECISION TO<br>
UPHOLD LAW EXCLUDING HOMOSEXUALS<br>
FROM MILITARY SERVICE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended the
Supreme Court's decision Monday to turn down a challenge to the
law excluding homosexuals from military service in <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  &quot;The Court knows a solid ruling when it sees
one,&quot; FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Monday. &quot;Military
people support the ban and so do the American people.&quot;

<p>

FRC was given the rare opportunity to present oral arguments in
this case before the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  Wells-Petry,
a former Army lawyer who has defended the military's ban on homosexuals
for years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect
that the dismissal from the Navy of Lt. Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.

<p>

&quot;The Fourth Circuit not only upheld the law excluding homosexuals
from military service,&quot; Wells-Petry continued, &quot;it also
made hash of the Administration's regulations implemented to enact
the law.&quot;

<p>

Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department were on the
same side of this case, however their arguments differed greatly.
The Justice Department opposed FRC's arguments, which were based
on the intent of the law passed by Congress rather than on the
often contradictory directives prepared by the Administration
to implement the law.  The Justice Department also submitted a
brief opposing FRC's participation.  The Justice Department rested
their case, as their brief stated, on the &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.

<p>

&quot;Friends of the armed forces are pleased the Court let this
excellent ruling stand,&quot; Wells-Petry said.

<center><h2>&quot;ONCE GAY, ALWAYS GAY&quot; NOT TRUE,<br>
LOVE OFFERS REAL HOPE, KNIGHT SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For too long, many people have
come to believe that people with homosexual desires cannot change. <b>The
'once gay, always gay' fiction has persuaded more than a few Americans
to support so-called 'gay rights' out of a misdirected sense of
compassion.</b> But it is anything but compassionate to tell
someone they have no hope of change and that they might as well
indulge in sexual behavior that is unhealthy, immoral and in many
cases, even fatal,&quot; Bob Knight said Thursday during a ground
breaking news conference.

<p>

Knight, Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies,
participated in a 9:30 a.m. news event to unveil PFOX -- Parents
and Friends of Ex-Gays (Contact: Anthony Falzarano) -- a new,
national parents group that will counter the pro-homosexual PFLAG. The
news event, which included former homosexuals and lesbians, also
highlighted the Second Annual National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality
Day. (Contact: Michael Johnston)

<p>

Knight made the following comments during the news event at the
<b>National Press Club</b>:

<p>

&quot;Over on the mall this week, the AIDS quilt is a silent and
wrenching testimony to the hundreds of thousands of people struck
down with premature death.  The quilt also symbolizes tragic choices
made by many people who were misled into believing they had no
other option.  How many of these sons, daughters, fathers, brothers
or sisters would be alive today if they had had access to compassionate
people like these around me who have been caught up in sexual
or drug addiction but have broken the deadly pattern?

<p>

&quot;Today's message is very simple:  No one has to be 'gay.'
No one should reject a family member because that family member
is 'gay.' But love does not require accepting behavior that is
harmful. In fact, real love in action is a conscious effort to
steer someone away from behavior that can hurt or even kill. 
It isn't always easy, but it can be done, as evidenced by the
many who have.

<p>

&quot;Parents, Family and Friends of Ex-Gays (PFOX), which is
being introduced today, has been formed to aid people who have
family members struggling with homosexuality.  PFOX is dedicated
to correcting the many distortions and increasingly abusive assertions
made by homosexual activist groups against those with whom they
disagree. The homosexual activist movement despises and attacks
the ex-gay movement out of fear that these people are exactly
who they say they are: people once in bondage to homosexuality
but now freed to pursue a fuller life. But their lives are evidence
of options rarely discussed but very real.&quot;

<p>

<i><b>NOTE: From 10-11 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 11, former homosexuals
and lesbians will join together for a time of testimonials, sharing
and outreach on the West Front of the Capitol. Their efforts are
timed to coincide with the AIDS Quilt.  All are welcome.</b></i>

<center><h2>ASSISTED SUICIDE CASES DRAW<br>
ATTENTION OF PRO-FAMILY GROUPS</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>Stop the &quot;cheapening of human life,&quot; Cleaver 
says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court Tuesday announced
its decision to review two recent U.S. federal court cases on
assisted suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> 
struck down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from
prescribing lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the
Constitution's liberty interest, using reasoning identical to
the Supreme Court abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from
the Second Circuit concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide
violated the Equal Protection Clause on the ground that there
is no difference between &quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot;
and intentionally causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing
<I>amicus</I> briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court, urging
the Court to reverse the decisions from Washington and New York.

<p>

Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said, <b>&quot;It is a
tragic irony that our country is moving to a place where we prohibit
only the killing of the healthy and strong, while we sanction
the killing of the frailest members of our own families: our
unborn children and elderly parents and grandparents.&quot;</b>

<p>

Cleaver cited a recent report produced at the request of Congressman
Charles Canady on euthanasia in the Netherlands:  &quot;The <B>Netherlands
Report</B> presents some alarming facts,&quot; Cleaver said. 
&quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by Netherlands doctors
in its euthanasia program.  While this is certainly tragic, what
is more shocking is that, in the same year, more than 1,000 people
were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>; 140 of these cases
involved a fully competent person who was never given a choice.&quot;
<B>Euthanasia perverts and demeans the health profession by not
giving doctors the tools of life but rather putting in their hands
the instruments of death.</B>

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who
need us most to help them rise above depression and illness. 
A truly compassionate society will offer assistance and hope to
its citizens in need; relegating them to the morgue is the height
of utilitarian arrogance and greed.&quot;

<center><h2>DON'T FUND DR. DEATH, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended Friday
the efforts of Rep. Charles Canady in the production of the Congressional
Report on Assisted Suicide in the Netherlands.  FRC Director of
Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Friday she believes the report
is an important contribution to the debate concerning physician
assisted suicide and euthanasia in America.

<p>

<b>Cleaver said, &quot;It is a tragic irony that our country is
moving to a place where we prohibit only the killing of the healthy
and strong, while we sanction the killing of the frailest members
of our own families:  our unborn children and elderly parents
and grandparents. Euthanasia perverts and demeans the
health profession by not giving doctors the tools of life but
rather putting in their hands the instruments of death.&quot;</b>

<p>

FRC also praised the efforts of Senators John Ashcroft and Byron
Dorgan to prohibit federal funding for assisted suicide.  Already
in Oregon, the director of Medicaid has announced his intention
to use federal funds for assisted suicide.

<p>

&quot;The <b>Netherlands Report</b> presents some alarming facts,&quot;
Cleaver said.  &quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by
Netherlands doctors in its euthanasia program.  While this is
certainly tragic, what is more shocking is that, in the same year,
more than 1,000 people were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>;
140 of these cases involved a fully competent person who was never
given a choice.&quot;

<p>

This October, the Supreme Court is likely to announce its decisions
regarding review of two recent U.S. federal court cases on assisted
suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> struck
down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from prescribing
lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the Constitution's
liberty interest, using reasoning identical to the Supreme Court
abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from the Second Circuit
concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide violated the Equal
Protection Clause on the ground that there is no difference between
&quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot; and intentionally
causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing <I>amicus</I> 
briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court.

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who
need us most to help them rise above depression and illness. 
A truly compassionate society will offer assistance and hope to
its citizens in need; relegating them to the morgue is the height
of utilitarian arrogance and greed.&quot;

<center><h2>DEATH SENTENCE FOR UNBORN IS STAIN ON<br>
THE LAND OF THE FREE, HOME OF THE BRAVE</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>THIS ISSUE WILL NOT GO AWAY, BAUER SAYS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;This tragic vote, condemning
the lives of thousands of our children, will not be the end of
debate over Partial Birth Abortion. The President and those who
stood with him should be ashamed for blinding themselves to tragic
deaths in an attempt to win political points,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer said Thursday after the Senate
voted 57 to 41 -- 8 votes short of those needed to overturn Bill
Clinton's veto.

<p>

&quot;The only pain Bill Clinton seems to feel is his own. This
vote is about the kind of 'choice' people make when they see others
dying on a roadside. Some stop to help. Others keep walking. It
is inhumane to know how children are being killed as they pass
through the birth canal -- and do nothing.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996. It
is a measure of the kind of people we are.

<p>

&quot;This vote will not rest easy on the conscience of the American
people. This is a nation built on the idea that all people are
created equal. This will stick in their throats. We are a better
country than one that takes the lives of defenseless children
in this way.&quot;

<p>

Earlier today Gary Bauer stood with many distinguished senators
and a dozen of pro-family, pro-life, and religious leaders, including
Dr. James Dobson, in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to denounce partial-birth abortion and to call on the Senate
to override President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.

<center><h2>ENOUGH BLAME, TIME FOR ACTION IN<br>
WAR ON DRUGS,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> &quot;It's time to wake up and admit that
we have a major crisis on our hands,&quot; FRC Senior Policy Analyst
Bob Maginnis said Thursday. &quot;For the second time in a month,
new statistics have been released showing a dramatic increase
in the number of teens who use drugs.&quot;

<p>

According to a study released Wednesday by the National Parents'
Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE), the number of teens
in grades six through twelve using illicit drugs on a daily basis
increased 147 percent in the past decade.

<p>

These latest findings, along with the results of the Columbia
University study released in August, are a cause of great concern
to parents, teachers and politicians alike.  A joint Congressional
hearing Thursday will look into the causes of the recent jump
in teenage drug use.

<p>

&quot;The current Administration has virtually ignored the fact
that anti-drug abuse campaigns like former First Lady Nancy Reagan's
'Just Say No' program work,&quot; Maginnis said, &quot;There is
a definite correlation between the absence of such high-profile
nationalized efforts and the recent rise in drug use among teens.&quot;

<p>

&quot;It's time to stop complaining and get to work,&quot; Maginnis
explained. &quot;We've dropped the ball on the drug issue.  All
the evidence says the same thing, 'Talk to your kids about drugs.
Make them aware of the real dangers surrounding drug abuse, and
they will be less likely to experience firsthand the pain of addiction.'
We also need to reconsider a balanced interdiction and demand
reduction policy.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis returned last week from Zurich, Switzerland where he
addressed the Association for the Advancement of Psychological
Understanding of Human Nature and several other international
organizations on the topic of teen drug abuse in the U.S.

<center><h2>SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996 WAKING UP<br>
PRO-FAMILY MAJORITY, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Americans of many faiths stand
here today in unity because of the horrifying reality of Partial
Birth Abortion,&quot; <b>Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer</b> said Thursday morning, before the anticipated Senate
veto override vote. &quot;In recent days, liberals and conservatives,
Democrats and Republicans and those who worship in many ways have
joined their voices to speak for those children killed as they
pass through the birth canal.&quot;

<p>

Bauer made the following statement from the U.S. Capitol with
leaders from the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish communities.
The news conference followed an ecumenical prayer breakfast for
our nation's children and the partial birth abortion vote.

<p>

<b>&quot;However this vote goes, this will not rest easy on the
conscience of the American people. This is a nation built on the
idea that all  people are created equal. This will stick in their
throats. We are a better country than one that takes the lives
of defenseless children in this way. The President should be ashamed.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996</b>.
It has proved a powerful rallying cry for many Americans. And
as it is described, more and more people recoil in horror from
what really happens to thousands of our children.

<p>

&quot;It is an issue that is waking up a pro-family majority.
And it is an issue that illustrates just how radical Bill Clinton's
abortion position is. <b>Apparently, he does not feel the pain
of healthy children</b> killed moments from birth. <b>Apparently
he does not feel the pain of children who may have handicaps to
overcome</b>, but have a world of love to offer.

<p>

&quot;We Americans have to choose what kind of people we will
be. This 'choice' screams of injustice.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>REAGAN-PROCLAIMED &quot;RELIGIOUS<br>
FREEDOM WEEK&quot; SIGNIFIES BATTLE FAR<br>
FROM OVER FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council announced this
week its support for &quot;Religious Freedom Week,&quot; beginning
Sept. 23.  Proclaimed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan, Religious
Freedom Week began because &quot;(t)he American people have long
recognized that the liberty we cherish must include the freedom
to worship God as each of us pleases.&quot;

<p>

In celebrating Religious Freedom Week, FRC, whose motto is &quot;Defending
Family, Faith, and Freedom,&quot; joins hundreds of pro-family
organizations and religious institutions to acknowledge the importance
of faith and religious freedom in our country.

<p>

In believing that our Founding Fathers did not intend to establish
the principle of &quot;freedom <I>from</I> religion&quot; but
rather &quot;freedom <I>of</I> religion, &quot; FRC policy and
legal analysts have worked for years on ways to promote and protect
the freedoms people of faith enjoy in this country.

<p>

FRC President Gary Bauer has taken the issue of religious freedom
to Capitol Hill on numerous occasions testifying before Congress
on a proposed Religious Liberty Amendment and on the world-wide
persecution of Christians.

<p>

The rising occurrence of church burnings and of religious persecution
both in schools and in the workplace reveals the need for continued
efforts to restore the original intent of our Founding Fathers
in the Constitution.  As President Reagan noted, the First Amendment
&quot;is the protection of religion and conscience from government
interference.  It creates neither hostility between government
and religion nor a civil religion of secularism.&quot;

<p>

Plans have already begun to build greater awareness for Religious
Freedom Week in 1997. FRC policy analysts and government affairs
office have also begun developing policy initiatives and legislative
strategies to protect religious liberty in the 105th Congress.

<center><h2>PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION:<br>
'THE SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996'</h2>

<p>

<h3>Bauer commends House;<br>
calls on Senate to overturn Clinton veto</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Partial birth abortion is the
sleeper issue of 1996,&quot; Family Research Council President
Gary L. Bauer said Thursday. As the House voted 285 to 137 to
overturn President Bill Clinton's veto of legislation to ban a
horrific procedure used in the late stages of pregnancy, Bauer
made the following comments.

<p>

&quot;The fact that the late-term abortion technique called Partial
Birth Abortion even exists shows just how terrible is the slippery
slope message that children should be 'planned and wanted' before
having value. Americans on both sides of the life debate have
joined together to say that this cruel procedure goes too far.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton administration has presented us with tremendous
irony this week in their defense of Partial Birth Abortions and
their aggressive support of abortion-causing drugs, called RU-486,
and then their surprise at the increase in child abuse. When the
political elite use the bully pulpit to argue that life has no
value unless it's healthy, planned and desired, society's weakest
members become vulnerable.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council commends the House for their courage
in highlighting a procedure so terrible, it could not be used
on animals ... and should not be used for our unborn. And we call
on the Senate to join their collegues from both sides of the aisle
to overturn Clinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>

<p>

<h2>HOUSE TO VOTE ON PARTIAL-BIRTH<br>
ABORTION OVERRIDE THURSDAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On the day of the vote to override
President Clinton's veto on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
(H.R.1833) in the U.S. House of Representatives, Family Research
Council Director of Communications Kristi Hamrick said, &quot;By
telling people that only 'planned and wanted' children have value,
we have opened a deadly Pandora's box for our most helpless members
of society.

<p>

&quot;This week in the news, we see the Clinton administration
pushing chemical abortions, talking about partial-birth abortions
and then commenting on an increase in child abuse. But it is no
surprise to pro-family Americans that children are being injured
as we communicate the message that children are not a blessing,
but an option or a problem.  We must talk about all children --
born and unborn -- as valuable and worthy of our sacrifices for
them. Pro-family America calls on all members of Congress to override
the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act veto. We must act today to
support all our children.&quot;

<p>

The House will begin one hour of debate at 10:30 a.m. Thursday
morning followed by a vote.

<p>

<center><h4>What Experts are Saying About Partial-Birth 
Abortions</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisors
on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to late-term
abortions.  Because in no way can I twist my mind to see that
the late-term abortions as described -- you know, partial-birth,
and then destruction of the unborn child before the head is born
-- is a medical necessity for the mother.  It certainly can't
be a necessity for the baby.  So I am opposed to ... partial birth
abortions.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>World-renowned pediatric surgeon and former Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop, in an August 19, 1996 interview with <U>American
Medical News</U>, &quot;The view from Mount Koop,&quot; p.3.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Pro-choice activists categorically insist that only 500
of the 1.5 million abortions performed each year in this country
involve the partial-birth method, in which a live fetus is pulled
part way into the birth canal before it is aborted ... But interviews
with physicians who use the method reveal that in New Jersey alone,
at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year
-- three times the supposed national rate.  Moreover, doctors
say only a 'minuscule amount' are for medical reasons.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>&quot;The facts on partial-birth abortion,&quot; by Ruth
Padawer, <U>The Sunday Record</U> (Bergen County, NJ), September
15, 1996.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Congress, the public -- but most importantly women -- need
to know that partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated
to protect a mother's health or her future fertility.  On the
contrary, this procedure -- which has never been evaluated in
mainstream, peer reviewed literature -- can pose a significant
threat to both her immediate health and future fertility...  We,
and many other doctors across the United States, regularly treat
women whose unborn children suffer these and other serious conditions.
Never is the partial-birth procedure medically indicated.  Rather,
such infants are regularly and safely delivered live, vaginally,
with no threat to the mother's health or fertility.  Sometimes,
as with hydrocephalus, it is first necessary to drain some of
the fluid from the baby's head.  And in some cases, a cesarean
section is indicated.  In no case is it medically necessary to
partly deliver the child vaginally, and then terminate his or
her life before completing the delivery.&quot;

of more than 230 physicians, mostly professors and other specialists
in obstetrics, gynecology, and fetal medicine.</i>

<center><h2>RU-486: IT'S NO MIRACLE CURE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHERE ARE THE GUARDIANS OF WOMEN'S HEALTH?&quot; HSU 
ASKS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The Food and Drug Administration
has a responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
any drug that would be marketed for U.S. consumption. <b>But
with this rushed acceptance of RU-486, the FDA has clearly shown
that those safeguards can be ignored for political purposes</b>,&quot;
Family Research Council analyst Gracie Hsu said Wednesday as the
news broke of the conditional approval of the abortion-causing
drug regimen.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton Administration threw its political weight behind
pushing this abortion-causing drug past the safeguards that protect
American women. But this interference was not to save women's
lives. It wasn't for a breast cancer treatment or even for experimental
drugs for life-threatening diseases like AIDS.  It was simply
to approve a drug whose sole purpose is to end the life of a child,&quot;
Hsu said.

<p>

<center><h3><u>QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED:</u></h3>

<p>

<h4>HOW WILL RU-486 AFFECT WOMEN'S HEALTH?</h4></center>

<p>

During the U.S. clinical trials earlier this year, four women
required blood transfusions because they lost so much blood, 15
women required surgery, 21 required hospitalization, 13 percent
required treatment for bleeding, and five percent of all the women
in the study required narcotics for the pain.  All of these side
effects happened in spite of the fact that the women who participated
in the clinical trials were highly motivated, closely monitored,
and underwent follow-up.  We can expect that women will suffer
results far worse than these when RU-486 becomes available to
all U.S. women without the ideal conditions associated with clinical
trials.

<p>

Furthermore, the FDA has still failed to answer pressing questions
regarding how RU-486 will affect women's health.  For example,
if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- whether due
to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply with protocol -- the
medical complications could be severe, i.e., infection,
sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There is also
a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects of RU-486
on women, including the future fertility of women, the possible
link with breast cancer, and the medical complications resulting
from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

Beyond these issues of physical health, RU-486 will also negatively
impact women's emotional and psychological health.  The numbers
of women suffering from post-abortion trauma are already reaching
a critical mass, and we can expect these numbers to dramatically
increase with the introduction of RU-486.  This is because RU-486
requires women not only to take the abortion drug with their own
hand, but also to bear the psychological trauma of viewing their
unborn children after the &quot;products of conception&quot; are
passed.

<p>

<center><h4>WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE IF WOMEN BLEED TO DEATH?</h4></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration partnered with an abortion advocacy
organization, the Population Council, to bring RU-486 to the United
States. The drug manufacturers did not advocate or advance this.
Therefore, who will be legally responsible for what happens to
women?  Will women who are harmed by the drug have recourse to
sue?  Will the American taxpayers foot the bill for any problems
since this administration pushed the drugs even without the corroboration
of a drug manufacturer?

<p>

<center><h4>*Most asked media question*<br>
WHERE WILL THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT GO IF THERE ARE NO
PRAYERFUL PROTEST SPOTS?</h4></center>

<p>

The pro-life community is hardly confined to abortion clinics.
Rather, the pro-life movement is composed of concerned citizens
all across the United States who believe that human life is valuable
at all stages of life, from the moment of conception to the time
of natural death.  While some in the pro-life community choose
to peacefully protest abortion by praying in front of abortion
clinics, the pro-life community is widely represented by its compassion
for women in crisis pregnancies.  Crisis pregnancy centers provide
pregnant women with hope in the form of financial, material, and
emotional support.  These pregnancy care centers also provide
loving counsel for those women who suffer from post-abortion trauma.
Furthermore, adoption agencies provide women with a way to give
their children the gift of a family.  These ministries to women
will not change, but the pro-life community is saddened that the
approval of RU-486 will only cause more women to seek their services
as more women face the tragedy of post-abortion trauma.

<center><h2>FRC EQUIPS <i>MOMS AND DADS</i> WITH<br>
<i>SCHOOL SURVIVAL GUIDE</i>, A TOOL FOR<br>
KEEPING PARENTS AWARE AND<br>
INVOLVED</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHAT A DIFFERENCE A PARENT MAKES,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council released Tuesday
the 1996 <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I>, a 64-page
resource to help parents stay informed and involved in their children's
educational process.

<p>

&quot;Parents today are spending too much time combating condoms,
offensive curriculum, and failed federal programs,&quot; FRC President
Gary Bauer said upon the release of the <I>Survival Guide</I>.
&quot;While test scores plummet, horror stories about flagrant
breaches of parental rights are coming to us from around the country.&quot;
Here are some of the stories:

<p><ul>

<li>On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls in East Stroudsburg,
Pennsylvania, were required to submit to a genital examination
as part of a &quot;routine&quot; physical.  Without parental consent,
the school conducted the exams blocking the exit door and refusing
to allow the crying and pleading young girls to call their parents.

<p>

<li>Psychological testing under the guise of standardized testing
includes intrusive questions about the child's emotional state
and his relationship with his parents.  For example, a 149-question
survey used in Minnesota public schools without parental approval
contains questions such as:  Have you ever tried to kill yourself?
How often have you run away from home?  Have you felt so discouraged
or hopeless that you wondered if anything was worthwhile?

<p>

<li>In Stephens County, Georgia, parents were shocked to discover
that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had been driven to a
birth control clinic by a public school staffer without their
knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control pills and
condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and AIDS tests.
The parents were then denied access to the test results by the
school, which defended its actions on the grounds that the counselor
believed she was doing what was best for the girls.

</ul><p>

Author and FRC Education Policy Analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said
the <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I> was designed to
help parents not only know their rights in these situations but
also how to prevent them from happening in the future.

<p>

&quot;Families need not simply survive school,&quot; Marshall
said. &quot;They should be free to thrive and excel in any environment
- public, private, or home-based education.  Parents playing an
active role makes all the difference in children's educational
attainment.  They are the key to everyday school survival, and
we need to equip them to do the job they do best.&quot;

<p>

The <I>Survival Guide</I> is a detailed look at educational issues
facing all parents, whether they help with homework or homeschool.
The guide defines education jargon, like &quot;outcome-based
education,&quot; &quot;one-stop shopping center,&quot; and &quot;vouchers&quot;;
it explains students' religious liberties in the public school;
and it details what parental rights are and how parents can defend
them.  The <I>Guide</I> also introduces parents to the variety
of educational options available to them, including classical
and parent-based education.  Extensive reference lists place key
resources, from newsletters to on-line information, at parents
fingertips.

<p>

&quot;Parents are looking for alternatives and answers every day,&quot;
Marshall said. &quot;By getting information into the hands of
each parent, this guide is a simple, yet powerful way to restore
parents to their proper place at the helm of their child's educational
journey.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS BILL TO ELIMINATE<br>
GOALS 2000</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;This long overdue legislation will send federal
tax dollars back where they are needed the most -- in the hands
of the parents and teachers who can best decide how to use them,&quot;
Marshall says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Family Research Council supported the
&quot;Goals 2000 Elimination Act&quot; introduced by Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-SC) at a news conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

<p>

&quot;This legislation repeals the federal Goals 2000 program
and sends its funding back where it belongs,&quot; FRC policy
analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said, &quot;to the local school boards,
elected by parents and community members, who have the authority
to make decisions for their own schools.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Goals 2000 snatched local authority and put it in the federal
government's hands.  Under Goals 2000, state and local school
districts must spend their money according to Washington's bureaucratic
priorities, not their local needs,&quot; Marshall said.

<p>

&quot;Take a closer look at Goals 2000 and you'll see that it's
not about the 3 R's.  Read the eight national education goals
and objectives, and you'll find Goals 2000 talking about enhanced
prenatal health care, comprehensive sex education and requirements
for American businesses with regard to education.  The program
isn't about education -- it's about using our schools to forward
a broad, liberal social agenda,&quot; Marshall explained.

<p>

&quot;We all know that education in America is suffering,&quot;
Marshall says, &quot;but Goals 2000 is not the solution.  Enhanced
social services -- including school-based health care and sex
education beginning as early as kindergarten -- can't solve the
fundamental crisis our schools.  A return to what schools <I>ought</I>
to do best -- teaching the academic basics like reading, writing
and arithmetic -- is the right answer.

<p>

&quot;FRC applauds Rep. Graham's commitment to the family and
to education as demonstrated by the Goals 2000 Elimination Act.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>&quot;AMERICA DODGES THE BULLET,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS OF ENDA DEFEAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;America has dodged the bullet,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said of the Senate's
narrow (49-50) defeat of the so-called Employment Non-Discrimination
Act (ENDA).

<p>

&quot;For the U.S. Senate to come within one vote of enshrining
homosexuality along with race, sex and ethnicity in our nation's
civil rights laws represents a disconnect from reality.

<p>

&quot;Many ENDA supporters equated homosexuality with being black
or Hispanic. But minority groups that enjoy special protections
do so because of group histories of political powerlessness, economic
deprivation and unchangeable characteristics.  Homosexuals do
not qualify in any of these categories.

<p>

&quot;This was a homosexual jobs bill, pure and simple. It would
have forced employers to keep detailed records of the private
sexual preferences of their employees. How bizarre that the defenders
of <I>the constitutional right of privacy</I> were prepared to
annihilate privacy in the service of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

&quot;ENDA would have led, inexorably, to quotas and set-asides.
All the most divisive social conflicts in America today would
have been inflamed by the passage of this ill-advised legislation.
Can nearly half of our senators really want that?  Supporters
of  ENDA shrewdly used paper exemptions for churches and synagogues
to create a facade of deference to the religious community.  But,
make no mistake, this bill would have been used as a sledgehammer
to smash faith-based, for-profit institutions -- like religious
broadcasters, like religious publishing houses and bookstores,
like summer camps for religious youth.

<p>

&quot;Passage of ENDA would have signaled the contempt of Senate
liberals for the legitimate rights of the states, one-third of
which still list sodomy as a crime. Worst of all, ENDA would have
encouraged more young people to enter an immoral and unhealthy
lifestyle. Society cannot be indifferent to the signals -- subtle
and not-so-subtle -- that it sends its youth. ENDA would have meant
that the U.S. government doesn't care whether young people who
are struggling with their sexual identity resolve to live normal,
heterosexual lives or not.

<p>

&quot;But this <I>is</I> a day to savor victory. It is sweet because
it was so hard won. The overwhelming vote of the Senate (85-14)
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
sends a clear message that this basic institution is valued and
will be fought for. No one can take seriously the argument that
it is beneath the dignity of the Senate to debate the survival
of marriage. Failure to pass DOMA would have exposed the entire
federal union -- <I>all</I> the states, <I>all</I> branches of the
federal government -- to the dangers of an imperial judiciary. With
this stunning vote, the Supreme Court of Hawaii has all the justification
it needs to <I>reject</I> gay marriage. Let's put this bad idea
to rest now -- and forever. President Clinton should now eat his
spinach and sign DOMA immediately.&quot;

<center><h2>SENATE'S PASSAGE OF DOMA IS<br>
&quot;A VOTE FOR COMMON SENSE,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>Calls on President to &quot;eat your spinach<br>
and sign the Defense of Marriage Act&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary Bauer
hailed the overwhelming vote of 85 to 14 by the U.S. Senate to
pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which puts the bill on President
Clinton's desk.

<p>

&quot;Now that Congress has done its job and passed this wise
and needed legislation, we are saying to the President, 'eat your
spinach and sign the Defense of Marriage Act as you promised.'&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Given the gravity of the judicial challenge
in Hawaii, it is imperative that DOMA become the law of the land
as soon as possible so that the states won't be forced to accept
counterfeit 'marriage' should the Hawaiian courts take the radical
step of destroying the traditional definition.

<p>

&quot;It is amazing that we even had to fight a battle to ensure
that marriage remained the legal union of a man and a woman,&quot;
Bauer continued. &quot;But it was also heartening that so many
people around the nation rallied to defend this irreplaceable
institution.  The huge margin of victory was won by millions of
people who let their representatives know how they felt.&quot;

<p>

&quot;We commend Sen. Nickles and Reps. Bob Barr and Steve Largent
for their leadership in bringing the Defense of Marriage Act to
passage.

<p>

&quot;Failure to pass DOMA would have jeopardized the moral foundation
upon which the rest of society is built,&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Marriage has already suffered a loss of respect thanks
to the sexual revolution.  Many people are struggling with broken
families and are trying to put their lives back together.  Many
have prevailed over difficult circumstances and sought a better
life for their own families.  But society must never deliberately
raise the bar higher for the next generation of children. They
deserve the marriage-based blessings that previous generations
have enjoyed.

<p>

&quot;America's commitment to marriage has been strengthened by
this Act.&quot;

<center><h2>ENDA WOULD USHER IN NATIONAL<br>
HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA, KNIGHT SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&QUOT;'GAY JOBS BILL' THREATENS FREEDOMS OF RELIGION,<br>
CONSCIENCE, ASSOCIATION AND SPEECH&QUOT;</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (HR 1863; S972) is
a radical change in workplace discrimination law,&quot; said Robert
Knight, Family Research Council's Director of Cultural Studies.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), is
currently under consideration in the Senate and could be voted
on at any time.

<p>

&quot;What is being described as a harmless gesture of 'tolerance'
toward homosexuals in the workplace is actually a mighty weapon
to be used against both employers and employees who believe that
homosexuality is wrong.  This 'gay jobs bill' threatens the freedoms
of religion, conscience, association and speech,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;ENDA puts children's camps, Christian- and Jewish-owned
businesses, and many other institutions in the crosshairs of homosexual
activist lawyers.  At its root,&quot; Knight noted, &quot;ENDA
would distort the concept of civil rights by creating an unprecedented
behavioral component whose outer limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

&quot;The so-called 'religious exemption' in Kennedy's amendment
is so narrow that it will leave millions of devoutly religious
Americans exposed to the heavy hand of big government.  ENDA's
sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot; eliminates
any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual behavior,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;ENDA guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation
which could hurt small businesses most of all.

<p>

&quot;ENDA paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference,
regardless of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed;
(remember Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights
Act would never lead to quotas?); prohibits employers from disciplining
or taking into account in any way sexual activity <b>on or off
the job</b> by an employee (the term &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is infinitely expandable); defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
so broadly that all sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality,
are given special protection and therefore moral status on a par
with sex within marriage; and suggests the federal government
is officially supportive of sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals
by definition have sex with more than one person.

<p>

&quot;People want homosexuals to have the same rights -- not more
rights -- in the workplace as anyone else,&quot; Knight said.  &quot;The
federal government has no business ordering millions of Americans
to accommodate behavior that they believe is wrong and destructive.&quot;

<i>&quot;ON DRUGS<br>
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S CURIOUS<br>
SURRENDER&quot;</i></h2>

<p>

<h4>Available NOW along with other policy works
on the growing drug problem in America.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The policy debate over the drug
problem has radically changed from one that tried to find effective
ways of keeping our children from drugs to 'harm reduction' strategies
which facilitate 'safer' drug use ... and you can see the result
of that seriously flawed switch,&quot; said Robert L. Maginnis,
drug policy analyst for the Family Research Council. The policy
expert made his comments as more evidence was unveiled this week
on the growing drug crisis in America.

<p>

&quot;Illicit drugs kill 20,000 Americans every year,&quot; Maginnis
noted. &quot;We must get serious about the life and death struggle
that casual attitudes toward drug use ignore.&quot;

<li><I>New York Times'</I> polling shows what Gary Bauer has said
all along, the people making up the GOP delegation are primarily
pro-life.

<p>

<li>To the contrary of what pro-abortion Republicans have said,
the platform remains a document that reflects the majority view
of the GOP -- that life is an important issue.

<p>

<li>Gary Bauer continues to be a champion in the fight for life,
meeting with the majority of the delegation repeatedly during
these days to find reasonable ground.

<center><h2>DO YOUR KIDS INFLUENCE YOUR VOTE?<br>
FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL SAYS<br>
TRACK THE &quot;PARENT GAP&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON --</b> In the last presidential election, the &quot;Parent
Gap&quot; proved to be far bigger than the &quot;Gender Gap,&quot;
as voters with children in the home showed less support for Clinton
than childless voters or empty nesters.  In fact, &quot;the demographic
peers of George Bush and Ross Perot were more responsible for
the election of Bill Clinton and Albert Gore than any other age
group,&quot; noted Family Research Council Vice President for
Policy Bill Mattox.

<p>

Mattox made his observations in &quot;The Silent Minority -- The
Hidden Electoral Impact of Children&quot; based on original, scientific
polling FRC commissioned after the last presidential election.

<p>

On Wednesday, Mattox noted that the research tracks with current
polling which underscores that <i>marriage and property ownership
are good indicators</i> of whether someone votes conservatively.

<p>

&quot;<i>But tracking marriage alone is not enough</i>. The presence
of children in the home is sometimes even more important than
marital status,&quot; Mattox said.

<p>

<b>In the last election, &quot;none of the standard demographic
variables -- gender, income, ethnicity, religion, age, marital
status, or education -- was as reliable in predicting whether
or not someone voted for Clinton as the presence of children in
the home,&quot; Mattox reported.</b>

<p>

In fact, the presence of children in the home is a good indicator
of conservative leanings as a whole and a heightened interest
in &quot;values&quot; issues specifically, Mattox said.

<p>

<center><h2>FDA SHOULD NOT APPROVE RU-486 DUE TO<br>
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, FRC SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;The federal government should not promote a drug whose 
sole purpose is to destroy human life,&quot; Policy Analyst Gracie 
Hsu says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Indeed, we would all be outraged 
if the federal government ever issued an approval of Dr. Kevorkian's 
killing machine simply because he claims there are 'therapeutic' 
effects for his patient,&quot; Family Research Council Policy Analyst 
Gracie Hsu said Thursday.  &quot;We know otherwise.  In the same way, 
the federal government should not give its imprimatur to RU-486 
because no government should ever be responsible for the killing 
of innocent human beings or an accomplice to the mothers who would 
take the lives of their own children.&quot;

<p>

Hsu made her statement as Family Research Council and the National 
Right to Life Committee co-sponsored a news conference on the 
medical risks and legal implications of RU-486.   The news conference 
was held one day before a hearing by the Reproductive Health Drugs 
Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
consider whether the abortion drug RU-486 should be recommended for 
use in the United States. Hsu is scheduled to testify before the 
Advisory Committee Friday.

<p>

&quot;It is unacceptable for the federal government, through the 
vehicle of the FDA, to promote a drug whose sole purpose is to 
destroy the life of another human being.  There are no therapeutic 
effects of RU-486,&quot; Hsu said.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, the FDA has an ethical duty not to approve a 
drug that would be harmful to the mothers taking the drug.  We 
already know that at least one woman in Iowa lost so much blood 
as a result of taking RU-486 that she almost died.  And there are 
other issues regarding the abortion drug's safety and efficacy.  
For example, if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- 
whether due to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply to 
protocol -- the medical complications could be severe, i.e., 
infection, sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There 
is also a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects 
of RU-486 on women, including the future fertility of the women, 
the possible link with breast cancer, and the medical complications 
resulting from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

&quot;The FDA has heretofore compromised its objectivity and ethical 
standards because FDA Commissioner David Kessler promised that he 
would place RU-486 on a fast track and approve the drug within six 
months.  FRC calls on the FDA to halt its attempt to circumvent its 
own approval statutes to ensure safe and effective drugs for the 
sake of the lives and safety of both women and children.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL PULLS OUT<br>
OF &quot;STACKED&quot; HEARING UNDER STRONG<br>
PROTEST</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Ordinarily, we are honored to
be invited to testify at a congressional hearing, but we won't
allow ourselves to be used as a fig leaf for a propaganda party
on a homosexual 'civil rights' bill,&quot; said  Robert H. Knight,
Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.
&quot;It is obvious that they are staging this stacked hearing
now to try to cripple final passage of the Defense of Marriage
Act.&quot;

<p>

Knight had been slated to testify on July 17, 1996 before the
Government Programs Subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee,
chaired by Rep. Peter Torkildsen (R-MA).  The topic was to be
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) (HR 1863) which would
give homosexuals special rights in the workplace that other employees
do not enjoy.

<p>

Knight, who had testified in 1994 before the U.S. Senate Judiciary
Committee on an earlier version of the bill, canceled after learning
the lineup of witnesses.  The July 17 hearing lineup consisted
of three panels, with 10 of 12 people speaking for ENDA.

<p>

The first panel was slated to be of five businesspeople, all of
whom were supporters of ENDA.  The second panel was to consist
entirely of purported &quot;victims&quot; of discrimination because
of their sexual orientation.  No speakers were invited who had
suffered at the hands of homosexual activists wielding 
&quot;anti-discrimination&quot; charges. No former homosexuals were 
invited to counter the faulty research that has been publicized on 
causes of homosexuality.

<p>

The final panel was to have included Family Research Council and
a spokeswoman from the Small Business Survival Committee, along
with two pro-homosexual witnesses.

<p>

Both Family Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee
pulled out of the hearing, citing similar reasons:  the hearing
was a stacked showcase for ENDA, and not enough notice was given
to attain more witnesses to provide balance.  The Small Business
Survival Committee representative also said she had a prior commitment.

<p>

&quot;Torkildsen's Massachusetts colleague, Sen. Ted Kennedy,
has announced his intention to attach ENDA to DOMA when the bill
is considered in the Senate.  Since this addition would be unacceptable,
it is clearly an attempt to kill DOMA,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

&quot;ENDA is being raised at this time not on its own merits
but as a vehicle that they hope will derail the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA) which passed the House on a vote of 342-67,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;Why would anyone who supports DOMA want to be a party
to this charade?&quot;

<p>

&quot;President Clinton has said he <I>would sign it in its current
form</I>. Any effort to tamper with the language might jeopardize
final passage of the bill,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

Family Research Council had urged the Chairman's staff to contact
several other potential witnesses, including Anthony Falzarano,
Director of Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries in Washington, D.C.;
Seattle businessman Bryan Griggs, who was forced to defend himself
against a false charge of discrimination by a homosexual employee,
and Joseph Broadus, a George Mason University law professor and
expert in civil rights law.  Falzarano was never contacted; Broadus
was unable to be reached, and Griggs received a call at about
3:30 p.m. Washington time the day before the hearing, after Family
Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee had pulled
out under protest.  Statements from Broadus, Falzarano and Griggs
are available from Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The timing of the hearing and the lack of balance constitute
a naked attempt to use ENDA as a way to harm passage of DOMA,
and Family Research Council will not be used as a pawn in this
cynical game,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h4><i>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</i></h4>

<p>

<h2>RU 486: SUNNY RHETORIC OR BLOODY REALITY?</h2></center>

<p>

On <b>Thursday, July 18</b>, one day before the FDA Advisory Board
hearing to review the application to market the RU 486 abortion
technique in the United States, Family Research Council and a
number of national pro-life groups will hold a news briefing to
highlight the viewpoints of medical and legal experts on the dangerous
aspects of RU 486.

<p>

<center>The news conference will be held:<br>
<b>Thursday, July 18, 1996<br>
10:00 a.m.<br>
First Amendment Room, National Press Club</b></center>

<p>

This highly controversial drug has been put on the fast track.
Reports claim that the American trials have had no serious problems,
however there are many crucial questions that remain unanswered.
In fact, one doctor's patient was close to death after having
an RU 486 abortion.  Dr. Mark Louviere, an Iowa physician who
supports legalized abortion, will speak Thursday about his experience
administering the drug to a patient who lost more than half of
her blood volume after taking RU 486.

<p>

Other doctors and an attorney will address the many risks and
complications of RU 486, including: the psychological trauma,
safety and liability issues, and the problems with the approval
process.  For example, five Committee members and the executive
secretary of the Advisory Committee may have a conflict of interest
and bias in favor of abortion.

<p>

Family Research Council Policy Analyst <b>Gracie Hsu</b> will
testify Friday before the Advisory Committee for Reproductive
Health Drugs and will be present at the news conference for interviews.

<center><h2>FAMILIES SALUTE CONGRESS ON DEFENSE<br>
OF MARRIAGE VOTE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It is not intolerance to believe in traditional morality,&quot; 
Bauer says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;<b>Defending normalcy is not
an intolerant act.</b> It is not intolerance to believe in traditional
morality. The vast majority of Americans, from Hawaii -- where
this attack on marriage originates -- to the other 49 states,
all agree that marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes.
Family Research Council applauds this historic affirmation of
marriage,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer
said Friday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after the House voted 342 to
67 to pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which would define marriage
as the union of a man and woman in federal law and would allow
states to refuse to recognize same sex unions as marriage.

<p>

Bauer said: &quot;<b>We commend those pro-family champions who
voted today to protect marriage</b> from the aggressive legal
actions of homosexual activists and the ambitions of liberal judges.
The House made an important first step in defending marriage from
its attackers. <b>Family Research Council calls on the Senate
to also support the foundational, fundamental union of marriage
when the bill reaches it shortly. And FRC calls on the Senate
to reject diversionary efforts -- as the House did -- to alter
the bill.

<p>

&quot;Often I am asked, what does it matter if two men or two
women down the street want to call what they have 'marriage'?
Why does it hurt you or your marriage? Well it doesn't -- unless
they bring the law into it.</b> Then the fiction is imposed on
everyone and the counterfeit will do great harm to the special
status that genuine institution has earned. The force of law would
come against businesses, school and all institutions -- such as
the Boy Scouts -- that do not embrace homosexuality as a good
and normal behavior.

<p>

&quot;There are many relationships in which love is involved.
But marriage is a unique bonding of the two sexes, with the probable
expectation of procreation of children. It is the core of civilization
and is universally honored.

<p>

&quot;Good men and women of varying beliefs have been subjected
to a barrage of name-calling and abuse for simply saying that
marriage ought to be the union of a man and a woman and that the
law should protect this vital social norm. <b>It is not hatred
to prefer normalcy</b>.&quot;

&quot;This is by far one of the most crucial pieces
of legislation ever to be voted on in Congress,&quot; Bauer said
Wednesday. &quot;This bill was not invented to oppress a segment
of our society, but rather to defend the institution of marriage
- the core of our civilization - from being redefined into oblivion.&quot;

<p>

The House of Representatives is tentatively scheduled
to vote on DOMA (H.R. 3396) on Friday, July 12.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DECISION FREES CABLE<br>
OPERATORS TO REFUSE PORNOGRAPHIC<br>
PROGRAMS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Major Court victory will allow local cable companies
to protect our children from pornography,&quot; Cleaver
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> American families fighting to shelter
young children from cable television pornography won a major battle
today as the Supreme Court upheld the right of private cable operators
to screen pornographic programs from their leased access channels
in its <I>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium,
Inc. v. FCC</I> decision. &quot;This is a major victory for parents,
children and the First Amendment alike,&quot; says Cathy Cleaver,
Director of Legal Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The Court's reaffirmation of the indecency standard as a
check to determine which material is suitable for children is
significant,&quot; Cleaver continued. A June 12th federal district
court decision in Philadelphia ruled that the definition of indecency
as &quot;patently offensive communication, taken in context, which
describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs,
as measured by contemporary community standards&quot; is too vague
as it applies to the Communications Decency Act (CDA) which sought
to protect children from indecent material on the Internet.  According
to Cleaver, &quot;This latest decision greatly increases the likelihood
of a reversal of the Philadelphia decision when it is heard by
the Supreme Court.&quot;

<p>

In today's decision, the Court upheld the First Amendment rights
of cable operators by giving back to them the editorial power
to decide what programming they <I>do not</I> want to transmit.
However, the Court struck down provisions that <I>required</I>
cable operators to &quot;segregate and to block&quot; transmission
of sexual programs which they <I>choose</I> to show.  The Court
did not free cable operators to refuse pornographic programs on
public, educational or governmental channels because &quot;cable
operators have not historically exercised editorial control&quot;
over such channels.

<p>

&quot;The Court has done its part by giving cable operators the
ability to refuse pornographic programming,&quot; Cleaver said.
&quot;Now it is time for citizens to hold cable operators accountable
to the community.  Anyone who is concerned with this issue should
contact their local cable company and let them know, in no uncertain
terms, that pornography -- on any channel -- is simply unacceptable.&quot;

<center><h2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TREADS<br>
ON RELIGIOUS, CIVIL RIGHTS<br>
OF CATHOLICS IN THE MILITARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;President Bill Clinton's administration
has gagged Catholic chaplains in the military,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer noted on Friday.

<p>

In response to a massive post card mailing from the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops calling upon the Congress to ensure the acceptance
of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, HR 1833, Clinton's appointees
in the Pentagon moved to silence Catholic chaplains. An order
was sent from the Pentagon to the military chaplains not to participate
in the post card mailing.

<p>

&quot;Catholic service members and their families will thus be
denied the guidance of their priests and their bishops. They will
also be prevented from participating in an effort to communicate
to the Congress their own strongly held beliefs on one of the
premier moral issues of our day,&quot; Bauer said.

<p>

Bauer said he deplored the Clinton administration action. &quot;This
is denial of the religious and civil rights of Catholic Americans
serving in the military. Every day, these loyal Americans put
their lives on the line to defend our liberties. They deserve
respect, not abuse.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted Clinton administration claims that the pro-life post
card campaign constitutes &quot;partisan political activity.&quot;
But this claim is belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban was passed by overwhelmingly bi-partisan majorities in both
houses. Among the supporters in the House were such leading Democrats
as Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (Mo.), Minority Whip David Bonior
(Mich.) and freshman Patrick Kennedy (R.I.).  In the Senate, respected
senior Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan (N.Y.) vowed to support
the override of Clinton's April 10 veto.  &quot;It's just too
close to infanticide,&quot;  Moynihan said.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council endorses the efforts of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops to communicate with their co-religionists
in the armed forces,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;We will stand beside
our friends in defense of children threatened by this hideous
and painful method of abortion.&quot;

<center><h2>ON THE &quot;MORNING-AFTER PILL&quot;:<br>
FRC TO FDA: VOTE NO ON RELABELING,<br>
IT'S NEITHER &quot;EMERGENCY&quot; NOR<br>
&quot;CONTRACEPTION&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick on Friday urged the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to reject relabeling of oral contraceptives
to include abortion-causing uses.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick said: &quot;Although proponents of the 'morning-after
pill' like to call it 'emergency contraception,' the effect of
relabeling oral birth control pills for post-coital use would
make the pills neither 'emergency' nor 'contraception.'  Indeed,
we can expect that, if relabeling occurs, girls and women may
forgo other forms of birth control and simply choose to consume
larger dosages of the pill after sex.  And, the major function
of the pill when used after sex, if conception has occurred, would
not be 'contraception' (preventing fertilization) but 'abortion'
(preventing implantation of a living human being).

<p>

&quot;On the societal level, the 'morning-after pill' further
distances the act of sex from the physical consequence of pregnancy
and especially from its proper context within marriage.  Therefore,
it would be much harder to send a message of responsible sexual
behavior, especially to young men and women, when the immediate
potential effect of pregnancy is removed.  But even without pregnancy,
sex has consequences -- both physical and emotional.  Without
the fear of pregnancy, some might mistakenly presume that it is
'safe' to engage in sex, and therefore, initiate sex earlier or
engage in sex more frequently with multiple partners.  However,
these behaviors significantly increase the risk of sexually-transmitted
diseases and infertility.  On the emotional level, more often
than not, it is the woman who gets hurt by these noncommittal
liaisons.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, a 'morning-after' remedy would give men 'a
way out' from assuming responsibility for their sexual behavior,
shifting the power balance even more in favor of men.  The real
result of this overdose of birth control pills would be to cut
more of the moral ground out from under women who are trying to
make good choices for their lives.

<p>

&quot;Why should the FDA be so interested in relabeling oral contraceptives
when the drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change?
Currently, consumers can hold their physician liable if a drug
used for off-label purposes results in adverse health consequences.
Relabeling may protect physicians from liabilitiy, but it hardly
helps their patients, especially when long-term physical and social
consequences have not been carefully examined.&quot;

<p>

<i>Mrs. Hamrick made her statements on the eve of the FDA Reproductive
Health Drugs Advisory Committee hearing set for Friday</i> in
Maryland.  The continued push for relabeling comes from liberal
feminist and pro-abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood, the
Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy and the American Medical
Women's Association which filed a citizen's petition to force
the issue.

<p>

<b>An FDA decision to relabel oral contraceptives for use as a
&quot;morning-after pill&quot; would be troubling for several
reasons:</b>

<p>

(1) If the girl/woman did indeed become pregnant (post-fertilization),
the morning-after pill <i>would work, except in rare cases, as
an <b>abortifacient</b></i>, thickening the uterine lining to
prevent implantation.  The embryonic human being has already been
alive and growing for about a week, and since human life begins
at the moment of conception, preventing implantation is not 
&quot;contraception,&quot; it is &quot;abortion&quot; and should be 
treated as such.

<p>

(2) Furthermore, there are <i><b>serious potential risks</b></i>
to the women taking the &quot;morning-after pills.&quot;  For
example, it is quite likely that FDA approval of post-coital use
would cause women to change their behavior and use &quot;contraception&quot;
only after sex rather than the currently specified daily dosage
at a particular time.  The effect of consuming larger dosages
of birth control pills frequently is not known. <i>There are
apt to be <b>side effects</b></i>, potentially on future fertility,
possibly producing birth defects in surviving children, certainly
on the woman's immediate health, for it would compound the discomfort
of the regular-dosage &quot;pill&quot; -- nausea, bleeding, etc.

<p>

(3) These &quot;morning-after pills&quot; also <i>give men an
upper hand in <b>highly pressured sex situations</b>, and tilt
the power relationship in favor of the man</i>.  Recent research
reveals that many girls feel pressured to have sex by their boyfriends.
With the availability of these FDA-approved post-coital pills,
no longer can these girls appeal to the fact that they are not
&quot;on the pill&quot; or that they fear pregnancy; indeed, this
removes one of the most effective reasons which these girls may
use to defend themselves.  This could have the societal effect
of cheapening women, and sexual abuse may occur more often.

<p>

(4) One societal consequence of relabeling oral contraceptives
would be to <i>falsely create an equivalency between abortion
and contraception</i>.  It trivializes human life even more to
say that the pills' abortifacient nature in this context is no
more significant than simply using contraception.  It also helps
foster an attitude of irresponsibility with regards to sex, <i>placing
a misguided emphasis on <b>short-term rather than long-term thinking</b>
and consequences</i>.

<p>

(5) Drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change. <i>Relabeling
shifts the burden from physicians protecting patients, to patients
protecting themselves</i>.  If patients suffer from adverse consequences
associated with taking the &quot;morning-after pill,&quot; relabeling
may protect physicians from liability, but it doesn't help the
patients who have less recourse against such harm.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DOOMS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court today struck down
the Virginia Military Institute's 157-year-old tradition of providing
single-sex education in <I>U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>.
The Family Research Council had filed a friend of the court
brief in this case favoring single-sex public colleges.  FRC Senior
Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that the decision &quot;limits
the diversity of education alternatives and obstructs a state's
traditional duty to provide education.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said, &quot;Through eliminating publicly funded single-sex
education, the Supreme Court effectually instituted the Equal
Rights Amendment which failed to muster support from a majority
of the American people.  The ERA sought to equate gender with
race for discrimination laws despite the obvious differences between
men and women which do not exist among different races.  Nevertheless,
the Supreme Court by-passed the Constitution attempting to equate
race with gender by judicial fiat.&quot;

<p>

While this particular case appears to empower a woman's ability
to select the university of her choice, the shift in equal protection
jurisprudence may invalidate all 87 single-sex education facilities,
82 of which exist for females.  This shift precludes both men
and women from choosing to receive the benefits of single-sex
education.

<p>

Maginnis noted that &quot;research shows single-sex education
enables students to achieve higher educational performance and
encourages women to pursue majors such as science, math, and management.
Recognizing differences between the sexes and preparing educational
curriculum accordingly is rational; ignoring obvious differences
between the sexes in hopes they will disappear is nonsensical.&quot;

<p>

Although single-sex education may still exist in private schools,
the Supreme Court decision eliminates the possibility of single-sex
education for a large segment of the population who cannot afford
the cost of attending a private institution. Maginnis said that
&quot;the options available to individuals seeking an education
most appropriate for their specific needs is eliminated.&quot;

<center><h2><u>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE:</u><br>
REDEFINING MARRIAGE WITHOUT<br>
DESTROYING AMERICAN SOCIETY

<p>

HOW DO WE KNOW?<br>
ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS AT A MEDIA<br>
&amp; HILL STAFF BRIEFING ON JULY 2</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a special briefing for media and
Capitol Hill staffers, national leaders in the fields of law,
medicine, education and culture will outline the societal implications
of redefining marriage.

<p>

<b>Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer will host
this historic briefing from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. in the U.S.
Capitol, room HC-5, on July 2. Speakers list TBA.</b>

<p>

&quot;Marriage was not invented to oppress homosexuals,&quot;
Bauer noted. &quot;But most of the conversation on the Defense
of Marriage Act has centered around people's perceptions of the
homosexual experience, rather than on the consequences of  a tremendous
cultural change. The purpose of this event is to present intellectual
answers to the toughest questions. And to introduce national leaders
to the media on a revolutionary topic.

<p>

&quot;We have not begun to discuss, as a nation, the implications
of same sex 'marriage' on the law, our school, or our community.
We have barely acknowledged the many benefits of marriage between
a committed man and woman. We owe it to ourselves to understand
the possible outcomes of this unprecedented change.&quot;

<center><h2>GARY BAUER AND GRASSROOTS LEADERS ON<br>
THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT ...

<p>

HOW DOES AMERICA VIEW AN END TO<br>
MARRIAGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> For a discussion of the grassroots
implications of redefining marriage, reporters, columnists and
editors should plan to attend a <B>9:30 A.M. MONDAY, JUNE 24</B>
news conference in the <B>MAIN LOUNGE</B> of the <B>NATIONAL PRESS
CLUB</B>. Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer and
grassroots leaders will detail the need for the Defense of Marriage
Act along with the implications of destroying this pivotal union.

<p>

&quot;Nothing is as foundational for a culture as family. And
with poll after poll showing that American's number one concern
is family breakdown, this effort to cause the family death by
political correctness is even more out of place,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

To discuss the grassroots reaction and strategy of DOMA, pro-family
leaders from the following states will attend: MICHIGAN, OHIO,
CALIFORNIA, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, MISSOURI, SOUTH DAKOTA, IDAHO,
MAINE and VIRGINIA.

<p>

Many of the men and women who will be represented have already
won battles to protect marriage. Others are in the legislative
process in the states, and all will be calling for Washington
to respect the right of citizens to set the laws for their individual
states.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act both defines marriage for the federal
codes and establishes the right of states to make laws governing
marriage for their citizens.

<center><h3>DEMOCRATIC LEADERS PREPARE TO RELEASE<br>
&quot;FAMILIES FIRST&quot; AGENDA SUNDAY...</h3>

<p>

<h2>BUT YOU CAN GET YOUR COPY TODAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b>What is a pro-family agenda? What would
America look like if family policy was more than just political
rhetoric? For answers to those questions, reporters and editors
do not have to wait for the Democratic event scheduled for Sunday.
Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has spent
more than 20 years answering those questions and has written a
concise book detailing what a pro-family America would look like.

<p>

For any reporter wondering how a prominent pro-family conservative
evaluates family issues, the book is a great reference and easy-to-use
guide. In fact, at the end of every chapter, yes-or-no questions
make it simple to analyze the kinds of policy initiatives making
daily news.

<p>

Already, Gary Bauer's book has sold more than 300,000 copies.
In fact, it is the number one best-selling paperback on the Christian
book sellers list.

<p>

Some people think it takes a village to figure out what's best
for children. For millions of Americans, parents decide one on
one every day.

<p>

<b>If you're looking for a pro-family American agenda, call Family
Research Council at 1-800-225-4008 or 202-393-2100.</b>

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE WORSENED SINCE<br>
CHINA RECEIVED MFN STATUS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It's time to put teeth to our convictions<br>
and stop rewarding barbarity&quot; FRC says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For 15 years, the United States
has extended 'most favored nation' trade status to China.  Originally,
it had been argued that an economic 'open door' might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase,&quot; Family Research
Council Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu said Tuesday.

<p>

Hsu made her comments as Rep. Chris Smith's International Operations
and Human Rights subcommittee began its hearing on &quot;China
MFN:  Human Rights Consequences.&quot;  FRC urged Congress to
pass legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.
The House of Representatives is expected to take up legislation
regarding China's MFN status next week.

<p>

&quot;It was seven years ago when Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square;&quot; Hsu continued,
&quot;it was only last year when Hong Kong newspapers reported
that aborted human fetuses were being cannibalized in China, sold
as health food. Last September, directly before the United
Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the Chinese
government executed nine prisoners to 'send a message' to their
own people that they should not attempt to demonstrate against
the Chinese government.

<p>

&quot;In addition to these 'newer' human rights violations, other
abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN status
continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as 'laogai,' as Harry Wu has demonstrated.  Furthermore,
Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted or sterilized, state-run
orphanages continue to starve female children to death, and Christians
continue to be systematically tortured and imprisoned.

<p>

&quot;The failure of the United States to hold China accountable
for its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Instead, the
U.S. has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care
more about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

&quot;It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's 'most favored nation' trade privileges.&quot;

<center><h2>WHO CARES ABOUT MARRIAGE ...<br>
AND WHY OFFICIAL WASHINGTON<br>
SHOULD CARE</h2>

<p>

<h4>GRASSROOTS LEADERS TO STAND WITH FAMILY RESEARCH<br>
COUNCIL ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The grassroots implications of the
Defense of Marriage Act will be the topic of a <B>Monday, June
24, news conference</B> called by the Family Research Council
and Family Policy Councils from across the nation. The event will
take place in the <B>National Press Club Main Lounge at 9:30
a.m.</B>

<p>

&quot;One of the hottest issues in the public debate today is
same sex marriage. And there is every reason to believe that it
will be hotly debated by Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, Family Research Council president. &quot;FRC will
stand with state leaders who have already earned their stripes
on this issue at the local level in defense of marriage.&quot;

<p>

&quot;For anyone wondering whether the defense of home, family
and marriage is a winning issue, the grassroots victories and
support for the Defense of Marriage Act should make it clear.
Every major religion and every successful society has understood
the importance of marriage as the bringing together of the sexes.
And families across America also know just how important this
foundational institution is.&quot;

<p>

Many of the state leaders who will be in attendance have already
won battles in defense of marriage in their legislatures and will
be calling for the federal government to respect the views of
their state citizens. Others are in the middle of legislative
action on state marriage initiatives.

<p>

Family policy councils are state-based organizations that monitor
and advocate at the state level as FRC operates at the federal
level. Leaders from <b>Michigan, Ohio, California, Idaho and Missouri</b>
will be attending. Other state leaders, such as from <b>Pennsylvania,
Indiana, North Carolina and South Dakota,</b> will participate
either by statement or in person. Updated state information on
other participants will be available throughout the week.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT EXTENDS<br>
JUDICIAL TYRANNY TO CITY LEVEL</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Court has quit being a constitutional umpire</br>
and now bats clean-up for homosexual activism,&quot; Knight
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b> In throwing out a lower court's ruling
that upheld Cincinnati's Issue 3 amendment to the city charter,
the U.S. Supreme Court went beyond its ill-reasoned decision last
month in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, said Family Research Council Director
of  Cultural Studies Robert Knight on Monday.

<p>

In <I>Romer</I>,  the court had ruled that Colorado (or any state)
could not pass a law barring homosexuals from receiving special
civil rights protections at the state or local levels.  The law,
Colorado's Amendment Two, was designed to afford statewide protection
of speech, assembly and religion from coercive homosexual activism.

<p>

&quot;In today's Cincinnati case, the court says that voters can't
even amend their own city charters to preclude the enactment of
laws giving homosexuals more rights than other citizens,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;In remanding the case with instructions to
look at <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the court is extending its illogic
to a new level.&quot;  As Justice Scalia said in today's dissent,
&quot;the consequence of holding this provision unconstitutional
would be that nowhere in the country may the people decide, in
democratic fashion, not to accord special protection to homosexuals.&quot;


<p>

&quot;As the sexual revolution keeps grinding, new litigants seeking
rights for pedophilia, polygamy and other sexual 'lifestyles'
will soon surface,&quot; Knight said. &quot;The people of Cincinnati
were right to try to keep 'sexual orientation' from being awarded
special protection.

<p>

&quot;The Supreme Court is stacking the deck against parents,
clergy, the Boy Scouts and businessmen who are being targeted
by coercive 'gay rights' laws.  In so doing, the court has quit
its role as constitutional umpire and is now batting clean-up
for the homosexual rights movement,&quot; Knight said. &quot;Let's
hope and pray that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals won't be
cowed into creating more bad law.&quot;

<center><h2>ARROGANT DECISION CONTRADICTS PRIOR<br>
CASES ON PORNOGRAPHY DISTRIBUTION TO<br> 
MINORS, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<center><h4>FRC Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver says decision on
the Communications Decency Act not a pro-family defeat</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;What else should we expect from
an ACLU-hand-picked judge than a sweeping, radical decision allowing
adults to knowingly send and display pornography to minors on
the Internet?&quot; Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said
Wednesday. &quot;Nevertheless, this is not an ultimate defeat
for American families and children.  No matter where this case
goes next - either to the full Eastern District Court or the Supreme
Court - the Department of Justice will have a better opportunity
to defend the constitutionality of this statute.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver made her remarks as the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania released their decision Wednesday
on the <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> case involving the regulation of pornography
distribution to minors on the Internet.  Family Research Council
presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief defending the
cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  The decision,
written by Dolores K. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit
Court of Appeals and Carter appointee, contradicts previous Supreme
Court decisions on the distribution of indecent material through
the media.

<p>

&quot;It is an arrogant decision which flies in the face of the
Supreme Court and our society,&quot; Cleaver said.&quot; We have
long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful material
have the obligation to keep the material from children. Outside
cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually explicit
images in public places and from selling porn magazines to children.
So, on the Internet, the burden of protecting children from exploitation
should not rest solely on the parents.&quot;

<p>

In her decision, Judge Sloviter maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. However, Cleaver
said that &quot;this decision reflects the Court's unwillingness
to consider proposed regulations by dismissing them as 'burdensome.'
There are constitutional ways to protect children from cyberporn
but not restrict the freedom of speech of the pornographers or
the adults.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Cyberspace is a work in progress. We
should not squander the opportunity to examine and appreciate
a world where pornography knows no bounds. Failure to enact strong
laws is a concession that the information superhighway should
belong to pornographers.  It would be like leaving a loaded gun
in a playground.&quot;

<p>

<h2>JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO MARK UP<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE<br>
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BILLS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The House Judiciary Committee begins
mark up today of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (H.R. 3396)
and the Church Arson Prevention Act (H.R. 3525). 

<p>

Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said that &quot;Congress
and the President should do everything they can to extinguish
the fires that are causing the religious liberty of thousands
Americans to turn to nothing but embers.&quot; On the DOMA bill
Bauer added that &quot;the stability of this country rests on
our faith and our families. Without defending our nation against
the current threat of a redefinition of marriage, the traditional
family unit will never be the same.&quot; 

<p>

Both bills are on the fast track due to current events in Hawaii
and in the southern states.  As the date for the Hawaiian Supreme
Court case on &quot;gay marriage&quot; rapidly approaches, the
full House Judiciary Committee presses forward on DOMA today.
In the next few weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee plans a
hearing at which Gary Bauer will testify on DOMA.

<p>

As the number of reported church fires in the southeast nears
60 since January 1995, the House Judiciary Committee begins mark
up of the Church Arson Prevention Act.  Co-sponsored by Chairman
Henry J. Hyde (R-IL) and ranking Democrat John Conyers (D-MI),
this bill enables Federal authorities to more quickly and efficiently
investigate and prosecute these cases and also protects the freedom
of religious expression.

<center><h2>WILL THERE BE ANY PRO-LIFERS IN THE BIG TENT?

<p>

GARY BAUER COMMENTS:</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The following is a statement from Gary
L. Bauer following up on Senator Dole's comments on CNN <i>Inside
Politics</i> regarding the pro-life plank in the platform:

<p>

&quot;Senator Dole had, this past weekend, navigated some tough
shoals.  Today the ship has been run a ground again. I hope sometime
soon the senator will stop debating fellow Republicans on abortion
and start debating the most pro-abortion President in American
history.  If this keeps up, the so-called big tent won't have
any pro-lifers in it.&quot;

<center><h2>BIG GOVERNMENT CAN'T STAND FOR CHILDREN<br>
BUT IT COULD STEP ASIDE FOR PARENTS,<br>
FRC STANDS WITH MOMS AND DADS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;If the tobacco lobby tried to rally
for smokers' rights, most people would mock their efforts</b>,
but when more than a 100 organizations that lobby for and receive
federal grant monies get together to pressure for more welfare
spending, they're treated as though the name of the event equals
reality. But to stand for children, you need to stand for families,
not big government,&quot; said Kristi S. Hamrick, Family Research
Council Director of Communications on Friday.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick made her comments on the eve of the liberal Children's
Defense Fund &quot;Stand for Children&quot; rally set for June
1. She and other pro-family leaders stood together with families
who have had struggles in areas of taxes, adoption and education.
The news conference highlighted the many issues and organizations
pointedly unnoticed in the so-called &quot;non-partisan&quot;
event.

<p>

She said: <b>&quot;Big government doesn't best stand for children,
parents do</b>. And in the last 30 years, through excessive taxes,
failed welfare programs and overbearing federal control of education,
<b>parents have been squeezed out of the driver's seat of their
family cars, to be replaced by Big Brother. It's too bad he's
been headed in the wrong direction</b>.

<p>

&quot;During the last 40 years, the tax burden on the American
family has gone from one dollar in 50 to one dollar in four. It's
a reverse Robin Hood situation, taking from the poor to give to
bloated government programs and bureaucrats who act as though
they know what's best for other people's money and children.

<p>

&quot;<b>We need the $500 per child tax credit</b>. We need a
balanced budget. We need adoption tax credits. And we need them
now. We applaud the fact that Congress kept its promises and passed
this long overdue tax relief for families and began to address
the burden of debt that will be left to our children. Unfortunately,
liberal activists -- like the Children's Defense Fund -- prevailed
upon President Bill Clinton to veto this necessary tax relief
and balanced budget legislation.

<p>

<b>&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude
that liberal elites know better</b> than parents. The goals of
federal policy should not be to replace the family or parents,
but to affirm them. In particular, we need to help those children
most in need get into stable families.

<p>

&quot;It is shameful that foster care, 'a temporary' program,
becomes a quasi-parent for more than 600,000 abused and neglected
children. Ten percent wait more than 7 years for the system to
give them legal, loving parents. These languishing children deserve
better. We can help them by freeing them for adoption after a
set period of time, and supporting adoption tax credits.

<p>

<b>&quot;It shouldn't surprise anyone</b> that the groups invited
to attend the rally -- groups like The Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund, Planned Parenthood, Zero Population Growth, National Organization
for Women -- support government as surrogate parent. But men and
women nationwide understand that it's parents who best know and
best love their children. And for radical activists to claim that
they are advocates for children is so lacking in credibility,
it doesn't pass the straight face test.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>TO THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND:<br>
THE <i>REAL</i> QUESTION IS WHO BEST STANDS FOR<br>
CHILDREN ... AND THE ANSWER IS PARENTS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;The best advocates of children today
-- and the most unappreciated -- are mothers and fathers, working
together to stand for children,&quot;</b> said Gary L. Bauer,
president of Family Research Council on Wednesday, May 29. &quot;The
best thing we could do as a society to stand for children is affirm
and support parents.&quot;

<p>

<b>Bauer made his comments on the eve of the Stand for Children
Rally</b> scheduled to take place on June 1 in Washington, D.C.
The rally was organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund
known for supporting big government intervention in the family.

<p>

<b>&quot;For Children's Defense Fund</b>, the organizer of the
impressively-named 'Stand for Children' event, the best advocate
a child has is a government official or bureaucrat. But government
is often part of the problem, both by implementing family un-friendly
policies and diminishing the importance of the people who best
love children -- parents,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude of
parents as 'guilty until proven innocent.'  But healthy societies
have understood that parents are almost always those who best
defend children. And only when the home has broken down should
the state intervene to save the child and assist in getting that
child permanently into a loving family.

<p>

<b>&quot;Family is key</b>. Children from broken families should
not be captives of temporary government solutions. It is shameful
that foster care, a 'temporary' program, becomes a quasi-parent
for more than 600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent
wait more than seven years for the system to give them legal,
loving parents.  These languishing children deserve more than
'bought' foster care.  As one system child of 10 years said, 'I'm
all wrapped up in programs, what I need is a mom and a dad.'

<p>

&quot;Not surprisingly, the groups invited by CDF to attend the
rally were primarily those who believe that government should
be a child's best friend. In fact, despite well-spoken words about
faith in child rearing, an anti-faith attitude has marked CDF's
policies. Children's Defense Fund has been hostile to the role
religious organizations can play as advocates for children and
families in place of government.

<p>

<b>&quot;CDF has taken the attitude that experts know best</b>
--  rarely parents -- and have consistently fought against school
choice for parents and day care vouchers for poor parents who
want their children instructed in a values setting.

<p>

&quot;But most significantly, time and time again, the Children's
Defense Fund has missed the mark on <b>the greatest crisis facing
our children -- family breakdown</b>. For them, every problem
is an economic one, explained not in the loss of values or loving
homes, but in dollars and cents. The last 30 years has shown clearly
the failure of these approaches. Unless we all stand together
for the family, our society will fall.&quot;

<center><h2>BAUER CALLS<br>
AMENDMENT TWO DECISION<br>
'DISASTER FOR SELF-GOVERNING PEOPLE'</h2>

<p>

<h4>'THE COURT IS TAKING AWAY AMERICANS'<br>
FREEDOM TO DISAGREE ON HOMOSEXUALITY'</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Today's 6-3 Supreme Court decision
in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a disaster,&quot; said Gary L. Bauer,
President of the Family Research Council.  &quot;The legal details
will be debated, but the ruling's immediate impact is clear enough:
No state in the country may amend its constitution to bar the
granting of special rights for homosexuals.

<p>

&quot;No one -- including the people of Colorado -- is suggesting
that homosexuals should lose any rights; but nobody has the right
to 'win' at the ballot box even when losing.  Homosexual activists
lost at the ballot box, but now they will see their will imposed
on the people of Colorado -- and the rest of the nation -- by an 
out-of-control, unelected judiciary.

<p>

&quot;Now, with state laws being struck down, it is clear that
the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is urgently needed.
Otherwise, marriage itself will be redefined radically by unrestrained
judges. DOMA may just be the antidote to the judicial lunacy.

<p>

&quot;As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a stinging dissent, 'Today's
opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and
barely pretends to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals
in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential
treatment . . . Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment,
but of political will.'

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;On yet another question of profound public
concern, the legislative voice of the American people has been
silenced.  Even the illusion of a level playing field evaporates
before our eyes.

<p>

&quot;Here's how it works:  Homosexuals may win laws providing
themselves with special rights, and Americans who disagree may
not pass any laws to the contrary. No other group has that kind
of power to impose its agenda on the rest of the people.  This
decision, apart from its policy consequences, should send chills
down the back of anyone who cares whether the people of this nation
any longer have the power of self-rule.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILIES SHOULD NOT BE FORCED<br>
TO FUND CONDUCT UNBECOMING<br>
TO OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE</h2>

<p>

<h4>MEDIA INVITED TO VIEW VIDEOTAPED ACCOUNT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Everyone -- the media and public
-- is invited to view a 6-minute videotape detailing some of the
events that transpired during the homosexual 'Cherry Jubilee'
parties held in taxpayer-funded government buildings in April,&quot;
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
said Wednesday.  &quot;Rep. Steve Gunderson has said the events
at two parties have been misconstrued in a written eye-witness
account -- but a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The Family Research Council became concerned about a possible
misuse of family tax dollars after reading lewd advertisements
for the events in homosexual publications and other media outlets.
The gay-friendly, Washington, D.C. libertarian newspaper <I>City
Paper</I> described the Cherry Jubilee Main Event Party as a &quot;gay
'circuit' party....Circuit parties are all-night -- and usually
drug-infested -- gay dances.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Video footage taken at the Main Event clearly shows half-naked
men dancing to a disco beat in the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium,
a hall that has been used for presidential ceremonies,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;And earlier footage shows the same auditorium hosting
the indescribably vulgar Sado-Masochistic Leather Fetish event
during the 1993 Homosexual March on Washington.  It is inappropriate
in the city of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln for vulgar parties
thrown by anyone for any reason to be staged in our taxpayer-funded
facilities built to accomplish the noble goals of democracy. 
Hardworking American families should not be forced to facilitate
conduct unbecoming to our national heritage.  And the Rayburn
House Office Building should not be used for Sunday disco parties.

<p>

&quot;The offensive use of taxpayer-funded buildings set aside
for federal agencies and the business of the House shows that
the issue here is not 'tolerance.'  Unfortunately, that word has
been abused to force Americans to endorse, support and facilitate
offensive behavior.  And when people object to this abuse, they
are assailed as 'bigots' or 'haters.'&quot;

<p>

&quot;Despite Rep. Gunderson's words on the House floor that
nothing inappropriate took place, <b>here are four accounts to
note:</b>

<p><ul>

<li><i>&quot;...the dancing became increasingly lewd and
suggestive.  As the night wore on, the dancers began simulated
sex gyrations.  There was intense groping and stroking of each
other.  Some couples dancing on table tops, mimicked anal sex
through their clothing, while others pantomimed oral sex.....At
about 4 a.m., two men proceeded to engage in illicit sexual behavior
in the main auditorium.....oral intercourse....The restroom stalls
at the Mellon auditorium were constantly being occupied by two
men at a time....evidence of illegal drug use was present.  Audible
snorting could be heard throughout the evening in the bathroom
stalls.&quot;  -- free-lance video journalist Marc Morano in an
eye-witness account published in the Congressional Record.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;Jim Jennings of Hill &amp; Knowlton, a sponsor
of the event, said he didn't witness drug use but added, 'I would
not be surprised, though, that in any group of 20-to-30-year-olds...[that]
there would be some who had done drugs...If it became clear that
[drug use] was a serious element of this event we'd stop it.'
Instead, he said he simply witnessed 'very provocative dancing.'&quot;
-- Paul Bedard, &quot;Gay GOP lawmaker defends 'Jubilee,'&quot;
The Washington Times, May 15, 1996, p. A-1.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;I saw a couple of instances of people in a
corner using drugs...a fair number of people using drugs.&quot;
-- City Paper homosexual reporter John Cloud, as quoted in The
Washington Times.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;The stately place was incredible -- we felt like
we were in a hallowed hall. We spent much of our time out on the
dance floor trying to cop a feel, or back in the sponsors' lounge
trying to cop a feel, or outside in the designated smoking area
trying to cop a feel and a smoke.&quot; -- columnist in the homosexual
Metro Weekly, as quoted in The Washington Times.</i>

</ul><p>

&quot;Pro-family Americans are tired of having their values disparaged
and their tax dollars wasted on undignified personal agendas,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;These charges are serious enough that they
should be investigated by Congress, by the Metro Police and by
the General Services Administration, which is responsible for
events at the Mellon Auditorium.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT IS &quot;IN<br>
CIVILIZATION'S BEST INTEREST,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC URGES HOUSE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT H.R. 3396</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (H.R. 3396)
&quot;is one of the most urgent and essential pieces of legislation
to be considered in this century.  The institution of marriage
must not be taken lightly,&quot; said Family Research Council
President Gary Bauer. &quot;Clearly, those who care deeply about
children, about morality, about the well being of the larger society,
must resist the attempts by a tiny segment of the population to
diminish the foundation on which society stands.&quot;   Bauer
made these comments as the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee
held a hearing on the legislation that would preserve marriage
from being redefined by state courts.

<p>

Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Bob Barr
(R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced by Senator Don Nickles
(R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would protect the traditional
definition of marriage as a legal union between one man and one
woman in the U.S. Code, and also protect states from any redefinitions
imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage has been quickly raised
to the federal level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian
courts will soon take the radical step of striking down that state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

&quot;Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;Marriage
is a societal good even without children, as husbands and wives
serve as role models for children in their neighborhoods. Marriage
between one man and one woman gives children the best economic,
emotional, and psychological environment in which to grow up.

<p>

&quot;We must step up our efforts to defend marriage now.  Instead
of submitting to radical demands that would destroy marriage,
we need to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and
the culture.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC LABELS NEEDLE EXCHANGE<br>
PROGRAMS BAD MEDICINE FOR<br>
FIGHTING AIDS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The fight to establish federally-funded
needle exchange programs is being urged as a wedge issue to gain
drug legalization,&quot; Family Research Council's policy analyst
Robert Maginnis said today.  &quot;Linking drug addiction with
the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic under the pro-drug umbrella
called 'harm reduction' may be good political strategy, but it's
an awful idea that is gathering momentum, and it must be countered.
Needle exchange programs are simply bad medicine.&quot; 

<p>

Maginnis spoke today at the National Conference of State Legislatures
on the topic, &quot;Getting to the Point: The Role of Sterile
Syringes in HIV Prevention.&quot;

<p>

Needle exchange programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among injecting drug users to reduce the risk
of transmitting the AIDS virus.  Exchange advocates claim that
the science conclusively supports these programs, however on close
examination the science is seriously flawed.

<p>

&quot;The science downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts,&quot;
Maginnis said.  &quot;Some resort to prostitution to fund their
addiction.  After all, non-needle-using crack addicts have a high
incidence of HIV. Most of the needle studies fail to interview
neighborhood residents to see whether they approve of the effect
of these programs.  They also tend to trivialize the drug problem
and offer no alternative solutions.

<p>

&quot;Needle exchanges promote a breakdown in law and order. They
are poor medicine and poor public health practice. Our goal should
be to eliminate drug abuse, not find a safer way to do it.  The
best way to curb the spread of HIV among injecting drug users
is to get them off drugs.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE IS &quot;CULTURAL<br>
WATERSHED,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC GIVES FULL SUPPORT TO DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
&quot;is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation to be considered
in this or any year. This is a cultural watershed,&quot; said
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer. &quot;Will America
move to protect marriage -- the foundation of civilization --
or will America become the first nation to destroy marriage? At
stake is nothing less than the future of the nation and the well
being of our children.&quot;

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act was announced today in the House and
the Senate, and Family Research Council gave its full support
to the legislation that would protect marriage against current
attempts to redefine it.  Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent
(R-OK) and Bob Barr (R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced
by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would
protect the traditional definition of marriage as a legal union
between one man and one woman in the U.S. Code, and thus protect
states from any redefinitions imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage was raised to the federal
level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian Supreme
Court will soon take the radical step of striking down the state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

Bauer noted that more than 30 states have legislative activities
underway to address this threat and 9 have already enacted such
laws. But because marriage is referenced in the U.S. Code, the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and in Social Security regulations,
federal law is necessary to ensure that no state would be forced
to submit to a redefinition of marriage should another state's
court system take that step.

<p>

&quot;The heart of family life is marriage,&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;It brings the two sexes together in a unique legal, social,
economic and spiritual union -- no other relationship provides
society with the benefits that marriage does. As we have drifted
from the defense of marriage, we have experienced severe social
and economic problems, and now, marriage is under attack as never
before. If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken,
there is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault
on marriage. No civilization has ever introduced a counterfeit
definition of marriage, and those who have allowed the family
to be weakened have not survived.&quot;

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DISQUALIFY<br>
CHINA FROM RECEIVING<br>
&quot;MOST FAVORED NATION&quot; STATUS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council on Tuesday
urged the Clinton Administration to revoke China's &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status because of China's myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu released the following statement prior
to the press conference held by the Coalition to Stop MFN for
China: 

<p>

&quot;China's horrific record on human rights is undisputable.
Its blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life has led
to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers at Tiannanmen
Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers, women
being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide, and
the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of Christians.

<p>

&quot;In the 15 years since the United States has granted China
'most favored nation' trade status, our economic 'open door' policy
has not resulted in even one of these human rights abuses being
halted or abated.  Even if there was, at one point, justification
for extending MFN status to China, arguing that economic trade
might lead to greater influence in the human rights realm, China's
record of continued human rights abuses should completely dispel
that notion.

<p>

&quot;Up to now, the Clinton Administration has only paid lip
service to human rights.  For even while Hillary Clinton was verbally
condemning coercive abortion policies last September in Beijing,
President Clinton was refusing to grant asylum to several Chinese
women who fled their homeland to escape their country's forced
abortion policies.  It is time for President Clinton to put actions
to his words.

<p>

&quot;The oppressive nature of this Chinese government regime
is well-known.  And if the United States does not use the carrot
of its economic markets to encourage China to a humane standard,
then the stick should be the closing of our economic doors.

<p>

&quot;Those obsessed with the idea that there is money to be made
in China seem to forget that the United States is the richest
market in the world and has a lot to offer or withhold. If all
that we communicate to the world is that money making is our only
value, then we cannot be surprised when dictators rise to power,
promising only economic concessions while people die.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BILL<br>
CUTTING GOVERMENT'S ROLE AS<br>
PORNOGRAPHY SALESMAN</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. House of Representative's
National Defense Committee passed by voice vote an amendment today
to the 1997 Defense Authorization Act that would prohibit the
sale or rental of pornography anywhere on U.S. military property.

<p>

Robert Maginnis, FRC's director for the Military Readiness Project
and a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said &quot;This legislation
will aid in strengthening the moral character of our military
personnel, as well as protect the military family. Sexually explicit
material intended to appeal to prurient interests should not be
sold in government stores.&quot;

<p>

But in 1995, the Army Air Force Exchange Service sold more than
$5 million of pornographic materials and today the Pentagon's
bookstore sells <I>Playboy, Penthouse, Playgirl, Penthouse Letters,
Penthouse Comics and Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix</I>. 

<p>

According to Colonel Maginnis, &quot;Pornographic material, like
alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.  Beginning with 'soft'  pornography
sold in military stores, the desire for sexually explicit material
grows to require more explicit images in order to reach the previous
level of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.&quot;

<p>

The Military Honor and Decency Act comes in the wake of the rape
of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a U.S. sailor and two Marines,
and the groping of a female sailor by a drunken chief petty officer
on a commercial flight.

<p>

Under current policy, military store managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of obscenity
outlined by the Supreme Court. The high court's criteria were
written to protect freedom of speech and expression but there
are kinds not protected by the Constitution.  These include, among
others, slander, libel, perjury, yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a
crowded theater and child pornography.

<p>

&quot;The government should not be involved in the distribution
of material that conflicts with the principles of honor and decency,&quot;
said Maginnis.  &quot;With the growing number of sexual misconduct
cases in the military, it is time the federal government sever
its involvement in the pornography trade.&quot;

<center><h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO UNTO OTHERS...<br>
ORDINARY PEOPLE DESERVE THE SAME PERKS<br>
AS FEDERAL WORKERS, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer joined with Sen. John Ashcroft Tuesday in calling for
increased workplace flexibility and more &quot;comp time&quot;
options. Currently, laws on a 40-hour workweek prohibit flexible
schedules, and rather than merely offer time-and-a-half money
for overtime work, comp time could be expanded to offer time-and-a-half-off
options as well.

<p>

Bauer made the following comments during a 3 p.m. news conference
in S-211 of the U.S. Capitol:

<p>

&quot;Ironically, the federal government has boasted of its success
in providing flexible scheduling for the people who fill its ranks
... but rank and file Americans don't have the same options. Government
should do unto others what it has done for itself -- remove the
restrictions on a work week and allow freedom to enter the kinds
of  start-up businesses that are on the cutting edge of growth
and opportunity. And to allow those businesses which built America
to offer the same options that federal workers receive.

<p>

&quot;Recent focus groups have shown that women in particular
are deeply concerned about the amount of  time they have to spend
together as a family. Children's schedules are not always compatible
with corporate America. We need to get government bureaucrats
out of the scheduling business that takes place between employers
and employees who are juggling jobs and families. A recent study
conducted by the Family and Work Institute found that 66 percent
of employed families with children under 18 indicated that they
didn't have enough time for their children. And an original poll,
conducted for the Family Research Council, showed that 61 percent
of Americans favor more time over more money. We have the ability
to address the Family Time Famine in America.

<p>

&quot;Increasing opportunity is a women's issue, a children's
issue and most particularly, a family issue.

<p>

&quot;And I would also urge the Congress to adopt the $500 per
child tax credit, because it would reduce economic pressures on
families, thereby freeing parents to spend more time with their
children. These are the kinds of changes that men and women desired
when they voted for a change in Washington D.C. And I commend
Sen. Ashcroft's leadership in spearheading this positive change
in today's workplace.&quot;

<center><h4>EDITORS' NOTE: REPORTS INDICATE CLINTON TO RELEASE 
PARTIAL-BIRTH VETO STATEMENT AT 5 P.M.</h4>

<p>

<h2>CLINTON SHOWS SHOCKING DISREGARD FOR THE VALUES OF THE 
<i>MAJORITY</i> OF AMERICANS, AGAIN REWARDS PRO-ABORTION ALLIES</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>&quot;Clinton seems to find no life worth saving</i>,&quot;
says Bauer</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Clinton's veto of  the overwhelmingly
supported Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act shows once again his
absolute loyalty to the most extreme abortion advocates,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said on Wednesday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act -- a measure which passed both houses with wider
margins than almost any bill this session.

<p>

Bauer noted: &quot;Polling out this week shows once again that
the vast majority of Americans -- more than two-thirds -- support
either restrictions on abortion or its elimination. These numbers
tell a story that every man and woman of conscience understands.
People do not want to see life casually ended. And they do not
accept abortion as the highest and best offering of our great
Constitution. They are troubled by a 1.5-million person death
count every year. And the overwhelming success of pro-life candidates
in the last election, both Democratic and Republican, underscores
the troubled electorate's concern for run-away abortion 'rights'
turned into societal wrongs.

<p>

&quot;Bill Clinton has again aligned himself with the most extremist
elements of the abortion lobby -- those who see no value in life
poised on the edge of birth. Bill Clinton said he wants abortion
to be rare, but he seems to see no life worth saving, not even
a fully viable child, whose living brain tissue is vacuumed out,
causing painful death.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who knows that our
nation has more to offer than abortion. And from my travels around
the country, I can say for certain that this veto will mark the
Bill Clinton presidency with a stain that will not be white washed
with any amount of election rhetoric.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
DEFENDS MILITARY LAW<br>
IN <i>RICHENBERG V. PERRY</i></h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> <I>Richenberg v. Perry</I>, a military
case that involves a former air force captain challenging his
discharge for homosexuality, will be heard today in a federal
appeals court in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Family Research Council's
Military Readiness Project, the only national group actively defending
the military's legal ban in court, filed an amicus curiae brief
defending the federal law.  MRP representatives will be attending
the case in St. Louis and will be available for interviews. 

<p>

MRP Director Robert Maginnis, a retired Lieutenant Colonel, explains,
&quot;FRC is in court because the Clinton administration refuses
to defend the law.  Rather, it defends a faulty implementation
of the law labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; which permits
homosexuals to serve.  The American people, the law and military
tradition have spoken clearly on this issue:  homosexuals are
not permitted to serve in the armed forces.&quot;

<p>

MRP counsel Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, wrote
in the brief that Richenberg's case is fatally flawed when it
attacks the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.
&quot;This policy,&quot; she says, is only &quot;a political myth.&quot;
According to Wells-Petry, Richenberg's case argues that &quot;treating
detected and undetected homosexuals differently in terms of eligibility
for military service renders the policy irrational, in that it
furthers no legitimate governmental goal&quot; by sifting homosexuals
into two camps, separated only by detection.  On this, she notes,
&quot;No doubt the policy described by Richenberg might pose the
constitutional questions he attempts to raise.  But no such policy
is at issue in this case.&quot;

<p>

In addition, she holds that the Department of Justice does not
even need to defend the regulations.  Instead, the law passed
by Congress, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654, is what really is at issue
and is quite clear:  all homosexuals are barred from service.
Thus, there is no legal loophole through which homosexuals can
serve in the military.  The Military Readiness Project has long
maintained that the real problem is the Clinton Administration's
persistence in claiming the law permits homosexuals to serve instead
of enforcing the law's true intent, namely, to codify the armed
forces' long and constitutional policy of prohibiting homosexual
service.

<p>

MRP has provided briefs in similar cases concerning homosexual
servicemembers.  In the 4th Circuit case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
it was given the unusual opportunity to make oral arguments before
the full court.

<p>

The <I>Richenberg</I> case is one of eight appellate cases making
their way to the Supreme Court. It's expected that either the
2nd Circuit's <I>Abel</I> case or the <I>Thomasson</I> case will
likely be heard on appeal by the high court in its next session.

<center><h2>BAUER TO EDUCATION SUMMIT:<br>
&quot;Empowering Parents helps Kids&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;When all is said and done, the
highest goal of an education summit should be our children's improved
learning,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said
on Tuesday as the Governor's Education summit began. Bauer, undersecretary
of education during the Reagan Administration, urged the attendees
of the summit to focus their attention on initiatives that help
children -- not bureaucrats.

<p>

&quot;We know that these kinds of meetings over the years have
made the participants feel good, but on the whole, they've done
little to improve American education,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;But
when it comes to our kids, it's worth the effort to find what
really works. I would urge the attendees to follow these principles:

<p><b>

<li>Empower Parents not bureaucrats.<br>
<li>Reject the anti-American National History Standards<br>
<li>Submit any agreements made at the summit to the American
people.

</b><p>

&quot;I do not believe government-funded or endorsed national
standards will increase local control or lead to better education,&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Summit leaders can score real achievement by
voting to reject the outrageously biased, anti-American history
standards.  Proponents of national standards have had a difficult
time assuring the American people that their standards would be
high enough to make America internationally competitive and at
the same time low enough so that the vast majority of students
could achieve to such levels.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted that a goal since the Reagan Administration was to
dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. &quot;Governors have
a keen interest in education. They therefore should support calls
for abolishing the Department of Education. We need to bring decision
making authority back to local schools and local leaders.&quot;

<p>

&quot;But no matter what is agreed upon,&quot; Bauer said, &quot;I
urge the governors not to sign any agreement that has not been
released for public comment in their states.  I urge CEO's not
to sign any agreement that would increase government interference
with the American economy. American students deserve our best
efforts in their behalf.&quot;

<p>

<i>REPORTERS PLEASE NOTE: FRC Special Assistant to the President
Robert Morrison is attending the summit and will be available
for comment on site.</i>

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG AGAIN ON<br>
TEENS AND AIDS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> A White House report issued today shows
that 25 percent of Americans who are infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education, and HIV testing without parental notice.
<p>
&quot;This is a policy-driven tragedy unfolding, and the Clinton
Administration is offering only more of the same prescription
that got us here in the first place,&quot; said Family Research
Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight.  &quot;To
say that lack of information is causing the problem is outrageous.
The schools inundate children with graphic sex information beginning
in kindergarten, and when record numbers of teens experiment and
contract diseases and unwanted pregnancies, the answer, we are
told, is always more of the same -- more condoms, more 'education,'
more knowledge of deviant sex practices -- and less parental input.
<p>
&quot;Teens themselves have told reporters that information is
not the problem -- it's the presentation of sex as an inevitable
plumbing exercise in a sex-saturated culture, without regard for
marriage.  According to a University of Minnesota study by a homosexual
researcher, young males &quot;often engaged in high-risk sex despite
good knowledge about HIV.&quot;  The teens &quot;correctly recognized
they were more likely than others to be infected, but were not
deterred from dangerous behavior.&quot;  (Dr. Gary Remafedi, survey
of 239 gay and bisexual males aged 13 to 21, 1994).
<p>
Knight adds, &quot;The condom-based approach has failed miserably
for 20 years and ruined countless lives.  Good programs are available
that work, but the Clinton Administration and their allies are
trying to kill them off.  And the same government that wants to
steal children's innocence now wants to test them for HIV without
parents' knowledge.
<p>
&quot;Parents across America are vitally concerned about their
children's well-being, and they -- not the government -- should be
the primary counselor in their child's sexual development,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;Parents must not be cut out of their children's
lives, especially if their child's life is in jeopardy. No one
should face HIV test results alone,&quot; Knight said.

homosexual sailor who admitted to past misconduct and who intends
to continue that practice.  On October 27, 1995, the Family Research
Council filed a friend of the court brief calling for the dismissal
of the case.
<p>
Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.), FRC's director
of the Military Readiness Project (MRP) will attend the Seattle
hearing.  He said, &quot;Machinist Mate Mark Philips confessed
to homosexual misconduct in 1992 but he filed a lawsuit blocking
his discharge.&quot;  FRC first joined this case in early 1995
by filing a court brief at the trial court level.  Philips lost
that challenge.
<p>
&quot;Philips is a homosexual crusader,&quot; said Colonel Maginnis,
&quot;who wants to use the court to air and resolve national policy
on homosexuals in the military and in particular Congress' constitutional
authority to dictate military personnel policy.&quot;
<p>
Machinist Mate Philips claims that his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy board was swayed by his
admission of misconduct.  He also claims there are sexual acts
that are guaranteed within a constitutionally protected zone of
privacy.
<p>
This case is one of five military homosexual cases now pending
at the Federal Appellate Court level and three cases at the Federal
District Court level.  The MRP is involved in all the appellate
cases as an amicus and had the unusual opportunity last December
to make oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> hearing. 
<p>
As the nation's leading organization defending the military's
ban, FRC argues that many of these cases came about because the
Clinton administration purposely did an end run around the law
and wrote implementing regulations labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't
Tell&quot; which permit homosexuals to serve.  The law prohibits
service by homosexuals.

<title>February 28, 1996 Press Release</title>
<body>
<center><h2>MEMO</h2></center>
<p>
<b>February 28, 1996
<p>
TO:     National News Media<br>
FROM:   Gary L. Bauer, President, Family Research Council<br>
RE:     Statement on Religious Bigotry in Media Coverage</b>
<p>
<b>Religious bigotry, and facile appeals to such bigotry, have no place in the 
American political lexicon.</b> In the past few weeks, some media coverage of 
the 1996 Presidential campaign has betrayed a disturbing insensitivity to the
standards of civil discourse that our nation's founders intended to prevail in
public debate.  Last Friday night's edition of ABC's Nightline is only the latest
example of this insensitivity, an uncharacteristically superficial report by Ted
Koppel that attempted to legitimize the idea that American Catholics in the
1940s and 1950s were given to reflexive prejudice against their fellow Jewish
Americans.
<p>
<B>Americans of all faiths -- and even no faith -- cherish a heritage of religious 
liberty that celebrates the contributions of diverse denominations to our 
national life.</b>  They honor the examples of tolerance and courage that abound
in our history, from Sam Adams' call that the First Continental Congress open
with the prayer of a clergyman not of his own denomination, to the famed
incident of the four chaplains -- a rabbi, a Methodist minister, a
Catholic priest, and a Dutch Reformed minister -- who sacrificed their 
life-jackets to other men and perished in the sinking of the troop ship 
Dorchester in July 1943.
<p>
<b>Prejudice has certainly written dark chapters in every era of American 
history, but ABC breaches its responsibility to the American people when it 
paints a misleading and malignant portrait of American Catholics.</b>  As an
organization representing hundreds of thousands of American families, including
Catholics, the Family Research Council deplores ABC's report.  We urge everyone
engaged in coverage of the 1996 elections to maintain the highest standards
of journalistic ethics and to cover the issues with factuality and fairness. ABC
owes all religious people of goodwill a swift and heartfelt apology.

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG ON PARTIAL BIRTH</h2>
<p>
<h4>PRO-LIFE AMERICANS AND CLINTON KNOW THAT<br>
HEALTH OF THE MOTHER = ALL ABORTIONS</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement following President Clinton's
comments regarding his new position on the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act:
<p>
&quot;After Congressional hearings and extended public debate
and no doubt prayerful consideration, members of both houses of
Congress, on both sides of the aisle, passed a bill which would
ban partial birth abortions.  However, President Clinton has now
announced that, after 'praying' long and hard, he will support
the late-term abortions of babies who are breech-delivered alive
until all but the head remains in the mother's womb, and who die
because the abortionist stabs the back of their heads to suction
out their brains.
<p>
&quot;That President Clinton would veto a ban on a procedure characterized
as 'four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth abortion' shows his
clear disregard for the value of human life.
<p>
&quot;Even worse, Mr. Clinton has tried to cloud his extreme pro-abortion
stance by saying that he, in fact, supports the ban except 'to
save the life of the mother and <I><B>for the mother's health</B></I>.'
<p>
&quot;The Partial Birth Abortion Ban, as passed by both houses
of Congress, already includes a life of the mother exception.
But the health clause that President Clinton seeks to include
is so broadly defined in U.S. law that it would make <b>all</b>
partial-birth abortions acceptable, including the 80 percent of
partial birth abortions that are performed for purely elective
reasons.
<p>
&quot;The 1973 <I>Doe v. Bolton</I> Supreme Court decision defined
'health' as encompassing '<I>all</I> factors -- physical, <I>emotional,
psychological, familial</I>, and the woman's age -- relevant to
the <I>well-being</I> of the patient' (emphasis added).  As a
Yale Law school graduate, President Clinton is completely aware
that adding a health exception to the partial birth abortion ban
would render the bill meaningless.  And his attempts to deceive
the public by talking about prayer and health will not overcome
the overwhelming objections to this heinous form of infanticide.&quot;

<center><h2>SUING SUCCESSES, FLAUNTING FAILURES:<br>
HENRY FOSTER'S RECORD<br>
ON TEEN PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Wednesday in response
to President Clinton's teen pregnancy task force under the leadership
of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Dr. Foster and Planned Parenthood</B> -- Dr. Henry Foster
has had a long-time association with Planned Parenthood and promotes
its goals.  Dr. Foster was a member of the Board of Directors
for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) for several
years beginning in 1975.  In 1989, Dr. Foster served on PPFA's
National Leadership Committee in their Campaign to Keep Abortion
Safe and Legal, the main purpose of which was to fight against
parental consent laws, waiting periods, and other moderate restrictions
that states have the right to set.  In 1992, Dr. Foster was one
of PPFA's Public Policy Advocates, promoting PPFA's goals and
programs in the public policy realm.
<p>
&quot;<B>Suing Successes</B> -- Planned Parenthood has filed lawsuits
against pregnancy prevention programs that work.  For example,
in Hemet, California, Planned Parenthood sued to remove three
successful abstinence programs -- <I>Teen-Aid, Sex Respect, </I>and<I>
Choosing the Best</I> -- from the school district.  In independent
evaluations, all three abstinence programs proved to reduce the
teen sexual activity level, the teen pregnancy rate, and help
change students' attitudes towards saving sex until marriage.
In Jacksonville, Florida, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit
against <I>Teen-Aid</I> despite the fact that Teen-Aid reduced
the teen pregnancy rate by 35 percent just 3 years after its implementation.
<p>
&quot;<B>Flaunting Failures</B> -- Dr. Foster sought to become
Surgeon General on the platform of combatting teen pregnancy due
to his experience with his own Nashville-based program, &quot;I
Have A Future&quot; (IHAF).  But IHAF's contraceptive-based approach
was a proven failure -- participants in the program actually showed
<I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those outside of the
program, according to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.  These
results are consistent with other contraceptive-based programs
-- all of which show an increase in sexual activity rates, teen
pregnancy rates, and increased exposure to sexually-transmitted
diseases.
<p>
&quot;<B>What's Wrong With This Picture?</B> -- Why has President
Clinton chosen Dr. Foster as his senior advisor on teen pregnancy
when it is clear that Dr. Foster's policies and philosophy have
failed?  And, why has Mike McCurry said that the task force will
pursue contraceptive-based approaches when research clearly shows
that such approaches only put our children at higher risk?  Most
of all, why select a senior advisor on teen pregnancy who associates
himself with suing prevention programs that do indeed work?  President
Clinton, the American people await your answer.&quot;

<center><h2>CHALLENGE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON:<br>
SUPPORT <i>REAL</i> PREVENTION OF<br>
TEENAGE PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Tuesday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
under the leadership of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry
Foster:
<p>
&quot;<b>For the Record --</b> In his State of the Union address,
President Clinton said that he would form an organization which
would 'support grass-roots community efforts all across our country
in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Abstinence Programs Work</b> -- If President Clinton
is really serious about decreasing the teenage pregnancy rate,
he needs to look no further than the myriad of successful abstinence
programs around the country.
<p><ul>
<li>For example, <I>Best Friends</I> is a program which connects
teenage girls with mentors and utilizes the benefits of positive
peer pressure to promote abstinence.  A recent evaluation showed
that only 1.1 percent of its participants became pregnant, as
opposed to the 25 percent pregnancy rate for other girls in the
city.
<p>
<li>An evaluation of <I>Sex Respect</I>, an abstinence-based curriculum,
found that students participating in the program had considerably
lower pregnancy rates than those in a comparison group (5 percent
vs. 9 percent).
<p>
<li>Since Jacksonville, Florida (the fifteenth largest school
district in the nation) implemented the abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> three years ago, the rate of teen pregnancy has
dropped by 35 percent.
<p>
<li>Other successful programs abound such as <I>True Love Waits</I>,
<I>Reasonable Reasons To Wait</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>AANCHOR</I>, among others.  And the one common denominator
in all these programs is that they emphasize abstinence and character
development.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>Contraceptive-Based Approaches Fail</B> -- The data are
clear:  President Clinton should not support contraceptive-based
programs because they have proven to fail, increasing not only
the teen pregnancy rate but also teen sexual activity.
<p><ul>
<li>A study using data from the 1988 National Survey of Adolescent
Males (NSAM) found that adolescent males who had been instructed
in sexual biology and birth control were at a higher risk of early
intercourse than were those who had received no instruction.
<p>
<li>After Balboa High School in San Francisco instituted a condom
availability program, the school's overall teenage pregnancy rate
increased by a fourth in just two years.
<p>
<li>A recent <I>Washington Times</I> article reported that teen
pregnancy rates are higher in states that teach condom use than
in states that eschew sex education or stress abstinence.
<p>
<li>Participants in Dr. Henry Foster's Nashville-based program,
&quot;<I>I Have A Future</I>,&quot; actually showed higher rates
of sexual activity than those outside of the program, according
to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>What Will The Future Record Show?</B> -- The real question
is, will the Clinton/Foster task force support the abstinence
programs which have proven successful in reducing not only teenage
pregnancy, but also teenage sexual activity?  Or, will the task
force continue to support failed contraceptive programs and policies,
such as Dr. Foster's very own &quot;I Have A Future&quot; program?
<p>
&quot;We urge the President to carefully examine the data.  The
Family Research Council hopes that this task force will support
SUCCESS over IDEOLOGY.&quot;

<center><h2>PROMOTING FAILED POLICIES ON<br>
TEEN PREGNANCY:<br>
DR. HENRY FOSTER, TAKE 2</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Monday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
headed by failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Disappointing -- </B>Bill Clinton in his State of the
Union Address sounded a very loud call for sounder values in society.
We were skeptical but hopeful that he intended to follow through
with the ideas expressed in his speech. Unfortunately, this appointment
shows that that is not the case.
<p>
&quot;<B>Replicating Failure -- </B>When President Clinton nominated
Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General, he said that he wanted Foster's
program, 'I Have A Future' replicated throughout the nation. 
But part of  the reason Dr. Foster was rejected as Surgeon General
was because his program, like all contraceptive-based programs,
was a proven failure.  Participants in Dr. Foster's 'I Have A
Future' program actually showed <I>higher</I> rates of sexual
activity than those outside of the program, according to a Carnegie
Corporation evaluation.
<p>
&quot;During Dr. Foster's confirmation hearings, Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS) said that 'the bottom line' was that 'there were
difficulties' (with Foster's program), including a 'dropout rate
[of]...at least 47.6 percent.'
<p>
&quot;<B>What Works?</B> -- Evaluation studies are crystal clear:
the only programs that really work to reduce teen pregnancy are
ABSTINENCE programs.  During his State of the Union address, President
Clinton noted that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped for two
years in a row.  The reason for this decline is <b>not</b> due
to federally-funded &quot;safe sex&quot; programs nor Joycelyn
Elders' conscience-assaulting promotion of condoms. Rather<I><B>,
teen pregnancy is declining because more teens are choosing abstinence</B></I>
despite all of the federal government's efforts to promote the
contrary. Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the decrease in teen pregnancy rates
is concurrent with the rising number of teens choosing to abstain
from sex.
<p>
&quot;<B>Lacking Common Sense</B> -- Why has the President appointed
Dr. Henry Foster to head a task force to combat teen pregnancy
when Dr. Foster's own program has a proven track record of failure?
Why has the President ignored all the data about the effectiveness
of abstinence-based programs and instead chosen to promote a failed
policy nationwide?
<p>
&quot;The American people rejected Joycelyn Elders, Kristine Gebbie,
and Dr. Henry Foster because they all promoted the same disastrous
policies.  Each of them was finally ousted because of the outcry
of the American people against their programs.  The President
should know that he cannot escape accountability simply by giving
Dr. Foster a back door by which to enter to do more harm to our
children.&quot;

<center><h2>FORGET DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SPINNING<br>
WHAT IS A PRO-FAMILY PLATFORM?<br>
HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHO WILL FIGHT FOR IT?<br>
<p>
THERE IS A SINGLE SOURCE.<br>
<i>OUR HOPES, OUR DREAMS</i></h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. -- &quot;At Family Research Council, we
don't endorse candidates. But we want <b>every</b> candidate to
deal with the breakdown of values and the disintegration of the
family that is eroding the America of our hopes and dreams,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of Family Research Council and author
of the soon-to-be released <I><B>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision
for America.</B></I>
<p>
<b>This book is the answer to the most asked questions</b>, &quot;What
do you want for America?&quot; and &quot;What do you want people
to do about it?&quot; Gary Bauer is uniquely qualified to answer
those questions. His almost 30 years in political life include
serving President Ronald Reagan as domestic policy advisor and
serving as undersecretary of education under William Bennett.
<p>
Bauer notes, &quot;Every politician talks about supporting the
family, but when the election results are in and the rhetoric
dies down, different visions are in conflict. And every time,
America's families wonder why the people who sounded so good,
could make such bad policy. My book is a tool for deciphering
exactly what a politician means by 'pro-family policy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Hillary Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child</b>,
but the real 'village' is founded on strong parents, supported
by family, friends, churches, schools and the local community.
Big government isn't a village. And bureaucrats in Washington,
D.C. are not better able to make decisions for children than loving
parents. The village must be an environment in which families
are supported and strengthened.
<p>
&quot;<b>The problem today <i>is</i> the village</b>. Cultural
pollution, crime, violence, liberal government policies, sexually
explicit images, unresponsive educators and anti-faith bigotry
are among the 'village forces' that work against families trying
to teach their children right from wrong and trying to give them
a sense of  the American dream.
<p>
&quot;<b>The dream is not the pursuit of money</b>, but it is
the hope that every person will have the opportunity to succeed
in a world that does not self-destruct, but has enduring values
that protect us and our families.&quot;
<p>
Published by Focus on the Family,<I> Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
is a valuable grassroots tool. You can order a copy by calling
1-800-225-4008. <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> will be available
Feb. 1 at your local Christian bookstore.
<p>
&quot;<b>Dr. James Dobson and I want to get this book to one
million readers in 1996</b>,&quot; Bauer noted, &quot;so that
every American will have a pro-family resource. At the end of
each chapter, Yes-or-No questions make it possible for people
to take the spin out of the rhetoric.
<p>
&quot;But the heart of the book is the 'Compact with Our Fellow
Americans,' a commitment for those who sign it  that we will work
together to heal America and make it the place of  our hopes and
dreams.&quot;

<center><h2>AFTER JUDGE WITHDRAWAL, U.S. APPEALS<br>
COURT SET TO HEAR ABEL CASE</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> After almost a month delay, <I>Abel
et. al, v. U.S.A. et. al</I>, one of the many cases involving homosexuals in 
the military, will be heard today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit in New York City.  On Dec. 19, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out.  Today,
a new three judge panel will hear arguments about six service
members' discharges on the basis of admission of homosexuality.
 Family Research Council filed a friend of the court brief, written
by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project,
in the case.  Experts will be available for comment in New York.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent <I>Thomasson</I> hearings in
Richmond, Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the
Clinton Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress
by defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which
clearly excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
&quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is no such thing as a
chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
Because of <I>Abel's</I> delay, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>, another
case on this issue recently heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit, may reach the Supreme Court before <I>Abel</I>.
FRC presented oral arguments in <I>Thomasson</I> and may have
the opportunity to argue before the highest court in the land
one of the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
<center><h4>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also can be reached by contacting the FRC
media office.</h4></center>

<center><h2>FRC APPLAUDS TELECOM BILL<br>
CYBERPORN LANGUAGE,<br>
SAYS LAW PROTECTS MINORS<br>
FROM A &quot;LOADED GUN&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council applauds the
Telecom Conference Committee's decision to include pornography
restrictions in the Telecommunications Bill.   &quot;Leaving pornography
unrestricted in cyberspace is like leaving a loaded gun in a playground.
The new language will help parents protect their children by making
cyberporn inaccessible by children,&quot; Director of Legal Studies
Cathy Cleaver said.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of court-approved &quot;indecency&quot; standard, defined
in the bill as an <B>&quot;image or other communication that,
in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive
as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs&quot;</B> 
<p>
<li>Indecent communications <B>restricted from children</B>, available
to adults
<p>
<li>People liable only for <B>knowing violations</B> of the law
<p>
<li>Online service providers not liable for violations beyond
areas they own or control
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws unchanged
<p>
<li>Those taking good faith efforts to restrict pornography from
children have a defense
</ul><p>
Cleaver noted that, contrary to much of the current rhetoric,
the cyberporn provisions will not find Shakespeare or any other
serious work of literature or library art to be indecent. &quot;Adults
with common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently
offensive materials which degrade women, corrupt children, and
ruin men,&quot; Cleaver said, &quot;and the courts will be obliged
to evaluate material in its proper context.&quot;
<p>
FRC's Assistant to the President for Government Relations Marty
Dannenfelser noted that a few other provisions of the bill are
still unresolved and urged the conferees and the Congressional
leadership to make every effort to conclude these matters as soon
as possible.
<p>
&quot;I hope that both the House and the Senate are able to give
final approval to this important legislation by the end of the
year, so that we do not risk losing the opportunity to protect
our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn,&quot; Dannenfelser
said.

<center><h2>NEW DIVORCE RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The national divorce rate is 4.6,
according to a compilation of new data released today by the Family
Research Council.  In 1994, 4.6 of every 1,000 Americans divorced.
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank 1st and 2nd, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation.  Both states
experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between 1992 and
1994 to remain at the top of the list.  Massachusetts fell from
2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from 3.1 to
2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period.  Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to
9.0 in 1994.
<p>
Currently, divorce laws in almost every state give greater legal
rights to spouses who want to end the marriage than to spouses
who want to try to work out their marital problems. According
to FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey, 55 percent of the American
public want to see these laws modified to offer greater protection
to spouses interested in saving the marriage.  &quot;Clearly divorce
reform is an issue that needs to be addressed at the state level,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.

<center><h2>NEW ILLEGITIMACY RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Thirty-one percent of all births in
the U.S. are to unmarried women, according to a compilation of
new data released today by the Family Research Council.
<p>
&quot;Most Americans believe preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancy
is a realistic goal,&quot; said FRC president Gary Bauer.  He
cited findings from FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey showing that
most Americans actually have greater hope for illegitimacy prevention
programs than for workfare programs designed to move single mothers
off welfare.
<p>
In addition, FRC's poll showed that most Americans consider &quot;putting
the child up for adoption&quot; and &quot;marrying the child's
father&quot; to be better responses to an unwed pregnancy than
single motherhood.  A clear majority -- 55 percent -- say abortion
is the &quot;worst&quot; response to an unwed pregnancy, Bauer
said.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a ratio of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.  
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.

<center><h2>ABEL JUDGE PULLS OUT OF CASE<br>
GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, SAYS FRC</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> When Family Research Council staff got to
the New York court on Tuesday where the <I>Abel et al v. William
Perry </I>was being heard, they were prepared to hear arguments
about six service members' discharges on the basis of admission
of homosexuality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in New York City was the next stop for the case which could go
on to the Supreme Court. 
<p>
However, at the last minute, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out. Court
watchers said that the judge pulled out after the Justice Department
reminded him of the letter. Since there were only two judges left
to hear the case, rather than the three needed, the hearing had
to be postponed.
<p>
&quot;This is very good news for pro-family Americans,&quot; FRC
Director of the Military Readiness Project Robert Maginnis said,
directly after the hearing. &quot;The New York court is not expected
to be as favorable to the view of most Americans, the law and
military experience -- the view that homosexuals should not be
allowed to serve in the military because of the problems their
presence cause.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Abel was one of two cases on this issue making its way toward
the Supreme Court. The other, <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>, was heard
recently in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
and Family Research Council presented oral arguments. Now, Thomasson
may very well make it to the Supreme Court first, and Family Research
Council could argue before the highest court in the land one of
the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration has not been making the case
that has traditionally fallen to the government -- the case for
a strong military force, free from a sexually charged environment.
It is critical that a fighting force be able to work as a team
without the complications of sexual politics.&quot;

<center><h2>ABEL CASE DOES END-RUN AROUND THE LAW,<br>
SET FOR TUESDAY HEARING IN NEW YORK</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council, a national
leader in the battle opposing homosexuals in the military, filed
this summer a friend of the court brief in the <I>Abel et al v.
William Perry</I> federal case which is scheduled for arguments
on Dec. 19.  Either this case or the 4th Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> case is expected to reach the Supreme Court next
year.  Family Research Council will be at the U.S. Court of Appeal
for the Second Circuit in New York City when the case will be
heard, and experts will be available for comment.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent Thomasson hearings in Richmond,
Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the Clinton
Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress by
defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which clearly
excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel
 &quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is not such thing as
a chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said. 
<p>
&quot;Feeling pulled to do something is not the defining issue.
A person who is tempted to shop lift when a clerk's back is turned
is not a thief. A thief is the person who acts on that temptation
or who enters the store looking for an opportunity to steal,&quot;
Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
After the hearing, a ruling could be expected sometime between
March and May, Maginnis said. The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, 
counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project. 
<p>
<b>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also will be reachable by calling the FRC
media.</b>

<p>
<center><h2>CLINTON'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT USES<br>
SUPREME COURT TO PROMOTE<br>
ANTI-FAMILY AGENDA</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Today, the Family Research Council
filed a friend of the court brief in the Supreme Court case of
<I> U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I> (the Virginia Military
Institute). FRC Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that &quot;in
this case, the Clinton Administration is promoting a radical agenda
that would enact the goals of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
without a vote.&quot;   Oral arguments are set for January 17,
1996.
<p>
Clinton's Justice Department goes well beyond the issue of whether
single-sex public colleges should be legal.  According to the
government's brief, Clinton wants the high court to impose a &quot;strict
scrutiny&quot; test which would make all classifications by gender
very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would
be a back door to the Equal Rights Amendment reviving old debates
about Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, homosexual marriage and unisex
bathrooms.
<p>
The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel to FRC's
Military Readiness Project.
<p>
&quot;Ironically, this case would strike its hardest blow on women's
institutions,&quot;  Wells-Petry said. &quot;Single-sex schools
for women number 87, compared to two all-male partially state-supported
schools. Educators working with both sexes have long appreciated
that for some girls and some boys, a single-sex education provides
unique benefits. We can include the First Lady and a quarter of
the female members of Congress among leading Americans who are
single-sex education alumni.&quot;
<p>
The government's Supreme Court brief states, &quot;The long history
of discrimination against women, the general irrelevance of sex
as a ground for official decision-making, and women's continuing
under representation in government, all support the application
of strict scrutiny here.&quot;   This ignores differences between
men and women which were cited in the VMI hearings and helped
defeat the ERA.
<p>
The Clinton Administration appealed the decision by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  which accepted Virginia's proposal
to offer a military-style alternative at Mary Baldwin College
in Stauton, Virginia.  The government claims that  the 1976 forced
integration of women at the service academies shows that &quot;the
admission of women into a rigorous, military-style educational
program does not impair any governmental interest in producing
military personnel, let alone 'citizen-soldiers.'&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Accepting this 'evidence' will seriously erode female combat
exemptions and may subject women to a future combat draft,&quot;
said Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
<p>
Drew Days, III, Clinton's solicitor general, argues &quot;that
strict scrutiny is, in fact, the correct constitutional standard
for evaluating differences in official treatment based on sex.&quot;
 Strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications challenged
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.  It requires
the defendant to prove that any race-based classification is narrowly
tailored to achieve a compelling government objective.  But the
color of a person's skin and sex are different spheres.
<p>
Looking at legal precedents, Maginnis noted, &quot;A strict scrutiny
finding in this case could eliminate single-sex education, permit
homosexual adoption and marriage, prohibit single-gender sports
and even make single-sex prisons unconstitutional.&quot;

<center><h2>IT'S TIME WE KNEW  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE<br>
CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</h2>
<p>
<h4>Family Research Council calls on Congress to support the Child
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Fresh examination of the full
range of erroneous and fraudulent findings in the Kinsey research
is long overdue,&quot; Family Research Council Director of Cultural
Studies Robert H. Knight said Thursday in a news conference to
unveil the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995.
Knight made his comments in the 11:30 a.m.  news conference at
2222 Rayburn as Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) presented the legislation.
<p>
Mr. Knight made the following statement:
<p>
&quot;Family Research Council commends Rep. Stockman  and the
approximately 40 cosponsors on the introduction of The Child Protection
and Ethics in Education Act of 1995, a bill designed to resolve
unanswered questions about the ethics and scientific integrity
of the sex studies by Alfred C. Kinsey in the 1940s and '50s.
 Despite the flaws identified by early critics of the Kinsey methodology 
and findings, the twin studies Kinsey's team authored,
on male and female sexuality, continue to provide a pseudo-intellectual
foundation for social change that has proven deeply injurious
to children and families.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> by Judith Reisman,
Ph. D., and Edward Eichel, M.A. (Drs. Gordon Muir and John Court,
eds.) revealed a variety of serious problems with the Kinsey research.
 According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of these problems is 'compelling
. . . disturbing . . . and requires investigation.'  A review
of Kinsey, Sex and Fraud in the British medical journal The <I>Lancet</I>
concluded that the book 'demolish[es]' the foundations of the
Kinsey research, which The <I>Lancet</I> editors concluded was
'unethical [and] possibly criminal.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The<I> Lancet's</I> characterization of portions of the
research as 'possibly criminal' is based on the inclusion in the
male study of several tables compiled from information obtained
by 'nine' pedophiles.  Table 34 reports the results of orgasm
produced by adults in infants as young as a few months old.  The
current director of the Kinsey Institute, Dr. John Bancroft, now
says that there was but one pedophile engaged in this infant molestation,
but the Institute has refused to reveal his name, the names of
his child and infant victims, or anything else about the circumstances
under which this data was obtained and published.  These and other
key questions must be resolved now.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The introduction of The Child Protection and Ethics in Education
Act today takes a significant step forward in the effort to learn the full 
truth about the Kinsey research.  Given what we already know, it is unimaginable
that any reputable scientific study, any curriculum, or any public
policy today would be based on this work.  The American people
deserve a full accounting of the role that Kinsey played -- and
is still playing -- in molding the sexual ethics of our nation
and its children.&quot;

<p>
<h3>STOCKMAN BILL TO ADDRESS:</h3>
<p>
<h2>DOES DATA FROM MOLESTED<br>
CHILDREN SHAPE MOST SEX<br>
EDUCATION PROGRAMS?</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council will lend its
full support to the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act
of 1995 to be announced by Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) in a news
conference <B>Thursday, Dec.7 at 11:30 a.m. in 2222 Rayburn</B>.
<p>
The bill's purpose is &quot;to determine if Alfred Kinsey's 'Sexual
Behavior in the Human Male' and/or 'Sexual Behavior in the Human
Female' are the result of any fraud or criminal wrongdoing.&quot;
 If such is found, the Congress will &quot;require an in-depth
study be performed to determine if Kinsey and his fellow researchers
employed systematic sexual abuse of children to obtain the data
tabulated in 'Table 34' and other portions of the study,&quot;
the bill states. 
<p>
The bill would also require the Government Accounting Office (GAO)
to study whether federal agencies and schools have used tax monies
to promote information on sexual behavior based upon &quot;erroneous,
fraudulent&quot; research.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Bob Knight wrote and directed
a 30-minute documentary, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot;
investigating Kinsey's studies.
<p>
Knight said, &quot;After looking at the video, people are compelled
to ask, did the researchers lie about their findings, or were
children actually molested in the name of science?  It's a frightening
story, but it doesn't stop there. This research is central to
current thought on sex education for our children today.&quot;

<center><h2>STOP EFFORTS TO REPLACE MOM &amp; DAD<br>
WITH BIG BROTHER, CLEAVER SAYS</h2>
<p>
<h4>PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT OF 1995 ON DECK<br>
AT 10 AM HEARING, DIRKSEN 226</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In the growing struggle of parents
versus the government in a war over who decides for America's
children, &quot;the need for federal legislation is becoming increasingly
apparent,&quot; said Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Studies
for Family Research Council, on Tuesday.
<p>
Miss Cleaver spoke on behalf of parents and in support of the
1995 Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (H.R. 1946, S. 984).
During the 10 am hearing, Family Research Council applauded the
efforts of Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and  Rep. Steve Largent
(R-OK) in sponsoring the act because &quot;this is a good step
toward  restoring the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children.&quot;
<p>
In support of parents, Miss Cleaver related the following:
<p>
&quot;Consider the following: this summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon
Earls of Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year old daughters' room.  After repeated inquiries
of the school superintendent, they found that a school counselor
had driven the girls during school hours to a health clinic where
they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and given condoms
and prescriptions for birth control pills.  Mr. And Mrs. Earls
have not been allowed to see the results of their daughters' tests.
 This type of 'parenting' by agents of the state must stop.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tragically, there are cases of abuse and neglect that the
government agencies must address.  This legislation continues
to allow the government to intervene when it has a compelling
interest to do so.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Stable, intact families rearing children with both love
and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed. Let's stop replacing Mom and Dad with Big Brother, and
pass the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL ARGUES TO<br>
UPHOLD 1993 LAW ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h2>
<p>
<h4><i>THOMASSON v. PERRY</i><br>
HEARD IN U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council presents oral
arguments today in a landmark case in which the U.S. Court of
Appeals, 4th Circuit will consider the constitutionality of the
Clinton's Administration's homosexual policy as an interpretation
of the 1993 law passed by Congress excluding homosexuals from
military service. FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, former Army
lawyer who has litigated the military's ban on homosexuals for
years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect that
the dismissal from the Navy of Lt-Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.
<p>
Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department will be on
the same side of this case, however their arguments differ greatly.
The Justice Department opposes FRC's arguments, based on the intent
of the law passed by Congress, and submitted a brief attacking
their participation.  The Justice Department rests their case
on, and as their brief states, has a &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.
<p>
Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis says
the recent opposition  indicates that &quot;the Justice Department's
primary motive is to uphold Clinton's promise to the homosexual
community rather than to defend a law in the military's best interests.&quot;
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to
serve in an environment that does not put them in unnecessarily
intimate and intrusive circumstances.&quot; 
<p>
Maginnis anticipates the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to refer
the case to the Supreme Court.

<h2>FRC TO PRESENT ARGUMENTS IN<br>
LANDMARK CASE, <I>THOMASSON v. PERRY</I></h2>
<p>
<h3>U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT TO HEAR<br>
CASE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h3></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a rare occasion, Family Research
Council will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding homosexuals
from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday, December
5 hearing.  FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney
who litigated the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the
law in the landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> before the
U.S. Court of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
FRC will be in the position of defending the law passed by Congress,
and the Clinton Administration's Justice Department will take
the more liberal position of building their case on the Department
of Defense regulations implemented to enact the law.
<p>
According to Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis,
the confusion between the law and Clinton's &quot;Don't Ask/Don't
Tell&quot; policy is a strategy designed to lead to litigation.
<p>
&quot;Military people support the ban and so do the American people,&quot;
Maginnis said. 
<p>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99% of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine the
cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.

<h3>HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY CASE,<br>
<i>THOMASSON v. PERRY,</i> TO BE HEARD IN U.S.<br>
COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h3>
<p>
<h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
WILL PRESENT ARGUMENTS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding
homosexuals from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday,
December 5 hearing. Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney who litigated
the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the law in the
landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry </I>before the U.S. Court
of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
To the surprise of court watchers, the Appeals Court granted
FRC's request to address them -- despite the objections of the
Department of Justice and attorneys for Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual serving in the military. Ironically, Family Research
Council will be in the position of actually defending the law
-- which would seem to be the province of the Justice Department.
However, the Clinton Administration's Justice Department has taken
the more liberal position of building their case on the regulations
implemented to enact the law.
<P>
According to Family Research Council analyst Robert Maginnis,
from the beginning of the &quot;Don't Ask/Don't Tell&quot; policy,
 the strategy of the Clinton Administration  has been to set up
a confusing situation between the law and the regulations.
<p>
<B>&quot;The confusion was designed to lead to ligitation,&quot;
Maginnis said.</B>
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put

<h2>SENATE RESUMES DEBATE ON</br>
PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BILL</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. Senate is expected to resume
debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) as early
as Monday, December 4.  Family Research Council supports the partial-birth
abortion ban and will oppose any weakening amendments to the bill.
<p>
The Senate voted November 7 to refer the bill to the Judiciary
committee for a public hearing. On November 17, the Senate Judiciary
Committee held a hearing to educate the Senators about this procedure.
 Senators heard dramatic testimony from a number of witnesses
including the President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists,
Dr. Ellison. Delivering key testimony, Ellison dispelled the claim
of an abortionist who testified last summer before a House subcommittee,
that anesthesia given to the mother as part of the procedure protects
the fetus from pain, and that it causes &quot;brain death&quot;
in the fetus. Others testifying about the procedure were former
abortion nurse Brenda Shafer, Dr. Pamela Smith, Dr. Nancy Romer,
Helen Alvare, Jeannie Wallace French, and Professor Douglas Kmiec.
No amendments were offered to the bill, and it automatically returned
to the Senate &quot;calendar&quot; November 28. 
<p>
As early as Monday, December 4th, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-KS) and Senator Bob Smith (R-NH), the prime sponsor of the
bill, may take up the House-passed bill on the Senate floor. 
<p>
The House has already voted overwhelmingly on November 1 to pass
the bill by more than a 2-1 margin (288-139).  In the Senate,
it is expected that the bill will receive support from a diverse
group of senators with various histories on pro-life votes.  FRC
will be urging Senators to oppose a series of misleading amendments
designed to gut the substance of the legislation.

<center><h2>FEDERALLY-FUNDED &quot;SAFE SEX&quot;<br>
COMMERCIALS SEND WRONG MESSAGE<br>
TO TEENS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement in response to the new
&quot;safe sex&quot; public service announcements released today
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):
<p>
<B>Flawed premise</B> -- &quot;The Family Research Council (FRC)
finds the HHS ads irresponsible in that all the ads -- with the
exception of the abstinence ad -- begin with the flawed premise
that there is nothing wrong or harmful about teenagers having
sex as long as they use a condom.  The truth is, out-of-wedlock
sex is harmful in and of itself, regardless if a condom is used:
 broken hearts, emotional regret, and greatly increased likelihood
to divorce are just some of the consequences of pre-marital sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Doomed for failure</B> -- &quot;These ads are doomed for failure.
 Research clearly shows that condom-based approaches actually
increase the likelihood that teenagers will initiate sex.  The
only approach that has proven to be effective in protecting young
people is abstinence.  The problem with these ads is that, when
they crash and burn, they'll likely take a whole host of young
people with them.&quot;
<p>
<B>Irresponsible use of federal funds</B> -- &quot;When public
opinion polls show that a majority of adults <b>and</b> teenagers
believe that it is best to save sex for marriage, it is irresponsible
for the federal government to be using taxpayer dollars to give
its imprimatur for teens to have sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Undermines parents</B> -- &quot;The ads, clearly aimed at teenagers
and 'Generation X,' undermine what most parents want for their
children.  These ads undercut the message that most parents explicitly
or implicitly relate to their children that sex should be saved
until marriage.&quot;
<p>
<B>FRC's position</B> -- &quot;FRC is, and always has been, committed
to protecting young people from the negative consequences of early
sexual activity (i.e., out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion, AIDS,
and other sexually-transmitted diseases), and to promoting the
positive benefits of saving sex for marriage (i.e., more stable
marriages, greater sexual satisfaction, fewer infertility problems).
 FRC has been a leader in educating young people about the benefits
of abstinence and heartily endorses other efforts which help strengthen
the resolve of young people to wait until marriage to have sex.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC WILL FIGHT FOR MILITARY<br>
LAW IN FEDERAL COURT</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council will defend
the military's homosexual law before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on December 5.   This rare privilege comes after extensive
FRC work in articulating a case about the real impacts of  the
radical homosexual agenda in the military.
<p>
Robert Maginnis, FRC's Military Readiness Project director and
a retired Army lieutenant colonel, announced on Tuesday that the
4th Circuit which sits in Richmond, Virginia, approved FRC's motion
to make oral arguments in the case of Navy Lt. Paul G. Thomasson.
 <b>This is the first challenge to President Clinton's &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy expected to reach the Supreme Court
next year.</b>
<p>
Mr. Thomasson, who worked for the admiral administering &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; told his commander about his sexual orientation
days after the policy went into effect.  After the Navy moved
to discharge him, he challenged the policy in federal court and
lost.  
<p>
Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator and now representing
FRC, will argue that the White House and Pentagon failed to follow
a newly enacted law when writing the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;
policy.  The law, enacted by Congress and signed by President
Clinton, bars homosexuals from serving in the military.  But the
regulations allow homosexuals to serve as long as they keep their
orientation private.
<p>
Mrs. Wells-Petry explains, &quot;They're definitely trying to
do what I call 'the wink' in the regulations as opposed to a clear-cut
rule.  They're trying to put as a matter of policy, 'We're going
to wink at it until it becomes flagrant.'  In our view it's just
not a workable policy.&quot;
<p>
The Military Readiness Project has aggressively filed amicus briefs
in most homosexual military cases because, as Colonel Maginnis
says, &quot;The Clinton Administration is ignoring the law and
trying to erase centuries of prudent policy in favor of allowing
homosexuals to serve in the military.&quot; 
<p>
FRC's team will join a three-sided argument with the Justice Department
defending the regulations, Mr. Thomasson's attorney asking that
the law and the policy be ruled unconstitutional and the Military
Readiness Project defending the law.
<p>
In accepting FRC's motion for oral argument, the Court acknowledges
that there is &quot;extraordinary&quot; justification for a third
party to argue.  The extraordinary situation exists because neither
the government or Thomasson is addressing the right issue.

<center><h4>ANNOUNCING FRC'S NEW T.V. SHOW:</h4>
<p>
<h2><i>&quot;STRAIGHT TALK</i><br>
FROM THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council this month
launched a new one hour television program called, &quot;Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council,&quot; on National Empowerment
Television (NET), a cable Political NewsTalk Network. Every Wednesday
at 8 p.m., the show airs cutting edge news stories, fast-paced
discussions and commentary by President Gary Bauer, Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick, and guest appearances by FRC policy
analysts, members of Congress, and leaders of the pro-family movement.
<p>
The show includes many different segments, such as &quot;Behind
the Headlines,&quot; an insider's look at what is happening to
the family in Washington, and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; a highlight
of what FRC has been doing to bolster the family.
<p>
Each show tackles a single issue from many sides. Topics include:
what original FRC polling shows about Americans, welfare reform,
tainted sex research, and more. 
<p>
An exciting new venture for FRC, &quot;Straight Talk&quot; reaches
into more than 11 million homes. &quot;Our dream of providing
a pro-family voice is much bigger than merely building a conservative
'speed bump' in a vast terrain of liberal reporting,&quot; Gary
Bauer said. &quot;Our vision is to help a national audience understand
not only what we believe but why we support the kind of pro-family
reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is to make
a connection with even more of those millions of Americans who
go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world their
children are inheriting.&quot;
<p>
To learn whether your cable company carries NET: Check local listings
or call your cable carrier. If you have a satellite dish, NET
can be reached on Galaxy 7, Transponder 20. <B>Beginning December
1st, NET will change settings to Galaxy 6, Transponder 7.</B>
To obtain a listing of cities where the network currently operates,
or a postcard to be mailed to your local cable operator requesting
the network, call 1-800-225-4008.

<center><b>SENATE SENDS PARTIAL-BIRTH TO COMMITTEE:<br>
<font size=+2>IT'S A TIME FOR EDUCATION, SAYS BAUER<br>
<p>
<i>AND: MEDIA ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY HEARING.</i></font></b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Pro-family Americans support
the vote today because it allows more time to better educate the
Senators about this inhumane procedure,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer said Wednesday after the Senators
voted to recommit the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to the Senate
Judiciary Committee.  A hearing will be scheduled in committee
in the next nineteen days.
<p>
&quot;As we saw in the historic vote in the House, with members
on both side of the abortion issue voting for the ban, our representatives
acknowledged that there are limits to what can be done to the
unborn. A procedure that pulls a child into the birth canal so
that his or her brain tissue can be sucked out is blatantly unacceptable.&quot;
<p>
&quot;This ban will not affect women whose lives are in danger.
The bill is clear. And the additional time will allow the Senate
to fully consider what is being done to some children moments
before birth.&quot;
<p>
<b>MEDIA ADVISORY: FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
will testify 9:30 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, SD-342. TOPIC: The Family Privacy Act. The
bill would require the approval of at least one parent before
a minor could respond to surveys or questionnaires from federally
funded programs.</b>

<center><h2>FRC TESTIFIES IN FAVOR OF A<br>
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AMENDMENT</h2>
<p>
<b>HEARING AT 10 A.M. IN SENATE DIRKSEN - ROOM 226</b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> At a hearing today in the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy
Cleaver said the following in favor of a religious liberty amendment
to the Constitution:
<p>
&quot;The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the
religious 'neutrality' amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism,
but to promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment
in truth, to which every American is entitled.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>
<p>
<h2>KINSEY SEX STUDIES ARE TOPIC OF<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY BROADCAST</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
of this week, &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; a radio show reaching
over one million listeners with Dr. Dobson and guest Robert Knight,
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies, will discuss,
&quot;What happened to children in the sex studies conducted at
the Kinsey Institute on Indiana University's campus in the 1940's?&quot;
<p>
<I>The Children of Table 34, </I>a video that FRC released this
fall after three years of research and production, prompted the
broadcast. This video investigates the circumstances and people
involved in collecting the data that is revealed in Alfred C.
Kinsey's reports in 1948, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male
</I>and in 1953, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>. 
<p>
FRC has repeated attempts to confront the Kinsey Institute with
questions regarding this study.  Recent controversies surrounding
the study include the Institute's claim that the data gathered
for this report originated from one anonymous man. 
<p>
Knight, who wrote and directed FRC's video, said, &quot;Kinsey's
sex studies have been used as the scientific basis to justify
everything from condom distribution in schools to teaching children
how to masturbate. If indeed this influential data was gathered
by one man who molested children ages two months and up, something
must be done by the new Congress to examine this horrific, scientific
experiment and to change the course of sex education as we know
it today.&quot;

<center><h2><i>ROMER V. EVANS</i>: THE IMPACT OF A CLINTON PRESIDENCY?</h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- &quot;Today, pro-family Americans saw
a powerful repercussion of the Clinton Presidency,&quot; Family
Research Council attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Tuesday, following
oral arguments in the homosexual related case <I>Romer v. Evans</I>.
&quot;Justices Ginsberg and Breyer, Clinton appointees,  led the
charge against the people of Colorado in the Supreme Court hearing
on the contentious Amendment 2 case.&quot;
<P>
Wells-Petry filed a &quot;friend-of-the-court&quot; brief on behalf
of Family Research Council and attended the oral arguments. Her
involvement follows on the heels of FRC Director of Communications
Robert Knight who testified at the trial court level on behalf
of the people of Colorado's right to make a democratically agreed
upon statement about homosexuality.
<P>
In the brief before the Supreme Court, Wells-Petry argued that
to throw out Amendment 2 and overthrow the people of Colorado's
decision was to cut off democratic options, such as legal referendum,
and make homosexuality the law of the land. 
<P>
The Clinton administration appointees were clearly aggressive
in their questioning of the   people of Colorado, Wells-Petry
noted. She made the following statement:
<P>
&quot;The Clinton appointees used 80% of the air time during the
one-hour hearing.  They sat in super judgment of the people of
 Colorado, apparently undisturbed at the prospect of substituting
their judgment for that of the over 1,524,000 Colorodans who exercised
their constitutional right to vote on this issue.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Moreover, these two justices in particular seemed completely
unconcerned about the implications, both for the law and society,
of 'discovering' a new fundamental right that obviously was created
to award homosexuals special rights even though homosexuality
does not fall under established legal analyses of classes requiring
special protection.  In fact, in this very case the lower court
held that homosexuals are not a suspect class.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In short, during oral arguments before the high court, little
was said about the bizarre impact this case could have on the
democratic process.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We have seen the future of a Clinton court,&quot; Wells-Petry
said. &quot;This is another wake up call on the implications of
the presidency. How many justices will be nominated by the next
president?  It's time for a national conversation on whether Americans
want the right to vote on the laws of the land, or to allow liberal
judges to overrule democratic decisions.&quot;

<i><font size=6><b>ROMER v. EVANS</font></i><br>
<font size=5>&quot;The Case of the Decade&quot;</font></b>
<p>
<h2>MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUPREME COURT<br>
DECISION WOULD RESEMBLE <i>ROE v. WADE</i></h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- When the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments
for <I>Romer v. Evans </I>on October 10, it could be a historical
moment, as sweeping as <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.   Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry, a former Army major and author of <i>Exclusion: Homosexuals
and The Right To Serve</i>, has submitted a &quot;friend of the
court&quot; brief, and has noted that this decision mirrors <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> in that &quot;it would present the same risk for public
policy disaster by foreclosing political choice.&quot; 
<p>
When the court in Colorado struck down Amendment 2, it said that
homosexuality cannot be the subject of negative public regulation,
even regulation by omission.  
<p>
In her brief, Wells-Petry said that such a decision from the U.S.
Supreme Court would provide homosexuals with &quot;'easy money'
-- a new constitutional right -- with which to buy a result they
did not earn in the marketplace of ideas. This new right allows
homosexuals to circumvent the process of obtaining a consensus
for their ideas in that marketplace of ideas. It allows homosexuals
to insulate their ideas from that market's ebb and flow.  Indeed,
no matter what ideas homosexuals advance, people never can use
the ballot box affirmatively to reject those ideas.&quot; 
<p>
Wells-Petry warned the court that such a &quot;tremendous change
in the functioning of our democracy&quot; would have as severe
an impact on society as did <I>Roe</I>. &quot;The social, political,
and jurisprudential ramifications of the judicial overreaching
of <I>Roe</I> must not be repeated through the creation of a new
fundamental right in <I>Romer,</I>&quot; Wells-Petry stated.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight testified at
the trial in Colorado and said that a gay rights ordinance violates
the free speech clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
 The implications of this decision would be felt across society.
FRC  Policy Analyst retired Army Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis stated
that this decision would even affect the military and its policy.

<p>

While you and I were enjoying our Thanksgiving turkey, a
judge in California was busy putting Proposition 209 on the chopping
block.  Through Prop. 209, California voters dismantled the state's
system of racial preferences in hiring and college admissions.
The judge issued what's called a &quot;temporary restraining
order,&quot; keeping the racial spoils system in place for now.
He claimed that Prop. 209 probably violates the 14th amendment's
guarantee of equal protection.  But that's exactly what Prop.
209 <i>does</i> guarantee:  equal protection for all citizens
regardless of race or gender.

<p>

Now whatever you think of affirmative action itself, this
case is yet another example of judicial tyranny.  In Colorado,
it was a ban on special rights for homosexuals.  In Washington
state, a law against assisted suicide.  In each case, the courts
overturned the will of the people on a hotly contested issue.
The real question we must ask is:  how can self-government survive
as our courts shrink our liberty?  To answer that question is
to determine the fate of our republic.

<p>

After months of delay, Hollywood's television executives
have come up with a plan to protect your children from sex and
violence on the tube.  But don't celebrate yet..  Because, unfortunately,
the only thing it will protect is the big-time producers' ratings.

<p>

In essence, what Hollywood proposes is something like the
current movie rating system.  Each television show would carry
a simple code pegged to the age of the viewer that Hollywood considers
appropriate for each program.  Well!  I'm not impressed.  I just
don't trust Hollywood's opinion of its own product.  Most parents
want to know what a program actually contains.  Does it include
profanity?  Violence or nudity?  Homosexual characters and themes?
Parents want this information before they sit down to watch,
or let their children watch, a program.

<p>

Last spring, President Clinton met with television executives
to encourage them to come up with a system to safeguard families.
After so many months, Hollywood has responded with a dud.  This
is one premiere that deserves a swift cancellation.

<p>

For the Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with
today's Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call

<p>

The year's not over yet, but here's my award for most cynical:
Those liberals in Congress and out who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act.  &quot;It's years away,&quot; they said of homosexual
marriage. &quot;Nobody's legalizing this,&quot; they said.  Conservatives
are &quot;jumping the gun,&quot; they charged.

<p>

Guess what. Hawaii's Supreme Court has just ruled that gay marriage
is legal in the Aloha State.  Pro-gay Bill Clinton has been safely
re-elected.  And the same people who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act have forgotten everything they said just a few months
ago.  Then, Clinton's spokeswoman said he &quot;scorned&quot;
the Defense of Marriage bill -- even as he signed it. And the
press sure scorned it.

<p>

But events in Hawaii prove how timely, how important, how <I>needed</I> 
the Defense of Marriage Act was.  This fight is not over.
We will not give in.  The overwhelming majority of people in
America -- and in Hawaii itself -- <I>oppose</I> homosexual marriage.
The more people find out about it, the more strongly they want
to defend true marriage. Remember, what the radical homosexuals
really want is not marriage for them, but the <I>end</I> of marriage
for everyone.

<p>

The December chill has set in around the city of Washington.
With Congress out of town and President Clinton embarking on
a second term, the news hereabouts would typically be dominated
by the White House.  But it's been strangely silent at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave.  Maybe it's the President's bad case of laryngitis although
most people who know Bill Clinton say not even that can keep him
from talking.

<p>

Just think: a month ago, as the Presidential campaign was
in high gear, the White House was reportedly simmering with ideas.
There were new proposals every day to counter education decline
and domestic abuse.  With all of that energy and excitement, staffing
the President's Cabinet should be easy.  But instead the President
only in the last 24 hours has been able to make appointments of
new officials to take us across that bridge to the 21st century.

<p>

Maybe the White House will shake off these December doldrums,
but it may also be that Bill Clinton is undergoing the curse of
the second term.  During this century, second terms have been
notoriously full of failure, indecision and scandal. Will that
be Bill Clinton's fate, too?  Only time will tell.

<p>

Honor. It's the missing word in modern English.  Honor is
a respect for norms, for history and tradition.  Honor is courage
fused with a deep humility.  Above all, honor is profound honesty.

<p>

But honor today is in trouble.  Just how much trouble is
obvious in a news report about the Congressional Medal of Honor.
It seems that the company that manufactures this prized award
has been doing a little business on the side.  It has been selling
duplicate copies of the medal to whoever is willing to pay.  You
heard me right.  For seventy-five dollars, you're a Congressional
Medal of Honor winner. The Congressional Medal of Honor is rarely
given.  Only the most unusual acts of bravery and self-sacrifice
-- extraordinary valor they call it -- qualify.  The Medal is
sometimes given to a grieving widow, parents pierced to the heart,
a now fatherless child.  None of these things has a commercial
price.

<p>

Once in a while an event comes along that captures vividly
how far we've fallen.  The case of the bogus medals is one of
those events.  America needs to recover its sense of honor.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

This week, more disturbing news was unveiled about the problem
called Gulf War Syndrome.  If you haven't been following this
story in detail, it involves nearly one hundred thousand American
veterans of the war against Saddam Hussein.  These veterans are
experiencing a wide variety of ailments, including birth defects
among their children, and a dispute is raging over whether exposure
to Iraqi chemical weapons is to blame.  For six years now, our
government has dragged its feet about getting to the bottom of
this.  The latest word is that key documents central to this investigation
are missing.

<p>

I'm neither a military nor medical expert, but foot-dragging
and ineptitude on matters like this are unacceptable.  The Pentagon
should be seeking answers to the nagging questions about Gulf
War Syndrome with the same vigor that it prosecuted the fight
against Iraq.  These young men, and now women, who answered their
country's call were heroes and heroines overseas.  Now our government
is acting like they are only hypochondriacs.  They deserve better
-- much better.

<p>

You probably haven't heard of the basketball team from Mount
Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina, but chances
are you'll soon hear a lot about them.  Many sportswriters and
scouts are calling them possibly the best high school team ever
assembled.

<p>

That in itself is interesting, but this team of athletic
stars is &quot;best&quot; in another and deeper sense, too.  They
are a nucleus of young men brought together as much on the basis
of their dismal past as their bright future.  This Christian school,
led by Pastor Donald Fozard, committed itself long ago to using
basketball to reach boys' souls.  The kids Fozard has taken in
are a motley crew of ex drop-outs, &quot;fall-through-the cracks&quot;
young men.  At Mt. Zion, they experience school as a disciplined
environment.  There are runs at five in the morning, mandatory
church twice-a-week, team prayers.  They are not allowed to date,
swear, listen to rap music, or wear jewelry.

<p>

The focus at Mt. Zion is on character and on the long-term
future -- on right and wrong and on faith.  And that focus is
taking Mt. Zion straight to the top.

<p>

American families want to trust their government in matters
great and small, but sometimes it isn't easy.  As we found with
the recent controversy over air bags, federal officials knew more
about the hazards of these devices than they were willing to tell
us -- supposedly for our own good.  The same goes for Gulf War
syndrome -- the possible exposure of our Desert Storm soldiers
to chemical weapons.

<p>

There was shocking testimony on Capitol Hill this week. 
It now seems clear that military commanders failed to pursue findings
by their own trained personnel that chemical weapon exposure had
taken place.  The British defense ministry has now publicly apologized
for its failure to follow through on the issue too.

<p>

These incidents have a common thread -- a national nanny
government that thinks it must shape and limit what the people
know.  Maybe you've had a similar experience with public officials
-- with the IRS, or with some environmental rule.  Practices like
these create an unhealthy gap between citizen and government.
That just isn't America -- here you have to earn your trust.

<p>

He has been christened the &quot;butcher of Tienanmen Square,&quot;
and he visited Washington this week, where he was received with
full military honors.  The communist general I am referring to
is China's Minister of Defense --  the same man, the very same
man, who ordered Red Army Troops to crush the unarmed student
protest that captured the world's attention in 1989.  He was invited
to the United States by President Clinton, who came into office
campaigning for human-rights and who has reduced U.S. policy in
Asia to one vast trade mission.

<p>

While the general was getting the red-carpet treatment, the
European Parliament was giving its major human rights award, the
Sakharov prize, to a jailed Chinese dissident, Wei Jing-Sheng.
Mr. Wei's sister received the award on his behalf.  She used
the occasion to remind us that we have betrayed our principles.
We are supporting &quot;a gang of tyrants&quot; in Beijing, she
declared, because we are focused narrowly on &quot;the great Chinese
market of the future.&quot;

<p>

American policy now betrays American ideals.  This was a
week of shame in Washington.

<p>

Bill Clinton has gone on the warpath again, this time taking
aim at talk radio.  Appearing on a popular talk show, Clinton
denounced talk radio as &quot;overwhelmingly right wing,&quot;
and said it doesn't serve the country well.  Well, I'll concede
one point.  Talk radio can sometimes be crass and crude.  Some
hosts believe you have to offend to get an audience.

<p>

But someone needs to remind the president of something. 
It takes gall to denounce one of the few unstructured forums in
this country for political speech.  Like most politicians, Clinton
ran a tightly controlled, carefully scripted campaign this year.
Talk radio, on the other hand, at least reflects some genuine
give-and-take among average Americans.  Own a phone and you can
be part of the conversation.

<p>

America is a land of freedom, and millions of men and women
have shed blood to keep it that way.  The last thing today's citizens
want or need is a lecture from the just re-elected president of
the United States that their views shouldn't be aired.  After
all, isn't having our say the American way?

Outside the White House press room, there is a gallery of
famous drawings by Norman Rockwell.  Rockwell portrayed reporters
as a classic group of working stiffs, lovable Joe's just waiting
for the right story to come along.  Just how far that image of
the press has faded from the public mind is obvious in a new Harris
Poll.

<p>

By large margins, the poll found, Americans believe reporters
are, get your paper and pencil ready, politically biased, obnoxious,
negative, sensational, and inaccurate.  And if that isn't enough,
the public also believes that reporters have too much influence,
ignore people's privacy, overlook their own errors, show too much
violence, and don't much care about people.  This is hardly good
news for our free press.  The public has about as much faith in
them as it would in Attila the Hun.

<p>

And the Harris Poll also had some hot tips for reporters.
By similar majorities, Americans want the media to root out corruption
in office and to protect the public from abuses of power.  In
short, to be good citizens first.  Now it seems to me that isn't
too much to ask.

<p>

Today is Christmas Eve, and across the country airports and
highways are jammed.  People are heading home for the holidays,
hoping to make it in time for Christmas.  But today there are
tens of thousands of Americans who can only dream of those airports
and highways -- of those homecomings that matter so much.

<p>

Those are the men and women of our Armed Forces.  America
may be at peace, but still there are an incredible 237,000 American
soldiers scattered across the globe.  We're all aware of the contingent
in Bosnia, but the majority of our sons and daughters overseas
are elsewhere.  They are serving with NATO, manning submarines
under polar ice, sweating as military attaches in Africa, or guarding
the truce line in Korea.

<p>

We are not at war, but none of these soldiers serve in safety.
As the publisher of the <I>American Legion Magazine</I> pointed
out recently, the great irony is that the very status of our forces
as emissaries of peace makes them targets of war.  To these men
and women, we say, &quot;Merry Christmas, and may God bless you
and your families.&quot;

On Christmas Day, we celebrate what might be called the &quot;mundane
miracle.&quot;  It was the most ordinary of events:  the birth
of a baby.  But it was the most impossible of miracles, too: 
the incarnation of God Himself.

<p>

The birth of that baby split human history in two.  Nothing
will ever be the same on this earth.  On an infinitely smaller
scale, the birth of any baby has the same effect on human habits.
Having a child changes us.  Suddenly, the carefree single becomes
caregiving father or mother.  Issues that didn't matter before
suddenly matter a lot --- from personal safety, to what's on TV,
to pornography -- right on down to regular mealtimes.

<p>

Such is the power of a baby.  But today, as more and more
of us turn our back on the child born in Bethlehem, our backs
are turned on other babies, too.  Babies slain in the womb or
left in dumpsters with the other debris of our too-fast times.
How foolish we are to reject new life -- for what is Christmas,
but the eternal promise of new life in Christ?

<p>

The newspapers have been filled lately with all sorts of
stories about questionable political contributions from Asian
sources to President Clinton's reelection and legal defense funds.
The stories raise major issues that go to the integrity of our
political system, and they should be thoroughly investigated.
Unfortunately, there's a danger in all of this that Asian-Americans
as a whole will be falsely stigmatized.

<p>

That makes the story of Kingston Technology even more important.
John Tu and David Sun are business partners who lost $2,000,000
in the 1987 stock market plunge.  Tu is a Chinese immigrant. 
Rather than despair, he and Sun restarted their California-based
business with just $4,000.  Through hard work and ingenuity, they
rebuilt their company and turned it into an American success story.
They just sold the company for $1.5 billion.  And get this, they
are giving their employees an average bonus of $75,000.

<p>

That's some Christmas present -- and it's an even more poignant
reminder that it's not race, but ethics that count.

<p>

Have you heard the news out of Oakland, California?  In that
city, the school board has done something truly idiotic.  They
decided to designate the language of certain minority students
as a foreign language.  The term for this language is &quot;Ebonics,&quot;
but in fact Ebonics is nothing more than English spoken poorly.

<p>

By getting the language patterns of these urban kids established
as a foreign tongue, the school board hoped to take advantage
of bilingual education money.  You heard me right.  Naturally,
the school board's action caused a firestorm.  It's tempting to
joke that all of this is merely a semantic dispute.  These young
kids obviously need help in learning to speak, read, and write
standard English, so who cares where the money comes from?  But
something deeper is at work here.

<p>

This issue really concerns false presumptions about who can
learn.  The Oakland school board is selling its own black students
short.  By doing so, it is limiting their horizons and their job
prospects.  The word for that is &quot;sad&quot; -- in any language.

I get caught up in holiday shopping as much as anyone, and
I have the bills to prove it.  So naturally my talk today is about
how we make too much of material goods during this spiritual season.
But I have special reason to emphasize that theme.

<p>

Just before Christmas, we received one of those calls in
the night every parent dreads.  The phone rang with the news that
our daughters, Elyse and Sarah, had been in an accident on the
interstate 75 miles from our home.  They were returning from Elyse's
college, and it was a night of sleet and slick roads.  The car
had spun across the highway and been rear-ended. The car was
totaled, but fortunately, both girls' injuries were minor -- a
bad head bump and some whiplash.  But it came home quickly to
us how easily our girls could have been killed on that highway
home.

<p>

The heart of Christmas is the miracle of the child Jesus,
God becoming man.  That miracle was even more meaningful this
year at the Bauer house, all because of what did -- and didn't
-- happen on a dark and icy road.

<p>

During his presidency, Bill Clinton's Secret Service detail
has had a sometimes-stormy relationship with the public.  The
latest incident occurred at the National Cathedral on Christmas
Eve.

<p>

The Rev. Bob Schenck got close enough to Clinton to whisper,
&quot;God will hold you to account, Mr. President.&quot;  According
to Schenck, Clinton heard the remark and understood it as Schenck
meant it -- a reference to the Presidential veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban.  In any event, when the service was over, Secret
Service agents detained Schenck, rifling through his wallet. 
They denied him a lawyer, and told him Clinton had complained
about Schenck's words.

<p>

As I noted, this isn't the first time Secret Service agents
have made life unpleasant for people who dare speak to Clinton.
What Schenck reportedly said is hardly a threat.  In fact, every
one of us will be held accountable by God -- for what we've done,
or failed to do, to show mercy, or kindness, or love.  And on
that day of judgment, none of us will have Secret Service agents
at our side to shield us from the truth.

<p>

I'm a bit old-fashioned, so every New Year's I make resolutions.
Some are personal -- like remembering to walk the dog before
I turn in for the night.  But others are public.  Here at the
Family Reserch Council, we've made several resolutions for the
New Year.

<p>

First, we're resolved to make 1997 the year of pro-family
tax relief.  Family tax cuts are one of those things that everybody
supports, but nobody enacts.  It's time this nation invested as
much in human capital as it does in physical capital.  Second,
we're resolved to make 1997 a year of national awakening about
the need for judicial reform.  With pending  issues like assisted
suicide and same-sex marriage, there's no time to lose in restoring
legislative power to the American people.  Third, we're resolved
to launch a new youth program, that will help train the next generation
of young men and women in the Judeo-Christian world view.

<p>

Finally, we resolve to seek these goals with an attitude
of prayerful humility.  As we reach out to the better angels of
our neighbors, we must first renew our own better angels.

<p>

When a set of indicators is headed in one direction, while
a related indicator is headed the other way, society must take
notice.  That's the case today in the area of drug-related arrests
among juveniles.  Overall, the national crime rate is declining.
But arrests of young people for drug possession are soaring.
Just one example.  In Fairfax County, Virginia, where I live,
the arrest rate for juvenile drug possession has increased <I>sevenfold</I>
since 1991.

<p>

That number is appalling, not just for what it says about
drug use, but also about the conditions in which drug use thrives.
Police now estimate that there are roughly 25,000 gangs operating
in the United States.  All told, these gangs have 652,000 members.
They typically commit all sorts of crimes, but the drug trade
remains a keystone business for most of them.

<p>

Thomas Constantine, head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, calls this situation &quot;a ticking time bomb.&quot;
I agree.  You and I -- and every citizen -- must re-enlist in
the war against drugs.  If we fail, that bomb will go off in a
crowd of our children.

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
January 6, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Now here's some good news from America's inner city.  Picture
this.  In Baltimore, fifty-eight young boys arrive for school
at 7:15 am.  It's cold and dark outside.  But inside, the boys
get a warm greeting from a Catholic priest and the 31-year old
headmaster at Ignatius Academy.  Each boy shakes hands with the
two men.  It is a civilized ritual.  If their pronunciation is
wrong, it is corrected, but no one is demeaned.  Most of the fifty-eight
boys are black, a few are white or Hispanic.  Only eighteen are
Catholic.  But each boy knows he is a child of God.

<p>

The school operates on the assumption that it makes a 
difference when young children are taught
that Jesus loves them.  It costs five thousand dollars a year
to educate each boy, but that's far less than Baltimore spends
on its public school students.  Generous donors provide scholarships
for the boys and each boy writes a personal thank-you letter,
because they should.  There are no metal detectors here.

<p>

The donors, the parents and the teachers at this school are saving
Baltimore, one soul at a time.  I pray that 1997 will give us
more stories like this academy.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	Tax reform is gaining momentum. Lawmakers from both parties are proposing sweeping changes in the income tax system, such as the Armey-Shelby flat tax (the most widely known of the proposed reforms), a national sales tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, the Gephardt 10 percent tax, and a value-added tax.1 Almost every Republican presidential candidate endorses some form of radical tax reform, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) asked former Congressman and housing secretary Jack Kemp to chair a commission to recommend how best to reform the tax code. 
<p>
	 Each of the tax reform proposals assumes that the existing income tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul. But they achieve this in significantly different ways. The question is, which approach would be best for taxpayers and the economy?

<p>

	When evaluated based on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly, the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest.2 Direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. <p>	 Since no tax system is perfect, this grading scale is somewhat subjective:  A for reform as close to the ideal as possible,3 B for significant improvement over the current system, C for no significant effect one way or the other, D for a plan (or a feature of a plan) demonstrably worse than today's tax code, and F for significantly worse than today's tax code.<p>	In order to understand these grades, it is necessary to identify what is wrong with the current system and then to determine how each reform plan addresses each of these flaws.<p><b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM</b><p>	Today's tax code has few defenders. Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Shirley Peterson states that there is nothing logical about the way the code is constructed now.4 As House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt points out: <p><blockquote>	 It has become a test of legal brainpower, an accountant's decathlon, a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and buried tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives. The Internal Revenue Service has become a symbol of what is wrong with American government.5</blockquote><P>	And Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has summed up many of the problems with the current system, noting:<p><blockquote>	During much of the past century, tax policy has been a primary tool with which government has wielded power, fed the bureaucracy, an
d redistributed wealth.... Any fair system would not penalize, but instead reward people for working harder, investing wisely, and saving more. It would eliminate the lobbyist-drafted loopholes that benefit the few, but force the rest of us to pay.6</blockquote><p>	The current income tax system is both anti-growth and discriminatory. Its problems, while seemingly endless, fall into several broad categories:<p><b>High tax rates</b> -- Under present law, a successful entrepreneur will pay more than 40 cents of each additional dollar earned to the federal government. This burden can rise to over 50 cents when state income taxes are included and to more than 80 cents when estate taxes are added. These excessive rates penalize productive economic behavior and reduce incentives to work, create wealth, and take risks.
<p>
<b>Complexity</b> -- The large number of forms, regulations, and rulings forces many Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms. According to the Tax Foundation, annual compliance costs total nearly $200 billion (in addition to the taxes paid to Washington and the loss in economic growth caused by excessive rates).7<p><b>Multiple taxation</b> -- Some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, are subject to as many as four levels of tax. For example, a dollar of capital income could be subject to corporate income, personal income, capital gains, and estate taxes. This combined burden becomes confiscatory and undermines incentives to save and invest.<p><b>Social engineering</b>  -- Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties, and deductions. Some income is taxed more than once, while other income is not taxed at all. Such complexity is inevitable in a tax system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy while collecting large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code.
<p>


<b>THE COMPETING TAX PLANS</b>
<p>
	While there is widespread agreement on what is wrong with the tax system, there is considerable debate over which plan best solves these problems. The following are the key features of the major tax reform proposals currently under consideration:
<p>
<b>Armey/Shelby flat tax</b> -- Based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax, H.R. 2060 and S. 1050, sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), would replace the current personal and corporate income tax system with a simple 17 percent tax on all income. With the exception of a generous family allowance, all labor income is taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents) are withheld and paid at the business level. Both businesses and individuals would fill out postcard-sized returns. 
<p>
<b>National retail sales tax</b> -- This proposal would replace the personal and corporate income taxes with a sales tax. Many details remain unknown, such as what tax rate would be applied and what goods and services, if any, would be exempted. As of publication, there is no legislation to create a national sales tax, although Representatives Dan Schaefer (R-CO) and Billy Tauzin (R-LA) may introduce a bill shortly. 
<p>
<b>Value-added tax</b> -- This tax, known as the VAT, is similar to a national sales tax, except that it is levied on the additional value created at each stage of production. For example, instead of a 25 percent retail sales tax on purchases at a furniture store, the VAT would tax the logs as they go to the sawmill, the lumber as it goes to the furniture manufacturer, the furniture as it goes to the store, and the same furniture as it is sold to the consumer. The net effect, however, is the same:  a 25 percent tax on the value of the retail sale. There currently is no legislation to replace income taxes with a VAT, although House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) intends to introduce some type of direct consumption tax.
<p>
<b>Nunn/Domenici USA tax</b> -- Sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), the Unlimited Savings Account tax (S. 722) creates the equivalent of an unlimited Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and replaces the current rate structure with a three-rate structure that includes a top rate of 40 percent. Some deductions are lost or curtailed, and at least one new deduction is created. The corporate income tax is replaced by a VAT.
<p>
<b>Gephardt 10 percent tax</b> -- This plan, introduced by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO), broadens the tax base by eliminating such preferences as deductions for charitable contributions and state and local taxes and taxing the value of fringe benefits. The proposal also replaces the five current tax brackets with five new brackets ranging between 10 percent and 34 percent.
<p>
<b>Specter flat tax</b> -- Using the same model as the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), in S. 488, proposes a slightly higher rate and lower personal allowance in order to maintain limited deductions for charitable contributions and the full deduction for home mortgage interest.
<p>
	Other tax reform proposals are expected in coming months. Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) may introduce a version of the flat tax which presumably will have many of the same economic benefits as the Armey/Shelby legislation. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) is rumored to be preparing a tax reform bill, though no details are available and his decision to retire may alter those plans. Finally, as the tax reform debate heats up, the Administration might introduce its own plan. The President has said that he finds the flat tax appealing, and Chief of Staff Leon Panetta introduced flat tax legislation as a Member of Congress in 1983. The White House also has expressed interest in the value-added tax,8 although it is unlikely that the Administration would support a VAT as a replacement for the income tax.<p>	<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b><p>	While each reform has an overall grade, it is particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different tax plans reflect nine important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>
<b>Low Rates</b> 
<p>
	Low tax rates ensure that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b>A</b>
<p>
	The flat tax popularized by the House Majority Leader begins with a 20 percent rate that phases down to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Assuming a low rate and with income not taxed directly, the penalty on the creation of wealth would be minor.9<p>Value-added tax:  <b>A</b><p>	As with the national sales tax, a VAT with a low rate would have minimal impact on working, savings, and investment.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>D</b><P>	The top tax rate in the USA tax is 40 percent, even higher than in current law. To make matters worse, it applies to taxable incomes as low as $24,000 for a family of four.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Like the current system, the Minority Leader's plan has five separate rates. These rates are slightly lower than in current law, but the expansion of taxable income and the income levels at which the different rates apply offset this minor improvement.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	The Specter plan's low 20 percent flat rate would stimulate increased work, savings, and investment when compared with current law, although it could be even lower if the remaining deductions were scrapped.
<p>


<b>Simplicity </b>
<p>
	The current income tax has more than 400 different forms, requires more than one billion 1099 forms (tracking interest and dividend income), and necessitates more than five billion hours of effort each year.10 While individuals rightly complain about the costs of simply compiling information, calculating their taxes, and understanding forms, compliance costs for business are twice as high.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>	
<p>
	The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping would be greatly simplified by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Compliance costs for individuals would disappear, though retail businesses would bear an increased burden because they would be responsible for collecting the tax and complying with reporting requirements.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>
<p>
	Individual compliance costs would vanish, as would the daunting complexities of the corporate income tax, but businesses would have to maintain detailed records to calculate their share of tax liability as goods and services travel through the production process.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Since the burden of the corporate income tax is even worse than a VAT, compliance costs for business would fall under a USA tax. Individual compliance costs could rise relative to the current system, however, because of requirements for tracking deposits and withdrawals into the unlimited IRA.
<p>

Gephardt 10 percent tax: <b>C+</b>
<p>
	The corporate income tax remains the same, but many deductions for the personal income tax are eliminated. This would lead to slightly lower compliance costs for individuals.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of tracking home mortgage and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax, like the Armey/Shelby version, also significantly reduces compliance costs.
<p>


<b>Savings and Investment</b> 
<p>
	By double-taxing, triple-taxing, and sometimes even quadruple-taxing income from capital, the current system significantly hinders capital formation. This reduces the quality and quantity of machinery, equipment, and technology in the economy and lowers wages by reducing the amount workers can produce.
<p>

Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All income is taxed, but only subject to one level of tax. The current multiple taxation of capital income is eliminated. While this would boost savings and investment compared to current law, the effect would be to make the tax code neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging savings, investment, or consumption.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By not taxing income directly, the retail sales tax removes the bias in the existing system against savings and investment.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, the VAT addresses the capital formation problem by ending income taxation altogether.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b>B</b>
<p>
	While the USA tax eliminates the bias against savings and investment caused by multiple taxation by providing an unlimited IRA, it dampens incentives to save and invest by imposing sharply graduated rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<p>
	The Minority Leader's plan not only retains the existing anti-savings, anti-investment features of the current system, but also makes the tax code even more hostile to savings and investment by including provisions such as an increase in the tax rate on capital gains.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	As with all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model, there is no bias against capital formation. The continuation of certain deductions, particularly the mortgage interest deduction, does result in a mild distortion of market forces.11<p><b>Social Engineering</b><p>	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, everything from putting a child in daycare to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Particularly disturbing is the ability of special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<P>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	The only preference in the pure flat tax is a family allowance. Government would not attempt to steer economic decisions or try to penalize or reward different types of behavior.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Presuming it would apply equally to all goods and services, the retail sales tax would get government out of the business of micromanaging private decisions. There is a danger, of course, that politicians would impose higher rates on unpopular goods and services (tobacco, caviar, imports) while granting lower or zero rates to others (food, shelter, health care).
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, a pure VAT ends government favoritism and efforts to subsidize certain industries or activities. The same caveat -- the potential for discriminatory rates -- applies.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Some deductions are eliminated, but this is offset by the creation of new ones such as a deduction for educational expenses. The USA proposal, however, does end the current code's explicit penalties on savings and investment.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>B-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of the home mortgage interest deduction, special preferences in the tax code are eliminated. The Minority Leader's plan even taxes fringe benefits. Existing penalties on savings and investment, however, are made even worse by increasing the capital gains tax.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Except for continuing limited individual deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax takes government officials out of the business of picking winners and losers.
<p>


<b>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties </b>
<P>
	In part because of the code's numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection activities that many believe are abusive. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, would solve much of this problem. Because all tax systems ultimately are based on coercion, and thus are accompanied by police powers for the taxing authority, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize the scope and opportunity for intrusion.
<P>

Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b> A</b>
<p>
	By dramatically reducing the complexities of the current system, this plan would leave taxpayers with less reason to fear the IRS. For individual taxpayers, the only possible areas of controversy are the size of one's family and the amount of labor income earned (taxes on capital income are withheld and paid at the business level). Whatever problems remain -- including how the self-employed handle deductions, particularly if they work out of their homes -- would be a fraction of those that exist now.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Small businesses will not appreciate collecting taxes for the federal government, but the level of intrusion resulting from a properly designed sales tax is small compared with the current system. This is particularly true in states that already impose sales taxes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	In its pure form, the VAT should minimize most tax collection abuses. Businesses would need to maintain records, but the impositions on privacy would be small compared with the current system.12<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C</b>	<p>	Much of the current tax system is left in place. Moreover, the government will require detailed financial records from individuals who lower their tax burden by saving.<p>Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b><p>	Some deductions disappear, presumably reducing the potential for disputes with the IRS, but the multiple taxation of savings and investment becomes more pervasive, a step that will create more conflicts between citizens and tax authorities. The net effect is probably zero.
<P>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Simple and straightforward, the Specter flat tax should eliminate most abuses. Retention of certain limited deductions, however, requires record-keeping and creates opportunities for IRS intrusion into taxpayers' personal affairs.
<p>


<b>Fairness</b>
<P>
	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal treatment. Any special treatment, either preference or penalty, violates this principle. All taxpayers -- and all income -- should be treated equally.
<P>
	
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is taxed once. The only exemption is the zero bracket amount (personal allowance) based on family size.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	All taxpayers presumably will pay the same rate, and all goods and services presumably will be taxed. As with the flat tax, there probably will be some mechanism to eliminate any tax liability for those with low incomes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	Like the retail sales tax, the VAT theoretically should apply equally to all taxpayers and not discriminate by charging different rates. Also, there likely will be a process by which to offset the tax burden for the poor.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C-</b>
<p>
	Maintaining steeply graduated rates means that the law will not apply equally to all taxpayers. Government would continue to interfere with economic decisions by granting preferential treatment to certain activities. Also, the estate tax would remain, applying double taxation to the affected income.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<P>
	Like the USA tax, the Gephardt proposal includes steeply progressive rates that explicitly impose special penalties on certain citizens. Compounding this error is its exacerbation of the current code's multiple taxation of capital income. The only provision that precludes a failing grade is the elimination of some deductions.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<P>
	This proposal has all the fairness of the Armey plan, with the exception of modest deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.
<P>

<b>Downside Risk</b>
<p>
	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually attractive and would boost the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The long-term ability of each tax to retain these theoretical benefits must be considered.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>B</b>
<P>
	Just as lawmakers began raising rates after the 1986 tax reform act, future Congresses could undo a flat tax. One advantage of a pure flat tax, however, is that any changes would be obvious to voters. 
<p>
 The worst that could happen is that policy might drift back to where it is now, but a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority to raise tax rates would address this concern.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The great risk with a retail sales tax is that politicians might adopt a direct consumption tax, but never get around to abolishing the income tax. Also, if state experience is any indication, a sales tax might be manipulated so that some products are exempted while others are subjected to punitive rates. A constitutional amendment explicitly barring an income tax would solve this problem.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	All the risks inherent in a retail sales tax exist with a VAT. The European experience shows that it gives politicians an incentive to have both a direct consumption tax and an income tax.13 Moreover, the VAT is applied at arbitrary and uneven rates in most countries. As with the sales tax, a constitutional change could resolve this concern.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The USA proposal replaces the corporate income tax with a VAT. Therefore, concerns that the government might have two major revenue sources are not just theory, but reality. The risk also exists that the corporate income tax either would never be abolished or would be recreated.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	In a sense, there is not much downside risk with the Gephardt plan because the proposal is not an improvement over current law. On the plus side, the plan creates no new taxes and would require a referendum to increase taxes in the future.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby proposal, the Specter flat tax is haunted by the evidence since the 1986 tax reform act. Because the Specter version explicitly accepts the notion that policymakers should impose tax preferences because it preserves certain deductions, the risks are somewhat higher that the tax code could be skewed even further.
<p>

<b>Evasion </b>
<p>
	Support for any tax system and its long-term viability depends on how the law works. If there are opportunities for individuals to evade taxes -- and if enough of them take advantage of those opportunities -- the public will view the law as corrupt. Moreover, the loss of revenue will encourage politicians to raise rates on those who do comply with the law, thereby encouraging still more evasion. The downward spiral of higher rates followed by more evasion could be endless.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Because of its low rate, this tax provides minimal incentives for evasion. Moreover, by taxing business income at the source, it eliminates the need for more than one billion 1099 forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>D</b>
<p>
	The evidence suggests that retail sales taxes higher than about 10 percent are subject to widespread evasion.14 Indeed, almost every country with a VAT originally had a sales tax but changed once rates crept above that level because of problems with complexity and compliance.15<p>Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>	<p>	A VAT does allow the government to enforce much greater compliance than is possible under a sales tax because the tax is collected at each stage of the production process and there is no need to track whether a product is being sold at retail or wholesale.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b><p>	The high tax rates in the USA tax will increase incentives to use the underground economy. Moreover, because there will be no tax on income put into savings (and no taxes levied on funds withdrawn from savings), there could be incentives to find ways to manipulate this system.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Evasion is not likely to change significantly under the Minority Leader's plan. Eliminating certain deductions could reduce evasion opportunities, but increasing the multiple taxation of capital income will increase incentives to hide or underreport income.
<p>

Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Retaining limited deductions and taxing at a slightly higher rate could cause a modest reduction in compliance compared to a pure flat tax since there would be an opportunity to exaggerate deductions.
<p>


<b>International Competitiveness</b> 
<p>
	In a world where capital funds react quickly to changes in a nation's business climate, a tax system that rewards entrepreneurship will attract increased investment and job creation. A system that penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, by contrast, will suffer from capital flight. In addition to their effects on growth, international provisions in the current code are a major source of complexity. Unfortunately, as Chart 4 illustrates, America has undermined its ability to compete by raising tax rates while most of our competitors have been cutting tax rates.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By eliminating the multiple taxation of capital income, all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model will trigger a surge of new investment and jobs in the United States. By ending the complex practice of taxing American companies and individuals on their foreign income (already taxed in the country where it is earned), the flat tax model will lower compliance costs dramatically and encourage more U.S. firms to enter the global market.
<p>
National retail sales tax:   <b>A</b>
<p>
	Replacing the current, deeply flawed income tax with a direct consumption tax will boost international competitiveness, increase investment, and stimulate job creation. However, the benefits result from ending the income tax, not from imposing the sales tax. Some proponents argue that a sales tax would help the economy and the balance of trade, because it would be levied on goods and services coming into the country while exports would be exempt. This would not create a competitive advantage for America.16 Products sold in America, whether foreign-made or domestic, would be subject to the U.S. sales tax. Likewise, products sold in other countries, whether domestic or American-made, would be subject to applicable sales taxes or VATs in those countries.
<P>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	As with the retail sales tax, a VAT will attract foreign investment and encourage job creation. As noted above, these benefits do not flow automatically from a direct consumption tax. VATs and other sales-based taxes simply create level playing fields. Their benefits stem from elimination of the income tax.
<P>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby flat tax, the USA tax largely ends the complex practice of taxing businesses on income earned overseas. It also eliminates most multiple taxes on capital income, a reform that would encourage foreign investment. Unfortunately, some of these incentives would be offset by high marginal tax rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Because the current tax system penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, it is extremely destructive to international competitiveness. The Minority Leader's proposal might exacerbate this problem somewhat by expanding the multiple taxation of capital income.17<p>Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b><p>	With a low rate and no tax burden on foreign income because it already is taxed by the nation where it is earned, the Specter flat tax would boost growth and attract capital from overseas.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	The current income tax system demands comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many proposals have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax are the best. The flat tax replaces the current five-tiered punitive rate structure with a simple, fair 17 percent rate. The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping is replaced by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business. 
<p>
	 Direct consumption taxes like the retail sales tax and VAT theoretically achieve similar results, though such proposals also risk creating major new sources of tax revenue for the federal government. If these proposals were made contingent on enacting a constitutional amendment barring income taxes, this concern would disappear. Finally, plans that attempt to preserve features of the current system, such as the USA tax and the Gephardt 10 percent tax, fall short of the goal. By maintaining a discriminatory system of graduated rates, these plans fail the critical tests of growth, simplicity, and fairness.

 <li>   For example, a flat tax with a 10 percent rate is superior to a flat tax of 17 percent. Such a proposal, however, implicitly assumes a decline in the size of government that is not likely to occur in the near future. The Armey/Shelby flat tax earns high grades within the context of what is practical, at least in the short term.<p>

<li>    All taxes, including the sales tax and VAT, are paid out of income. The difference between these taxes and a flat tax is that the flat tax collects revenues when the income is earned, while direct consumption taxes collect the revenue when income is spent. Either way, a key to economic growth is keeping the rate as low as possible.<p>

 <li>   This does not imply that the flat tax, sales tax, or VAT have no negative impact on privacy or are free of government intrusion. These grades simply mean that the level of government snooping is smaller than the current system's and about as low as can be achieved given that government is forcibly extracting hundreds of billions of dollars out of the economy.<p>
