<title>Family Tax Credit Could Pay for College -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>TAX CREDIT COULD PAY FOR COLLEGE</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 20, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>	
<p>
	One of the reasons Washington has failed to pass a budget for 1996 is that President Clinton believes Congress has been too zealous in cutting government education programs.  
<p>What the president did not say -- and may not even know -- is that by opposing Congress's plan to give families a $500-per-child tax credit, he effectively denies millions of American families a greater financial opportunity to send their children to college.
<p>	That's right. The fact of the matter is that Congress's balanced budget plan is one of the most education-friendly bills in quite some time. And since the budget wrangling between Congress and the White House isn't over yet, there's still a good chance to save its most important benefits. Consider the following:
<p>	1.)  My colleagues at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> have calculated that if an average American family saved the entire $500-per-child tax credit for a period of 18 years, that family would be able to accumulate an amount of money equal to what $14,000 buys today. That's more than enough to pay the average cost of an education at a public university.  
<p>
	2.)  Heritage analysts also have shown that the $500-per-child tax credit would provide families that can't afford private education with enough money to pay nearly 25 percent of the tuition at a typical private elementary school. This would increase the number of parents able to send their children to private schools, just like so many members of Congress do today.  
<p> 3.) Congress's seven-year balanced budget plan would cause interest rates to drop by at least 0.5 percent below what they will be if current federal budget and tax policies are kept in place. This reduction in rates would save a student more than $400 on the cost of an average student loan. Four hundred dollars is enough to pay for a year's worth of books, two additional classes, or even a third of the cost of a personal computer.
<p>	These are all benefits President Clinton will deny American families and students if  he  forces Congress to abandon the $500-per-child tax credit. Why then does he continue to lambaste Congress for cutting spending on education? After all, Congress's balanced budget plan would cut less than 2 percent per year during the next seven years from a federal education budget that represents only a tiny fraction of the total spent on education across the country. In other words, President Clinton would deny 28 million American families the ability to pay tuition for their 51 million children to go to college -- rather than cut a tiny portion of a budget that itself is a tiny fraction of America's educational effort.
<p>	From the president's point of view, such cuts are "anti-education." But from the vantage point of the average American family, the picture is quite different. After all, which do you think eventually will have a greater positive impact on your child's education: Four years of college, or programs run by the U.S. Department of Education?
<p>
Think of what you could do for your children's education with an extra $500 per year. You could save more than enough to send each child to a solid public university for four years. You could afford to purchase an encyclopedia set, a personal computer, the services of a tutor or any number of other educational values. Congress is offering these to the American people, and President Clinton doesn't like it. Why? Because the choice would be left in your hands. Like his ill-fated health-care plan, he wants the key decisions to be made by the bureaucrats.
<p>	The question Washington faces is this: Is a good education policy one that expands the reach and control of federal programs, as President Clinton apparently believes? Or is it a policy that expands the choices available to American families so they can afford the cost of a private elementary school and send their children to college?
<p>	I submit two more points to consider before this choice is made:
<ul><p>
	<li>The money spent on public elementary and secondary education has increased more 
than 200 percent since 1960. Spending by the U.S. Department of Education has increased 634 percent since 1962. What has all this money done for our kids? Over the same period, average SAT scores have declined 73 points.
<p>
	<li> It is not surprising why more families are choosing private schools for their children. A private-school graduate is 52 percent more likely to apply to college than a public-school graduate. And an average college graduate earns a salary nearly 80 percent higher than that of the average high-school graduate. 
</ul><p>
	So, next time President Clinton claims Congress is trying to deny education to children, ask yourself: Who is more concerned about my child's education? The bureaucrats who get my money if the president has his way -- or the private school or college that gets it if I make the decisions myself? Can we, as a nation afford another three decades, or even seven years, of declining test scores, bureaucracy as usual, and an increasingly undereducated workforce? 
<p>	The time to return control of our children's education to American families is now. One way to do it is to stand by a budget plan that does just that.

<title>Not Just a Rich Man's Issue -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3><i>NOT JUST A RICH MAN'S ISSUE</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 20, 1995<br>

<p>
	For decades, lawmakers who really know what makes the economy grow have been trying to cut America's capital gains tax. After all, every other industrialized nation has recognized the economic folly of penalizing thrift, responsibility and success, and has cut their capital gains tax or eliminated it entirely. 
<p>	Congress's balanced-budget plan contains the most recent effort to cut the tax on capital gains. During the back-and-forth debate, President Clinton accused Congress of trying to "give a tax break to the rich." 
<p>	But this simply isn't true. Based on my analysis of 1991 tax returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal Revenue Service -- more than 50 percent of the benefits of cutting capital gains taxes would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income taxpayers. They could keep more of what they save and use their capital gains to pay educational, medical and other expenses. 
<p>	Sure, cutting the capital gains tax will benefit manufacturers, retailers and other employers -- those who provide Americans with jobs, and who also may be wealthy as a result of their success. This is all to the good, because the money these people don't pay in taxes will be invested in the economy and create more jobs instead of collecting mold in the pockets of federal bureaucrats. Businesses and households spend their money better than government: When was the last time you bought a $700 hammer?  
<p>	But the capital gains tax isn't just something corporate executives have to deal with. It's what gets slapped on your Uncle Joe when he sells his family business; on your retired grandparents when they sell that nest egg of General Motors stock they've been holding for 40 years; and on your parents when they sell their empty-nest home to live in an apartment. All these legitimate economic gains by middle-class American taxpayers -- many of them elderly -- shouldn't be accompanied by a huge tax bill from Uncle Sam. But they are. And it's not fair. 
<p>	Especially when those who argue against a capital gains tax cut fudge on the number of "rich" people who would benefit. Politicians -- including President Clinton -- commonly distort the numbers by counting the one-time capital gain your grandparents realize on the sale of their old house as if this indicated their normal income level. In other words, if they were collecting $30,000 a year from Social Security and made a one-time $30,000 capital gain from selling their house, they would be counted as a $60,000 a year household for purposes of arguing against cutting the capital gains tax!
<p> 	That's ludicrous. And it gives you an idea of the lengths some people will go to keep America from understanding what will happen when the government stops penalizing success. 
<p>	The truth is that each of America's leading private economic consulting firms -- including DRI/McGraw-Hill, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and Laurence H. Meyer & Associates -- has concluded that balancing the federal budget and cutting taxes at the same time, including the capital gains tax, would result in a stronger, more productive economy. This is precisely the plan President Clinton is opposing.
<p>	For example, one of the most widely respected models of the U.S. economy -- the University of Michigan Quarterly Model -- found that combining a balanced federal budget with tax cuts would produce immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing in long-term economic activity. When my colleagues and I at The Heritage Foundation conducted a similar study, we found not only that the economy would surge, but that most of the economic benefits hinged precisely on a cut in the capital gains tax. Without that cut, most of the benefits vanish.
<p>	 The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would cut in half the amount of money your parents are forced to pay the government when they try to collect their retirement nest egg. It would eliminate the tax liability of 3.5 million poor American families through a $500-per-child tax credit, so they wouldn't have to pay federal taxes at all, directly affecting the well-being of 8 million American children. And it would encourage a booming economy. Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, recently testified before Congress that just the "expectation" of a balanced budget had caused interest rates to drop two percentage points. 
<p>	But instead of admitting that Congress may have something here, and giving middle-class Americans a windfall of economic well-being, President Clinton wants to harp on the tired, class-warfare and envy rhetoric. He continues to present Congress's plan as "tax cuts for the rich." 
<p>	The facts do not support this view.

<h2>Block (Grant) Party</h2> 
<P>

<B>by <a href="http://badger.state.wi.us:/agencies/gov/gov_home.html">Tommy Thompson</a></B>
<P>
 What will the states do differently once they have block grants?
The short and simple answer: We will put our ideas to work. Once
a block-grant system becomes operational, several key areas of
public assistance will be set loose from the dead weight of federal
oversight.<p>
 For the most part, the block-grant system frees states
from the shackles of a waiver system that has inhibited innovation
and stymied true reform. Prior to recent congressional action,
if a state passed an innovative welfare reform initiative, it
would have to go to Washington on bended knee and kiss somebody's
ring in order to get a waiver to implement the program.<p>
 In Wisconsin,
we know the waiver system all too well. We have sought and received
227 different waivers to implement our innovative welfare programs.
And we know that you never get everything you ask for in a waiver
request, either. If your waiver asks for 10 items, you are lucky
if Washington grants you three.<p>
 In Wisconsin, the block-grant
system means we will be able to implement the most ambitious change
in the welfare system that this country has ever seen.  <p>
The changes
we expect to enact are called W-2, or Wisconsin Works. This initiative
would end the automatic welfare check. It would end AFDC. And
once implemented, W-2 will mark the greatest change in social
policy in this country in the past 50 years. <p>
In Wisconsin, we
will no longer have a welfare system; we will have a work system.
In fact, we have already transferred our welfare division from
our Department of Health and Human Services to our Department
of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations, and have made it a work
division. The reason: We are replacing the automatic welfare check
with a comprehensive package of work options, job training, health-care
and child-care services, and even financial planning.  <p>
And we
know W-2 will succeed in moving people off welfare and into the
workforce. Wisconsin has been reforming the welfare system longer
than any other state by far, having begun when I took office in
1987. Since then, our AFDC caseload has dropped 30 percent, and
we're saving our taxpayers $17 million a month.  <p>
Imagine what
Wisconsin and other states could do with the freedom and flexibility
provided by the block-grant system. <p>
In a recent study, Princeton
University professor Lawrence Mead concluded that Wisconsin cut
its welfare dependency because it tied benefits to work. W-2 is
based on the philosophy that for those who can work, only work
should pay. We assume that everybody is able to work-or at least
is able to contribute to society through some work activity within
their abilities. The only way to escape welfare or to escape poverty
is to work. There is no other way. Therefore, W-2 helps the traditional
welfare recipient make the transition to employment and an independent
life as quickly as possible. When people seek economic assistance
(or what used to be known as AFDC) from the state, they will be
required to sign up for work immediately. And it is only by performing
some level of work that they will receive economic assistance.<p>

W-2 consists of a four-rung job ladder designed to help participants
climb out of poverty and government dependence and into a life
of independence and self-reliance. The top rung is unsubsidized
employment. Under this option, participants who are job-ready
will be matched up with the best available job. This is the ideal
option-the rung on the ladder that all participants should aspire
to reach. A W-2 participant directed into unsubsidized work is
also eligible for, depending on his income, food stamps, health
care, child care, and the earned-income tax credit. <p>
The second
rung on the ladder is subsidized employment, or trial jobs. This
rung is for people without a work history but with a willing attitude.
Employers who hire people on this rung get help in offsetting
some of the costs of training and trying out a new employee. The
wage subsidy is limited to between three and six months. A person
in a trial job can remain on this rung of the ladder for no more
than 24 months and is eligible for food stamps, child care, health
care, and the earned- income tax credit. <p>
Community-service jobs
constitute the third rung and are meant for people who need to
practice the work habits and skills necessary to be hired by a
private business. These jobs will pay 75 percent of the minimum
wage (more than the welfare grant) and may come with food stamps,
child care, and health care. A person can remain in a community-service
job for up to nine months before being required to move up the
ladder, and there is a lifetime limit of 24 months for this rung.<p>

The fourth option, and bottom rung of the ladder, is called W-2
Transitions. This rung is reserved for those who legitimately
are unable to perform self-sustaining work, even in a community-service
job. To receive cash benefits, participants will work in activities
consistent with their abilities. Work at this level pays 70 percent
of minimum wage, and the worker is eligible for food stamps, health
care, and day care. Although this option has a 24-month participation
limit, extensions are permitted on a case-by-case basis. <p>
The goal
of this program is to move those with little or no work histories
up the work ladder, gaining more work experience, until they are
in an unsubsidized job and caring for their families on their
own. Participation is limited to five years over a person's lifetime.<p>

The benchmark for W-2's fairness is a comparison with low-income
families that work for a living. With this in mind, the program
includes a system of copayments for health-care and child-care
benefits. Just as low-income families must pay for child care
and health care-either in full or in part-W-2 participants will
be required to pay what they can afford for these services, on
a sliding scale. W-2 also would make health care more accessible
to low-income working families by allowing them to buy into the
state health-care system. <p>
Finally, Wisconsin Works is designed
to address the problem of teen pregnancy. In the past, too many
long-time welfare recipients started on welfare as teen parents.
We have to break the cycle of dependency earlier. So under our
plan, teen parents who are minors and who cannot live at home
or with a legal guardian will not be allowed to set up their own
household with cash assistance from the state. For those who cannot
live at home, three options will be available: Live in a foster
home, live in a group home, or, as a last resort for older teens,
live in a supervised independent setting.  <p>
The Wisconsin Works
welfare package has received bipartisan support in our legislature,
which is expected to approve the program early next year; we plan
to implement it in 1997. Without block grants, however, we would
need a series of waivers and probably would be unable to adopt
half of the program's initiatives. <p>
Another area that holds tremendous
promise for innovation under a block-grant system is Medicaid.
No item affects state budgets more profoundly than Medicaid, so
states will be looking for the most efficient and effective way
to provide high-quality health care at a reasonable cost. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we started improving our Medicaid system some time ago, but again
had to rely on a waiver system that scuttled some of our plans.
Regardless, industry experts have recognized Wisconsin for running
the country's most efficient Medicaid system. <p>
We began our reform
efforts using a managed-care system, which has allowed us to provide
more Medicaid recipients with a higher quality of care at lower
cost. Indeed, by enrolling AFDC recipients in health-maintenance
organizations, the state became an active player in controlling
costs. Instead of serving as a blank check, the state could step
in and negotiate the highest quality care at the best price. Instead
of serving as a health-care &quot;payor,&quot; the state is now
a health-care &quot;buyer.&quot; <p>
What is most exciting about the
program is that HMOs are providing AFDC recipients with better
health care. They have a primary doctor, someone they can go to
on a regular basis. They also have greater access to important
preventive care, such as well-baby visits and immunizations. <p>
While
Wisconsin is not alone in utilizing a managed-care system for
Medicaid recipients, the block-grant system will make it easier
for all states to shift to such a system.  <p>
As major buyers of
managed care, states will be able to leverage their purchasing
power to control costs as well as improve access and quality.
With the financial flexibility of block grants, many states also
will be able to extend this formidable purchasing power to offer
low-cost coverage to uninsured working families. Though managed
care, particularly for the elderly and disabled, requires careful
planning and vigilant oversight, it will be an essential component
of every new Medicaid program. <p>
States throughout this country
have been extraordinarily successful in enrolling nearly one-third
of all Medicaid recipients in managed-care organizations. But
progress has been frustrated by lengthy, time-consuming waivers
for arcane federal rules designed to impede managed care. In effect,
the current waiver process gives states a Hobson's choice: Either
accept the costly and burdensome new strings often attached to
federal waivers, or forgo altogether the use of managed care and
other modern delivery systems now common in the private sector.<p>

Besides managed care, the Medicaid block-grant system would allow
states to pursue integrated solutions in providing health care,
particularly long-term care for the elderly. <p>
Comprehensive service
networks are being created by the private sector from the inevitable
integration of health-care suppliers, particularly health plans,
hospitals, and clinics. While the federal government has been
oblivious to these historic changes, employers and other buyers
of health care are adapting to take full advantage. The block-grant
system will allow state Medicaid programs to take advantage as
well. <p>
Under the old Medicaid system, states were forced to take
a fragmented approach to health-care problems, most notably long-term
care. An incomprehensible layer of federal restrictions forced
states to create disparate programs in order to work around federal
obstacles. In the provision of long-term care, the result was
a confusing, overly complex and costly mix of home, community,
and institutional care. <p>
The new Medigrant program, however, will
permit states to integrate their long-term care programs and promote
the purchase of private long-term care insurance. By combining
the array of home, community, and institutional programs into
more integrated solutions based on managed care, the elderly and
disabled will have more options and taxpayers' costs will be better
controlled. Integrated solutions also provide states with greater
leverage to improve access to health care as well as the quality
of care. <p>
A third advantage to the block-grant system is that it
would allow states to make Medicaid coverage more sensible. As
an entitlement under federal law, the scope of Medicaid coverage
is now determined by the courts and rule-making bureaucrats. Neither
the medical community nor the taxpayers have any real say in the
matter. This has led to such absurdities as the coverage of gourmet
cookies, soap, and household appliances. This has long frustrated
the states as they've struggled to manage their systems. <p>
Freed
from federal oversight, we'll likely see the end to Medicaid as
the Cadillac of health plans and the eventual adoption of coverage
more akin to that offered to workers in private industry. While
coverage for the elderly and disabled will continue to include
additional services, particularly long-term care, the end of the
legal entitlement will permit states to take into account true
medical needs and the cost-effectiveness of alternative services.<p>

Finally, the Medicaid block-grant system will lead to streamlined
administration, which will save taxpayer money. As a result of
an avalanche of federal mandates, Medicaid has become the most
complex social program ever devised. The Medicaid program is now
governed by more than 50,000 pages of federal-state agreements,
more than 2,000 pages of federal laws, and some 15,000 pages of
federal rules and instructions. This extraordinary level of complexity
makes the federal tax code look like a nursery rhyme. <p>
Furthermore,
states must collectively prepare more than 8,000 federally mandated
reports each year. Most of these are never read, much less used,
by a living soul. Because of the labyrinth of federal eligibility
rules, there are more than 200 different ways to qualify for Medicaid
in Wisconsin alone. Making matters worse, federal loopholes force
states to cover middle-class individuals and facilitate the hiding
of assets and income. <p>
Under the 170-page Medigrant bill, state
Medicaid plans could be vastly simplified, thousands of pages
of inane federal rules would be rescinded and those 8,000 reports
would be reduced to just 50-one for each state. States like Wisconsin
will be able to streamline eligibility determinations, close loopholes
and tie Medicaid coverage to participation in jobs programs like
W-2. And accountability will be enforced where it truly matters-in
the establishment of fiscal controls, independent audits and evaluations,
and public reporting of program performance. <p>
Medicaid will be
an area where states will clearly be able to demonstrate a greater
ability to manage an unwieldy program and provide services better
than Washington. And it will serve as an example of what can be
accomplished once Washington steps back and keeps its overregulating
fingers out of the mix. <p>
The block-grant system will provide states
with a remarkable opportunity to enact their best ideas and brightest
programs. The ultimate winner will be the taxpayer, who will receive
a higher quality product at a lower cost. Already, with the limited
amount of experimentation the federal government has allowed,
states have shown that they can manage complex programs like welfare
and Medicaid much better than the federal government. The very
concept of federal block grants shows that Congress is recognizing
the great work that is already being done by the states. <p>
In Wisconsin,
we can't wait to carry on that work and put our best ideas into
practice.

<h2>Humble Clovis Defies The Education Visigoths</h2>
<P>
<B>by Christopher Garcia</B>
<P>
 In 507 a.d., at Vouill&eacute; in present-day France, the King
of the Franks led a band of warriors against the Visigoths, the
marauding barbarians who had sacked Rome a century earlier. The
king, named Clovis, defeated the Visigoths and broke their hold
on Europe.<p>
 Today, a modern namesake-the Clovis Unified School
District (CUSD), in Fresno, California-is successfully defying
another ominous empire: the education establishment. Despite serving
a significant portion of Fresno's urban poor, Clovis is proving
that public schools can deliver a good education with a small
budget and minimal bureaucracy.<p>
 Clovis has long ignored the prevailing
cant about the need for high spending and huge bureaucratic machinery
to regulate public education. During the 1993-94 school year,
CUSD spent $3,892 per pupil; school districts nationwide averaged
$5,730. The district's student-to-administrator ratio is 520:1-nearly
twice the national average. And although similarly sized districts
(like those in Rochester, New York, and Madison, Wisconsin) typically
house 300 to 400 employees in their central offices, CUSD employs
just 167. With no teachers union or Parent Teachers Association
(PTA), CUSD is a rarity among public schools.  <p>
In this case, less
means more-more students performing above average across a broad
range of measures. The district's average score on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) is 52 points higher than the state average
and 42 points higher than the national average. CUSD's mean composite
score on the American College Test (ACT) stands respectably at
the 65th percentile. In 1995, with a senior cohort of 1,606, CUSD
students passed 720 Advanced Placement (AP) exams. <p>
Perhaps one
reason Clovis kids outperform their peers is that they show up
for class more often: The district's high-school attendance rate
is nearly 95 percent, and its drop-out rate is only 4 percent.
The district doesn't skimp on its extracurricular offerings, either.
More than 80 percent of Clovis students participate in one of
the most successful programs in California. Last year, the district
earned a championship at the National Future Farmers of America
Convention and sent its state-champion Odyssey of the Mind team
to compete in the world finals. <p>
Many Clovis children are among
the most disadvantaged in the region. Nearly 40 percent of the
district's students live in Fresno City. Six of CUSD's elementary
schools enroll enough AFDC children to qualify for direct financial
assistance from the federal government. And five schools have
student bodies with more than 50 percent minorities. In 1989,
the median household income of the community surrounding Pinedale
Elementary School was $10,000 below the national median of $28,906.
And yet Mexican-Americans, who make up the district's largest
minority (about 18 percent of all students), outperform their
state and national counterparts on the ACT by significant margins.<p>

Created in 1960 from the merger of seven rural, low-income school
districts, CUSD presented its first superintendent, Floyd V. Buchanan,
with a significant challenge: Barely more than one in three of
the district's 1,843 students performed at grade level. Buchanan
wanted to push this figure to 90 percent-but how? <p>
Put simply:
competition, control, and consequences. Buchanan reasoned that
schools would not be spurred to meet the goals that he and the
central administration set for them unless they competed against
one another in academic and extracurricular achievement. He established
goals for each of the system's 11 schools at the start of the
year, ranked them according to their performance at year's end,
and established a system of carrots and sticks (mostly carrots).<p>

Most importantly, administrators and teachers were allowed to
choose the teaching methods and curricula they felt suited their
objectives. This formula, in place for decades, has allowed the
district-now with 30 schools and 28,000 students-to place between
70 and 90 percent of its students at grade level. <p>
Competition
in the district exists at several levels. Earning a rating as
a top school is its own reward, but the district recognizes high
achievement in other ways. The top schools on the elementary,
intermediate, and high-school levels are recognized at an annual,
districtwide award ceremony. The district's best teachers and
administrators are honored at a dinner. And the school's achievements
are reported to parents and the community in the pages of the
district's publications.  <p>
The friendly, competitive culture at
Clovis clearly has helped drive achievement. Because a school's
performance at a districtwide choral competition or drama fair
influences its ratings, teachers, students, and administrators
work hard to give their routines the extra edge needed to push
ahead of their colleagues. Schools borrow the winning strategies
used elsewhere. Students at Clovis West High School, for example,
often score better on SATs and AP exams than those at Clovis High
School, so Clovis High has borrowed test-preparation tips from
Clovis West. Clovis High is also trying to improve discipline
by looking at successful techniques employed at Buchanan High.<p>

Competition, however, would produce little without local decision-making.
Anticipating trends that would revolutionize America's Fortune
500 companies, Buchanan made flexible, decentralized, site-based
management a fundamental feature of the school system in 1972.
The district office has been responsible for setting goals and
establishing guidelines, but schools have worked to meet these
goals in their own ways. &quot;They give us the what and we figure
out the how,&quot; says Kevin Peterson, the principal of Tarpey
Elementary School.<p>
When officials at Pinedale Elementary School
determined that parent participation there was lower than at other
schools, for example, they realized that immigrant parents felt
locked out by language barriers. So they created &quot;family
nights&quot; to help these parents take part in their children's
education. With their children present, the parents are taught
games and devices they can use at home to help their children
with their homework. The result: Immigrant parents now participate
more. Such innovation is easier in the absence of teacher unions.
For example, the district deploys teachers weekly to the homes
of about 100 recently arrived immigrants to provide them English-language
instruction and to help them build a bridge to their rapidly assimilating
children. Meredith Ekwall, a first-grade teacher at Weldon Elementary
School, teaches English at night to the parents of her ESL students
to encourage English use in the home. In districts where collective-bargaining
agreements stipulate precisely how much time teachers spend teaching,
micromanage the amount of time teachers can devote to activities
outside of the classroom, and dictate what a district can and
cannot ask its teachers to do, such flexibility and voluntarism
is rare.<p>
Along with teacher autonomy and greater parent access,
Clovis strives for accountability. All the teachers, without exception,
are expected to bring 90 percent of their students up to grade
level. If they do not, everyone knows about it. The district's
research and evaluation division notifies teachers, parents, and
administrators of school and student performance. And with curriculum
development and teacher hiring and firing in the schools' hands,
knowledge is power. The approach has &quot;made every teacher
accountable,&quot; says Redbank Elementary School Principal Susan
VanDoren. &quot;[I]t made me sit down and look at all those kids
[needing help] and ask, 'What can we do?'&quot; <p>
Parents seem more
likely to ask that question in Clovis than in other school districts.
Parents and other community members (including the clergy, senior
citizens, and businessmen) sit on advisory boards, where they
review individual school performance and formulate policy. Last
year, some parents were upset that children were required to read
feminist author Maya Angelou's <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</I>.
Parents forged an agreement with the district that allows them
to review books assigned to their children and help develop alternatives.
Other boards recently voted to institute a voluntary uniform and
a fee-based home-to-school transportation program. Teams of parents
issue critiques of schools on the basis of data culled from parent
surveys; these reviews are posted in every staff room in the district.<p>

These boards function the way PTAs are meant to, but without the
stifling hand of teacher-union influence. &quot;The reason for
the success of Clovis,&quot; says Superintendent Walter Buster,
&quot;is that these schools are truly governed by elected lay
people.&quot; <p>
Ultimately, it seems, success in CUSD is driven
by community expectations. &quot;There's a corporate culture that
has been established that requires more of people, expects of
people more, and gets of people more,&quot; says H.P. Spees, executive
director of Fresno-Madeira Youth for Christ and member of CUSD's
clergy advisory council. <p>
This culture of expectation is impressed
upon teachers even before they pick up a piece of chalk. A lengthy,
multi-tiered interview process incorporates parents, teachers,
community leaders, principals, and administrators and signals
to prospective teachers that the Clovis community demands much
of its teachers. According to Ginger Thomas, the principal of
Temprance-Kutner Elementary School, some teacher candidates quit
the interview process, saying &quot;you guys work too hard.&quot;
Assistant superintendent Jon Sharpe contends that Clovis sustains
&quot;a work ethic in the public sector that's almost unsurpassed.&quot;
He may be right: In 1992, CUSD teachers even voted down their
own pay raise to channel the money into books and supplies. <p>
In
an education system under assault for its academic failures, Clovis
has produced a winning formula. CUSD schools have won recognition
by the state of California 15 times and earned national blue ribbons
from the U.S. Department of Education 13 times. The prestigious
Phi Delta Kappa Center for Evaluation, Development, and Research
has featured Clovis in two works, <I>Clovis California Schools:
A Measure of Excellence</I> and <I>Total Quality Education</I>.
Even outspoken critics of public education recognize the district's
accomplishments. &quot;If we are going to limit ourselves to the
Prussian system of education, Clovis is the best we are going
to get in a tax-financed school,&quot; says Marshall Fritz, the
founder of the Fresno-based Separation of School and State Alliance
and the father of four Clovis students. <p>
Awards aside, the real
lesson of Clovis is that good education depends not on bloated
budgets but on creative and committed teachers and administrators
held accountable by engaged communities. Clovis's success also
suggests that quality in public education will not be the norm
until resources are channeled to classrooms rather than bureaucrats,
and parents wrest control over education from teachers unions.

Michigan had no public-school teacher strikes

Under legislation signed last March by Governor John Engler, school
teachers are now fined a day's pay for each day they strike and

Montana earned $13 million from timber harvests on state-owned

down 12 times as many trees, the U.S. Forest Service lost $42
million in its Montana properties. Don Leal of the Political Economy

in better reforestation practices, spacing trees further apart
so that each tree receives more water and nutrients, and by using
less than one-third the staff to prepare timber sales. <p>
Since Cincinnati,

eligible, 97 have chosen them since their introduction last March.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This is untrue.
<p><ul>
<li> The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.
<p>
<li> When past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is an astonishing 13 years.
<p>
<li> Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than three quarters will spend over five years on AFDC.
</ul><p>
The current liberal system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, "poverty" is harmful for children, and welfare, by allegedly reducing poverty, will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not assist children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastatingly negative effect on children's development. It is welfare dependence, rather than poverty, which has the most negative effect on children.
<P><ul>
<li> Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. 
<p>
<li> Welfare receipt as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower will be the boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income. 
<p>
<li> Receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
</ul><p>	
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult. 
<p>
The House and Senate will soon pass welfare reform legislation based on three key principles: 
<p>
1)  Reducing the growth of illegitimacy; 
<p>
2)  Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and 
<p>
3)  Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending. 
<p>
The public strongly supports the key provisions of the congressional reforms. According to recent polls:
<p><ul>
<li> By a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent, Americans support a "family cap."  Eighty-four percent "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."
<p>
<li> Three out of four Americans believe welfare encourages illegitimacy. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
<li> Still, nine out of ten Americans feel that welfare recipients should have "to work for their benefits."  However, they feel overwhelmingly that work requirements should be imposed on welfare mothers with older children before they are imposed on mothers with pre-school children.
</ul><p>


<b>THE PATTERN OF DEPENDENCE: LENGTH OF TIME ON WELFARE</b>
<p>
The public is often told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. According to this picture, AFDC generally provides temporary aid, and very few recipients receive welfare for extended periods. This picture is inaccurate. 
<p>
Of the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, most will be dependent on welfare for very long periods of time. As Chart 1 shows, families receiving AFDC at the present time have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years enrolled in AFDC.<sup>1</sup>  When past receipt and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC among those families currently receiving AFDC benefits is an astounding 13 years.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, these figures actually underestimate the length of welfare dependence, since such families are very likely to receive other welfare benefits (such as food stamps, SSI, Medicaid, and housing) even after they leave the AFDC caseload.
<p>
As Chart 2 shows, among those families currently receiving AFDC, 72 percent have already spent over two years on AFDC, and nearly half have already spent over five years on AFDC. 
<p>
Looking into the future and making projections based on the historical patterns of AFDC receipt, it is clear that among the 4.7 million families currently on AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. And more than three quarters of current AFDC families will spend over five years on the AFDC caseload.
<p>
Long-term welfare dependence is most common among women who have children out of wedlock. Never-married mothers, in general, remain on AFDC twice as long as divorced mothers.
<p>

<b>DOES WELFARE BENEFIT CHILDREN?</b>
<p>
The current debate over welfare reform involves conflicting visions of society and the impact of welfare on human behavior. Real reform will not be achieved until specific core assumptions which form the foundation of the modern welfare state have been overturned and discarded. From its onset, the liberal welfare state has been founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:
<p>
<b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.
<p>
<b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Therefore, welfare is good for kids.
<p>
From this logic has sprung a relentless thirty-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The current proposal from Congress to slow down the automatic growth of welfare spending violates these cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system and thus has led to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment.
<p>
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of an increasing number of young Americans.
<p>
It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually. The first is that raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children. The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that "poverty" causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.
<p>
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values which are key to the child's success.
<p>
The second flawed liberal premise is that it is very easy to raise family income through welfare. This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.
<p>
This is borne out by experimental evidence. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80.<sup>4</sup>  The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs:  Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment.
<p>
The third liberal tenet is that higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life. In certain limited cases, such as when welfare is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives. While higher welfare payments and spending do not benefit children directly, they do increase dependence and illegitimacy, both of which have devastating negative effects on child well-being. Thus, overall, welfare operates as a system of organized, well-funded child abuse. 
<p>
The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, recently published research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high benefit states.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>6</sup>  Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children.
<p>
Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
O'Neill and Hill conclude:
<p><bq>
	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states.<sup>8</sup>
</bq><p>
A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher <i>non-welfare income</i> obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25).<sup>9</sup>  However, <i>welfare income</i> had the opposite effect:  The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing, up the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.
<p>
A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.
<p>
Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women who are raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare.<sup>11</sup>  Similarly, single mothers who were raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers who were not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
Boys raised in single-parent households receiving public housing aid are more than five times more likely to engage in criminal activity than are boys who are not raised in such conditions. Young girls raised in single-parent homes in public housing are roughly five times more likely to bear children out of wedlock themselves than are girls who are not raised in such conditions.<sup>13</sup>  In short, welfare usually operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful will be the child as an adult.
<p>
In attacking the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, the Clinton Administration has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Administration's report on welfare makes clear its belief that rapid automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
The Administration report is founded unequivocally on the failed hypothesis that combating "poverty" through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy which, in turn, have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed, not (as the Clinton Administration does) at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's plan.
<p>

<b>PUBLIC SUPPORTS CONGRESSIONAL WELFARE REFORM</b>
<p>
By overwhelming margins, the public supports the principal elements of the welfare reform passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, according to a poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Bethesda-based polling firm, for the Family Research Council in mid-October 1995.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
For example, by a margin of 84 percent to 13 percent Americans support the family cap. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock."
<p>
In contrast to proposals by President Clinton, the welfare reforms agreed to in the House/Senate conference will contain modest but real steps to reduce illegitimacy. Three out of four of those polled agreed that the current welfare system makes it easier for women to choose to have children out of wedlock. By a ratio of two to one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important goal in welfare reform than attempting merely to make single mothers self-sufficient.
<p>
However, the public still believes overwhelmingly that welfare recipients should be required to work. Ninety percent of those polled stated that "recipients of government welfare programs should have to work for their benefits."
<p>
Since it would be difficult to require all welfare recipients to work immediately, the reform bills passed in the House and Senate urge states to impose work requirements on the most employable recipients first. Specifically, the bills urge states to focus work requirements on fathers in two-parent families and single mothers without pre-school children before requiring work of single mothers with pre-school children. (Roughly half of AFDC families have no children under age five in the household.) The public agrees overwhelmingly with these work priorities. Eighty-eight percent of the public feels that work should be required of fathers and mothers of school-age children before it is required of mothers caring for pre-school children.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The welfare reform legislation which will be approved by the House/Senate conference proposes a reform of the current welfare system based on three central themes:
<p>
<b>Reducing the growth of illegitimacy;
<p>
Reducing dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
<p>
Limiting the explosive growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
Among the many elements of reform in the legislation, seven are crucial:
<p>
1) The bill will end the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC spending. Under the legislation, states which increase their welfare caseloads will no longer be rewarded by an automatic increase in federal funding. This change imposes a fundamental fiscal discipline at the state level which is essential to real reform.
<p>
2) The bill establishes a family cap. Under the bill, mothers already enrolled in AFDC will not receive an automatic increase in federal welfare benefits if they give birth to an additional child while on welfare. (However, states will be permitted to enact legislation to "opt out" of this requirement.)
<p>
3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states which reduce out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
<p>
4) The bill provides $75 million per year in funding for a new block grant for abstinence education.
<p>
5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill establishes serious work requirements for welfare recipients. Under the bill, up to 40 percent of the AFDC caseload will be required to work or become self-sufficient by the year 2002.
<p>
6) In contrast to all previous "work" requirements, in the AFDC program, the work requirements in the proposed legislation are real. Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a "pay after performance" rule. Recipients will not receive benefits until the required work has been performed satisfactorily. If the recipient fails to perform the required hours of work, benefits will be reduced pro-rata.
<p>
7) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of "workfare" is to reduce welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to maximize the number of welfare recipients in "make work" public service jobs. It recognizes that the best road to self-sufficiency is to reduce the number of persons who become dependent and get "hooked" on welfare in the first place. In contrast to President Clinton's plan, which rewards states for expanding "welfare addiction," the approach in Congress for the first time focuses on rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who get "hooked" on welfare in the first place.
<p>
Overall, the proposed legislation represents a significant and badly needed first step in overhauling a bloated and destructive welfare system. The proposed reforms will be of great benefit to society, the taxpayers, and, most important, welfare recipients themselves.

<B>LETTER TO OUR READERS</B><HR>



<h2>Welcome to <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2><br>

by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a><p>

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></b><br>

<i>January-February 1996, Number 75</i></center>

<p>

	<i>Policy Review</i>, the magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<p>	Our new name is <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>. We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will focus on the institutions of civil society -- families, communities, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments -- that are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized, bureaucratic government.


<p>	We think of our mission as "Applied Tocqueville," in honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832 wrote <i>Democracy in America</i>, still the best book about our country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their communities. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders today who are carrying on this tradition.
<p>

	We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities. Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<p>	Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments, and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed liberal programs.
<p> 	The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable than government.
<p>	Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<p>	Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and behaviors.
<p>	The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. America is about to enter another such age, with conservatives at the lead. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will be at the forefront of this movement, chronicling its success stories and describing its challenges and opportunities.
<p>
<center><b>An Invitation to Liberals</b></center><hr width=50%>

<p>
	We hope many liberals and centrists will join us in this adventure. Liberals who have learned from their mistakes of recent decades have a great deal of practical wisdom to offer conservatives who are trying to replace the welfare state. And conservatives will be most effective in the coming era of institution-building if we can harness the energy, idealism, imagination, and intelligence of liberals in our cause. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> hopes to be a bridge between conservatives and liberals who are trying to renew the American experiment in self-government.

<p>
	At the same time, we will make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of civil society. Unlike liberals, who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives follow Tocqueville in seeing religious fervor as one of the most powerful forces for strengthening and sustaining civil society. We expect that many of the great institutions that will emerge over the next generation will be founded by churches, synagogues, mosques, and ecumenical associations of people of faith. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will feature a department, "One Nation Under God," that will describe how religious institutions are repairing America's social fabric. 
<P>	We also see business as an essential ally of the citizenship movement. Liberals see nonprofit associations as morally superior to profitmaking businesses. Conservatives, by contrast, hold that the marketplace offers accountability and incentives for performance that are frequently missing from the nonprofit world. The most creative answers to social problems often come from businesses that can profit by solving them. A new column, "Blessings of Liberty," will show the contributions of economic freedom and marketplace competition to the regeneration of civil society.
<P>	Liberals who claim they want to promote civil society frequently use government regulation and judicial decisions to achieve the opposite. The Declaration of Independence accused King George III of a "long train of abuses and usurpations" that denied Americans their fundamental liberties. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will include a department, "Abuses and Usurpations," that will detail how federal and state executive branches, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions.  

<p>
	One of our most important departments, "Home Front," will provide news and information about organizations that are working to rebuild the family. While many liberals are belatedly recognizing the importance of strong families, liberal organizations such as the Children's Defense Fund still concentrate on securing government funds for single mothers and the social workers who serve them. Conservatives hold that children need loving families more than they need government money, and "Home Front" will profile the organizations that are doing the most to promote responsible parenthood.
<p>

	Many other conservative organizations have dedicated themselves to advancing civil society. The Capital Research Center, the Manhattan Institute and its magazine <i>City Journal</i>, the <a href="http://www.acton.org">Acton Institute</a>, the Philanthropy Roundtable, the Hudson Institute, the Reason Foundation, World magazine, the Institute for Contemporary Studies, the New Citizenship Project, <i>American Enterprise</i> magazine, the Civil Society Project, Focus on the Family, the <a href="/pff/">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> are just a few of the organizations doing outstanding work in this area. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will report on their work, publish articles by their researchers, announce their upcoming conferences. Our goal is to build the American Citizenship movement into one of the most significant political and cultural movements of the next generation.
<p>
<center><b>Freedom with Responsibility</b></center><hr width=50%>

<p> 
	Why have we chosen the phrase "American citizenship" for this movement? Because these words combine freedom with responsibility. These are the two great themes of modern conservatism, and they build on the best of the American tradition. Freedom without responsibility cannot endure; responsibility without freedom cannot create. The great American experiment in self-government has survived for more than two centuries and created more opportunity for more people than any other political system because for most of our history we have emphasized both the rights and the responsibilities of citizenship.
<p>	As many observers now argue, this great experiment is at risk, and the restoration of American citizenship is now the most essential requirement for the renewal of American culture. Moreover, it is the most important unifying principle of conservatism in the post-Cold-War era. The principle appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, nongovernmental institutions. It appeals to religious conservatives with their emphasis on faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to  growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize generosity and economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, it appeals to nationalists who want to restore American patriotism and a strong sense of American cultural identity. And the restoration of American citizenship is an attractive principle for bringing liberals and centrists into the conservative fold.
<p>

	The restoration of American citizenship will also bring our divided country together. Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the political principles of the United States: the Constitution, the rule of law, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: These have included the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our  own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of our neighbors' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
<p>

	Please join us in the historic mission of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>. To the long-time readers of <i>Policy Review</i>, and especially to you who have been with us since our beginning 18 years ago, we say: Thank you for your support and encouragement, your letters, and your comments on our articles. You are our most important constituency. We believe you will thoroughly enjoy the newly designed magazine, and hope you will stay. Our new mission is based on what you have said you like most about the old <i>Policy Review</i>. We are determined to live up to your standards. 


<p>	To our new readers, we say: Welcome aboard. We need your ideas, we need your enthusiasm, and we need your moral energy. Join us in the American citizenship movement, as we offer the analysis and stories that will help revive the spirit of American citizenship and work to ensure that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from this earth.

<li>This department was created in 1966 to oversee the growth in urban mass transit programs, air traffic, and construction of the Interstate Highway System.
<li>Because each member of Congress tries to assure that his or her state or district recieve as much pork as possible, this department regularly funds expensive, low-priority projects over more sensible, appropriate ones.
<li>Congress earmaked 129 surface projects, at an annual cost of $250 million in FY 1995. During the same year, $1.5 billion was appropriated for airport grants-in-aid, including nearly $5 million for the Jimmy Stewart Airport in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.
<li>19% (18,000 workers) of its civilian staff was furloughed in the first government shutdown.

<li>Made infamous in the 1980's for purchasing $12 "portable language inscribers" (a.k.a. "pencils"), $45 hammers, and $130 toilet seats, this bureaucracy has shaped up considerably in recent years.
<li>The Clinton Administration underfunded even its own Bottom-Up Review of this Department by $100 million in 1995, and neglected to budget for unexpected emergency actions, like the one to Haiti.
<li>258,000 civilian employees (31% of its overall staff), labelled non-essential, didn't show have to commute to this 5-sided building during the first shutdown.

<li>Its operating costs have ballooned by over 800 percent in the last thirty years, but did cut its 1996 budget to $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion in 1995.
<li>It recently came under the same environmental and workplace regulations that had long been imposed on all other organizations nationwide.
<li>Its 1995 appropriations bill eliminated 2,350 positions, 8.6% of its workforce.

<center><h4>Statement to accompany the release of the Gallup Poll</h4> 
<h2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> 
<P><i>December 12, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
Toward the close of my tenure as secretary of education, in a
speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America,
I called for a &quot;transformation of government policy to match,
and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;  I
was referring to the public's recognition that drug use was no
longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but a
personal, medical and economic catastrophe.  That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to '92 -- with
real results.  Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war.  But public sentiment, as this Gallup poll attests,
has not changed.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug
control policy with the federal government rightfully leading
the fight.
<P>
It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine in ten Americans
seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs
rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  Americans
should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use among adolescents
is once again on the rise after the steady and dramatic decline
of the 1980's and early 1990's.  According to the Center on Addiction
and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, &quot;the jump in
marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals that 820,000
more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of
that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and
addicts.&quot;  More bad news is that drug-related hospital emergency-room
cases -- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached
the highest levels since 1978.  Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.  
<P>
What Americans have witnessed -- and reacted to in the Gallup
Poll -- is the result of a failure of public policy brought about
by a moral torpor on the drug issue.  Policy follows attitude.
 But the public's attitude is not one of indifference toward the
scourge.  When asked what they wanted to see <I>a lot more</I>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <I>two-thirds</I>
cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United
States.  By contrast, <I>fewer than half</I> -- 43 percent --
asked for more treatment programs.
<P>
The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot; presents
a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support it received
in the Gallup poll.  Unlike the effective and modest treatment
programs sponsored by churches and using variants of the 12-step
method, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful
and ineffective.  From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment spending
almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment slots actually
declined.  And the discouraging result is that overall cocaine
treatment is not significantly reducing the polulation of hard
core addicts.  We must turn our support toward the proven models
of treatment, while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine
and crack addiction as yet one more compelling reason why preventing
casual drug use by the young -- the first step on the path to
addiction -- is so important.
<P>
Gallup poll respondents put drug interdiction high on their list
-- the percentage of those calling for increased efforts to reduce
the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was 88 percent.  Those
respondents are right  -- the government should put the U.S. military
in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our
borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction
process.  We know that strong interdiction works.  In 1989, the
U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down on the cocaine
cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking and interdiction
effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries
north.  These events produced substantial disruption in the cocaine
supply to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991.  Drugs were less available
on the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined;
reported cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy
users fell; and casual use dropped dramatically.  Today, U.S.foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once-strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated.   We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine-source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.  
<P>
More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict people for
the use and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America.  The response is wise on both counts.
 Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels.  The federal role requires the identification and dismantling
of all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating
in the U.S.   Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention
education are state and local responsibilities for which current
federal aid should be block granted without mandates.  
<P>
The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose legalization
of drugs send a strong message to those who would propose such
an option.  Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and
threatening to society because they are illegal.  They are illegal
because they are dangerous and  threatening to American society.
 Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.  On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization
-- and the overwhelming body of the American people who  reject
such a policy of despair. In the Gallup poll, the people have
again made that point.
<P>
Success in the drug war depends above all on what happens in America's
homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations, television
and movie screens, city streets and civic halls.  It depends on
the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy,  police chiefs, judges
and community leaders.  When I was President Bush's &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities.  I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better.  I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements.  The point is, we know what works.
 The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

<center><h3>How Capitalism is Capitalized</h3> 
Letter to the Editor of the <i>Washington Post</i><P>
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>December 2, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
<blockquote>
Dear Editor:
<P>
John Berry's November 9 Trendlines article, &quot;Treasury Argues
That the Tax Bite on Capital Isn't So Bad,&quot; reveals the ignorance
of our Treasury Department with regard to the workings of capitalism.
 The core of Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' argument
is that declining inflation since the early 1980s has reduced
the tax burden on corporate profits.  But corporate profits taxes
are taxes on income, not capital.  Income can only be derived
from businesses that have already raised capital.  Companies reporting
substantial profits, such as those listed on Fortune 500, are
often established firms in mature markets.  Many are &quot;cash
cows&quot; that transfer wealth from capital to income because
they have exhausted their opportunities for successful risk taking.
 The fact that such firms are shouldering a lighter tax burden
with the decline of inflation tells us nothing about the &quot;tax
bite&quot; on capital.
<P>
The fact is, at a nominal rate of 28%, the capital gains tax has
stood at an historic high in the U.S. since 1987.  That's because
without inflation-indexing, the real rate can easily exceed 100%
on long-held assets that have merely earned a market-based rate
of return.  This high unindexed capital gains tax shuts off capital
to all but the least risky ventures, discouraging entrepreneurship
and thus producing sub-optimal economic growth.  That may be fine
for the large, established, risk-averse corporations throwing
off the cash that Larry Summers is proud to say is suffering lighter
tax burdens in a low-inflation environment.  But it offers scant
hope to our inner-cities and other capital-starved communities
that would have the most to gain from a rebirth of the entrepreneurial
spirit.  That's why I strongly urge congressional leaders and
the White House to include in their budgetary agreement a measure
to lower and index capital gains tax rates. 

<P><P>

<center><h3>Immigration:  Where We Go From Here</h3> 
By <a href="kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> 
<P><i>November 27, 1995</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 American immigrants generate jobs, products, processes, small
businesses, and government revenues at a pace that far exceeds
any strain on U.S. resources.  This is not just my conclusion;
  former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead, U.S. News Editor
Mortimer Zuckerman, IBM Vice President Ed Zschau, Texas Instruments
CEO Jerry Junkins, and a dozen other investment, manufacturing,
and communications leaders expressed the same conclusion in a
recent joint statement.
<P>
Some immigration policies badly need reform, especially those
having to do with illegal immigration.  Under the 1986 immigration
reform act, for example, it's illegal to hire an undocumented
alien, and hard and costly even to hire a legal one.  By contrast,
it's allowed, and in many cases legally mandated, to pay out welfare,
medical, education and other benefits.
<P>
It would be better, and more American, to make it easy to work--for
example, with a generous guest worker program and low-cost i.d.
for participants.  It would be just and would create better incentives,
and make it harder to get welfare payments.  For instance, the
U.S. could more readily accept immigrants who take a pledge not
to go on welfare (a pledge many have already taken).
<P>
With such policies, we not only can &quot;afford&quot; to keep
the golden door open;  we will attract the same type of dynamic
men and women who historically helped build this immigrant nation.
 Let's agree to reform the welfare state and not allow America
to be turned into a police state.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i>

</center><p>



	Citizenship has always been an important question in America, and sometimes it is urgent. This is such a time. In the nature of our society, we leave much to private action. We do this as a matter of principle, in the interest of the liberty that is our entitlement. In America, it is our nature and our law to recognize this natural liberty. That is why private action is unusually important here. But today, private action is not doing its job.

<p>
	We know the facts. A third of all children are born out of wedlock. Half of marriages break up. Thievery and pillage, rape and murder flourish at horrific levels. Our graduates know neither basic facts nor main ideas. Most Americans are economically dependent on the government in some way. Our world is richer and more sophisticated, yet there is a decline of civility, of responsibility, and of knowledge about the highest things, giving our society a low, even primitive cast. Americans have the feeling that something more than their greatness may be going. They feel the loss of goodness, and the emptiness of that feeling cannot be borne.
<p>

	The liberals have a plan to repair this loss. It is the centralized, bureaucratic, administrative state. Its language is familiar: It calls us to "attack our problems on a national scale," "with the full resources of our country," "with the best minds in the nation," all "coordinated from the top." It reminds us that "Washington has a responsibility" -- for example, to keep children nourished. Liberalism finds its energy in utopian promise. Woodrow Wilson would "marry our interests to the state," as if we could be, in the literal sense, one grand family. Franklin Roosevelt would eliminate want, not just from the United States, but from the world. And he would eliminate fear while he was at it. Lyndon Johnson would guarantee equality of result. Hillary Clinton would "change what it means to be a human being in the 21st century."

<p>
	Modern liberalism is progressive, visionary, and ever expanding, and has a conception of citizenship appropriate to its principles. The citizen under modern liberalism responds to policy. He knows that the progress to which society is destined requires progress by him, in his own person. He must be ready, when fashion shifts, to alter his pronouns, his diet, and his relations with his children. He must stay abreast of the shifting value placed on family, or patriotism, or history. He must, in short, be pliable, ready to be shaped and molded.
<p>	Liberals understand the importance of making their vision of citizenship compatible with, even necessary to, the old concept of citizenship that it replaces. When Bill Clinton was inaugurated, for example, he suddenly became "William Jefferson" Clinton. To emphasize the point that he is named after Thomas Jefferson, he spent the eve of his inauguration at Monticello, and traveled the same route that Jefferson did to arrive at the ceremony. He announced his tax increase on Lincoln's and Washington's official birthday, and spoke about their greatness and attention to duty. 
<p>	President Clinton thus continues a tradition of successful modern liberalism begun by Woodrow Wilson and perfected by Franklin Roosevelt. Modern liberals know better than to reject openly the ideas of the Declaration of Independence. But they talk plenty about "completing them," which means changing them completely. Franklin Roosevelt, for example, invented a new demon -- "the economic royalists" --- to replace King George III. He claimed to be defending liberty, in the same way the Founders had defended it against the King.
<p>	But in fighting the economic royalists, Roosevelt attacked also the right to property, a fundamental right that the Founders took pains to establish. Because of this cleverness, the liberals are good at seeming public spirited and devoted to the old ideas. People have long trusted them to serve the community, to care about citizenship and neighborliness.
<p>	We conservatives are united in our opposition to the liberal idea of citizenship. We have seen that there is no liberty under this program. It extinguishes liberty by extinguishing the creature capable of liberty. By the force of government, it replaces him with some new being. It takes a lot of government to "change what it means to be a human being." Several million administrators, deploying a quarter of the largest economy on earth, do not seem to have finished the job in a full generation of trying.
<p>	If we conservatives do not like the liberal idea of citizenship, what do we like? There, more work is needed.
<p>	Recall the standard list of the things wrong with our society, such as divorce and illegitimacy and crime. I would add one generally forgotten: a loss not only of habit, but of knowledge, a loss not only of the exercise of good citizenship, but of the ideas that underlie it. In short, we are ignorant of the basis of our government and the way that it should operate.
<p>	Working adults know that the government is too big and wastes their money and tells them lies on a regular basis. But very few people know or understand even the basic issues of contemporary politics. They do not know, for example, that the cuts proposed by the current Congress amount only to a small fraction of federal spending. They do not know that each of the Clinton budgets called for large increases in domestic spending. They do not know that the welfare system pays its typical clients more than $22,000 per year in southern California, nor that this is more than double the minimum wage.
<p>	This ignorance is neither surprising nor worrisome, except that it betokens a larger ignorance of the high purpose of and the strict limits on government in America. Because of this, we tend to work out our policies practically. We will devolve welfare to the states because "the federal system has proved that it does not work." We hardly mention that the only real entitlement is to the money we earn for ourselves, and that we have no right to anything earned by another. In this respect, we compare poorly to the generation of Americans who would not pay a tax on tea because they were not represented in the legislature that imposed it. These earlier Americans could tell you, right down to the law of nature and human equality, why that tax was wrong, and why another one might be right. They were schooled in the business of being citizens. That schooling made it possible for them to win their liberty.
<p>	Our statesmen -- even those on the Right -- do not do a sufficient job recovering this lost knowledge. None of our statesmen called the Clinton health-care plan unconstitutional. Few oppose entitlements root and branch. What are we to do?
<p>	The recent debate on Proposition 187, California's illegal-immigration initiative, suffered from this failure. Good people supported the initiative, and good people opposed it. The good people who supported the initiative, with a couple of important exceptions, did not make a case about the meaning of citizenship. They talked about denying these so-called benefits of citizenship to some who did not deserve them, without saying what most of them believe: Citizens do not deserve them, either. The good people who opposed the initiative talked a lot about equal treatment, and they said little or nothing about the beliefs and practices that constitute citizenship in America. We were left with a debate about a side issue, and the main point was lost in the whirlwind.
<p>	If statesmen cannot do the work, then we citizens -- in private life -- must do it. I would salute, for example, the conservative writings that support the regeneration of fatherhood, and the sanctity of the family, and the necessity for religion to become powerful once again in our public as well as in our private lives. It is vital to add, however, that our problems are deeply political, and their solution will require hard political action, based upon deep political reasoning and unyielding political conviction.
<p>	Although the Bureau of This or the Agency for That may not be the answer to the evils we face, we are still a profoundly political nation, and our public life is infused with political ideas. Take, for example, the recent celebration of "voluntary and local associations" as we find in the writings of Marvin Olasky or Russell Kirk or Speaker Newt Gingrich. We have turned back to Tocqueville, and we know now that American life until lately teemed with these associations and was elevated and ennobled by them. Of course we are right, in one sense, to think that these local institutions are not at all political. They have no formal constitutional place, they function apart from political action, and they exist in one form or another wherever societies are found.
<p>	Still, in America these local, prepolitical institutions had a special vitality. That vitality was nourished by the political institutions of the country. Now that those institutions have changed, the local institutions of America have diminished in strength. Major social-service charities are worried that, under block grants, they will not get as much money from the states as they have been receiving from the federal government. These same charities do not, as a rule, provide actual direct help to the poor. Rather they assist the federal government in providing those services. Here, then, are "local and voluntary institutions" that are not really local and not really voluntary. Their character has been altered by a change in national politics.
<p>	When local institutions thrived in America, they did so under the influence of a great principle at the heart of the nation's politics. According to this principle, we are equal in our rights, and not to be governed except by our consent. Our citizenship itself operates under this principle of equality, a principle announced in the first organic law of the United States. It is a principle not of local but of national scope, a principle authoritative not because it was adopted by a town or even by a country, but known to every man who is rational. In America, local and voluntary institutions operate beneath the shelter of high national principles.
<p>	Conservatives rightly think that religion should play a larger part on the public stage, for religion has been a vital component of American citizenship from the beginning. Tocqueville observed that "there is no country in the world where the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America." Liberty is vital to religion, he wrote, and religion in turn is vital to liberty:
<p><blockquote>	"Liberty regards religion as its companion in all its battles and its triumphs, as the cradle of its infancy and the divine source of its claims. It considers religion as the safeguard of morality, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of the duration of freedom."
</blockquote><p>

	But it is important to learn from the Founders about how to speak of religion. The Founders were absolutely at ease with a civic acknowledgment of the Deity and its implication for citizenship. But they spoke in the language of reason as well as of revelation. The preachers of the Revolution spoke often and strongly about morality, both in public places and in their churches. In so doing, they addressed their countrymen not as parishioners simply, but also as fellow citizens. Take for example the words of Samuel West, a preacher and a member of the convention that wrote the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780:<p><blockquote>
	"The most perfect freedom consists in obeying the dictates of right reason, and submitting to natural law. When a man goes beyond or contrary to the law of nature and reason, he becomes the slave of base passions and vile lusts; he introduces confusion and disorder into society, and brings misery and destruction upon himself. This, therefore, cannot be called a state of freedom, but a state of the vilest slavery and the most dreadful bondage. The servants of sin and corruption are subjected to the worst kind of tyranny in the universe. Hence we conclude that where licentiousness begins, liberty ends."
</blockquote>	

<p>If we wish to emulate our Founders in our efforts to restore religion to the public square, we must do it in this way. This way is stronger than the appeal many religious conservatives put in its place today. It is stronger because it makes its claims upon an argument and evidence that applies to all, and not only those who are blessed with faith in the person of their Maker. While it supports that faith, and lays the ground for it, this way begins with reason, the faculty that perceives the natural law -- the basis of citizenship in our Founding.
<p>	The Founders were also conscious of the limitations citizenship places on religion. Consider the words of George Washington in a letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island:<p><blockquote>
	"It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support."</blockquote><p>
	Religious liberty, Washington argued, is central to the American conception of citizenship. American citizenship is open to people of any faith or creed. Liberty -- the freedom to use one's property, to pray to one's God, to speak one's mind -- sets a limit upon politics that is inviolable.
<p>	At the same time, the basis of liberty sets a limit upon something more than politics. It sets a limit also upon what properly may be called religion. Religion is free in America from all oppression, and yet those who practice it must live under a political guideline. They must "demean themselves as good citizens." Nor is this standard simply a negative or passive requirement. Citizens must give their country "on all occasions their effectual support."
<p>	Citizenship, then, provides a standard against which religion itself must be measured. True enough, citizens may be exempted from military service if their religion requires it, yet the rules of justice that underlie citizenship can be enforced even in the face of a claim of religious protection. If, for example, the Davidians at Waco had been abusing their children, even if they were doing so in the name of God, then the use of force to extract those children would have been justified.
<p>	One "cannot say that people have a right to do wrong," said Abraham Lincoln, that great student of the Declaration and the Founders. If we know what is right, then we may with justice require right from others under the law. We may with justice expect a man who pledges his faith to a woman to keep that faith, a man who fathers a child to provide for that child, a man who is a citizen to fight for his country. The country is on the side of the citizen who does his duty. It belongs to that citizen; he and his fellows are sovereign in it. In return for their liberty, which the government does not give them but helps them to protect, they have obligations that they are bound to discharge.
<p>	I have described the attentive and pliable citizen who is the hallmark and aim of the modern, liberal regime. Another kind of citizen is implied in the heritage that comes to us from our forefathers. This is a citizenship that responds to the bidding of the natural law and human equality. Americans take up more space, speak more directly, and stand their ground more assertively than people in most other places. An American is more likely to start a business, to give to charity, and to care for his community.
<p>	 Such a citizen has been shaped by hammer blows and the sting of the sword. These were the blows of the American Revolution and the wars that have come since. They were fought in the name of a faith and a creed that applies to all and is at the same time special to us. Winston Churchill, the son of an American mother, regarded the American people as the new great people of the earth, standing beside the Greeks and the Romans and the British among the leaders of mankind. When he cited the great documents that have secured the liberties of the English-speaking peoples, he did it on the Fourth of July. He named the Declaration of Independence as the greatest of them all, knowing full well that it covered all men, whatever tongue they spoke.
<p>	If private action is to do its job again in our country, it must not be seen as a private realm alone. Uniquely in our country, the rules that guide a private citizen, as he cares for his family, and works at his job, and serves his community, are the same rules that inspire the form and purpose of government. For that reason, the restoration of the private realm to its full vitality and decency requires the recovery of the ideas that form the basis for our politics. We must once again hold certain truths to be self-evident. We must meet the challenge that those truths lay before us.

<a name="powell"></a><li> Colin Powell's Nov. 8 decision not to run-for president closes
one chapter of the 1996 presidential sweepstakes, but opens many
others. Although the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
ruled it out, there is still a possibility that he may be asked
to join the Republican ticket in the vice presidential slot. And
his name is already being touted as a presidential candidate in
the year 2000
<P>
Let's analyze some of the reaction to the potential Powell campaign,
before <I>and</I> after Nov. 8.
<P>
<B>Before.</B>  Several, days before Powell's announcement, leaders
of 10 conservative groups held a press conference warning the
retired general not to run and vowing to oppose him if he did
&quot;Any candidacy by Colin Powell must be stopped. He will be
stopped,&quot; said Morton Blackwell, the Republican National
Committeman from Virginia.
<P>
Blackwell also went as far to suggest that some conservatives
were promoting Powell only because he is black &quot;If General
Powell were a white general holding these views, they would not
consider for a moment supporting him for our party's nomination,&quot;
he said.
<P>
Others attending the press conference and supporting this view
included Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation and National
Empowerment Television, David Keane of the Conservative Political
Action Comrnittee, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform,
and Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council.
<P>
This move by some party conservatives was the most hypocritical
and preposterous in recent memory. First, for people who like
to tout their pro-America credentials, it is exceptionally un-American
and undemocratic to suggest that any American is barred from seeking
public office. If he or she is unacceptable, it's up to the voters
to decide, not for a self-appointed band of litmus testers to
try to scare people out of running.
<P>
Several black conservatives were asked to participate in this
charade, including the publisher and editor of <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. 
<P>
But the response and receptiveness (or lack thereof) to Powell's
potential candidacy helped smoke out some of the elements in the
Republican Party who are most strident and resistant to expanding
the party's base. This was one positive outcome of otherwise deplorable
behavior on the part of some patty activists.
<P>
Time magazine reports that House Speaker Newt Gingrich met privately
with Powell Nov. 2 and encouraged him to run, saying &quot;a campaign
would succeed-but only if Powell wanted it very badly.&quot; Without
endorsing Powell Gingrich encouraged him and told him they could
work as a team Powell also had conversations with former Presidents
Ford, Bush and Carter prior to making his final decision. The
broad range of support Powell received, from former Presidents
to lay persons, demonstrates his appeal across party and ideological
lines.
<P>
<B>After.</B>  One newspaper, the <I>Concord (N.H.) Monitor</I>,
said of the Powell decision: &quot;Powell made the right decision
for the right reason. . . If we were President Clinton, we would
seize the chance and call on him to lead a bipartisan, broadly
representative commission on race relations.&quot;
<P>
It is an indication of how far we have to go concerning stereotypes
and pigeon-holing of our nation's black citizens that a major
American newspaper would even suggest reducing a four-star general
to the status of race merchant.
<P>
In response to Powell's announcement that he was joining the Republican
Party, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the general took a &quot;step
backward&quot; by aligning with the GOP. Noting GOP plans to cut
popular federal programs for the poor, Jackson said Powell will
have to do &quot;some very heavy lifting to meet his goal of making
the party more attractive to black voters.&quot;
<P>
Jackson's reaction reveals two important things about his approach
to politics. One, his view that it is a a step backward&quot;
for a man of Powell's stature to work toward two-party participation
by black Americans demonstrates the Reverend's idea of &quot;progress&quot;
is for all blacks to walk in lock step behind Democratic leaders.
<P>
Two, his view that Powell will have to change the GOP by himself
places an unreasonable expectation on the retired general's shoulders.
After all, Jackson has been in the Democratic Party for years
and they Still refuse to accept him as their standard bearer.
Perhaps he should do some &quot;heavy lifting&quot; of his own
in the Democratic Party.
<P>
Powell's son Michael, in an interview with Time magazine following
Powell's Nov. 8 press conference, said the retired general might
be persuaded to accept a spot on the GOP ticket if asked by the
nominee. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he was in government
again as a secretary of something or even vice president,&quot;
said the younger Powell.
<P>
And some of Powell's supporters have not yet thrown in the towel.
Some Powell partisans are organizing a massive write-in campaign
and pinning their hopes on a win in New Hampshire to coax Powell
to join the Republican field.
<P>
California Citizens for Powell Chair Emmett Cash III said, &quot;If
the people of New Hampshire write him in great numbers, he will
be the next President of the United States. New Hampshire is the
key to this election for Colin Powell.&quot; But it might be best
to respect Powell's wishes--for now. He doesn't want to be a candidate
this year. After 35 years of service to his country, he deserves
a break.
<P>
<a name="collins"></a><li> In a surprise announcement, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Il.), the
longest serving black woman in Congress and a Chicago political
power, said she will retire. Since being elected to succeed her
late husband in 1973, Collins has handily won election after election.
Collins, in a Washington, D.C. press conference, said, &quot;The
main factor in stepping down is I'D be 65 years old next year.
I believe you know in your life when its time to make a change.&quot;
<P>
Collins said she considered retiring in 1994. The 7th Congressional
District which she represents contains the Loop and most of the
North Michigan corridor and the Near North Side, with the infamous
Cabrini-Green housing project. It also goes south, past the Century
Prairie Avenue mansions to the Taylor homes and takes in a few
heavily black South Side neighborhoods.
<P>
Collins played a pivotal role in remapping Illinois' congressional
districts after the 1990 census, demanding that her district retain
the Loop. &quot;It has been frustrating moving from the majority
to the minority, but that's not the reason I'm leaving,&quot;
said Collins. &quot;I've enjoyed fighting the Republicans, quite
frankly.&quot;
<P>
Her retirement set off a stampede of would-be successors.
<P>
<a name="jj"></a><li> Two-time presidential candidate Jesse Jackson said Nov. 9 he's
thinking anew about running in 1996 now that retired Gen. Colin
Powell has ruled out a potential White House bid.
<P>
The Associated Press reported that less than 24 hours after Powell
announced he would not run, Jackson said at a news conference
that he has met with his advisers over the past few days to ''assess
the landscape.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I still have the fire in my belly and clear vision in my
head about what a president ought to do to make the nation better,&quot;
said the founder of the National Rainbow Coalition and presidential
candidate of 1984 and 1988.
<P>
Jackson said it was premature to say when he would reach a decision.
<P>
But while criticizing what he said was Clinton's inattention to
urban issues, Jackson suggested he would stay on the political
sidelines if the president begins to pay more attention to cities
and racial inequities.
<P>
&quot;I feel that Clinton, if he focuses on the covenant, honors
it and addresses those people who elected him, he could be elected
again. But if he abandons that base then that base has no allegiance
to him,&quot; he said.
<P>
Jackson said it would be difficult for him to run in the Democratic
primaries and that an independent candidacy would be the only
way to &quot;open the process up.&quot;
<P>
<a name="cv"></a><li> President Clinton emerged the clear winner in CityVote, the
presidential preference balloting that lumped together declared
and potential candidates, independents and party members on Election
Day.
<P>
210,000 votes were cast in 13 cities, including Tucson, Ariz.
and Fayette, Mo. In the Nov. 7 non-binding urban primary, Clinton
drew 43.7 percent. Colin Powell came in second with 18.2 percent
and Sen. Bob Dole finished third with 11.9 percent.
<P>
The rest received votes in this order: Steve Forbes, Ross Perot,
Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm and Jesse Jackson. Republican presidential
hopefuls Lamar Alexander, Sen. Arlen Specter and Sen. Dick Lugar
rarely, if at all, exceeded 1 percent.
<P>
Twenty-one names in all appeared on the ballot. Legal challenges
prevented several bigger cities, including Boston, Baltimore and
Newark, from participating. CityVote also was plagued by pressures
from the
<P>
Democratic National Committee, which sought to have Clinton's
name struck from the ballot.
<P>
<a name="banks"></a><li> Banks may have lost a defense against redlining charges.
<P>
Two economists with the Federal National Mortgage Association
said earlier studies erred in supporting a reason often given
for lender avoidance of low-income neighborhoods, according to
a report in American Banker.
<P>
The idea that home values in such neighborhoods tend to fall is
mistaken, the researchers found. In fact, they said, home values
in poorer areas have actually gone up, while those in affluent
areas have slipped.
<P>
Their study indicates that bankers, in avoiding low-income neighborhoods,
lack an economic justification they could cite before to counter
fair-lending charges. Now they must focus on the credit histories
and incomes of particular applicants--rather than the area in
which they live. That is much harder to do.
<P>
The economists, Eric Rosenblat and Ying Li, in a paper presented
Oct. 24 to the Society of Government Economists, said the flaw
in earlier studies was a reliance on demographic information that
wound up having no correlation to housing values.
<P>
The earlier studies looked at the number of welfare recipients
and the number of vacant homes in an area to explain why bankers
did not lend in certain communities.
<P>
Many economists have questioned the validity of those studies,
arguing that bankers consider only the borrower and the house
when making loans. Community characteristics such as the number
of welfare recipients don't matter, they said.
<P>
The Fannie Mae study is the first research project to formally
rebut the prior findings.
<P>
The researchers based their conclusion on data collected by Fannie
Mae and the Federal Home Mortgage Corp. that covered housing purchases
in California--including Los Angeles, Anaheim and Oakland. They
limited their review to homes that changed hands at least twice
between 1986 and 1994.</ul>

<title>Missing: $13.5 Billion -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Missing: $13.5 Billion</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) wins my annual award for the most outrageous example of government bungling. If this isn't an example of why government should be entrusted with as little responsibility as possible, I don't know what is.
<p>
	A recently completed Inspector General's (IG) audit found that the department's Food and Consumer Services (FCS) division -- which is responsible for the school lunch and food stamp programs -- could not document what it did with $13.5 billion of the $36.7 billion it spent in 1994. That's right: 34 percent of what it spent was unaccounted for! Talk about waste, fraud and abuse!
<p>
	The auditors reported that at one point, when figures from the Treasury Department -- which writes the government's checks -- didn't match its own, FCS just "fudged" the numbers and forced a match. According to the IG, the employees made no effort to figure out why the discrepancies existed or what was done with the unaccounted-for money. In the private sector, this is called "fraud." 
<p>
	Even big-government liberals like Vice President Al Gore now agree that government is rife with waste and foolishness. For a good laugh -- rather, a good cry -- just read Gore's <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/npr/nptoc.html">"National Performance Review."</a> As I noted, the Agriculture Department is responsible for running two very costly and politically charged programs: school lunches and food stamps. These programs affect millions of American families and suck up billions of your tax dollars every year. And the bureaucrats responsible for running the programs don't even know where your money went!

<p>	Of course, the USDA bureaucrats have an excuse. They complain about a recent switch to a new automated bookkeeping system. In other words, everything was humming along just fine until somebody tried to make things work more efficiently.
<p>	Come on. Either Agriculture Department managers are incompetent and need to be replaced or the welfare state has grown so large that nobody can keep track of where our money is going.
<p>	
The so-called "War on Poverty" -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized school lunches, etc. -- has cost American taxpayers $5.4 trillion over the past 30 years. There really aren't enough "good intentions" in the world to justify spending that much money with basically no result. The percentage of Americans living in poverty is still around the same level it was in 1965, when the spending spree began. When something doesn't work, it should be fixed. Or gotten rid of.
<p>	Of course, conservatives like me are demonized when we suggest that the welfare state  undermines personal responsibility. Now, along comes this audit to suggest that welfare also affects the responsibility of the people running the system.
<p>
	Think about it. Wouldn't you get a little jaded about accountability after years of passing out billions of dollars for a system that doesn't work -- and the more it is seen as a failure, the more money you are given to pass out?
<p>
	It is probably a pretty safe bet that this particular agency is not unusual, that similar outrages would be found if the rest of the welfare system were audited.
<P>
	In fact, the auditors in this case had to give up before finishing because the bookkeeping was so sloppy. "We discontinued our review because we did not believe that we could complete our sample in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost," they said.
<P>
	At least someone was thinking of who was picking up the tab.

<H2>The Bosnia Mission - Is It Worth it?<BR></CENTER></H2>

This week, President Clinton is sending thousands of U.S. Troops to Bosnia to make peace and not everyone agrees on the goals, reasons, or if we should even be in Bosnia.  This week, Town Hall has assembled several pieces of information from around the net and here at Town Hall.  Check back every day for new additions and later in the week, give us your opinion of the Bosnia mission.

 There are four key issues pending with telecommunications conferees:
<ol>
<li><a href="#net">Internet Regulation</a>
<li><a href="#puhca">PUHCA</a>
<li><a href="#reg">Price Regulation</a>
<li><a href="#comp">Long Distance Competition</a></ol>
<P>

<P><a name="net"></a>
<center><B>INTERNET REGULATION</B>
<P></center>
Earlier this year, the House voted 420 to 4 in support of the
&quot;Cox-Wyden-White&quot; approach to Internet regulation and
&quot;cyberporn.&quot; This approach established no new criminal
penalties for pornography on the Net; provided immunity for on-line
service providers who enable users to block or screen access to
objectionable material; and, prohibited the FCC from regulating
the Net.  The Senate approved the more intrusive &quot;Exon&quot;
approach, which Speaker Gingrich opposed.
<P>
<i>This morning, House conferees met to decide what approach to
Internet regulation they would advance in Conference</i>.  They
adopted the White approach, which maintains most Cox-Wyden provisions
but also includes new criminal penalties for transmission of pornographic
material on the Net.  In adopting the White approach, however,
they changed the standard for application of these penalties from
the limited Constitutional standard of &quot;material harmful
to minors&quot; to &quot;indecency&quot; -- a killer amendment
in the eyes of the broad Internet, on-line provider and freedom
coalition (e.g., Americans for Tax Reform; Citizens for a Sound
Economy, Heritage Foundation).  The vote among House members was
17-16, with Republicans Goodlatte, Gallegly, Hoke, Moorhead, Frisa,
Barton, Hyde, Schaefer, Buyer, Flanigan, Barr, Paxon and Stearns
voting for the &quot;indecency&quot; approach.  The Christian
Coalition was strongly supportive of this change, with the freedom
coalition strongly opposed.  Democrats who supported the &quot;indecency&quot;
standard included Conyers, Schroeder, Gordon and Jackson-Lee.
<P>
<i>If this provision cannot be changed back to the original White
approach, many of those who supported the White approach will
work to kill the bill</i>.
<P><a name="puhca"></a>
<center><B>PUHCA</B>
<P></center>
The Senate telecommunications bill would allow the 14 registered
utility holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (PUHCA) to enter telecommunications and related businesses
on the same basis as other companies (utility and non-utility).
 <i>Earlier this year, Speaker Gingrich called for such flexibility</i>
(see attached news release).  
<P>
The House bill has no provision comparable to the Senate language.
 In staff conference negotiations so far, the House has refused
to accept the Senate PUHCA language based on the assertion, advanced
most often by Congressmen Dingell and Markey, that it has insufficient
consumer protections for captive utility ratepayers.  (In reality,
the Senate bill contains extensive consumer protections aimed
at ensuring that captive ratepayers do not subsidize telecommunications
activities.)
<P>
<i>Senate staff have now offered additional consumer protections
in an attempt to break the impasse; no response has yet come from
the House</i>.
<P><a name="reg"></a>
<center><B>PRICE REGULATION</B>
<P></center>
Staff of House and Senate conferees have agreed to strike language
contained in both versions of the legislation requiring the FCC
and state public service commissions to replace old-style, cost-plus
rate-of-return regulation with price regulation.  This requirement
was included on the grounds that price regulation would not only
streamline Federal and state telecommunications regulation, but
would also reduce any financial incentives that the local telephone
companies might have to cross subsidize competitive services with
revenues earned from non-competitive offerings.
<P>
Price regulation requirements were included largely through the
efforts of Senator Lott and Congressman Tauzin.  <i>Staff apparently
decided to strike the provisions from the conference report in
deference to pressure from the White House and some state regulatory
commissions who view the requirement as an encroachment on their
jurisdiction</i>.
<P>
The move from rate of return regulation to price regulation was
a key feature of both bills, supported especially by Sen. Pressler
and Cong. Fields, and <i>its elimination from the final bill would
make it significantly less pro-competitive</i>.
<P><a name="comp"></a>
<center><B>LONG DISTANCE COMPETITION</B>
<P></center>
During the telecom debate in September, the House expressly rejected
provisions that would have delayed Bell company entry into the
long distance market until they were able to demonstrate that
local phone markets were competitive (i.e., a facilities based
test).  The House rejected this proposal out of concern it would
create a disincentive for long distance carriers to enter local
phone markets with the Bells, thereby delaying Bell entry into
the long distance market.
<P>
<i>Though the Senate staff apparently has agreed to the provisions
in the House bill, the long distance carriers have persuaded Chairman
Bliley and Rep. Fields to reconsider the type of facilities-based
local competition test that the House earlier rejected</i>. Neither
the House conferees nor the conference committee as a whole have
voted on this issue.

<title>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT ADOPTION</title>

<p>
<h2>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING<br>
ABOUT ADOPTION</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I hope that we will reach out across the country
and create an environment in which every couple who wants to have
a child -- or several children -- and is capable emotionally and
financially to adopt, has the opportunity to adopt.  And I hope
every child who finds himself in a situation without a permanent
relationship with adults who care will have an opportunity for
a permanent legal family; and that we will work together to make
adoption as easy as possible, as practical as possible, and as
supported as possible.&quot;  -- Speaker of the House of Representatives
Newt Gingrich at the National Council for Adoption's Adoption
Hall of Fame Banquet, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;Even if pro-choice and pro-life advocates can never agree 
philosophically on the question of abortion, we can agree on adoption. 
I have long been a proponent of adoption and will continue to support 
it. Both pro-choice and pro-life advocates can and should come together 
to promote adoption. Too many children desperately need families and 
homes.&quot; -- Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;I'm particularly pleased that this house will serve
as a place from which children will be adopted under the responsibility
of Catholic Charities, and I would personally plead that everyone
who knows of this house, everyone who knows of other places like
it, will do all that can be done to promote adoption of the children
here in our own country.  We have more than 400,000 children languishing
in foster care in America.&quot; -- First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at Mother Teresa's Home for Infant Children in Washington,
D.C., 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;The fact is that with adoption comes joy and challenges
and, always, blessings.  If you're thinking of starting a family,
or adding another member to your present family, please consider
adopting a child who has been waiting -- sometimes a long time
-- for someone to love them and provide a happy home.  You'll
be giving a precious gift -- the special love of a family -- to
a child who desperately needs it.&quot;  -- Dave Thomas, founder
of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants in a publication
entitled &quot;Adoption Works...For Everyone:  A Beginner's Guide
To Adoption.&quot;

<title>Bridging the Budget Gap on Medicare -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>BRIDGING THE BUDGET GAP ON MEDICARE</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
 Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/welcome.html.cgi"> The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 73<br>
November 21, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The Congress-White House budget agreement reached on Sunday would incorporate a slightly modified Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline against which to measure competing ways to balance the budget in seven years. 
<p>
This is important because it means both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue will be using the same "benchmark" to compare proposals with current law. Until now, the White House has insisted on  using baselines developed by its own Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Congress uses the nonpartisan CBO, as required by statute. Since the OMB's forecast for the economy and spending under current law generally is more optimistic than CBO's (that is, assumes faster economic growth and a slower increase in many federal programs), achieving any proposed federal budget requires smaller savings according to the White House than according to CBO.
<p>
Using the same CBO scorecard will make it much easier to reach compromise in a number of policy areas where the White House and Congress hitherto appeared too far apart for an agreement. Perhaps the most important of these areas is Medicare. The White House and congressional Democrats in recent weeks have attempted to draw a stark distinction between the Medicare savings projected in the House-Senate conference budget resolution and President Clinton's budget plan, released in June. Americans have been told that, while the President's plan seeks to achieve only $128 billion in savings over the next seven years, the conference budget resolution seeks to achieve $270 billion in savings. Hence, the impression is created that Congress intends to reduce projected Medicare spending by more than double the amount favored by the White House.
<p>
Using the same CBO baseline for both Medicare proposals sharply reduces the gap. 
<p>
Specifically:
<p>
Comparing the two budget plans with the CBO baseline indicates that the White House wants savings of $192 billion, not the $128 billion it claims when comparing its plan with that of Congress. This makes the difference between the two plans $78 billion over seven years, not the $142 billion claimed by the White House.
<p>
But even this overstates the gap between the two positions in terms of reducing the outlays for Medicare. The reason:  Congress's budget includes new revenue into the program from raising Part B premiums in two ways. In the arcane accounting of Washington, bringing new revenues into the Medicare program is considered identical to cutting the growth of projected spending on health care services. It obviously is not, however, since adding revenues to fund the program does not reduce spending, even though it does reduce the growth in net outlays. 
<p>
Under the congressional plan, the first way Part B premium revenues are increased, compared with current law, is by maintaining premiums at 31.5 percent of costs instead of allowing them to fall to 25 percent of costs, as current law would do (meaning an actual reduction in premiums). This raises $48.7 billion over seven years. Under the second change, an affluence test would be applied to Medicare recipients, and upper-income beneficiaries would face an additional increase in premiums, reducing the subsidy these individuals currently receive from taxpayers. This second change raises $8.6 billion over seven years. Thus, the combined revenue generated by the premium adjustments -- which is classified as a reduction in spending by Washington, but actually funds more Medicare services -- is $57.3 billion over seven years.
<p>
The Clinton budget contains no premium increases, even on the wealthy. So to compare the effect of the two Medicare proposals on actual spending for services, it is necessary to add the misleadingly classified $57.3 billion revenue increase to the congressional budget numbers.
<p>
If Medicare spending under the two budgets is compared with the CBO baseline, after correcting the congressional figure for the additional premium revenue, the difference in spending falls to a gap of just $20.7 billion over seven years in a program which is projected to spend $1,900 billion over that period. Thus, the gap between the White House and Congress on Medicare spending is just one percent of current projected outlays.

<hr><P>
<i>What would have happened if the Founding Fathers had tried to
draft the Declaration of Independence today with a lawyer from
the American Civil Liberties Union on the committee....</i>
<hr width="50%">
</center><P>
JOHN ADAMS: Gentlemen, let us pray that the Almighty will grant
us wisdom in the wording of this document and in setting the course
for this new nation.
<P>
ACLU: I object! God has no place in government!
<P>
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: Sir, to forbid the rightful acknowledgment
of God in the affairs of state would be an abridgment of the religious
freedom we came to this country to enjoy.
<P>
THOMAS JEFFERSON: Religion is the foundation of all just government.
Our laws have their source and their authority in the Bible. Don't
we need wisdom and His blessing? The Bible says, &quot;The fear
of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&quot; and &quot;Blessed
is the nation whose God is the Lord.&quot;
<P>
ACLU: Don't forget that it was abuses by a state religion that
were partly responsible for bringing us to this point of separation
from England.
<P>
JEFFERSON: We need separation of church and state to prevent the
church from controlling the state, or the state the church--not
to prevent the church from civilizing the state and holding it
morally accountable.
<P>
ACLU: You are imposing your belief in God on me! I'm an atheist!
<P>
ADAMS: Whether you are an atheist or not does not affect God's
existence. Oh, very well. Those who wish to may privately and
individually acknowledge God's ruling in our lives.
<P>
Now, Mr. Jefferson will read us the Declaration of Independence,
subject to our revisions.
<P>
JEFFERSON: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal--'
<P>
ACLU: Objection! 'Truths' is a relative term. What's true for
you may not be true for me. And creation is a religious concept.
<P>
ADAMS: Then let us amend that statement to read, 'We hold these
opinions to be self-evident, to some, that all men are equal--'
<P>
ACLU: Sexist!
<P>
ADAMS: How about 'all persons are equal'?
<P>
ACLU: Better. But I'd prefer, 'all races, genders and lifestyles
are Equal--'
<P>
FRANKLIN: 'lifestyles'? What are lifestyles'?
<P>
ACLU: Sexual preference: adultery, homosexuality, prostitution,
pedophilia--
<P>
FRANKLIN: I pray our nation never--
<P>
ACLU; If you people persist in your references to prayer, I'll
seek a court injunction.
<P>
ADAMS: Order! Order! Gentlemen! Mr. Jefferson, please continue!
<P>
JEFFERSON: '--That all lifestyles, etc., are equal and that all
persons find themselves possessing certain arguably inalienable
rights, that among these are life--'
<P>
ACLU: Objection! Infringes on a woman's right to reproductive
choice.
<P>
JEFFERSON: '. . . liberty and the pursuit of happiness'
<P>
FRANKLIN: This doesn't even make sense! How can people have 'rights'
which are not granted by anyone? How can those who do not have
a right to life profit from their rights to liberty and the pursuit
of happiness?
<P>
I move we kick this lawyer out of the meeting!
<P>
ACLU: Objection! Violation of the first amendment to the Constitution:
my right to free speech.
<P>
ADAMS: What is the Constitution?
<P>
ACLU: Freedom of speech extends not only to political dissidents,
such as ourselves, but to moral relativists, and to those who
may in the future seek to destroy what we are now building.
<P>
FRANKLIN: God forbid!
<P>
ACLU: Freedom of religion means that moral values can have no
influence on public life.
<P>
ADAMS: But that is nonsense! This would mean that our public prayers
would violate the laws of the nation we are in the process of
creating.
<P>
ACLU: That's what the Supreme Court will say!
<P>
FRANKLIN: If that's how you people are going to interpret it,
I hope to God we never do draft it.
<P>
ADAMS: Gentlemen, we seem to be deadlocked. Every attempt on the
part of men of good will to establish this nation seems to be
actively thwarted by the lawyer from the ACLU. The revolution
is hereby cancelled. <P>

 The Hebrew and Greek words for &quot;envy&quot; are used 23 times
in the Bible.  They are used negatively 22 times, positively once
-- when the apostle Paul in Romans 11:14 hopes that the good lives
of Christians will arouse non-believers to constructive envy.
<P>
 Calvin Trillin, author of the hilarious food book <U>American
Fried</U>, presents his own version of constructive envy concerning
ordering in restaurants.  Do not study the menu, he says, or discourse
endlessly with the waiter; instead, see someone at an adjacent
table who is stuffing his face with great joy, point at him and
his food, and tell the waiter, &quot;I want some of that.&quot;
<P>
 Constructive envy.
<P>
 Sitting in a room at the Gospel Mission on 810 Fifth St. N.W.,
41-year-old Jerry Minor opens the furnace door of his past and
looks into hell.  &quot;I couldn't -- I couldn't hold a job,&quot;
he recalls.  &quot;Drugs and alcohol.&quot; Mr. Minor started
using heroin and cocaine when he was 19, was married at 22, and
over the next few years turned from &quot;recreational use&quot;
into a drug-focused wreck of a man.
<P>
 Mrs. Minor accepted the occasional use, but as it mastered Minor
and he became unable to hold a job or act decently in the home,
she &quot;just couldn't put up with it anymore&quot; and left
in 1984.  Minor hit the streets, selling crack cocaine and heroin
but not netting much cash in the process, &quot;because I was
using as much as I was making. Most of the money went right back
into my body.&quot; 
<P>
 He was also &quot;off and on&quot; in jail for selling drugs.
 When not behind bars he would see his wife and children every
few weeks; she would plead with him to stop doing drugs, but &quot;it
was just beyond my control to stop.&quot; He sometimes stayed
at big, government-funded homeless shelters, but he found there
&quot;a lot of the same things that I was always doing.  A lot
of drugs, a lot of fights.&quot;  
<P>
 Minor walked into the Gospel Mission in 1992 -- out of desperation,
not belief.  &quot;I was tired of doing the things that I was
doing.  I was tired of going in and out of jail.  And that was
it.  The shelters fed me and clothed me but they gave me no rest.
 I was just tired, you know?&quot;  He was also functionally illiterate,
and deciding it was time to do something about that.
<P>
 At the Gospel Mission, constructive envy started to set in. 
&quot;I started seeing other people accepting the Lord, and realized
they were getting better. I wanted some of that, because I had
tried everything else. And there were people here showing me that
they cared about me.  People helped me with the Bible, helped
me understand the Bible.  And it was the grace of God that finally
did it.&quot;
<P>
 Three years later, Minor is working as a drug counselor at the
Gospel Mission.  He could never be licensed by the government:
 He doesn't have the classroom hours, and his reading still isn't
very good. (A volunteer tutor works with him regularly.) But he
knows the tricks of the drug trade and isn't easily taken in by
scams; he's stood up to bullies before and isn't easily possessed
by fear; he's learned to live with little and isn't readily subject
to greed. 
<P>
 There's still a long way to go for Jerry Minor.  He's working
on his relationship with his children.  (His ex-wife has since
remarried.) He's still working on his 3-R skills.  But &quot;now
he's a leader,&quot; says Gospel Mission staff psychologist Molly
Soper.  &quot;The men look up to him, and new ones come in see
that he's getting it together in a way they have not.&quot; 
<P>
 Constructive envy.  It doesn't happen when homeless men are thrown
together into a shelter that enables their self-destruction by
supplying needs regardless of behavior.  It doesn't happen when
men forget that right and wrong do have meaning, and that not
all life styles are equal.
<P>
 But when it does set in -- because truly compassionate people
have structured a challenging environment in which  the desire
to change is watered daily -- constructive envy does not enable
people to wallow as they are.  It changes them.

<P><p><P></center>
 Over the past several years there has been a dramatic retrenchment
of government's economic role.  Around the globe various countries
have privatized their banks, steel mills, post offices, air traffic
control systems and roads.  The change has been no less dramatic
in the energy sector.  Great Britain and Chile have already privatized
their electricity industries and several other countries are now
following suit.  Given this return to private enterprise in former
bastions of statism, it is somewhat embarrassing that, while the
Russians have privatized more than 10,000 firms in the past couple
of years, the U.S. Congress is finding it impossible to privatize
four agencies that generate and distribute electricity in the
South and West, and at most represent one-twentieth of one percent
of our GDP.
<P>

 These agencies, the Power Marketing Administrations (or PMAs
to their fans), were created over the past sixty years to market
power generated at dams operated by the Corps of Engineers and
the Bureau of Reclamation.  The electricity generated at these
facilities is sold at mostly below market rates to rural electric
co-operatives and local government utilities -- a group commonly
called &quot;preference customers&quot;.  
<P>
 Privatization of the PMAs has foundered on the effect it would
have on the electricity rates charged to consumers of this low-cost
power.  So far, various proposals to address this problem have
been lacking.  The preference customers have advocated that the
PMAs be sold to them at bargain prices.  This has run into the
opposition of private utility companies that also want the chance
to bid on the assets.  The House Resources Committee's plan, now
defunct, would have sold the Southeastern Power Administration
(SEPA) to the highest bidder, and mitigated any &quot;rate shock&quot;
with a regulatory rate cap.  
<P>
 The sale of SEPA has been waylaid by traditional interest group
politics.  The beneficiaries of this program (i.e., the preference
customers who receive subsidized power) have a concentrated interest
in this issue that, as usual, has trumped the general interest
of taxpayers who paid for the construction and operation of the
PMAs and currently subsidize the power.  It's been reported that
even the Bass Anglers Sporting Society fought the sale.  It seems
they fear the owners of the privatized dams will increase fees
at bass rich reservoirs.  This is yet another example of how good
intentions are simply not enough to move the process in Washington.
<P>
 In order to privatize the PMAs and, more  generally, in order
to truly reform the Federal government, we are going to have to
do more than just think good thoughts and exhort Congress to vote
the general interest.  We have to make change something special
interests desire rather than fear.
<P>
 In the area of privatization, we should learn from the experiences
of other countries around the world.  Through voucher and other
plans foreign governments have transformed natural opponents of
privatization such as employees and customers into stakeholders
and advocates.  The Czech Republic's voucher scheme was extraordinarily
successful.  It made the benefits of privatization obvious even
to &quot;widows and orphans&quot; for whom terms like &quot;shares&quot;
or &quot;stock exchange&quot; had still been rather foggy.
<P>
 Taking inspiration from the Czech experience we need to privatize
the PMAs in way that turns potential opponents into proponents.
 The way to do this is to convert the PMAs into government corporations.
 Next, the final consumers of PMA power -- those who use power
bought from a PMA to light their homes or run their businesses
-- would be given the option to purchase stock in the PMAs at
a price reflecting the value of the PMAs under current operating
conditions.  This option would be fully transferrable and so consumers
could either exercise it, thus become part-owners of the corporation,
or sell it to whomever they want under any conditions they agree
upon.  
<P>
  Unlike the proposals put forward so far by the preferred customers,
this legislation will open the sale up to any qualified bidder.
 This will ensure that the assets will wind up with those who
can use them most efficiently.  This approach will move decisions
about ownership and operation of these facilities out of committee
rooms in Washington and give those decisions to people who have
a direct interest in the outcome.  Interested buyers will have
to woo consumers instead of sending lobbyists to Washington. 
<P>
 However, unlike open sale proposals put forward so far by private
utilities, it will not leave in place an interest group protected
only by a governmental regulatory structure.  A wide-open bidding
process will bid up the value of the PMAs giving consumers the
chance to realize substantial gains by selling their options.
 Consumers will be compensated for any possible &quot;rate shock&quot;
through cash from the sale of their option, or appreciated stock.
<P>
 Most importantly, it will convert those who are now most fearful
of any change in ownership of the PMAs into supporters of privatization.
 Consumers will take an active interest in the process as they
check the financial pages of their newspaper every day for the
latest offer.  They will write their Congressman asking not to
stop the sale, but to expedite it so they can realize their gain
from the sale on the open market.
<P>
 In December of 1986, on the day Margaret Thatcher's government
was launching its privatization of British Gas, a crowd of about
a hundred people gathered in the foyer of the Manchester Stock
Exchange.  Before the sale, the government had done everything
possible--staggered payments, bonus and voucher schemes, and free
and matching shares--to encourage and empower former customers
and employees to buy shares.  That day, the foyer soon took on
the atmosphere of a bookie's office.  As the price of the newly
floated shares rose, the crowd cheered.  When prices faltered,
they booed.  This shows how a creative plan can capture the imagination
and support of the public.  
<P>
 The approach described above can change the current political
dynamic in a similar and dramatic way.  It would end government
involvement in generating electricity, an area where it no longer
needs to be involved.  It will also provide an example of the
innovative types of solutions that can be used to restructure
other areas of the Federal government.
<P>
 This concept will be incorporated into a bill that will be introduced
by one of the authors, Congressman Shadegg.  The plan will avoid
a sale to the current preference customers at below market rates,
which would not truly privatize these facilities.  A preference
sale would merely move the facilities from the left hand of the
government to the right, perpetuate subsidized power and hurt
the taxpayer.  
<P>
 The privatization plan embodied in the bill also avoids a &quot;trust
us&quot; sale to the existing private power companies under terms
which ask the current customers give up their benefit for nothing
and rely on a government regulatory structure to protect them
from rate shock.
<P>
 Following the example used around the world, giving a fully transferable
purchase option to the current customers meets two important criteria.
 First, it will achieve privatization at market rates, and second,
it will fully compensate the current customers.
<P>

<title>SEX-TROUBLED NAVY SHOULD DEEP-SIX PORNOGRAPHY SALES</title>
<body>

<h2>SEX-TROUBLED NAVY SHOULD<br>
DEEP-SIX PORNOGRAPHY SALES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>
<p>
In the wake of the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a
U.S. sailor and two Marines and the groping of a female sailor
by a drunken chief petty officer on a commercial flight, Admiral
Jeremy Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, has called for A
Day of Introspection for service men and women to consider the
issue of sexual harassment.
<p>
Whether &quot;introspection&quot; can help is anyone's guess,
but if our nation's military leaders are really serious about
combatting improper sexual activity by service personnel, they
will move quickly to stop the save of sexually explicit materials
on military bases.
<p>
Believe it or not, the federal government is the country's largest
distributor of pornographic materials.  By selling sex magazines
to U.S. Armed Forces through the military exchange system, the
government spreads smut tax-free and at discount prices.
<p>
Most Americans (51 percent) favor banning the sale of pornographic
materials on military bases, according to a new national survey
conducted for the Family Research Council by Voter/Consumer Research,
a Maryland-based pollster.  Not suprisingly, support for this
measure is particularly high among women.
<p>
To date, the Navy's solution to the problem of sexual harassment
and misconduct has been both misguided and ineffective.  The positive
effects of sexual harassment classes have been more than offset
by assigning more women to the close quarters environments of
naval aviation and combat ships.
<p>
Evidence of this is the recent deployment of the <I>USS Eisenhower</I>,
to the Mediterranean for six months.  The crew included 415 women,
a large number of whom became pregnant, engaged in extramarital affairs,
and returned to publicize incidents of sexual misconduct.  Experienced
sailors were not surprised by the <I>Eisenhower</I> results. 
Any skipper of a coed ship can relate incidents of fraternization,
granting of favors for sex, on-board pregnancies, etc. 
<p>
Navy regulations already prohibit the sale of materials that &quot;inspire
or encourage lust, particularly in the young, by exploiting indecent
or undue exposure, exaggerating sexual characteristics of male
or female figures, or by showing suggestive obvious passionate
actions or poses.&quot; 
<p>
The Navy's hesitancy to dump this trash may be because commanders
lack the courage to enforce the regulations or fear First Amendment
challenges.   At least one ship commander ignored such possible
constraints and did the right thing.
<p>
The captain of the <I>USS America</I> received a complaint about
a magazine sold in his ship's store.  The April, 1984 issue of
<I>Hustler</I> magazine included graphic pictures of a woman engaging
in a sex act with a crucifix.  The ship's supply officer was ordered
to deep-six the magazine.
<p>
In many cases, commanders may not understand the connection between
sexually explicit material and sexual misconduct.  They can't
&quot;connect the dots.&quot;
<p>
Pornographic material, like alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.
 Beginning with &quot;soft&quot; pornography sold in Navy stores,
the desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more
explicit, more deviant images in order to reach the previous level
of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and  may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.  Such activities may include promiscuity,
exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, sex with children, rape,
sadism or homosexuality.
<p>
Army exchanges sell this trash, too. <i>Hustler,</i> one of the
more perverse of the &quot;mainstream&quot; magazines,  is sold
openly at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where military personnel
find one of the largest government-sponsored displays of erotic
material in the world.
<p>
Submariners at Groton, Connecticut can also choose from a wide
selection of pornography.  Even in Washington, D.C., the Pentagon
Book Store sells nine &quot;soft-porn&quot; magazines and two
sexually explicit homosexual magazines, the latter belying DOD's
commitment to &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell.&quot;
<p>
Under current policy, military exchange managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot;
outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case <i>Miller vs. California</i>.
<p>
The <I>Miller</I> criteria were written to protect freedom of
speech and expression but there are kinds of speech and expression
not protected by the Constitution. These include, among others,
slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling
&quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater, copyright violations and
child pornography.
<p>
Navy regulations allow commanders to ban materials that could
incite sexual harassment in the workplace.  According to the Navy,
the workplace is &quot;an expansive term for military members
and may include conduct on or off duty, 24 hours a day.&quot;
 This includes off-duty in an off-base military community, on
commercial airplanes, at aviation conventions and on the high
seas.
<p>
Marine commanders at Camp Lejeune applied this concept of  &quot;off
duty&quot; to a local purveyor of pornography.  Eugene's Arcade
was placed off limits to military personnel. The shop's owner,
Eugene Enslin, filed a suit alleging violation of his constitutional
rights of free speech.  U.S. District Court Judge W. Earl Britt
dismissed the lawsuit, concluding that, &quot;A military commander
has an overriding duty to safeguard the morals, welfare and discipline
of his men.&quot;
<p>
A 1992 Department of the Navy memo states: &quot;A commanding
officer has broad responsibility to ensure the effective and efficient
operation of his/her command... [and] has authority to regulate
or ban activities that may be detrimental ... to good order, discipline,
and morale among command personnel.&quot; It is clear that commanding
officers may restrict base exchanges from selling materials that
promote illicit or offensive behavior.
<p>
In a 1992 letter to the Navy's Assistant Secretary for Manpower
and Reserve Affairs, the Navy Exchange Commander wrote: &quot;I
believe strongly that our Navy...should establish a Navy-wide
policy which states that material inconsistent with its core values,
which is demeaning to men or women of our Navy and which is contrary
to good order and discipline, will not be sold in exchanges.&quot;
<p>
In a 1992 memo to the Chief of Naval Operations, Captain P. W.
Kelley, a Navy lawyer, stated: &quot;In view of the mission of
the exchange system... adult periodicals can be excluded from
exchange shelves.&quot;
<p>
Several years ago, Americans learned that topless and bottomless
&quot;performers,&quot; male and female, were appearing under
military auspices at U.S. military bases in the Pacific.  When
these incidents were publicized, the Navy banned the sex shows.
 It argued, &quot;The issue of moral acceptability aside, on-base
activities such as these contribute to creating an environment
in which all females are regarded with less or no respect, and
abusive behavior toward all women is not only passively accepted
and condoned but encouraged.&quot;
<p>
It is clear that the Navy understands the detrimental effect of
pornographic materials and explicit sex-related entertainment.
 It is also clear that policies are in place to limit the availability
of such material or shows to service members.  The fact that defies
logic is that the services remain in the porn business.  Why?
<p>
Given the rise in sexual assaults and the growing attention devoted
to sexual harassment, the Navy must stop the sale of pornography through 
military installations. Unscrupulous businessmen are willing to sell the 
trash, but must taxpayer funded stores peddle depraved material at cut-rates 
and tax-free to servicemen worldwide?
<p>
Eckerd Drugs and 7-Eleven have voluntarily decided not to sell
sexually explicit material despite the loss of potential profits.
 Why does the U.S. government, which should stand for what is
right and moral in our country, not have the social conscience
of these commercial firms? 
<p>
Commander-in-Chief Bill Clinton has the unilateral authority to
remove pornographic material from military stores.  With the stroke
of a pen, his executive order could prohibit the sale of sexually
explicit materials in base exchanges all over the world.  Such
an order would surely be upheld in the courts, especially if based
on long respected claims of military deference.  We are waiting,
Mr. President.

<title>How Congress Can Help Trigger Reform in DC Schools -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>HOW CONGRESS CAN HELP TRIGGER REFORM IN D.C.'S SCHOOLS</i></h3>
By James F. Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/welcome.html.cgi">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 440<br>
November 1, 1995<br>
</center><hr width=50%>
<p>
Nowhere in America is there a greater need for innovative approaches to education than in the nation's capital. Amid the intense debate in Congress and around the country over education and the future of America's schools, little is being done to improve the educational system for the children of the District of Columbia. Fortunately, however, at the request of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), the Task Force on D.C. Schools and Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) have developed a plan that takes the first step towards giving the District's children the education they have a right to expect.
<p>
The dismal record of the District's schools is a national embarrassment. The city spends an average of almost $9,000 per year on its more than 80,000 enrolled students. This is the third-highest spending rate of any state or equivalent jurisdiction, some $3,000 above the average. Its student-teacher ratio (14.4 to 1) is the fourth-lowest of any state or equivalent jurisdiction. Yet SAT scores in the District rank 49th out of 51 (50 states plus D.C.), and its graduation rate is also 49th out of 51.
<p>
It is time for a drastic overhaul of the District of Columbia school system. Ideally, the pressure for this should come from within the District, but reformers have been frustrated by the fierce opposition to change, led by the school bureaucracy and the teachers union, that so far has stymied action from within the city. Congress, however, has a unique role in the District. Within the District of Columbia appropriations bill, it has an opportunity to help trigger local reform by adopting Representative Gunderson's proposal to improve educational opportunities for the District's children.
<p>
The Gunderson proposal authorizes the establishment of independent public charter schools, using existing D.C. public and private schools as well as new schools created with the help of universities in the District. It even authorizes many federal institutions within D.C., including the National Science Foundation and Smithsonian Institution, to help establish public charter schools.
<p>
The establishment of charter schools would help restructure the existing public school system, allowing innovative school principals and teachers to work with parents and academic institutions to overhaul the system. Under the Gunderson proposal, lower-income parents would have the right to choose an effective private school if they are not satisfied with their child's public school. This would hold the public schools to account.
<p>
Specifically, Representative Gunderson's proposal gives scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family income is at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family income is not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. These scholarships would allow low-income D.C. families to send their children to any private, independent religious or non-religious school located in the District of Columbia and the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and Maryland. They also would cover the cost of fees and other expenses for tutoring and instructional services after school hours and the costs of transportation for a student enrolled in a District of Columbia public school, public charter school, or private school participating in the tuition scholarship program. 
<p>
The Gunderson proposal establishes a special panel to develop tests to monitor the progress of the District's schools so that parents have real information on which to evaluate D.C.'s schools. This World Class Schools Panel would be responsible for developing a core curriculum for kindergarten through 12th grade. In addition, it would encourage more private-sector involvement in the District's schools.
<p>
The Gunderson proposal does not tell D.C. residents what schools they must have. Rather it creates the conditions and incentives for change. It is still up to parents, teachers, principals, and District institutions to take advantage of this opportunity.
<p>
The plan is not without its weaknesses. For one thing, it does nothing to help the D.C. Superintendent or parents break down the suffocating bureaucracy that swallows education dollars and thwarts reform. And while a "D.C. Desk" in the Department of Education might help D.C. schools locate resources and expertise to assist reform, there is a real danger that it will become just another force blocking reform. Despite these weaknesses and its limited scope, Representative Gunderson's proposal would be the crucial first step in ending business as usual in the District's school system. It would give parents, students, and innovative educators the tools they need to force change on a fossilized system. And it would give low-income families the chance to escape those public schools that refuse to give children the education they should expect in the nation's capital.

<i> &quot;Well, I think in the information age, too much information
and too much sort-of-quasi-information -- I mean, you guys have
to compete with near-news, too -- It's like, you know, like when
we were kids, we'd drink near-beer?  You've got all this information
and a lot competition among news sources and then you're competing
with the near-news and there is a danger that too much stuff cramming
in on people's minds is just as bad for them as too little in
terms of their ability to understand.&quot;
   </i>   <br><b>-- President Clinton</b>
<br>
               <I>The Washington Post</I>, 
                September 24, 1995
<P><hr width="50%">
<p> &quot;Too much information?&quot;  &quot;Near-news?&quot;  &quot;Ability
to understand?&quot;  In these informal remarks to a group of
reporters and producers, President Clinton appears to be having
second thoughts on the &quot;third wave&quot;.   In sharp contrast,
many commentators herald the much-acclaimed information revolution
precisely because it will empower individuals to convey and receive
their own news and information.  Who's right?  Are the many on-line
services, the Internet, talk radio and the sheer increase in electronic
outlets and programs a good thing?  More particularly, will they
lead to a more informed citizenry?
<P>
 There's no denying that Americans now enjoy an ever-expanding
range of outlets from which they can get a wealth of news and
information programming.  Focusing only on the electronic media,
98 percent of all U.S. homes can receive the major TV networks,
of which we now have four.  More than 90 percent of all households
can subscribe to cable TV and roughly 60 percent do.  Eighty-five
percent of all U.S. homes have VCRs.  Almost all can subscribe
to two one-hundred-channel direct broadcast TV systems (DBS) and
over a million have done so in the space of a year.  Ninety-four
percent of Americans can receive more than five TV  stations,
most of which carry locally originated programming.  By subscribing
to either cable or DBS, they can have more than a 100 additional
networks of information and programming.  Increasingly, AM radio
stations are adopting talk radio formats.  Local or nationally-syndicated
talk show hosts are giving millions of Americans the opportunity
to listen and discuss the issues of the day with  each other.
 Anyone with a telephone line, at least a 286 computer and modem
can access an online service and the Internet.  The three biggest
online services claim over 8 million subscribers and the entry
of Microsoft's new online service has caused sharp price reductions.
 
<P>
 Not surprisingly, this period of unprecedented change and opportunity
is causing many new companies to enter the market while others
are consolidating or forming alliances with each other.  Notably,
some of the nation's largest telephone companies are preparing
to enter the video market using their own facilities or recently
acquired radio frequencies.  At the same time they are forming
their own production companies and forming alliances with the
owners of existing programs.  Recently, three big networks, CBS,
ABC and TBS, have been acquired by large media companies.  
<P>
 Paradoxically, these developments have created two competing
sets of concerns for those leery of the ongoing changes in the
marketplace of ideas.  On the one hand, there are the President's
worries that the quality of the public debate is declining.  For
example, will the plethora of news sources make it too difficult
to carry on a coherent national discussion?  Do the talk show
and online discussions too often stray from the facts?  Or are
they too shrill, uncivil, or illiberal?  
<P>
 On the other hand, the Clinton Administration worries that the
House and Senate telecom bills  about to go to conference will
unduly relax statutory limitations on broadcast ownership.  Apparently,
the concern is that possible broadcast mergers may stymie public
debate by giving large companies too much control over the marketplace
of ideas.  Is the fear that we will then end up with too little
diversity of &quot;stuff cramming in on people's minds?&quot;
 
<P>
 Neither of these concerns is well-founded.  First, the Administration's
concern about media concentration is misplaced, especially if
the focus is on the broader marketplace of ideas.  Americans are
now enjoying  the benefits of more speakers than ever before even
if limited to traditional electronic media.  Given that the current
mergers are taking place in relatively unconcentrated markets
with low barriers to entry and are still subject to traditional
antitrust review, it is reasonable to assume that they are motivated
by the desire to become more efficient.  In competitive markets
any such improvements will largely benefit viewers and listeners,
often by improving program quality and diversity.  In addition
to existing competition, more and more Americans have wholly new
ways to express and receive ideas -- talk radio and online services
being two examples.
<P>
 Second, rather than be concerned that Americans are receiving
too much information which is reducing their ability to understand,
we should celebrate the new power Americans now enjoy to get news
and information.  This &quot;demassification&quot; of the media
(Alvin Toffler's term) will allow Americans, when they choose,
to get their news unfiltered through the established media.  This
is not to say that the reputation of news sources is not important.
 In fact, a speaker's trademark may become even more important
to listeners in the information age.  Listeners will continue
to have strong incentives to use trademarks and their own good
judgment to discern quality speech and speakers from the rest.
 What will be different is that a speaker's cost of reaching widespread
audiences has plummeted and will continue to fall.  
<P>
 This process is fundamentally healthy.  Old established speakers
with established franchises are and will continue to be challenged
by new sources.  Currently distrustful citizens will have alternatives
to turn to.  The old and the new media will criticize, check and
ultimately improve each other.  Remember the concerns the print
industry had regarding the introduction of radio?  Those who worry
about the onslaught of information and &quot;near news&quot; would
do well to remember the fundamental insight of Judge Learned Hand:
&quot;The First Amendment presupposes that the right conclusions
are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues,
than through any kind of authoritative selection.  To many this
is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our
all.&quot;

Program</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3>Clinton and Cisneros Wrecked a Good Housing Program</h3>
<i>November 1, 1995</i><P>

Letter to the Editor of <i>The Washington Times</i> 
</center> 
<hr> 
Dear Editor: 
<P> 
I was surprised to learn that, according to your Oct. 26 report ("HUD's 
relocation of urban poor targeted for ax," Nation), I had "launched" the 
Clinton administrations' Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Moving to 
Opportunity program to "address urban blight by moving poor people from 
public housing in inner cities to subsidized rental units in higher-income 
neighborhoods."
<P> 
In the Bush administration, the Moving to Opportunity program was first 
authorized Oct. 28, 1992,--two weeks before President Clinton's election 
victory.  The program was designed as a demonstration project to support a 
family's choice to use a rental voucher to move to privately owned housing in 
any neighborhood of the family's choosing--one that offered more job 
opportunities for parents and better education for children.  This was the 
essence of the Reagan idea of vouchers for housing instead of public housing 
construction.  As such, the program was the antithesis of the social 
engineering that resulted in the forced residency of low-income families in 
government-run housing projects in the inner city. 
<P>Unfortunately, by the time Moving to Opportunity was 
<i>launched</i> by the Clinton administration in 1994 (see "A helping hand 
or social engineering?" Nation, March, 15, 1994), the program had been 
transformed by HUD into a massive new fair-housing program to disperse 
low-income families to middle-income suburban neighborhoods.  HUD 
Secretary Henry Cisneros said he wanted to replicate this dispersal strategy in 
every city in the country.
<P> 
The Clinton/Cisneros plan distorted a program that was intended to 
support the housing vouchers--the cornerstone of conservative housing policy.  
That's unfortunate, but under the circumstances, Congress was right to end it.

<h3>William J. Bennett Discusses Abortion Controversy</h3> 
 
 
<b>Address to the Catholic Campaign for America 
<br>Washington, D.C.</b> 
<P><i>November 17, 1995</i></center><P>
<hr> 
<P> 
	As Catholics of the Catholic Campaign for America, we must address without hesitation, and 
with proper moral seriousness, the issue of abortion in America.  One and a half million 
abortions performed every year -- of which the overwhelming majority are performed on 
perfectly healthy women in order to prevent the births of perfectly healthy children -- is a 
national shame and a national catastrophe.   
<P> 
	But not only is this catastrophic in itself -- indeed, it is virtually a definition of catastrophe -- 
it is also horrible in its consequences on the sensibilities of the American people.  There is 
little doubt that the 30 million abortions since 1973 have had a coarsening effect on a people's 
attitudes toward its children; it has diminished our sense of natality.  And it has accelerated 
the growth of what Pope John Paul  II has correctly called the "culture of death." 
<P> 
	In addressing the abortion issue, we should never abandon principle.  We should invite as 
many people as possible to the affirmation of our clear end: significant reduction of the 
number of abortions.   
<P> 
	But reasonable people of good will can and do disagree on the <i>means</i> to reducing 
abortions.  Some would push for various forms of criminalization, some would not. Some 
believe a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion is the surest and best way to go; 
others, in good faith, doubt this.  Differences aside, it seems to me we ought to bring to the 
cause all those who look at the figure of one and a half million abortions a year with horror 
and misgiving.  We can admit that yes, there are some hard, wrenching cases, cases on which 
people of good will disagree.  But let us set aside the small number of hard cases and focus 
our efforts on the vast majority of cases on which most Americans do not feel moral 
ambiguity. 
<P> 
	My own view is this:  I believe <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was wrongly decided and based on  
flawed legal reasoning;  I support legislative efforts to expand the boundaries of legal 
protection for the unborn (such as waiting periods, parental notification, restriction of 
abortions after viability, and other such measures); I oppose the use of public funds to pay for 
abortion;  and I strongly support pro-life alternatives such as adoption and abstinence. 
<P>
	As for the specific issue of a constitutional amendment, I know many people feel strongly 
about it.  But for myself, I do not think it has done much good, and I also believe there may 
well be drawbacks to it.  Above all, I believe it has done nothing to help reduce the number of 
abortions.  And that is, after all, the crucial issue in this debate: <i>how to reduce the number 
of abortions in America</i>.	 
<P> 
	Abortion is a moral issue and the law should reflect that fact.  Current law refuses to 
demonstrate to people that abortion is even a serious issue, much less a moral one.  Our efforts 
should be to infuse into the law a heightened sense of the spiritual and human dimensions of 
the issue.  Provisions which highlight and stress the morality of the issue -- waiting periods, 
information about fetal life and possible consequences for the mother, and parental 
notification among others -- should be pursued vigorously, on the state level.  And the recent 
effort to ban partial-birth abortions seems to me both tactically smart and morally sound. 
<P> 
	I believe that there is a pro-life agenda that is both incremental <i>and</i> principled, 
politically realistic <i>and</i> ambitious.  Our nation, as it is today, will sustain certain legal 
reforms: ending late-term abortions and sex selection abortions; promoting informed consent; 
and requiring parental notification to end the desperate isolation of pregnant teens and to 
promote responsibility, communication, and mature decision making.  That is where we ought 
to concentrate our legal efforts. 
<P> 
	I recognize that some pro-life groups will consider this kind of incremental approach as too 
little.  To which I respond: the approach I am advocating recognizes that social reform must 
respect political realities if we hope to restrict abortion-on-demand.  "Public sentiment is 
everything," Lincoln said of American democracy.  "With public sentiment, nothing can fail; 
without it, nothing can succeed.  Consequently, he who molds public sentiment, goes deeper 
than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces decisions.  He makes statutes and decisions 
possible or impossible to be executed."  
<P> 
	I believe this type of pro-life movement would find the support of the majority of Americans -
- including many Democrats who are deeply troubled by the massive number of abortions 
which take place every year.    
<P> 
	There is an instructive historical analogy to which we can turn.  Research by Professor Marvin 
Olasky (author of <i>Abortion Rites: A Social History of Abortion in America</i>) has 
revealed something that most Americans on both sides of the abortion debate do not 
understand.  At the outset of the Civil War the abortion rate, in a smaller U.S. population, was 
almost exactly what it is today.  A pro-life movement, based in a network of shelters, began to 
actively oppose abortion by providing refuge to women in trouble.  Institutions like YWCA, 
the Salvation Army, and Florence Crittenton homes concentrated their efforts among 
prostitutes and young, urban women, impregnated and abandoned.  These activists worked for 
small victories, provided women with positive, pro-life alternatives to abortion, and fought for 
laws while not making them their primary focus.  The result?  Between 1860 and 1910, this 
steady, compassionate social pressure reduced the rate of abortions by over half.  And the rate 
stayed low until about 1960.  This model -- what Olasky refers to as "containment" as a way 
to achieve "roll back" -- is precisely the model anti-abortion advocates should look to and 
learn from.  It is politically viable and ultimately more effective and life-affirming. 
<P> 
	In another historical analogy, some have compared abortion in this century with slavery a 
century-and-a-half ago.  Many defenders of the rights of blacks had differing views on which 
specific efforts to abolish slavery in a democratic republic would prove most expedient, 
prudent,  and fruitful.  These were passionate debates about an important issue.  I believe the 
course of action chosen by abolitionists like Harriet Tubman offers greater promise than the 
course chosen by John Brown.  Again, I think we could learn much from Lincoln -- who 
proposed containing slavery so as to put it on the path to extinction.  The spirit of both Harriet 
Tubman and Abraham Lincoln would well serve the pro-life movement today. 
<P> 
	Finally, I want to express my deep respect for the pro-life people who have labored long and 
hard and selflessly on behalf of the unborn.  I am speaking here of the people in the crisis 
pregnancy centers, adoption agencies, and foster homes around this country.  Their work is 
among the most admirable in the nation.  These are the people who are doing the most to 
contain and reduce the numbers of abortion in America.  They are unsung heroes of our 
Republic.  It is time we give them the praise they deserve.

The Foundation's policy team -- staff, senior fellows, adjunct fellows and fellow travelers -- works to provide the political philosophy and public policies which will inform the civic discussion which is creating the next generation of American society and government.  The Foundation's Vice President for Policy, Bill Myers, guides that work (when tolerated), collaborates on it (when permitted), cajoles (often), harasses (sometimes),  and, in other ways, shepherds PFFs policy efforts.  So far, that work aims to assess The Big Change, divine The New Majority, replace the FCC, transcend the FDA, free public utilities, foster home ownership, and otherwise build a positive, practical vision for America.  When not so engaged, Myers threatens to play the part of Senior Fellow in order to write and speak on subsidiarity, federalism and public policies which are best addressed locally, topics on which he once frequently published.  Myers has previously provided more traditional direction to the policy activities of the Free Congress Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange, the State Policy Network, and the South Carolina Policy Council

After serving as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the Bush Administration, the longest tenure (47 months) of any HHS Secretary in U.S. History, Dr. Sullivan returned to Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM).  As Head of HHS, Dr. Sullivan oversaw the Federal agency responsible for the major health, welfare, food and drug safety, medical research and income security programs in service of the American people.<p>

Dr. Sullivan became the founding Dean and director of the Medical Education Program at Morehouse College in 1975, the first minority medical school founded in the United States in this century.  In 1978, MSM began operation as a two year program in the basic medical sciences, admitting its first class of 24 students.  On July 1, 1981, the Morehouse School of Medicine became independent from Morehouse College with Dr. Sullivan as its Dean and first President, and on July 1, 1983, MSM became a member of the Atlanta University Center.<p>

the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Cabinet/html/Department_of_State.html">State Departments</a> Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs into a real,
long-range think tank. He did. Its theme became -- and, in 1988, just in time --
world change. Vlahos was then commissioned to help turn the U.S. Navys
rangefinders toward Big Change, while at the Center for Naval Analyses. In the
Foundation, he has found a place that not only sees the ongoing transformation of
American life -- the Big Change -- but that actively seeks to be a part of it.
Now Vlahos writes, in print and in the ether, about where we are going and how we
will get there.</ul>

<HR>
27-November-1995

<P>
RUSTY


<p>Sorry -- this is going to have to be a short one. I've been in the Oval Office with Bill, Mrs. William J. Clinton, Bob Rubin, and Dick Morris. We were talking strategy for the coming budget battle, and I'm waiting for the meeting to resume. For the first time in months, we're feeling confident and ready to go to war!

<p> Mrs. WJC and Dick Morris have put Bill on a pretty stringent diet -- high fiber, low fat. As you must know, Rusty, ever since my New York Times bestseller Earth in the Balance (for which, by the way, I was paid a moderate advance and had my contract vetted by the Senate Ethics Committee -- just so you know), they've been clamoring for another Al Gore manuscript. Just last week I finalized it. It's a compilation of all of the changes and streamlining that we've done since my revolutionary ``Re-Inventing Government'' proposals. Let me tell you, I sweated over those 43 pages. But in the end it was worth it -- I smell another hit! 
<p>
And Tipper had a cute idea: put a picture of Bill five months ago on the front cover -- you know, puffy-faced, red-nosed, cottony-eyed, kind of a ``government before the Gore plan'' photo; and on the back cover, put a photo of the leaner, trimmer Bill as a ``government after the Gore plan'' photo. So now we're in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for the leaner and trimmer Bill to emerge. 
<p>
In this meeting, anyway, he's certainly holding his own. I recommended that we make no concessions, no compromises. He nodded in agreement.
<p>
``Absolutely,'' he said. ``I think there comes a time when we just say, 'Hey, there are some things that we believe in, some things we will absolutely not compromise on.'''
<p>
``Great!'' I said.Bill looked plaintively at Mrs. WJC. She nodded to Dick Morris. Dick reached into a pocket and removed a jumbo Snickers bar. Bill tore into it.
<p>
``Gosh,'' I said, ``that's a peculiar diet regimen.''
<p>
``Yeah, well . . .'' mumbled Bill, mouth full. He turned to Bob Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury. ``I raised taxes too much, didn't I?'' he asked.
<p>
Bob was about to reply, when Dick Morris snatched away what remained of the Snickers bar. Mrs. WJC took out a short ruler, and with amazing speed snapped it down hard on Bill's hand.
<p>
``Ow!'' he cried.
<p>
``There's more where that came from,'' she said.
<p>
I just looked out the window, embarrassed. You know me, Rusty: I say, ``Let Clinton be Clinton.''
<p>
Bob Rubin leaned forward and spoke, almost in a whisper. ``Mr. President, do you really think you raised my taxes too much?''
<p>
Bill was silent for a moment. Bob opened up his case and took out a large McDonald's bag. ``Look, Mr. President. Look what I've got! A Big Mac -- '' Bob removed the plastic box -- I made a mental note to tell him that it will take our precious environment 15,000,000,000 years to digest the box that contains a hamburger that will take him only 15 minutes to digest -- and Bob began to eat the Big Mac. He reached into the bag and pulled out another one.
<p>
``Well, lookee here! Another Big Mac, all warm and gooey. Who will help me eat this, I wonder?''
<p>Bill answered in a tiny voice, ``I will.''
<p>
Mrs. WJC got into the act. ``But why should he give it to you? You raised his taxes too much.''
<p>
``No I didn't.''
<p>
``I CAN'T HEAR YOU!''
<p>
``No I didn't!''
<p>
Bob tossed Bill the second Big Mac. Paper rustled, lettuce flew, special sauce splattered -- the whole thing was gone in an eyeblink.
<p>
The intercom buzzed. ``Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich on conference call, Mr. President.''
<p>
Bill reached for the phone. Mrs. WJC waved her ruler. Dick Morris produced a large pepperoni pizza.
<p>
``Hello, Senator, Mr. Speaker,'' Bill said. ``I must tell you that I'm very disappointed in your budget bill. I think it declares war on the poor and underprivileged, it maintains a generous welfare for businesses and lobbyists, and I plan to veto it.''
<p>He paused for a moment, while Dole and Gingrich spoke. After a moment or two, Mrs. WJC put away her ruler, and Dick Morris put the pizza down on the credenza.
<p>
Bill cleared his throat. ``Actually, Newt,'' he said, ``I see your point. And Senator, in a way I agree with you, too. Maybe if we all sit down -- ''
<p>
Mrs. WJC yanked the phone from the wall. Dick Morris tossed the pizza aside and asked if Bob and I would excuse them. As we crept out, a few aides wheeled in a large caterer's steam table, laden with pies, ribs, butte red corn, and a suckling pig.
<p>
I never realized that letting Clinton be Clinton would be so fattening.

<html><head><title>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - October 1995</title></head><body><h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>NOVEMBER 1995</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	Other than political pundits and political junkies, most Americans have not yet turned their attention to the 1996 presidential race. President Clinton will apparently be the Democratic nominee and has shored up his base during the last few months.
<P>
The re-entry of Ross Perot into the election equation with his newly-formed third party--the Independence Party (the Reform Party in some states where there is a name conflict)-has heartened Democrats because it is perceived that Perot takes more potential votes from the political right than he does the political left.
<P>
In polls taken earlier this year, Clinton was losing to a then unnamed Republican presidential opponent. Now he beats the front-runner among GOP candidates, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, by several percentage points. Clinton's opponents usually make the mistake of underestimating his political tenacity and dexterity--at their peril. Remember: Former President George Bush was receiving 90 percent approval ratings a year-and-a-half before the 1992 general election.
<P>
There is an obvious yearning among the electorate for a president with leadership abilities, who inspires and presents a vision for the next millennium. Clinton has described the public mood as that of being in a "funk." Some have compared this description to that of President Carter's "malaise" speech during the year leading up to his re-election defeat. But the state of the public's mood runs much deeper. In many ways, Americans are depressed about their future. Media constantly bombard them with bad news--conflict, controversy and grim statistics.
<P>
The political process, including incessant media frenzies, has resulted in the denigration of nearly every American hero, living or dead. They want to tighten their fiscal belts, but depressed wages often keep them from doing the right thing The two major parties often appear to be more interested in making each other look bad, than explaining to voters exactly what is going on.
<P>
What the existing crop of Republican contenders are faced with is high expectations from a cynical public which has been disillusioned by its political leaders in recent years. Dole, et al, are campaigning in this complex environment and do not appear to making much headway.
<P>
Dole, the only candidate who has a significant amount of support from likely Republican primary voters, does not seem to be generating much enthusiasm. His support, at best, is sot The other candidates are registering in single digits with voters in most polls. The only people who seem to be benefiting from the GOP primary process are political consultants, who get paid to spend a candidate's money until it runs out.
<P>
Enter General Colin Powell. So far, he maintains high name identification and respect among the public, the media hasn't yet bloodied him up with stories about past mistakes, and he has not been forced to be about many of the pressing issues of the day. Some people see him as a savior for what ails America; some are not so sure.
<P>
But it is clear from the current political climate that voters are not going to settle for someone who doesn't make them optimistic about the future, someone they can trust, someone they can be proud to call "Mr. President."

spoke movingly of how America's founding documents and the abolition 
of slavery are linked with the moral causes of today.  &quot;President
Lincoln's question is no less a question for the present generation
of Americans,&quot; the pope said in Baltimore.  &quot;Democracy cannot 
be sustained without a shared commitment to certain moral truths
about the human person and human community.&quot;

As slavery was in the years before the Civil War, abortion is
a defining moral question.  The issue &quot;that will not go away&quot; 
is once again on the front burner of public debate.  Interestingly enough,
while talk grows among some leading conservatives about the circumstances
under which they could endorse &quot;pro-choice&quot; politicians, several 
leading liberal publications are giving space to the weightiest arguments 
against abortion on demand.
<p>
<center><h3>Facing Reality</h3></center>
<p>
The cover story in September's <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> is devoted to
abortion.  Prof. George McKenna of the City College of New York writes 
of the inescapable parallels between the pro-slavery and 
pro-abortion movements, including their rhetoric of &quot;privacy,&quot;
&quot;choice,&quot; and the insistence that &quot;religion&quot; should 
not interfere in the controversy. McKenna argues that abortion opponents
should adopt a &quot;Lincolnian&quot; position designed not to
outlaw abortion immediately through legislation, but to restrict it while 
galvanizing public opinion against the practice.
<p>
Naomi Wolf, an avowed feminist, writes in an Oct. 16 <i>New Republic</i>
article entitled &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls&quot; that the feminist 
movement errs when it fails to acknowledge that abortion is an 
&quot;evil,&quot; that it kills &quot;children&quot; and traumatizes many 
women. While Wolf does not abandon her &quot;pro-choice&quot; position, 
she does urge defenders of abortion to embrace a &quot;moral framework&quot; 
that mourns the loss of the aborted child.
<p>
To these ripples must be added the wave caused by the partial
conversion of Norma McCorvey to the anti-abortion cause.  McCorvey, 
the &quot;Jane Roe&quot; of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, recently abandoned the
pro-abortion camp and was baptized a Christian.  In an interview
on <i>ABC News</i>, she cited the grief that overwhelmed her when she 
saw &quot;empty swings&quot; in a park and thought of the children
whose deaths by abortion she had helped to cause.

<center><i><font size=+2>"ABORTION IS A DEFINING<br>
MORAL QUESTION . . ."</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>Taking Action</h3></center>
<p>
While the public debate takes new turns, Congress has begun to
take forthright action to restrict abortion.  The House of 
Representatives voted in August to ensure that no federal health monies
would be denied to medical schools that refuse to abide by the
new abortion training mandate from the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education. The House also reinstated a
stronger version of the Hyde Amendment limiting federal abortion
funding.  Both of these amendments, plus a ban on federally supported 
human embryo research, were attached to the 1996 Labor, Health and 
Human Services appropriation bill.
<p>
Perhaps the most important measure right now is the Partial Birth
Abortion Ban Act (H.R. 1833), cosponsored by 152 members of Congress, 
including 25 Democrats. A &quot;partial birth&quot; abortion is
a technique used to kill babies in the second or third trimester.
 It involves deliberately breech-delivering the baby alive until only 
his/her head remains in the mother's uterus while the rest of the
body protrudes into the birth canal.  The abortionist then jabs
surgical scissors into the base of the
baby's skull, opens the scissors to widen the cavity, then uses
a vacuum catheter to suction out the
brain.  Delivery of the now-dead baby with its collapsed skull
completes the procedure. A vote in the full House -- an historic 
moment in the rejuvenated national abortion debate -- is imminent.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Time is short.  Call 202-225-3121.  Urge your representative to
vote for H.R. 1833, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.  At the same 
time, urge him or her to stand fast for the pro-life House
positions in the 1996 Labor, Health, and Human Services bill.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="tax>
<b>Families First.</b>  The long struggle to provide tax relief for America's
families took a big step forward as the Senate Finance Committee approved 
a permanent $500 per-child tax credit on Oct. 19.  Marriage penalty relief, 
expanded individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and adoption tax
credits were also included.  Since the House has already approved
an even larger tax relief package with similar provisions, it appears that 
Congress will soon put family tax relief on the President's desk.  White 
House officials continue to threaten a Presidential veto.
<p>
<b>Careering.</b>  Hasty politicking on job training bills has both houses
talking dollars but not sense. The Careers Bill (H.R. 1617) and the 
Workforce Development Act (S. 143) streamline federal job
training programs but fail to uproot elements of Goals 2000 and
the School-to-Work initiative, with its central economic planning features. 
Congressmen are playing right into this agenda by
mandating data collection for a vast Labor Market Information
System, and promoting the National Skill Standards Board.  H.R. 1617 and 
S. 143 passed in their respective houses and passage in some form now 
seems certain.
<p>
<b>Back from the Brink.</b>  According to the 1995 Trustees Report, Medicare
will be bankrupt by the year 2002 unless major reforms are enacted.  
The full House approved reforms on Oct. 19 which 
introduce competition and choice into the failing Medicare system.
 In addition to capping the growth in Medicare spending, Medisave 
accounts for seniors -- similar to those proposed for
working families in Rep. Bill Archer's (R-Tex.) H.R. 1818 -- would
be established.  These accounts would allow seniors to choose their 
own doctors and pay for services not covered by a
traditional insurance plan (i.e., prescription drugs or long-term
care premiums).
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Red-blooded Change.</b>  For years, the American Red Cross has produced
AIDS materials full of misinformation.  Condoms have been emphasized 
instead of behavioral change.  Recently, however, Red Cross officials 
reversed course, calling for abstinence, HIV testing, partner notification,
and discouragement of  illegal behavior.  The largest federally-funded
AIDS education group, Red Cross still has a ways to go, however, since 
it still uses a &quot;nonjudgmental approach to HIV/AIDS 
education&quot; for youth, omitting the terms &quot;husbands&quot;
and &quot;wives&quot; in favor of  &quot;partners&quot; and
portraying homosexuality as no different from heterosexuality.
<p>
<b>Teen Trends.</b> New studies from the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) find that: 1) births to teenage mothers declined by 4 percent 
from 1991-1993; 2) teen pregnancy rates (including both
births and abortions) were down in a majority of states; and 3)
after 50 years of increases, birth
rates among unwed women of all ages have leveled off for three
years at 45.3 per 1,000 unmarried women.  These encouraging figures 
coincide with an increase in both abstinent teenagers and in states 
adopting legislation encouraging abstinence education.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Out of Control.</b> The large volume of calls from indignant parents
and teachers to the National Education Association (NEA) indicate the union 
went too far when it decided to promote the 
&quot;celebration of a Lesbian and Gay History Month&quot; endorsed
by homosexual groups and the American Historical Association.  At 
least one of the groups promoting the October observance
seems ready to admit defeat.  The president of the Gay, Lesbian,
and Straight Teachers Network told an <i>Education Week</i> reporter 
that the conservative reaction was &quot;beyond our control.&quot; 
<p>
<b>Capping Debate.</b> When members of the House and Senate meet soon
to strike agreements on a welfare reform bill, the defining issue will 
be the family cap. If passed, the cap would deny a
federally-funded increase in cash benefits to mothers who bear
additional children while on welfare.  While modest in scope, the 
cap is a critical first step in a larger effort to renew personal
responsibility.  Massachusetts recently went further by introducing
the first legislation in the nation that would terminate cash payments 
to unwed teenage mothers.
<p><a name="poll">
<b>FRC Survey.</b>  FRC's fourth annual Family Issues Survey, to be released
in late November, shows that most Americans (66 percent) believe &quot;things 
have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track&quot; -- compared 
to 21 percent who feel that things in America are on the
&quot;right track.&quot;  High &quot;wrong-track&quot;
perceptions usually reflect economic problems, and, indeed, a
new Census Bureau study shows that middle-class incomes showed no 
gains last year.  Earnings for full-time workers actually
dropped.  However, FRC's poll also shows that the majority (61
percent) of those who think the country is on the wrong track cite 
&quot;the breakdown of the family and a decline in values&quot; rather
than U.S. economic problems.

<h3>Colorado Ambush?</h3>
<p>
Oral argument was held Oct. 10 in the U.S. Supreme Court over
Colorado's Amendment Two.  A decision is expected in early spring.  At 
issue is the voter-approved referendum amending Colorado's state 
constitution so that homosexuals do not qualify for special rights. 
The measure invalidates special homosexual rights laws in several cities,
including Aspen, Boulder and Denver, but was struck down by Colorado's 
liberal state supreme court.
<p>
Amendment Two was initiated by Coloradans who perceived that homosexual
rights laws threaten their freedoms of religion, association and speech, 
as well as economic liberties.  For example, Boy Scout programs have 
been attacked in many places where &quot;gay rights&quot; laws are in
effect.
<p>
If the tone of the questioning by justices was any indication,
the Amendment could be in for a rough ride.  Led by Clinton appointees 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, six justices asked questions 
that seemed hostile.  Only Justice Antonin Scalia vigorously defended 
the law, arguing that the people of Colorado do not discriminate merely
by approving limits on special rights for particular groups -- 
particularly those which are not bona fide minorities. Scalia noted
that many states prohibit bigamy and homosexual conduct.  If these
laws are constitutional, he asked, then why can't Colorado bar special 
status for sexual orientation?
<p>
Justice Ginsburg answered that Colorado repealed sodomy laws in
1972, and that passage of the Amendment constituted a denial of 
homosexuals' access to the political process.  Scalia said,
however, that if that logic is applied, then all groups disadvantaged
by state laws, including smokers, have suffered unconstitutional 
discrimination.
<p>
Oral arguments do not dictate how a case will be decided, but
the hearing showed just how liberal the court remains in some crucial areas. 
Family Research Council filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief warning that delicate matters are best resolved through
laws that reflect bedrock cultural values.  Drafted by attorney 
Melissa Wells-Petry, who has written widely in support of the
military's ban on homosexuals, the brief warns that a reversal
of Amendment Two would constitute as large and destructive a judicial 
power grab as occurred in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> (1973).

<p>
<h3>Kinsey Breakthrough</h3>
<p>
Answering charges raised by FRC's new video, <i>The Children of 
Table 34</i>, Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft told the 
<i>Indianapolis Star</i> (Sept. 19) that he believes the child sex data 
in the famous Kinsey Report from the 1940s was the work of one pedophile.
This account contradicts that of Alfred C. Kinsey himself, who wrote in 
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> (1948) that explicit sexual 
data on 317 youngsters was collected by nine pedophiles.
<p>
Kinsey's findings continue to be the most influential data on
sex research published in this century.  Because the data have been 
used to validate the idea of child sexuality that animates most of
sexology and today's sex education, public illumination of Kinsey's
ethical swamp may lead to educational, legal and scientific reform. 
FRC is pressing Congress for an investigation into the
Kinsey Institute's child sexuality files, whose existence Dr.
Bancroft has now confirmed.  First
questions:  Who was the aforementioned pedophile and how did he
get access to hundreds of children, including infants?  Dr. Judith 
Reisman, who first explored the Kinsey child data in a 1981 monograph, 
and later in the 1990 book <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</i>
with co-author Edward Eichel and editors Dr. J. Gordon Muir and Dr. 
John H. Court, says she is encouraged that the 50-year-old mystery 
might finally be solved.
<P>
Meanwhile, FRC is appealing the Public Broadcasting Service's
rejection of <i>The Children of Table 34</i> for airing. PBS 
designates June as Gay Pride Month and, in mid-October, began 
running a four-part series celebrating homosexual activism.  This
same PBS says that the FRC video presents a &quot;conflict&quot; 
because FRC, as a pro-family group, has an interest in the material. 
Presumably, the &quot;conflict&quot; is that the film accords with
FRC's stated aim of protecting children from sexual abuse.
<p>
The Kinsey Institute is still a heavy recipient of taxpayer money
through its connection with Indiana University.  Kinsey's work and 
continuing influence are long overdue for public scrutiny.

<p>
<font size=+3>R</font>ecently I ran into Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania after a lunch in the Senate Dining Room in the U.S. Capitol. 
Many times the senator and I have taken debater's chairs opposite each 
other, even discussing some of our differences on national television.
<p>
&quot;You're the only one who will debate with me about abortion,&quot;
he told me and joked that we should take our &quot;act&quot; on the road.
It has been a privilege for me to talk about social issues on
behalf of the many people who support the Family Research Council. Every 
day, reporters from organizations such as <i>The New York Times</i>, 
<i>The Washington Post</i> and the nightly news shows call us
at FRC for our -- and what we hope is your -- perspective.  But usually 
an hour-long conversation with a reporter becomes a 10-second soundbite 
on the network news or less than an inch of copy at the bottom of a 
two-column story.
<p>
Not any longer.  Our dream of providing a pro-family voice is
much bigger than merely building a conservative &quot;speed bump&quot; 
in a vast terrain of liberal reporting. That is why we are about to
premiere our own television show.  Our vision is to help a national
audience understand not only what we believe but why we support the kind 
of pro-family reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is 
to make a connection with even more of those millions of Americans
who go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world
their children are inheriting.
<p>
Beginning Wednesday, Nov. 1, &quot;Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council&quot; will air at 8 p.m. on the new cable network 
National Empowerment Television (NET). We will be coming to
you on a weekly basis thereafter.
<p>
The show includes such segments as &quot;Behind the Headlines,&quot;
an insider's look at what is happening to the family in Washington, 
and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; which will highlight what FRC
has been doing to bolster the family.  The majority of our show,
however, will be fast-paced discussions of the answers pro-family 
advocates offer to the tough social questions we face today.
<p>
We believe &quot;Straight Talk&quot; has the potential to break
out of the 10-second soundbite box that conservatives usually occupy 
on television.  Family issues deserve in-depth treatment.  Most of
all, we hope to provide you with the kind of informative discussion
that will help you in your own understanding of the state of the 
family today -- in politics, in society, and beyond.
<p>
This is an exciting new venture for FRC.  NET now reaches into
more than 11 million homes and is growing daily. &quot;Straight Talk&quot; 
is an important addition to the network's menu.  We invite you to
watch and share your comments with us as the show unfolds.
<p>
Here's thanking you in advance for the kind of support that has
made &quot;Straight Talk&quot; possible.

<h4>Lobbying Reform</h4></center>
<p><hr width=30% size=2><p>
For years, political advocacy groups have taken advantage of the
public purse to finance their agenda.  Groups like Planned Parenthood 
receive millions of federal dollars each year, even as 
they engage in high-powered lobbying and political advocacy.
<p>
During its consideration of a multi-billion dollar appropriations
bill earlier this year, the House of Representatives adopted an 
amendment to prohibit recipients of federal grants from spending any
grant funds on political advocacy.  The amendment, sponsored by
Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.), also proposed strict limits on the 
amount of political advocacy a grantee could engage in with
&quot;non-grant&quot; funds.  Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) chairs
a House subcommittee that has held hearings and urged limits on such 
advocacy.
<p>
A coalition of liberal organizations has mounted a fierce campaign
to scuttle lobbying reform. This campaign has stalled the Treasury-Postal 
appropriations bill for several weeks.  The Clinton
Administration is threatening a veto if the Istook-McIntosh provision
is included in the final bill. The issue is likely to come to a head in 
mid-November.
<p>
<b>Action Item:</b> Call your congressman and senators today.  Tell
them it is time for genuine reform of the congressional spending process. 
A vital first step is to end &quot;welfare&quot; for lobbyists.

To help politicians summon the courage to scale back the role

initiative to cultivate charitable alternatives to the welfare state.

<h2>Breaking the Telecom Logjam
</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/director.html">G.A. Keyworth, II</a>
<P>
	As the House and Senate Conferees resolve the differences in the telecom bills passed by their respective bodies, they should keep one imperative in mind: "It's time to break the telecom logjam."  For the average American  these bills have undoubtedly gotten lost in a confusing swirl of competing claims and counterclaims about whether the bills will foster or undercut telephone competition.  Of late, the public discourse has been further confused by Clinton Administration contentions that the telecom bills would lead to undue media concentration and price gouging by cable TV companies.
<P>
	While widespread disaffection with this process would be understandable, a "pox on both your houses" attitude is a mistake.  The stakes for American consumers and workers in reforming telecom policy are immense.
<P>
	Starting in the mid-1970s Congress has time and again considered telecom legislation only to see the process stumble, stall and fail.  In this vacuum, the antitrust divestiture court, Federal Communications Commission, and the 50 states have set telecom policy.  At the national level, pro-competition policies were promoted by the divestiture court and the FCC.  Competition in the long distance, telephone equipment, and information services markets has flourished.  While some states have begun to open local telecom markets to competition, Congress now has a unique opportunity to jump-start this process by preempting state and local entry barriers and liberalizing related long distance, cable and broadcast regulation.  Congressional action would free up this dynamic sector and assure that the competitive process evolves naturally and produces a myriad of new digital services at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
	The importance of these coming contests is underscored by the many impressive preparations the combatants are undertaking to ready themselves to compete.  Most notable is AT&T's recent announcement that it will divest its network equipment business.  This second divestiture by AT&T will free it of any business conflicts with the Baby Bells who buy a lot of network equipment as it begins to compete in local telephone markets.  AT&T also has acquired McCaw Cellular, the largest independent cellular company, giving it the "wireless" capacity to compete with local telephone companies.  Also, a  consortia of cable companies and Sprint made winning bids of more than $2 billion in recent FCC auctions for wireless frequencies.  Finally, Hughes Satellite, Hubbard Broadcasting, Motorola and others have or will be embarking on satellite strategies.  These developments represent only a glimmer of the competitive energies that these telecom bills are about to unleash.
<P>
	The Clinton Administration and others claim that  passage of these bills would be a mistake.  They contend the bills will permit undue media concentration, lead to higher cable TV rates, and insufficiently guard against abuse by the Baby Bells of their local telephone monopoly.  These objections are either misplaced or can be worked out.
<P>
	The bills will not permit undue media concentration for two reasons.  First, all significant media mergers would still have to pass antitrust review.  Second, the radio and television markets (where the critics are most concerned) have seen hundreds of new stations come on line in the past five years, have low levels of concentration and face powerful challenges from competitors offering hundreds of channels, such as direct broadcast TV satellites (DBS), cable TV systems and telephone "video on demand" systems.
<P>
	Likewise, intrusive cable rate regulation is no longer productive.  Aside from the fact that cable faces competition from broadcast and DBS, cable regulation has simply not worked well.  It has been difficult for regulators to regulate cable systems, because cable prices are only one of several variables within the cable operator's control.  As a result cable rate regulation has likely led cable operators to reduce programming investment and quite possibly explains the failure of  the cable-telephone mega-mergers announced in 1993.
<P>
	The competitive issues implicated by the dispute between the local and long distance companies are admittedly more complex.  As much as we can be hopeful that local competition will flourish in most areas for most Americans, we are not there yet.  What preconditions the Baby Bell companies should meet before being allowed to enter the long distance market is something over which reasonable Nobel Laureates can disagree.  The House and Senate proposals are reasonable ones, though, and the time has come for the legislative leaders and President to cut the Gordian knot.
<P>
	These bills are not perfect by any means.  For example, they duck the important issues of reducing residential phone subsidies and freeing up radio spectrum use.  A Progress & Freedom Foundation study recommended these reforms as part of a fundamental reform package which would replace the Federal Communication Commission and rely even more on market forces.  These and other legislative improvements will have to await a "second" bite of the apple.
<P>
	Finally, there is no denying that these complicated bills evidence a lot of  "sausage-making."  Nonetheless, they replace a smorgasbord of federal law, FCC rules, divestiture court jurisprudence and state regulation.  In so doing, the telecom legislation would open local telephone markets to competition from long distance and cable TV companies, open the long distance market to competition from the Baby Bells, and open cable TV markets to competition from the local telephone company.  While many important issues would be left to the FCC and state regulators, reform along the lines of the bills would constitute a "great competitive leap forward."

<h2>When Will Government Be Back in Business?</h2>

After much talk and fanfare, the "<a href="/townhall/spotlights/9-18-95/welcome.html.cgi">train wreck</a>" is upon us and the Federal government has closed  (has anyone noticed?).  What that really means is that as of noon today (11/14/95), all nonessential services were stopped .  Which makes us ask, if some services are nonessential, why are taxpayers paying for them?<p> 

Never wanting to miss an opportunity to give away T-shirts to our users, weve' come up with a little contest.  When do you think the government will be reopened?  The rules are simple.  If you correctly guess the day and time at which the President signs the reconciliation bill, you will be eligible to win one of our fine shirts. 
<p>
The person who guesses correctly, or comes the closest, will be the winner.  If two or more get the day and time right, the recipient will be randomly selected from a pool made up of those who guessed correctly.  All submissions sent after the announcement of an agreement between the Congress and the President will not be eligible.  Remember, only one guess per person.
<p>
Let us know what you think about the closing of the Federal government.  Depending on ones political outlook, this is 
 either a disaster or a godsend.  One thing is sure, commuting into our Capitol Hill offices will be much easier as
long as this situation continues.

<title>Commerce Department Funds Blatant Lobbying -- Heritage</title>

<b>Government Integrity Project Report #7<br>
November 7, 1995</b>

<p><blockquote>

No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any...printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, to favor or oppose...any legislation....</blockquote>
<center>											18 USC 1913</center>
<p>
Opponents of the effort to end 40 years of political corruption manifested in a system of taxpayer-subsidized lobbying often state that existing federal law already prohibits using grant funds for advocacy.  They cite the above section of the U.S. Code to defend this view.
<p>
	It appears, however, that the law is irrelevant.  In recent weeks, the Department of Commerce has provided $200,000 to HandsNet, Inc., a California group which operates an online computer service focused on lobbying and available on the Internet.  According to its own Internet-based documents, HandsNet links "5,000 public interest and human service organizations across the United States."  Among the services offered: "the latest Action Alerts."
<p>
	A description of the grant award1 prepared by the grant provider, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (part of the Commerce Department), specifically mentions that the grant will allow "National organizations [to] help local ones keep up to date by publicizing action alerts...."  A recent selection of alerts includes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>"Istook Amendment--Call Your Representatives 10/30/95"</b><br>
"Now is the time to turn up the heat.... So Call, E-Mail, or Fax Your Representative Today!"
<p>
<li><b>"Give President Clinton a Wake-Up Call"</b><br>
"If President Clinton signs immoral welfare and Medicaid 'reform' bills, the 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for children will be destroyed."
<p>
<li><b>"Stop English-only Proposals in Congress 10/24/95"</b><br>
"Call and write to your Representative and Senator. Ask to meet with them directly."
<p>
<li><b>"Congress Yields To Traditional Values Coalition"</b><br>
"The hearing, dubbed 'Parental Involvement in Social Issues in Education'...is likely to become a tax-funded platform for gay bashing."
</ul><p>
Each of the alerts is supported by information to describe what action needs to be taken and what arguments can be used to lobby Congress most effectively.

<p>

<b>About the Grant to HandsNet</b>
<p>
	The $200,000 awarded to HandsNet, Inc., of California was to be used for the nationwide training of public interest organizations on how to use the Internet more effectively. The NTIA award summary states that HandsNet "will train 250 organizations in Internet skills, so that they can publish information on the new system."	In addition, HandsNet will "conduct a national outreach campaign" to introduce human services groups to the Internet.
<p>
	The major component of the grant appears to be a new training center in Washington, D.C. The center will be fully functional around January 1, 1996, according to HandsNet documents, but is housed temporarily at the headquarters of Families USA (funder of the 1994 Clinton health care bus caravans).  The national center will be operated in conjunction with the Institute for Global Communications, also of California.
<p>
<b>About HandsNet</b>
<p>
	In reviewing the HandsNet site on the Internet, it appears that its principal purpose is explicit political advocacy.  The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, among many other issues.  The three key information components provided are Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest (a summary of the alerts), and daily updates on key issues.  According to its Internet site, HandsNet is affiliated with the Institute for Global Communications, an arm of the Tides Foundation.  Members of HandsNet include the major opponents of the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich reform effort, including OMB Watch and the Alliance for Justice.
<p>
<b>About the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure 
Assistance Program (TIIAP)</b>
<p>
	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program is operated by NTIA in the Commerce Department.  Under the Clinton Administration, this program has mushroomed in cost, from $10 million in FY 1994 to $25 million in FY 1995.  In 1994 there were 92 grants; in the most recent round (to be announced in mid-November, but already awarded), there are 120.  There also are indications that the TIIAP may subsidize other lobbying activities, in addition to those of HandsNet, Inc.
<p>
	According to NTIA documents, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America received $300,000 in 1994 to set up a "nationwide on-line information system" for itself and all 164 affiliates.  Also in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet received funding to "establish a network of regional field representatives" and "demonstrate a model for building a national grassroots information system," among other things.
<p>
	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, ACORN (which led noisy demonstrations in Congress earlier this year), the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and Citizens Fund (an affiliate of Citizen Action, an active grassroots lobbying organization).  It is unclear which, if any, will receive funding.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The Commerce Department, through NTIA, has awarded a grant to an online lobbying organization for the specific purpose of engaging more groups in its Internet advocacy efforts.  The $200,000 gift to HandsNet, Inc., to train people in the publishing of action alerts and other lobbying materials represents a blatant misuse of taxpayer funds.
<P>
	Supporters of taxpayer-funded political patronage argue that the current system is designed to prevent abuses.  The case of the Commerce Department and HandsNet, Inc., provides a serious test of this claim. The fact that such a significant grant could be made with no effort to hide the fact that it directly funds lobbying activities clearly demonstrates the need for Congress to reform this costly and irresponsible form of political corruption.

<P>
<P>
The much-touted "train wreck" has been averted with the adoption of continuing resolutions.  The House and Senate have passed their versions of the budget.  Now members from each house must meet to iron out a final package to send to President Clinton.
<P>
Both the House and Senate versions of the budget reduce the government's burden on citizens and introduce better incentives for savings and investment.  President Clinton has vowed to veto any budget that closely resembles those passed in the houses of Congress; some Republicans are in favor of allowing the budget ceiling to expire if Clinton refuses to move to the right.  Who will flinch first?  The political manuevering is bound to be exciting!  
<P>
This week, <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> focuses on the final phase of the budget process:  conference.

<title>Where Teachers Send Their Own Children To School -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>WHERE TEACHERS SEND THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO SCHOOL</i></h3>
By Denis Doyle and James Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Business/Education Insider No. 42<br>
October-November 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<blockquote>"If teachers and their organizations reject the institutions they are teaching in and feel free to choose a private alternative, on what basis should other parents, particularly the poor and dispossessed, be denied this option?"</blockquote><p>
  This pointed question was posed by Denis Doyle, Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Educational Policy, during a recent lecture in Washington on his latest study, which shows where public school teachers send their children to school.
<p>
Drawing on 1990 Census data, Doyle finds that, taken together, public and private school teachers nationwide are only slightly more likely than the general public to choose private schools (17.1 percent to 13.1 percent). But in America's most troubled cities, the pattern is quite different:  Public school teachers are two to three times more likely than the general public to use private schools. For example, in Washington, D.C., 25.7 percent of the children of the city's public school teachers who make less than $35,000 attend private school. This is more than double the national average; among public school teachers nationwide, 11.9 percent enroll some or all of their children in private school. The pattern continues in cities like Boston (24.4 percent), New York (21.4 percent), Miami (35.4 percent), and Los Angeles (18.9 percent). As Doyle observes, "in America's cities, where the schools are arguably the worst, a large number of teachers abandon the institutions in which they work and enroll their offspring in private schools."
<p>
Doyle's study also analyzes the relationship between race and a public school teacher's use of private schools. Doyle finds that, nationally, black public school teachers use private schools more than white public school teachers (12.9 percent to 11.9 percent), and Hispanic public school teachers use private schools more than non-Hispanic public school teachers (16.5 percent to 11.9 percent). Meanwhile, white parents are somewhat more likely than nonwhite parents to send their children to private school. In the United States as a whole, 13.1 percent of all parents, 14.2 percent of white parents, 8.1 percent of black parents, and 10.8 percent of parents of other races send their children to private schools. Some 13.4 percent of Hispanic parents send their children to private school, while 10.1 percent of all non-Hispanic parents do so.
<p>
Doyle notes that black public school teachers are almost as likely as the public at large to use private schools (12.9 percent compared with 13.1 percent). He concludes that "black teachers who can afford a choice exercise it:  they are 50 percent more likely than black parents in general to enroll their children in private school. This might explain the high support for publicly funded school choice programs among minorities--they are often in the worst school districts and are more inclined to put their children in private schools when they can afford it."
<P>
Doyle says that "teachers--public and private, white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, low income, middle income, and high income--know how to address the nation's education crisis:  they vote with their feet and their pocket books. They choose private schools for their children when they think it serves their interests best."
<p>
"When public-school teachers choose private schools," says Doyle, "the truth is self-evident:  although they work in public schools they choose private schools for their own children because they believe the latter are better. They are connoisseurs."
<p>

<p>
<b>WISCONSIN PRIVATE PHILANTHROPISTS SUPPORT CHOICE</b>
<p>
In response to an August 25 Wisconsin State Supreme Court injunction halting the expansion of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (MPCP) to include religious, independent, and newly founded schools, private citizens in Wisconsin donated more than $1.8 million as of September 22 to help give the children of Milwaukee the right to stay in the schools of their choice. The campaign was led by Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE), Milwaukee's privately funded scholarship program. Of the $1.8 million raised for the fund, $1 million came from the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee and $125,000 was donated by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.
<p>
The Court's August 25 ruling put a stop to the Milwaukee choice expansion program and left more than 2,300 children stranded after they had already signed up for classes in the religious schools of their choice. The state and local teachers' unions, along with the ACLU, backed the lawsuit which resulted in the temporary injunction.
<p>
The case is to be heard soon by the Wisconsin State Supreme Court, and a decision is expected before the end of the year. According to the Landmark Legal Foundation of Kansas City, Missouri, which is providing legal support for the children, "the Milwaukee school choice litigation will ultimately result in a major U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing school choice programs that include religious programs."

<b>HIGH MARKS FOR WISCONSIN SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b>
<p>
In a related development, Family Service America (FSA), the largest international non-profit association dedicated to strengthening family life through education and research, has completed its independent, third-year evaluation of the Partners Advancing Values in Education scholarship program in Milwaukee.
<p>
PAVE is the nation's largest privately funded school choice program. Its design closely resembles Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson's recently expanded Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, which is publicly funded. In the 1994 school year, PAVE provided scholarships to 2,654 low-income students who attended 84 elementary and 13 secondary private or parochial schools in Milwaukee.
<p>
FSA's first-year evaluation of the program reported high levels of parent satisfaction (96 percent) and involvement (97 percent) among the 960 (63 percent) families who completed a survey. The second-year evaluation investigated seventh graders' academic achievement and reported that PAVE students scored higher in reading and math than did representative samples from Milwaukee public schools.
<p>
The purpose of the third-year evaluation was to determine whether parental satisfaction and involvement were consistent over the three years of PAVE's scholarship program for low-income families in Milwaukee.
<p>
<b>Findings of the third-year evaluation:</b>
<p>
"The overwhelming majority of parents were satisfied with the performance of the schools."  The responses indicated the following levels of satisfaction:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>96 percent</b> with the teacher's performance,
<li><b>94 percent</b> with the principal's performance,
<li><b>92 percent</b> with the discipline of the school,
<li><b>97 percent</b> with the program of instruction,
<li><b>96 percent</b> with textbooks,
<li><b>96 percent</b> with amount child learned,
<li><b>97 percent</b> with opportunities for parental involvement, and 
<li><b>97 percent</b> with school location.
</ul><P>
Some 92 percent of respondents rated their school "A" or "B."  Almost twice as many parents in each category were "very satisfied" rather than "satisfied."  And according to the study, parents became significantly involved in the schools of their choice:  96 percent attended parent-teacher conferences.

<b>WASHINGTON UPDATE</b>
<p>
<b>AmeriCorps</b>
<p>
Backed by an unfavorable report from the General Accounting Office (GAO), the nonpartisan investigative arm of the national legislature, Congress is trying to end what critics call one of the federal government's largest boondoggles:  AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service program. The House took the first step by voting to end funding for this high-priced program. The Senate, in  a 52 to 47 vote, followed suit on September 26. If enacted as part of the budget, this change would save the American taxpayers $575 million in FY 1996.
<p>
While the Clinton Administration and its supporters hail AmeriCorps as an innovative effort to expand educational opportunity through volunteerism, opponents say it has evolved into a big-government, pork-barrel project.
<p>
The August GAO report found that the new Clinton program cost $26,654 per participant to run, or more than 40 percent higher than the Administration's most recent estimates. Some 93 percent of the funding for the program comes out of taxpayers' pockets.
<p>
Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) argues that in an era of budget deficits, the Administration was asking the American taxpayer to fund bureaucracies and paperwork while forcing the Congress to look elsewhere for cuts. Grassley also claims that the program does little to help American families pay for college, destroys the spirit of volunteerism, and removes participants from the local communities where they are needed most. Indications that AmeriCorps improperly funds political activities sealed the program's fate in the Senate's debate.

<b>Direct Lending</b>
<p>
Congress is debating the future of President Clinton's direct lending program for student loans.
<p>
While the Clinton Administration has portrayed its direct lending program for college students as essential to the educational future of young Americans, the evidence suggests otherwise. The direct government lending program appears to be bad for taxpayers, bad for students, and bad for schools. 
<p>
The Senate has recommended an appropriation of $378 million for FY 1996. While this is $94.4 million more than the 1995 amount, it is $172 million less than the Administration's request. This has the effect of capping the program at 20 percent. The House has voted to zero out the program.
<P>
<b>Question of Cost.</b> Much of the congressional debate over direct loans turns on the crucial question of cost:  Replacing guaranteed loans with direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. When the direct loan program was enacted in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) initially estimated it could save $4.3 billion over five years. But this estimate ignored the long-term costs. The FY 1996 budget resolution amends the Credit Reform Act to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of the direct loan program. 
<p>
A revised CBO report, released in July and based on changes in official budget scoring, projects that a fully implemented direct loan program would save only $115 million over the next seven years. Indeed, according to the CBO, eliminating the direct loan program entirely while maintaining a guaranteed loan program would save $1.5 billion in budget outlays over the next seven years. According to Representative Bill Goodling (R-PA), the guaranteed loan program is "one of the most successful" public-private sector partnerships.
<p>
The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided through private institutions. But under the Clinton plan, the federal government would borrow the money needed to provide capital for the loans. This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each year. According to Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK), a complete shift to direct loans could add up to $348 billion to the national debt by the year 2014.
<p>
<b>Army of New Employees.</b> The U.S. Department of Education is expanding to handle the new program. The agency is hiring 600 new employees to administer the Clinton program and anticipates needing another 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational -- if Congress changes its mind and funds the program.
<p>
There are other worries about the direct lending program. Currently, some 75 percent of all available college financial aid comes from the federal government. If the federal government takes complete control of the loan program, colleges and universities in effect will become dependent on a single lender to support their students. The Department's power to control loan revenue, along with its expanded regulatory authority and enforcement power, will give the government vast influence over post-secondary education. Such financial power could provide the federal government an opportunity to influence or force curriculum changes, or to mandate such things as politically correct "diversity standards."
<p>
Today's guaranteed loan program is by no means perfect. Taxpayers still bear all the risk. But there have been several recent improvements in the program. For example, the loan application process has become simpler in recent years. The default rate also has been cut significantly.
<p>
There is little support for a government takeover of the guaranteed lending program. According to a nationwide poll of 1,000 respondents, 72 percent of Americans believe student loans should continue to be offered through private financial institutions, not the federal government. Congress would better serve both the students and the universities of America by eliminating the direct lending program and allowing the more economical and guaranteed lending program to provide the money to students.

<title>Time To Enact Real Enterprise Zones -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TIME TO ENACT REAL ENTERPRISE ZONES</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 438<br>
October 24, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
There is a genuine and urgent desire in Washington to trigger an economic rebirth of America's inner cities. But two rival proposals to help achieve that goal are the products of two profoundly different visions of how to generate economic development within inner-city America. One vision, which is the basis for an initiative being prepared by the Clinton Administration, assumes that progress can be achieved only if government leads the process of development and primes the economic pump. It calls, in effect, for an urban industrial policy managed from Washington. The other vision, which forms the core of bipartisan legislation intended as an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill, recognizes that the wise approach is not to try to pick winners and losers, but instead to provide the best possible climate of incentives and simplified regulation to foster local enterprises.
<p>
The White House view is that depressed neighborhoods can best be helped by steering more government programs into them. The Clinton Administration is readying a plan to do this by giving preferential treatment in awarding government contracts to firms operating in troubled neighborhoods. This initiative flows from the Administration's "Enterprise Zone" program, enacted in the last Congress, which centered on channeling government programs into targeted areas. The name given to that government-led program was particularly ironic since the original enterprise zone idea, developed in the 1980s, explicitly rejected the notion that government could trigger an economic recovery in the inner cities and called instead for a sharp reduction in regulation and taxes to spur business formation. That earlier version was not enacted.
<p>
A very different view of urban economic development is enshrined in bipartisan legislation introduced in the Senate recently. The sponsors intend it as an amendment to the upcoming reconciliation bill.
<p>
The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act (S. 1252) is sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham (R-MI) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). Cosponsors include Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA), Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL), John Breaux (D-LA), and Michael DeWine (R-OH.) The legislation would refocus and strengthen the Administration's enterprise zone program, based on a view of how to stimulate economic development in depressed neighborhoods that is very different from that held by the White House. Rather than have the government try to pick firms for preference in federal contracts, the Abraham-Lieberman bill seeks to make existing enterprise zones much more attractive to private investors. It would do this by eliminating the capital gains tax on investments in stock, business property, or a partnership in the zones, as well as by providing other tax incentives for direct investments and business redevelopment within the zones. The government would not limit these incentives to selected private investors or firms.
<p>
This approach understands that private investors are more likely than government officials to identify the entrepreneurs that can be the engines of economic development in depressed neighborhoods. It also recognizes that one of the main obstacles to business creation in these areas, particularly for small new firms, is the difficulty of attracting start-up and working capital. For small new enterprises, capital typically is obtained from  personal savings or private investors, not from the government--or even banks. That is why the capital gains tax exemption and other investor incentives in the Abraham-Lieberman bill are so important. As Senator Lieberman put it in a 1993 floor statement criticizing the lack of such incentives in the Clinton enterprise zone legislation, "Capital incentives are important because they are the one way... in which the government, with a small  expenditure, by reducing taxes, can draw in a large amount of private capital."
<p>
Stimulating a flow of private investor capital also recognizes that the firms most likely to succeed in a blighted area probably will not attract the attention of government. Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise for several years has been drawing public attention to the remarkable economic successes of locally generated inner-city enterprises in the most unlikely situations. Most of these enterprises would not qualify for a government contract or grant even if they sought it. But with the incentives of the Abraham-Lieberman bill, they are exactly the kind of innovative, upstart firms that would be sought out by risk-taking small investors.
<p>
These firms in the inner city also would be helped by another feature of the bill intended to remove some of the obstacles that add to the cost and frustrations of starting an enterprise. Within the enhanced enterprise zones, local governments could request waivers from federal regulations (other than civil rights, public safety, and similar rules) that hinder economic development. This is important because federal rules often unintentionally stymie economic and social improvement in depressed areas. For instance, restrictions on business activity in public housing projects in the past have blocked the creation of tenant businesses to provide child care, transportation, or other services that would make it easier for residents to become employed. Realizing the barriers posed by well-intentioned regulations that ignore practicality, many state and local governments have taken steps to simplify or pare back their own rules. The Abraham-Lieberman bill would require the federal government to do likewise in the zones.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation would take the first steps to help stabilize depressed areas in two other crucial ways. First, it would foster home ownership within enterprise zones. Based on proposals first developed by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, the legislation would provide incentives and grants to encourage resident management and ownership of public housing and the ownership of vacant property. Experience has shown that resident management and home ownership encourage the sense of long-term commitment among the residents of a neighborhood that is so crucial to establishing a favorable climate for enterprise.
<p>
Second, the bill would give some financial help to low-income parents wishing to obtain a better education for their children by choosing an alternative public or private school. Though the provision is modest, it indicates that the sponsors appreciate that improving the climate for education, as well as for business and home ownership, is crucial to achieving the economic turnaround of inner-city America.
<p>
The Abraham-Lieberman legislation brings together a surprising group of bipartisan co-sponsors. They are united behind an approach to urban improvement that recognizes the failures of government-led economic development and the need instead to create a positive climate for investing in small local enterprises. If Congress is to play its proper role in reviving the inner cities, and the hopes of those who live there, the first step would be to include the Abraham-Lieberman legislation in the budget reconciliation bill.

<h2>AmeriCorps</h2>
<b>Testimony by Arianna Huffington <br>
To<br> The Subcommittee On Oversight And Investigations<p>
</b><p>
OCTOBER 17, 1995<P>
Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you and the members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today.  I wish to speak about the difference between true volunteerism and paid "volunteerism," between the effective compassion that can come only from individuals, and the compulsory compassion of the bureaucratic welfare state.  I think that this is an important distinction to make, particularly here in Washington.  After all, only in Washington could you find someone who could miss the irony of paying someone for so-called "volunteer" work.  But I imagine you've heard a lot about that today.
<P>
I also wish to speak about the work we are doing at the Center for Effective Compassion that I have co-founded with Professor Marvin Olasky, and of the work that hundreds of  thousands of Americans are doing around the country everyday to help those most in need.   It is my unequivocal conclusion that Americorps, both as a reality and as a symbol, is hurting the work that has to be done if we are to solve the major social problems facing us.  It's hurting in three fundamental ways:
<P><OL>
<LI>It contradicts the basic religious and philosophical teachings about human nature, according to which human beings have an instinctive propensity to reach out and  help others.  This instinct -- which, in my latest book, I call the fourth instinct -- is competing with other, more self-interested instincts, but as a culture we need to do everything we can to strengthen the instinct that makes us part of a healthy community.  Americorps, by paying people to "volunteer" -- by paying them to do what should be done naturally as part of our learning to live and care for each other in society -- undermines that most important instinct in human beings.  
<LI>Americorps, in its small but significant way, like Great Society programs, in their all-pervasive way, cheats people out of the character-building rewards of giving.  We build up our moral muscle by exercising it.  We become virtuous by the practice of virtue, responsible by the practice of responsibility, generous by the practice of generosity, and compassionate by the practice of compassion.  And all these traits are being practiced because that's how we become fully human, not because we are being paid to practice them. 
<LI>The third, and most immediate, way Americorps undermines the practice of true, effective compassion is by standing in sharp contrast to the hard, unpaid, true volunteer work being done everyday in the trenches around America. What hundreds of thousands of people are doing everyday, Mr. Chairman, is rolling up their sleeves and actually helping to feed, to clothe, and to turn lives around. There was a very moving documentary on PBS last week about little-known, community-based groups working hard at tackling social problems in Anacostia.  How many of these groups are using Americorps volunteers?  Mr. Chairman, if these people were depending on  paid "volunteers" to keep going, they would have closed down long ago.</ol>
<P>Helping those in need is a moral imperative.  It is our responsibility -- our obligation -- and in a completely different realm from getting loans to go to school or money to live on.  These are all important necessities, but when we mix the two together, and, most important, when the mixing is done by the government at taxpayers' expense, something very important is lost -- both for the building of individual character and for the building of healthy communities. 
<P>The people I most admire in this world are volunteering their time everyday without the benefit of any fancy, bureaucratically-run programs.  Not too far from the Capitol, Mr. Chairman, there is Hannah Hawkins, a feisty, no-nonsense lady who runs an after-school program in Anacostia called Children of Mine.  Hannah serves hot meals to kids.  But she gives them much more than that.  She gives them the love and attention that many of them have never received at home.  She also gives them an important gift that government would never give -- Bible lessons, which teach them the difference between right and wrong, and which bring hope and meaning to their lives.  
<P>Also not too far from here are Marsh Ward and Julia Lightfoot, who run 
Clean and Sober Streets,  a safe harbor for drug and alcohol addicts who are trying to put their lives back together.  They give addicts the sort of attention and caring that they have not received before, particularly from government-run institutions
<P>In Denver, there is  Bob Cote, who runs a program called Step 13 in which he tries to help addicts turn their lives around.  Bob, a former addict himself, refers to the government-run programs as "suicide on the installment plan."  Bob's program houses 100 men a night; they are allowed to stay as long as they need to -- as long as they follow the rules, which include doing some kind of work each day as well as staying sober.  Bob's operation costs $300,000 a year, with no help from the government.  Bob estimates that if he were to do what he does now but with government money, it would cost more than $2 million because of all the absurd rules and regulations.  And that doesn't even count for having to pay for volunteers.
<P>In San Antonio, there is the Rev. Freddy Garcia, who runs a program called Victory Outreach, a combination church and halfway house for recovering addicts.  Rev. Garcia's success rate in getting people cleaned up and back on their feet is more than 60 percent.  Recently, the Texas Drug and Alcohol Commission asked Rev. Garcia to stop referring to his work as "drug rehabilitation" because he wasn't conforming with their regulations.
<P>And I could go on and on, Mr. Chairman. You probably haven't seen or heard of any of these people.  And  there's a simple explanation for this, Mr. Chairman: they aren't walking the corridors of Congress asking for government funds to sustain their programs.  And they most certainly do not believe that the best way to help the poor is to convince the government to help them.  Americorps is an affront to the people I mentioned and it is also a hindrance to the work Marvin Olasky and I are doing at the Center for Effective Compassion.  Our aim is nothing less than the transformation of America's efforts to aid those in need, from a bureaucratic, government-centered approach to a community-oriented, people-centered approach. 
<P>We have found plenty of inspiration for our work in American history, going back to the Pilgrims.  When the Pilgrims needed help to survive their first winter at Plymouth Colony, the Indians didn't simply give them a hand-out -- they gave them a hand-up.  Squanto taught them how to plant their corn successfully in New England's difficult soil.
<P>Squanto's act of effective compassion is the origin of Thanksgiving.  The hand-up made a huge difference.  The Indians didn't just run a soup kitchen or donate food to their neighbors; but too often that is what we do today.  The hand-out stems hunger for a while -- the hand-up banishes it forever. 
<P>I do not mean to diminish the effort or goodwill of Americans who will volunteer their time on food lines or organize food drives this Thanksgiving.  They are making a difference and brightening the holiday for many.  But what is needed is their involvement in making a lasting difference, as Squanto did with the Pilgrims.  
<P>Through a national campaign we are launching during Thanksgiving week, we hope to challenge some of our long-held assumptions regarding giving. Our message is simple: For compassion to be effective, it must be personal, challenging, and spiritual.  It does not involve government, and it most certainly does not involve payment for what is a natural duty and responsibility that we need to nurture from the time our children are very young.  I don't want my daughters when they are teenagers to say to me: "Why should I volunteer for free, Mom?  Dick and Jane are getting paid for it!"

<P> 

 
 
<p><li>Politicians mostly circumspect concerning <b>O. J. Simpson's</b> acquittal. Only<b> Pat Buchanan</b> condemned 
verdict. President<b> Bill Clinton</b> issued a statement: ``Our system of justice requires respect for the decision. 
At this moment, our thoughts and prayers should be with the families of the victims of this terrible crime.'' 
<b>Bob Dole's</b> statement told Americans: ``It is very important at this time that we use all our energies to find 
ways to understand each other and bring us together.''<b> Phil Gramm</b> deemed it inappropriate ``for a member 
of the Senate to be commenting on jury trials.'' <b>Colin Powell</b> said that the trial showed that the judicial 
system works and called on the country ``to move on.'' Also for moving on:<b> Lamar Alexander, Jack Kemp.</b> 
Gov. <b>Pete Wilson</b> said he ``would urge the removal of cameras from our courtrooms.''<b> Jesse Jackson</b> urged 
Simpson to lead the fight against domestic violence. . . . Even editorialists declined to judge the jury. New 
York Times faulted the police, prosecution, and Judge<b> Lance Ito</b> for ``bungling,'' and the defense for making 
``a prejudicial appeal,'' but took no position on the verdict. Not going out on a limb: the Washington Post, 
which noted that the acquittal ``stunned and disappointed'' some people but ``satisfied'' others. . . . Coverage 
of O.J. and racial division by the media fueled more talk about Powell. <b>Charles Krauthammer</b> argues that 
though a President Powell would prevent major reform of the welfare state, he would improve race 
relations. 
 
<p><li>White House is in an upbeat mood, buoyed by rising poll ratings and convinced that Republicans will field 
weak candidate next year. Clinton's strategy, which advisor<b> Dick Morris</b> calls ``triangulation,'' seeks to 
position him as a centrist, between congressional Republicans and Democrats.<b> Ann Devroy</b> (Washington 
Post) writes, ``Clinton's message that he is for the popular things Republicans favor -- like a balanced 
budget -- but against the unpopular things they propose -- like cutting Medicare -- is beginning to take.'' . . . 
Not all Democrats enthusiastic about the new strategy. Asked on Meet the Press to choose between Dole 
and Clinton, Sen.<b> Daniel Patrick Moynihan</b> (D., N.Y.) responded, ``I would rather have as President 
someone not running for the Presidency.'' Moynihan has clashed with White House recently over welfare 
and his proposal to save billions by reducing estimates of inflation. . . . Vice President<b> Al Gore</b> calls 
Republicans ``extremists,'' Clinton accuses them of raising taxes (actually Medicare deductibles, college-
loan fees, etc.) on the needy. Attacks led Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole to call off budget talks for now -- 
though Dole jokes that Gore's ``extremist'' talk ``may help me in some of the early primaries.'' . . . More 
tough budget talk from both sides: Clinton declares, ``I would gladly, gladly terminate my tenure here if the 
price of continuing it was just shelving everything I believe in about this country.'' Gramm says, ``He can 
hold us in session until the Second Coming and there is no possibility that I am ever going to spend one 
nickel above the level . . . in our budget.'' 
 
<p><li>Republican presidential candidates hold forum in New Hampshire. Comments Washington Post editorial: 
``Judging from what was said . . . the ideal President is someone who: 1) never had anything to do with the 
Federal Government in Washington, D.C.; 2) never set foot in Washington; 3) never even met someone who 
set foot in Washington; 4) never even voted to send someone else to Washington; 5) and wouldn't, if 
elected, even move to Washington.'' Alexander repeated call to ``cut their pay and send them home,'' Dole 
deflected questions about his age with good humor, </b>Bob Dornan</b> praised all the other candidates, Gramm 
softened his image by talking about his humble beginnings and his marriage. Focusing on tax reform were 
<b>Steve Forbes, Richard Lugar,</b> and<b> Arlen Specter</b>, while<b> Alan Keyes</b> continued to stress primacy of moral 
issues. . . . Pete Wilson's departure from presidential race leads to Dole endorsements by conservative Calif. 
Attorney General<b> Dan Lungren</b>, Calif. ex-Gov.<b> George Deukmejian</b>, and ex-co-chairman of RNC<b> Jeanie 
Austin</b>. 
 
<p><li>Gramm, seeking Cuban-American support, opposes Dole on English language, demands that<b> Fidel Castro</b> 
be barred from attending UN's fiftieth anniversary next month: ``The only purpose that we should allow 
Fidel Castro into America for is to put him in prison or to hang him. And frankly, I believe the people of 
Cuba should have first right to exercise either or both of those options.'' . . . Campaign memo by Gramm 
pollster<b> Linda DiVall</b>, leaked to press, summarizes focus-group results: ``Knowledge void on Gramm is still 
immense. . . Women were totally confused on his position on affirmative action and abortion.'' (He's against 
both.) . . . Buchanan warns that if Powell ``became the nominee and tried to make us a pro-abortion, pro-
gun-control, pro-affirmative-action party which celebrated New Deal and Great Society programs, then 
there will be an explosion in San Diego [convention] and I would fight him with everything I had.'' . . . It 
now looks unlikely that Perot's party will get on Calif. ballot. 
 
<p><li>Wall Street Journal quotes salon owner<b> Jordan Ferraro</b> on why more women are dyeing their hair red: ``I 
equate this with the fact that the Cold War has ended. The phrase, `Better dead than Red' has passed from 
our consciousness. . . . We're allowed now emotionally to become red.''

<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Million Man March & Affirmative Action</a></center>
<P>
In 1965 President Johnson signed Executive Order 11246, mandating "employers doing business with the federal government to develop affirmative action plans to assure equal employment opportunity in their employment practices."  Affirmative action was born.
<P>
  For thirty years affirmative action laws have been a source of tension between whites and minorities.  Some conservatives have even suggested that the Million Man March was not just a call for African-American solidarity, but also a wake-up call to the nation's leadership to deal with the real anger of African-Americans and redouble their efforts to end the "slavery" of assistance programs like affirmative action that suggest, as Shelby Steele put it, "somehow color, not our hard work, can bring us advancements."
<P>
  On 27 July 1995 Majority Leader and Republican Presidential frontrunner Bob Dole introduced the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995, proposing that, "...the federal government should not discriminate against, nor should it grant preferences to, any individual because of that individual's race, color, ethnic background or sex."  Will this be the end of affirmative action and the associated tensions?
<p>
This week, <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> focuses on the Million Man March and the issues surrounding affirmative action.
<P>
On Monday, we focus on the Million Man March as a backdrop for our discussion of affirmative action.  On Tuesday, read President Clinton's report on affirmative action as well as some reponses to that report.  On Wednesday read two conservative approaches to restoring equal treatment in employment.  On Thursday, read conservative commentary on the Million Man March and critiques of affirmative action.  On Friday we bring you arguments for the end of "quotas."  
<p>
Please share your opinions with us any day of the week by filling out our affirmative action questionaire.  We hope you find these articles enlightening!

06-November-1995

<P> 
 
 
<P> I CONFESS that I love a guy in uniform, but the appeal of the military man of the moment is wearing thin. 
Colin Powell is flirting with the nation and the GOP. But will he respect them after the election?
<P> Powell will announce his political intentions next month, and Washington prognosticators are evenly 
divided over whether or not he'll toss his helmet into the ring. Some Powell watchers are convinced that his 
innate caution will dictate enjoyment of his new prosperity and privacy rather than entry into the mean 
world of presidential politics. Others believe the rumor that Powell has hired a Republican polling firm and 
intends to announce his candidacy on Veterans' Day, in time to make a big splash in the November 18 straw 
poll in Florida.
<P> If General Powell does decide to enter the Republican race, what kind of Republican will he be? His 
popular image is of someone who had to do it all himself, overcoming the obstacles of poverty and a racist 
society through intelligence and gumption. Powell did work hard, and deserves respect. But as
<i>My 
American Journey </i>candidly reveals, his childhood was far more secure and comfortable than, say, Phil 
Gramm's. Powell was raised by loving, middle-class parents in the South Bronx of the Forties, a far cry 
from the living hell that is the South Bronx in the Nineties. He grew up in a racially mixed, harmonious 
neighborhood, and went to City College in New York at a time when academic standards were high and 
racial separatism was not preached. Powell's justifiable pride owes no debt to an Afrocentric curriculum.
<p> Politically, however, Powell has shown little appreciation for the lessons to be drawn from the differences 
between life in pre-Balkanized New York and life in the racially tense city of today. Indeed, in the wake of 
the O.J. verdict, he has shown an uncharacteristic clumsiness in handling racial issues. 
The O.J. verdict 
itself, Powell says, ``shows that the judicial system works.'' And though the sense of self-preservation he 
developed in the Army prevented him from joining Louis Farrakhan's march in Washington, he at first 
pleaded a schedule conflict rather than refusing straightforwardly to attend  -- an evasion that was all too 
transparent. Willing to offend conservatives (he is ``disturbed by the class and racial undertones beneath the 
surface of [their] rhetoric''), he seemed wary of taking on the outspokenly bigoted Farrakhan.
More generally, Powell has tacked left and right as his political interests have dictated. Until a week or two 
ago, he was expressing liberal social views; he stated his opposition to a Balanced Budget Amendment, and 
declared the Contract with America ``a little too hard, a little too harsh, a little too unkind.'' He called 
conservatives ``Neanderthals.'' His few genuflections in a conservative direction were vague tributes to the 
family and fiscal restraint, without any particular policy agenda, rather as if Bill Clinton had stepped up to 
the Republican mike. Indeed, he frankly said that ``neither of the two major parties fits me comfortably in 
its present state.'' 
<P> How did he choose which party to flirt with? He explained that the Democratic Party ``is not alive and well 
like the Republican Party is.'' Instead of rescutitating the Democrats, however, he seems more interested in 
tailoring the GOP to his own measure. But first he has to capture it. He duly tacked rightwards in an 
interview with Le Figaro. Suddenly the Contract with America was marked by ``energy, life, and a will to 
change.'' Even Newt Gingrich came in for a compliment. As for Powell himself, he pronounced himself 
``slightly to the right of center.''
<p> Initially, this may well work. As several polls have demonstrated, there is probably a larger popular 
audience for Powell than there is for his establishment opinions, including among GOP primary voters. But 
this popularity makes Powell a very valuable resource to those who do agree with his views. And who might 
they be? Over the past few months, says Powell, he has become aware of plenty of Rockefeller Republicans 
who have been ``somewhat silent.'' 
<p> Now, liberal Republican committee chairmen on Capitol Hill may not have had time to talk to Colin Powell, 
but their ``voice'' is being heard loud and clear. They have been working feverishly to derail the 
conservative revolution. Is it, then, the rank-and-file Rockefeller Republicans to whom Powell intends to 
give a voice? If he has met large numbers of them, he must have spent the summer in Connecticut or Rhode 
Island. And any impression that they represent the country's Republican voters is unlikely to be dislodged 
by his book tour, where he reportedly signs a thousand books an hour with barely a glance at the grateful 
purchaser, before he's off to his next star-struck press interview.
<p> SO, IF he were to enter the Republican primaries, Colin Powell would be undertaking the political mission 
of transforming a vibrant, conservative GOP into a pre-1964-style progressive GOP. Since Clinton's 
election, 142 Democratic officeholders have switched to the Republican Party. There are a record number 
of Democratic retirements from the Senate, and when the Republicans succeed in delivering on their 
agenda, there will be a boatload of Democrats retiring from the House. The current state of the GOP should 
suggest another maxim for Powell to add to his famous list of rules: ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
<p> But Colin Powell seems to believe that a fix is needed. He ignores the success of the conservative coalition. 
Having operated for years in official Washington, he appears to have internalized liberal orthodoxy on the 
permissible limits of political discourse. 
<p> But the Republican Party might not be the only casualty if Powell runs. He is currently enjoying the 
admiration of the nation. But would the Powell legend survive a run for the Presidency that pitted him not 
only against Bill Clinton, but also against the dominant conservative wing of the GOP? And all on behalf of 
the country-clubbers, of whom there were few in the Bronx, the Army, or even the Reagan White House.  --

Executive Memorandum No. 436<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	Sensing a dangerous drift in relations, President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin have laid the groundwork for a U.S.-China summit on October 24, 1995, in New York City. A great deal of work needs to be done. The U.S.-China relationship is highly unstable and, although Beijing shares much of the blame, President Clinton has only made matters worse.
<p>	
	The Clinton Administration's China policy has been like a runaway car, careening from one side of the road to the other, always in danger of running off the cliff.  It is time to regain control of U.S.-China policies. Otherwise, both U.S. interests and the security and stability of Asia will be in jeopardy.
<p>
	President Clinton should make clear to President Jiang that the U.S.-China relationship should not be focused on only one issue, such as Taiwan, or even human rights. Rather, the relationship should be broadly based. In his discussions with the Chinese president, Clinton should concentrate on four major areas of concern: 1) trade, 2) Chinese arms sales and other military provocations, 3) America's ongoing relationship with the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, and 4) the status of Hong Kong.  Discussing these issues would give the New York meeting a badly needed focus while finally putting U.S. China policy on more solid ground.
<p>
	<b>China Must Comply with Trade Agreements.</b>  China's inability or unwillingness to create an environment amenable to foreign business makes U.S. support for PRC membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) impossible. Beijing has promised to open its markets to greater international participation by strengthening its legal system, easing controls on foreign exchange, removing non-tariff barriers, and opening protected sectors of the economy. However, China so far has not lived up to its promises. 
<p>
	Beijing wants to join the WTO to guarantee its continued economic access to the international community, a critical factor in its own economic advancement. China's leadership also feels that entry into the WTO would be another signal of international acceptance of China as a world power. But if China wishes to enter the WTO, it must accept the same entry standards required of every other country. This should be made clear at the New York summit.
<p>
	President Clinton also should insist that China abide by the agreement on intellectual property rights, which it reached with the United States in January 1995. Clinton should inform the Chinese that failure to enforce the terms of the agreement will invite U.S. sanctions and cause American corporations to reassess China's commercial attractiveness.
 <p>
	<b>Hold China Accountable for Arms Violations.</b>  President Clinton should make clear that if allegations of Chinese sales of intermediate-range missiles to Pakistan and assistance to Iran's nuclear weapons program are true, these actions will be considered dangerous violations of international norms. China must be held accountable for such acts and strongly encouraged to adhere to the international "rules of the road."  The U.S. cannot ignore violations of these rules.
<p>
	President Clinton should object strongly to China's hostile military actions in the South China Sea.  Earlier this year the Chinese navy took control of the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef in violation of internationally established territorial norms.  This action challenges America's interest in freedom of navigation.  Instead of merely talking about the importance of open sea channels, the U.S. should take a more active approach and make clear that the U.S. 7th Fleet can and will protect these interests.  A statement of this sort would send the unambiguous message that America intends to continue playing an active role in the security of Asia.
<p>
	<b>Maintain Relationship with Taiwan.</b>  President Clinton must resolutely communicate America's intention to continue its unofficial relationship with the Republic of China, as defined in the Taiwan Relations Act. Though the PRC will ask, the United States should not yield to Beijing's pressure to deny visas for private visits by senior ROC officials, including President Lee Teng-hui.  The U.S. must not allow China to exercise a veto over U.S.-ROC relations.
	<p>
	China has shown flexibility by allowing Taiwan to participate in various international organizations, including the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank.  Using these precedents, President Clinton should urge the PRC to consider and support Taiwan's membership in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization and such U.N.-related agencies as the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
<p>
	It must be made clear to President Jiang that U.S. defensive arms sales to Taiwan will continue in direct response to the security situation in the region.  Thus, because the PRC's actions will have a direct influence on the nature and quantity of arms sales to the ROC, it would be in Beijing's best interests to refrain from intimidating actions, such as last July's missile tests conducted near Taiwan.  China also should scale back its military threat to Taiwan and re-open the high-level dialogue canceled in reaction to President Lee's June visit to the U.S.  The suggestion made by President Jiang earlier this month that he would welcome a meeting with President Lee should be praised as a positive first step in strengthening the strained ties between Beijing and Taipei.
<p>
	<b>American Interests in Hong Kong.</b> President Clinton should tell President Jiang that American confidence in the U.S.-China relationship will be damaged if Hong Kong's autonomy erodes after the reversion to China in 1997. Clinton also should express strong U.S. support for Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), which was elected on September 17, 1995.  The current LegCo should be allowed to serve out its entire four-year term, free of any disruption that might arise when Hong Kong reverts to PRC rule. President Clinton should be adamant about maintaining a popularly supported legislative body in Hong Kong.
<p>
	Clinton also must make it clear that the U.S. intends to conduct substantial bilateral relations with Hong Kong up to and after the 1997 reversion to Chinese rule.  This relationship should consist of, among other things, 1) strong American support for Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations that do not require sovereignty for membership, 2) an active American consulate general, 3) continued U.S. Navy port calls, and 4) an accelerated effort to complete outstanding U.S.-Hong Kong agreements.
<p>	

	China's emergence as a major regional and global power will be America's defining foreign policy challenge in the next decade. While the PRC's future will be decided by the Chinese, it is up to America and the international community to define and communicate to Beijing the norms by which it will be judged.  Taiwan, Hong Kong, China's military development, and trade are issues important to American interests in Asia.  How Beijing responds to these issues will be a test of its intentions and behavior in Asia and the rest of the world.  The key for the Clinton Administration in the coming months, and for the U.S. in the foreseeable future, is to conduct relations with China in a more stable manner, ignoring none of these overriding issues but at the same time allowing no one issue to derail the relationship.
<p>
	Engaging Beijing requires more than rhetoric and meetings.  It also requires a clear definition of U.S. interests and priorities that serve as the basis of what the U.S. does, not merely what it says.  Words about principle are not enough. U.S. actions must be clear enough to demonstrate unambiguously that American cooperation or opposition depends on how well China adheres to international rules of the road.  If nothing else, the October meeting provides an opportunity to define these rules, which serve U.S. interests, and to begin restoring a coherence to the conduct of the President's China policy that has been lost in recent years.

<title>Life With Russell Kirk -- Heritage</title>

<h3>Life With Russell Kirk</h3>

<b>By Annette Kirk</b>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a>, Delivered November 17, 1995
<p>
My estimation of Russell can best be summed up by an incident that occurred several years ago:  
After an especially tiresome travel schedule delivering lectures in several states, Russell returned 
home with a very sore throat. When I phoned the doctor's office to obtain an appointment for him, 
the receptionist said she had no appointments available for at least a month. Hoping to explain the 
urgency of my request, I burst out, "But he's a national treasure; civilization needs him!"
<p>
And so it did and does need the words of Russell Kirk and those other giants who serve as 
guardians of culture, transmitters of our heritage. We are but dwarves standing on the shoulders of 
these giants who provided the philosophical underpinnings of our present political discourse. 
Russell's own significant historical and literary contributions have been widely recorded. As Ken 
Cribb observed, "He lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony from dusty oblivion."
<p>
After almost 30 years of marriage to Russell Kirk, there is simply so much to say that it is hard to 
know where to begin. Russell recounts his life in his memoir, <i>The Sword of Imagination</i> 
(published by Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1995). Today, I will offer my reflections on what life with 
Russell was like, and insight into how his conservative heart shaped his conservative mind.
<p>
Let me begin by answering a question I am often asked:  "Where did you and Russell meet?"  
When I was a junior in college, and president of the student body, I attended many student 
gatherings, at which I met the young men and women who were later to emerge as the leaders of 
the conservative movement. During this time, I became involved in the founding of several 
conservative youth organizations. One snowy Saturday morning in February of 1960, I spoke at a 
conference in Manhattan on a book entitled <i>The American Cause</i>. At the luncheon, I was 
invited to sit next to the author, Russell Kirk. I found him charming and shy and, by dessert, 
discovered that we were kindred spirits. 
<p>
The next year, as a college senior, I arranged lectures for him at my college, as well as at several 
campuses on the east coast. After graduation, I began teaching English and directing dramatic 
productions in a high school on Long Island, while also taking courses for a master's degree and 
remaining politically active. During these years, Russell and I saw each other on many occasions, 
but wrote each other even more often. The two years prior to our marriage, he wrote long missives 
daily -- letters often amusing, but always full of wise insights.
<p>
In addition to writing long letters, Russell also sent me books as gifts -- books such as W.H. 
Mallock's <i>An Immortal Soul</i>, George Gissing's <i>The Private Papers of Henry 
Ryecroft</i>, and <i>The Mind and Heart of Love</i> by the theologian Martin D'Arcy. It was 
this last book, which contrasts the classical concept of love as eros with the Christian concept of 
love as agape, that captured our imagination. We discovered that we both envisioned marriage as a 
vocation, an opportunity to serve not only each other and one's family, but one's community, one's 
culture. To explain how we got from this point of agreement on marriage in the abstract, to my 
writing him a letter agreeing to marry him in particular, would take at least another lecture. So 
suffice it to say that it had long been evident that Russell wished to marry me. Simultaneously, I 
came to the conclusion that I wanted to live all my days with him, to be part of his life, of his world 
-- in short, that I loved him.
<p>
On March 17, 1964, I wrote Russell a letter announcing, "Our marriage is inevitable," which 
sounds rather dour at this distance. Amused, he replied, "Yes, inevitable like death and taxes."  We 
were married on September 19 of that year at my parish chapel, named "Our Lady of the Skies" 
because it was located at, of all places, Kennedy Airport. A zither-player from a restaurant called 
the House of Habsburg performed, and after a small reception at my parents' home, during which 
Bill Buckley held court in the kitchen, we were driven to the airport to depart for our honeymoon in 
a 1929 Rolls-Royce Phantom II hearse, with a bumper-sticker affixed to it proclaiming "Goldwater 
for President."  A classmate of Russell's from St. Andrews University was trying to sell this car and 
was eager to drive us to the church. This seemed a bit much, but not wanting to offend him, we had 
him take us to the airport instead, with our wedding party in the back of the hearse.
<p>
After a brief honeymoon on remote Beaver Island in the middle of Lake Michigan -- a long way 
from the pleasant cafs and hectic pace of New York City where we had courted -- we soon 
departed for California, where we feverishly campaigned for Senator Goldwater in the weeks 
before the election. This was the first of many campaigns in which we would be active, attending 
state conventions as delegates and hosting in our home innumerable gatherings for candidates for 
public office.
<p>
In Henry Regnery's preface to the 40th anniversary edition of <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, there 
is a description of Russell as a young man:  "He doesn't say much, about as communicative as a 
turtle, but when he gets behind a typewriter the results are <i>most</i> impressive."
<p>
During the first few years of our acquaintance, I experienced the truth of that statement -- Russell's 
preference for typing rather than talking. If he happened to be in New York when my parents held 
their Sunday evening gathering of conservatives, Russell would come. If he were asked a question, 
he would give an excellent response. When one asked him to tell a story, he kept us in charmed 
awe. Otherwise, he was mostly silent. Within a few days after the gathering, however, once he had 
returned to his typewriter, I would receive a letter from Mecosta containing wonderful comments 
and reflections provoked by our discussions.
<p>
After some years of marriage, one of Russell's assistants put the question to him:  "Dr. Kirk, you 
and Mrs. Kirk are two very different people. Mrs. Kirk is very energetic, always on the move, and 
outgoing. You, on the other hand, are more meditative, stoical, and reserved. How is it that you 
have such a happy marriage?"  Russell replied in his typical manner -- without hesitation and to the 
point -- "What you have said is true -- we are very different. First Principles -- this is the basis of 
our happiness."  Needless to say, the young man was startled to receive such an encapsulated 
answer.
<p>
We did agree on all important matters. Yet, there were two items on which there was some 
contention -- how much the monthly phone bill should be and whether we should drive home the 
70 miles from the airport via the expressway or the scenic route. I'll leave it to you to guess who 
always wanted to take the scenic route.
<p>
Perhaps some background on my education can shed light on Russell's response to the question 
posed to him about our apparent differences, and in doing so touch upon his influence on my mind 
as well as on my heart. When I attended a Catholic college in the late '50s, the curriculum was 
designed to introduce students to first principles, to both the life of the mind and the realm of the 
spirit -- to dispose them to what Newman termed a "philosophical habit of mind."  Philosophy, 
emphasizing logic, and theology, especially apologetics, were then at the core of the curriculum.
<p>
Unlike most of the young men I knew, Russell enjoyed discussing the essential questions in which I 
was interested -- questions such as the metaphysical understanding of "being," the proofs for the 
existence of God, and the meaning and purpose of life. While he agreed that what made man unique 
was his ability to reason and to know the difference between right and wrong, Russell also believed 
that pure reason had its limits and that logical proofs were not needed to validate religious truths. 
He persuaded me that even if a transcendent order were denied in the realm of reason, evidences of 
every sort -- proofs from natural science, history, and physics -- demonstrated that we were part of 
some grand mysterious scheme working upon us providentially.
<p>
Russell introduced me to the "illative sense," an expression employed by Newman to explain a 
method of reasoning beyond logic. The illative sense is constituted by impressions that are borne in 
upon us from a source deeper than our conscious and formal reason. It is the combined product of 
intuition, instinct, imagination, experience, and much reading and meditation. (See <i>The 
Conservative Mind</i>, Chapter VIII, "Conservatism with Imagination:  Disraeli and Newman.") 
Quoting Pascal, Russell often reminded me that "The heart has reasons that the reason does not 
know."
<p>
Russell's emphasis on things of the heart and the hearth became more evident after we were married 
and began to have daughters. So mindful was he of pleasing children that when building an addition 
onto his ancestral home, he instructed the carpenters to place the windows closer to the floor so 
little ones could look out more easily. He also made sure there was a room in a tower that could be 
used as a clubhouse and a winding staircase to a cupola set atop the house allowing them to view 
village fireworks on the Fourth of July. To entertain them he created a garden walk and called it the 
Troll's Path.
<p>
Perhaps an episode that occurred when our first three daughters were young will illustrate Russell's 
enjoyment of everyday life and display how he derived profound insights from ordinary events. In 
his memoirs, which he wrote in the third person, he recounts this tale:
<p><blockquote>
	At Mecosta, snowdrifts persist well into April; when the drifts vanish, the lilacs 
bloom. On the first warm and bright morning of April 1971, there burst out of the 
pantry door of the Old House Monica, aged three; Cecilia, aged two; and Felicia, 
aged eleven months -- the latter two in their pajamas. They commenced to caper and 
sing.
<p>
	Monica, emulated enthusiastically by Cecilia, began piling stones on the back steps. 
"Stones for breakfast!"  she shouted, "We're going to have stones for breakfast 
tonight!"  While Felicia writhed in an endeavor to escape from her father's clutch to 
crawl on the new grass, Cecilia, not to be outdone in fantasy, tried to feed her 
pebbles while exclaiming, "Tones for b'ekfas'!"
<p>
	"Hush!"  said Monica, "I hear a bird!"  Cecilia spied a picturesque insect. Only [her 
father's] prompt exertions prevented Felicia from devouring pebbles in earnest.
<p>
	Returning from the post office, Annette reproved [her husband] for surrendering 
feebly to the desires of their strong-willed daughters who might catch cold outside 
in their pajamas; he protested that their gamboling could not be restrained. Before 
their marriage, Annette had declared that any husband of hers ought to be ready to 
romp with the children. Now she found her Russell all too liberally fulfilling her 
commandment. 
<p>
	In the spring of life, Kirk reflected, nearly everything is wondrous. The fortunate are 
those who have not lost their sense of wonder; who subsist upon the bread of spirit, 
laughing at the stones of dullness and hard materialism.
<p>
	"The life eternal is determined by what one says and does here and now"; so Martin 
D'Arcy had said. With these three playful daughters, that spring morning, Kirk 
enjoyed one of those moments in which time and the timeless intersect:  a glimpse 
of immortality.... 
<p>
	Those men and women who fail to perceive timeless moments are the prisoners of 
time and circumstance. Only by transcending the ravenous ego, and sharing their joy 
with others, do mortals come to know their true enduring selves and to put on 
immortality.
</blockquote><p>
Russell believed that we all long for immortality, for the garden before the fall. Perhaps this is one 
of the reasons why he derived such pleasure from gardening. Our fourth daughter, Andrea, who has 
tended sheep, and shared her father's love of the land, has written:
<p><blockquote>
	When he first took up residence at Piety Hill, my father found the land shaved of its 
lush trees by the family's first settlers, earning it the name "Stump Country."  So to 
make amends for the sins of his ancestors, he planted hundreds of trees on our land 
and in the village. Despite this great number, it seemed as though he could 
remember when each tree was planted and any other interesting detail about it.
<p>
	Agrarian life was well understood and appreciated by my father. Under the dimming 
September sun he and I worked together planting and pruning. He loved to watch 
the progress his labors had achieved; the growth of new life from his ancestral earth. 
The most precious objects in my father's life were his family, his home, and his five 
acres of land.
</blockquote><p>
With Chesterton, Russell believed that all life is an allegory and could be understood only in 
parable. Thus, he relied chiefly on myths, fables, and imaginative tales to teach his children how to 
live in a bent world.
<p>
In an essay entitled "A Literary Patrimony," our second daughter, Cecilia, recalls:
<p><blockquote>
	Night after night my father read aloud to us, all of us delighted by the stories. 
Sometimes we listened for hours. Occasionally, he was even more eager to read 
than we were inclined to listen:  when we fell asleep, we were carried up the 
wooden hill -- the stairs -- to the land of nod.
<p>
	My father also invented his own tales. He related these stories as installments beside 
the fireplace, the traditional place for a community's stories, developing the 
characters and plots as he spoke. We followed "Hew and His Knife," "The Elusive 
Earl," and other tales. Often he would conclude an episode with the protagonists 
caught in a perilous predicament -- surrounded by bandits or the like -- which on 
one occasion so infuriated us that we demanded that he "get those children home to 
their momma."  Laughing, he appeased us with a more satisfactory conclusion.
<p>
	Haunting works, far removed from the tales he told us, my father's published fiction 
often considers the eerie, the macabre, even the diabolic. For the sheer pleasure of 
their evocative titles, I specify: <i>Old House of Fear</i>, <i>The Surly Sullen 
Bell</i>, <i>The Princess of All Lands</i>, <i>Lord of the Hollow Dark</i>, and 
"The Invasion of the Church of the Holy Ghost."  His published fiction and 
unwritten children's tales do, however, share a common element:  the appeal to the 
normative consciousness, touching upon struggles of an ethical nature.
<p></blockquote>

During our three decades together, Russell and I enjoyed the company of dozens of people who 
became, for months or years, part of our extended family. Because of their presence, we were able 
to celebrate more fully holidays, feast-days, and birthdays. At one point, we had so many 
celebrations that Russell conferred upon one of our "little platoon" the distinction of "Mistress of 
Revels."
<p>
Halloween was always an especially festive night. Russell wore his saffron-colored St. Andrews 
academic gown. The village children always referred to him as "The Great Pumpkin."  Later in the 
evening, after the doorbell stopped ringing, he would gather us all around to play an English game 
called "Snapdragon," which involved snatching flaming raisins soaked in brandy from a brass tray 
and eating them while they were still burning.
<p>
During those years, our household included students, refugees, several musicians, and Russell's 90-
year-old aunt, who lived in a log cabin next door. Every day at 5 p.m., tiny Fay Jewell invited all of 
us to join her in her daily drink, a single glass of whiskey and water. The students always liked to 
join her to hear her tales of Mecosta and to take a break from their more scholarly pursuits.
<p>
One could give innumerable examples of Russell's hospitality, shown in large and small acts of 
kindness to others regardless of age or stature. Perhaps the best illustration of this hospitality was 
his acceptance of the hobo who lived with us for six years until he died. A stalwart white-haired 
Viking with piercing blue eyes, Clinton Wallace came to us on probation, having done time for 
stealing from church poor-boxes. He reasoned that he was the poor, and so he was justified in 
taking what he needed. Other than stealing on occasion, his only vices were laziness and buying 
lottery tickets. For years he had kept himself warm while on the road by visiting libraries, where he 
actually read the books. He memorized reams of poetry and loved to recite it at our seminars, 
especially Shakespeare and the <i>Rubiayat of Omar Khayyam</i>. Russell wrote his best and, to 
my mind, most beautiful short story about Clinton and called it "A Long, Long Trail A-Winding."  
In it, the main character, Frank Sarsfield, patterned after Clinton, dies in a snowstorm. Ironically, 
just one year later, Clinton died in a snowstorm, on his way home after seeing the movie "Across 
the Great Divide."  He is buried in our family plot, next to Russell.
<p>
For two decades, we held formal weekend seminars several times a year, sponsored by the 
Intercollegiate Studies Institute. These seminars addressed a wide variety of topics, including "Our 
Classical Patrimony," "Historical Consciousness," "In Search of the American Spirit," "Literature 
in an Ideological Age," and "Can Virtue Be Taught?"  We also held hundreds of informal seminars 
for the many graduate students who lived with us. All together, some two thousand students and 
professors attended these gatherings. 
<p>
Several of these ISI/Piety Hill seminars were held over the New Year's Eve holiday, and so 
naturally called for a celebration. After three days of serious discussion, furniture in the drawing 
room was pushed back to accommodate the dancing of reels, the singing of carols, and the breaking 
of a piata. The most memorable of these New Year's Eve seminars was the one attended by Kitty 
and Malcolm Muggeridge. The topic was "Pilgrims in the Dark Wood of Our Time."  It was an 
awesome experience to hear Muggeridge reflect upon his fascinating life, to take walks in the 
snowy woods, returning to drink hot cider before the fireplace in Russell's library -- the barn-like 
structure in which all such seminars were held and where Russell did almost all of his writing for 
40 years.
<p>
His writing, or "scribbling," as he referred to it, resulted in 30 books, 500 <i>National Review</i> 
articles, 2,500 newspaper columns, and 400 essays. He also wrote introductions and prefaces to 
countless numbers of books, and edited 30 titles for his series "The Library of Conservative 
Thought."
<p>
Russell was never a dry-as-dust type of scholar. He departed from academe early on and instead 
strove to write evocative prose which spoke to a larger audience, one he identified as "the common 
reader."  He deemed it urgent to speak to this group -- which might include scholars, but mainly 
consisted of people in commerce, the professions, public officials, parents, or students. He wished 
to reach those who perceived that civilization had lost its object, its aim or end, had become 
decadent. He sought to articulate this loss, and to give hope that renewal was possible, to 
continually remind us that for there to be outer order in society, there must be inner order in the 
souls of its members.
<p>
Russell desired us to recognize that a conservative disposition always displays piety toward the 
wisdom of its ancestors. Piety, by which he meant reverence not merely for things spiritual, but also 
for habit, custom, tradition, and history, provides us with an understanding of the limits of our 
intellect and leaves us open to the paradoxes and mysteries of life. Of piety, Richard Weaver has 
said:
<p><blockquote>
	[I]t seems to me that it signifies an attitude toward things which are immeasurably 
larger and greater than oneself without which man is an insufferably brash, 
conceited, and frivolous animal. I do not in truth see how societies are able to hold 
together without some measure of this ancient but now derided feeling.... The 
realization that piety is a proper and constructive attitude... helped me to develop 
what Russell Kirk calls "affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of 
traditional life."... [This realization] was for me a kind of recovery of lost power or 
lost capacity for wonder and enchantment.
</blockquote><p>
It seems significant that the last book Russell published before he died was <i>The Politics of 
Prudence</i>, a selection from the 60 lectures he gave here at The Heritage Foundation over a 
period of 16 years. The last chapter of this book is entitled, "May the Rising Generation Redeem 
the Time?"  One reviewer wrote:  "There is something fitting about Russell Kirk addressing the 
younger generation... because there is a remarkable youthfulness about Russell Kirk himself.... His 
impishness, his capacity for wonder and delight, his intellectual enthusiasm, his freedom from 
academic cant -- all make him the ideal pedagogue for the next generation of conservatives."  Of 
those Heritage lectures, Ed Feulner commented:  "I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable 
overflow crowd of young people who couldn't get enough of him. I asked one of them what his 
hold was on them.... [A] young Reagan appointee said, 'He taught us all why our role was important 
beyond ourselves and beyond politics.'" 
<p>
Russell did not live to see the great congressional victory of '94. While he would have been pleased 
at this turn of events, he would have cautioned us to place this triumph in perspective. Probably, he 
would have approved the "Contract with America," but he would have reminded us of another 
contract, which joins in the community of souls those dead, those living, and those yet to be born -- 
the contract of eternal society.
<p>
This understanding of being part of a "community of souls" was very much evident in a eulogy for 
her father delivered by our third daughter, Felicia:
<p><blockquote>
	My father was delighted at my discovery at the age of fifteen of the Afrikaaner 
writer Sir Laurens van der Post. One of the first books of the many he presented to 
my mother before they were married was <i>The Seed and the Sower</i> by van 
der Post, whom he considered "a wise man."
<p>
	As my interest in the works of Sir Laurens grew, my father began searching his 
favorite book shops and catalogues for anything of a similar topic. On my last 
birthday I received eighteen books in this field. He often sent me postcards, typed of 
course, relating his progress in this endeavor. Our talks were of the bushman and his 
myths, of the land of Ethiopia, and the wonder of the world.
<P>
	This was the original basis of our friendship -- a bond of two of "God's spies," who 
did indeed as Shakespeare wrote in <i>King Lear</i>:  "live, and pray, and sing, 
and tell old tales and laugh at gilded butterflies... and take upon's the mystery of 
things."
<p>
	At our last Christmas gathering my father gave me a tape of an interview with Sir 
Laurens entitled "From the Heart."  We watched it together and listened to Sir 
Laurens speak of the prospect of his impending death and how after seeing "people 
of all races, of all cultures, and of all conditions die" [it was extraordinary to see 
how] "a certain majesty and dignity inside the human spirit comes to take people on 
to the end."  This was the way my father met death -- with reverence and dignity. 
What stories we'll have to tell, God willing, when next we meet!
</blockquote><p>
Being with Russell was never boring. Because he viewed life as a perpetual adventure and loved so 
deeply, we were continually surprised by joy. Through my reflections and through the words of 
others, especially his daughters, I have tried to reveal the essence of his mind and heart, which 
continues on in the legacy that he has left us.
<p>
Perhaps our eldest daughter, Monica, best expressed our family's thoughts on life with Russell:  
"My father was a great intellectual and a distinguished writer. He was a teller of ghostly tales and a 
planter of trees. He was a devoted husband and loving father. But above all, in his words and in his 
actions, my father was a gentleman. Even when he was in considerable pain, my father never lost 
his gracious dignity. When I made a commitment to help my mother care for my father in his 
illness, I knew that it was my duty. I now realize that it was an honor."
<p>
For those of us who knew and loved Russell Kirk, the promulgation of his wise words is both a 
duty and an honor. In this regard, T.S. Eliot's words seem especially appropriate:  "The 
communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living."

<title>Hot Issues -- Travelgate -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h2>Hot issues<p>Travelgate</h2><br><p></center>
The following letter, from ACU Chairman David A. Keene, was delivered to the United States Senate on September 11, 1996.
<p>
Dear Senator:<p>
On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge you to oppose the Levin-Biden amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill during floor considerations today.<p>
The Levin-Biden amendment would strike the provision providing for financial restitution for Billy Dale, the former head of the White House Travel Office, on the grounds that the measure is a private relief bill.
<p>
But that is not the case.  A private relief bill is legislation that, among other things, names a specific individual who will receive a benefit.  The Treasury-Postal bill contains no such specific reference.  The provision in question merely notes that its purpose is to provide restitution for the wrongly-fired former employees of the White House Travel Office.<p>
What's really going on here is that Senate liberals are trying to get Bill Clinton off the hook.  If they succeed in striking this provision, given the crush of legislative business remaining to be done in the few short weeks before the planned adjournment, Mr. Dale will have to wait until the next Congress to have his legal bills -- now in excess of $500,000 -- paid.  That's just not right.<p>
It wasn't right for Mr. Clinton to fire Mr. Dale in the first place.  It wasn't right for Mr. Dale to be accused and indicted.  It wasn't right for the White House to look over his FBI file seven months <i>after</i> they had fired him.  It wasn't right that Mr. Clinton -- even after a jury acquitted Mr. Dale on all counts in less than two hours, after a two-week trial -- continued to remind the public that Mr. Dale had once considered agreeing to a guilty plea.<p>
And it's not right that Senators Levin and Biden want to protect the president from having to sign this provision into law.<p>
Billy Dale was an innocent man, unjustly accused, who watched his world crumble around him -- all for the sake of political spoils.  His reputation was besmirched, his family humiliated, his integrity challenged.  You can't repair the emotional damage the Clinton White House has inflicted on this man and his family.  But you can help him get one step closer to being financially whole again.  Defeat Levin-Biden, and return to Billy Dale at the very least the money that was taken from him.<p>
Yours Sincerely,<p>
David A. Keene<br>
Chairman<p>

                    The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 27, 1996:             <P>                  Dear Representative: <P>       On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 1833, the partial birth abortion ban, when it comes to the floor today for a        vote.      <P>          As you know, this bill passed the House last November, and then passed the Senate with slight        modifications.  By passing the Senate version of the legislation today, you will bypass the needfor        a conference committee and send the bill directly to the president's desk.      <P>          One Senate amendment allows the procedure in cases where it is necessary to save the life of the        mother.  And another Senate amendment shifts the burden of proof to prosecutors to demonstrate        that the abortionist had other options available to save the life of the mother (whereas the original        House language had placed the burden of proof on the abortionist to demonstrate that he or she        had no other option).                We believe the Senate amendments are acceptable, and do not deviate from the basic thrust of the        bill:  to prohibit the grisly practice of beginning the delivery of a baby, only to stop when the        baby's head is still inside the mother so as to facilitate killing it.         <P>       Surely a nation as civilized as ours believes itself to be will not tolerate this ghastly activity.                That the pro-abortion lobby has rallied so vociferously against this legislation -- even prompting a        veto threat from the White House -- reveals better than words just how deep is their commitment        to the abortion cause and industry, and shows who are the true "radical extremists" in this policy        debate.                <P>                      Yours sincerely,                          <P>                                    David A.

The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 28, 1996:                                     <P>                              Dear Representative:     <P>  On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 3103, the "Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996,"        during floor consideration today and tomorrow.      <P>          As you know, this bill is a combination of three separate bills -- HR 3103, HR 3070, and HR 995        -- that went through the Ways and Means, Commerce, and Economic Opportunities Committees,        respectively, and was melded together by the Rules Committee yesterday.  <P>              For three years now, as one of the largest grass-roots groups lobbying on the issue of health care        reform, we have held fast to a set of principles for dealing with health care reform.  They are:<P>                1)     Expanding coverage through portability, done on a group-to-group basis;      <P>  2)     Expanding coverage for individuals through encouraging states to create risk pools   for        persons with pre-existing medical conditions;     <P>      3)    Expanding coverage through the creation of Medical Savings Accounts;     <P>      4)     Reducing costs through the imposition of limits on medical malpractice lawsuits;       <P>    5)     Reducing costs through an increase in the deduction for self-employed workers.          <P>      HR 3103 deals with health insurance reform in a reasonable and limited fashion, in a manner        based on several of these principles.  The legislation would provide for portability of health        insurance coverage on a group-to-group basis; would increase the deduction for self-employed        individuals from 30 to 50 percent; would limit medical malpractice claims, a much-neededchange        that would make health insurance more affordable by lowering insurance premiums for healthcare        providers; would encourage, through tax policy, the creation of state-level high-risk pools; and        would authorize MSAs, a provision which conservatives have supported for years as the only        long-term solution of the health insurance problem.      <P>             We can tell you:  this legislation addresses the problems in the health care delivery system in a        limited, reasonable way, and should garner the support of all those wishing to correct somecurrent        inadequacies in the system without allowing for a government take-over of the industry.                     <P>                    Yours sincerely,                  <P>                       David A.

 The following letter was sent from ACU Chairman, David Keene, to the United States Senate on March 27, 1996:   <P>
                                                  Dear Senator:          <P>      On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to oppose the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment to raise the minimum wage.            <P>    Economists of all stripes agree that the minimum wage has but one guaranteed effect -- to make        job creation more difficult for those small businesses that are the engine of job growth inAmerica,        and to thereby make getting a job more difficult for those seeking entry-level positions.        <P>        Given that our economy has performed anemically over the last several years -- a direct result of        federal government policies which include burdensome regulations, high taxes, and wasteful        spending programs that take otherwise productive dollars out of the private economy and putthem        into unproductive dollars in the public sector economy -- this hardly seems the right time to be        considering raising the costs of offering a job to a prospective employee.      <P>          Could it be that there's something else going on here?  Perhaps a transparent political payoff toBig        Labor, whose bosses just this week endorsed Bill Clinton for reelection -- the earliest-ever        endorsement by the unions of a candidate for the office?  When you take that into consideration,        and add to it the fact that the AFL-CIO bosses also announced this week their plans to raise an        additional $35 million war chest to target 75 House Republicans (combined with their expected        $400 million in-kind donations to Democratic candidates in this fall's elections), one begins to see        a pattern emerging.      <P>          Don't fall for it.  The minimum wage is a job-killer.  At a time when we need to be creating more        new jobs, not less, don't make it more difficult for small businesses to do so.  Reject union boss        pressure and stay firmly on the side of those millions of workers looking for entry-level positions.     <P>                                 Yours sincerely,    <P>                                                          David A.

        <p>
     
        Dear Congressman:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support HR 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty and
        Public Safety Act of 1996.&quot;<p>
        
        We believe the bill was strengthened by the passage yesterday of the amendment offered
        by Rep. Barr of Georgia.  No longer do we have to fear the U.S. government infringing
        on the constitutional protections of our citizens through wire-tapping crusades conducted
        willy-nilly, and no longer do we have to fear being charged with a crime for selling
        perfectly legal property which may or may not later be used in the commission of a crime.<p>
        
        Don't believe the liberal media, which has reported that the Barr amendment &quot;gutted&quot; or
        &quot;eviscerated&quot; the legislation.  It did not.  It strengthened it, by ensuring that in our desires
        to crack down on crime and terrorism, we are not gutting the constitutional rights of
        American citizens.<p>
        
        I urge you to vote &quot;yes&quot; on HR 2703.<p>

</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Welfare Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 
5, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Congressman:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support legislation embodying the welfare compromise
        crafted by the National Governors Association.<p>
        
        We believe that, alone of all the possible welfare reform alternatives, the NGA proposal
        passes two critical tests:  it ends the entitlement status of welfare (a reform for which
        conservatives have been fighting for years), and it remains true to the principles of
        federalism (for which conservatives have been fighting for decades).<p>
        
        We understand that several of the leading social conservative groups oppose the NGA
        reform.  As we understand their argument, their opposition to the NGA proposal is
        primarily based on the fact that it doesn't mandate a family cap as established in HR 4.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that allowing states to set their own family caps is not as certain
        a method for seeing to their adoption nation-wide as would be mandating a federal family
        cap, it is also undeniably true that 13 states already have enacted family caps on their own,
        and another seven have already applied for the necessary federal waivers to do so.  We
        believe that more and more states would adopt them as their success was demonstrated in
        the states that have taken the lead already.  This is the essence of federalism.<p>
        
        Moreover, the NGA proposal was adopted unanimously at its early February meeting. 
        Why should a Republican-controlled Congress have a problem agreeing to a proposal
        supported by 50 state governors, most of whom are Republicans?  Isn't the essence of
        conservative government the notion that government governs best which governs closest to
        the people?<p>
        
        As Speaker Gingrich said more than a year ago, conservative micromanagement from
        Washington is just as bad as liberal micromanagement from Washington.<p>
        
        Although it is doubtful that President Clinton would sign the NGA compromise -- and it is
        not even necessary to send him a bill -- it is important for the GOP House to go on record
        supporting a proposal supported by all Democratic governors.  The NGA proposal does
        achieve the over-riding strategic goal of welfare reform:  ending the entitlement status of
        the programs, and returning power to the states.  I urge you to support the NGA proposal.<p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Product Liability Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996

<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
       
        Dear Senator:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I'm writing today to urge you to vote for cloture tomorrow on the
        product liability conference report, and then to support its final passage.<p>
        
        America's current product liability laws are abused by lawyers seeking to make a &quot;fast
        buck&quot; and so-called consumer organizations seeking to shift blame from consumers to
        others with deep pockets.  The result is to drive up prices, make insurance unaffordable,
        and generally to deprive the public of many products which, when used as the directions
        suggest, are beneficial.<p>
        
        Trial lawyers have argued for years against meaningful reform of product liability laws, on
        the grounds that such changes would make consumers vulnerable to the wishes of so-called
        &quot;rapacious&quot; and &quot;greedy&quot; corporations.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The
        product liability laws, when amended, would allow those truly to hurt to seek redress.  But
        they would let those of us who do want to buy products, and use them responsibly, to do
        so.<p>
        
        Vote for cloture tomorrow on this important legislation.  And support when it comes to a
        final passage vote.  America's consumers will thank you.<p>
        
           
        <p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Small Business Deregulation</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support S. 942, the small business deregulation bill,
        when it comes to the floor tomorrow.<P>
        
        For far too long, America's small businesses -- the engines of economic growth -- have
        been laboring under a stultifying myriad of regulations, increasing the costs of doing
        business and making difficult the creation of new jobs so vital to the growth of our
        economy.<p>
        
        The bill's specific provisions, we believe, are eminently reasonable, and simply make
        common sense.  Waive fines for first-time offenders if the violations are corrected within a
        reasonable time period.  Let small businesses recoup their legal expenses if they win a
        challenge against excessive enforcement of existing regulations.  And give Congress a 45-day window 
        in which to review and reject newly-issued rules.<p>
        
        Support S. 942 tomorrow.  America's millions of small business owners -- and the people
        who want to work for them -- will be watching.<p>

      <P>
      
<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 18, 1996:<br>                
        
        <p>
        Dear Congressman:<BR>
        <P>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support H.Con.Res. 148 when it comes to the floor
        tomorrow.<P>
        
        The United States must send a clear message that it will not stand aside while tyrants bully
        a peaceful, prosperous, pro-American neighbor.<P> 
        
        H.Con.Res. 148 expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should demand that
        the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) live up to its prior promises to resolve differences
        with the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) by peaceful means, and that the United
        States should assist in the ROC's defense if the PRC attacks.<P>
        
        For decades, the PRC has relentlessly striven to isolate the ROC from the world
        community. Despite the mainland regime's mean-spirited policy, the ROC is an important,
        influential participant in international affairs. It is one of the few rising democracies in
        East Asia, promoting and protecting economic, political and individual liberty. The ROC's
        national legislature and virtually all provincial and municipal officials are chosen by direct
        popular vote in free elections. This month, for the first time in China's long history, a
        direct popular election for president will occur. The ROC's political and economic
        progress is a textbook model of what bipartisan U.S. policy has always encouraged the
        world over.<P>
        
        Both the PRC and ROC agree that there should be one unified China. Each has long
        claimed to be China's sole legitimate government, but only the ROC has taken positive
        steps toward compromise. It conducts itself under a &QUOT;one China, two governments&QUOT; policy
        while working to resolve other differences case-by-case. Regrettably, recent events again
        underscore the fact that peace derives from strength and only constant pressure and resolve
        make untrustworthy Communists abide by their agreements.<P>
                 
        The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 does not obligate the U. S. to assist the ROC should it
        become a victim of aggression. H.Con.Res. 148 can be an important step toward
        clarifying ambiguity and focusing the moral and political imperatives for U.S. policy. The
        choice is clear: if ever there was a stark case of &QUOT;good guys&QUOT; and &QUOT;bad guys,&QUOT; this is it. <P>
               
    <p>

<h3>A GUIDE TO KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both houses of Congress soon will consider sweeping legislation affecting the way millions of Americans get their health insurance. In the Senate, the chief sponsors of the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028) are Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).<sup>1</sup>  In the House, Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL) is coordinating the efforts to introduce an improved version of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.<sup>2</sup>  Both bills are intended to address a recurring and legitimate concern among millions of working Americans who currently have employment-based health insurance:  the threat of losing private health insurance when they lose or change their jobs, or try to obtain coverage when they have a pre-existing medical condition. But while the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains some useful provisions, it also contains serious flaws -- many of which would be corrected by incorporating language based on the House proposal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anxiety about health insurance coverage stems from the very nature of today's employment-based system. Typically, workers and their dependents are covered by an employer-based health insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same employer, and for just a short time afterwards. If a worker is laid off or takes a job with a different employer, the family may encounter pre-existing condition exclusions or different health care providers. If the worker joins a firm with no group insurance plan and buys his own coverage, he receives no tax breaks for purchasing that policy -- compared with generous tax relief if an employer obtains and owns the coverage. Lawmakers thus need to address two fundamental problems in trying to fix the broken health insurance market: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>1.)</b> Health insurance is the only type of insurance tied to the place of employment. Other major forms of insurance such as homeowners, mortgage, and life are not normally tied to a worker's place of employment. The reason health insurance is employer-based today is that federal tax relief for insurance is available only to workers who obtain insurance through their place of work. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>2.)</b> The tax code effectively limits workers and their families to only one type of insurance option:  employer-based health insurance. Insurance market reforms do not resolve this underlying problem with a distorted health insurance market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028), as reported out of committee, is flawed legislation. While S. 1028 avoids the price controls and huge tax increases found in both the Clinton plan and other bills introduced in the last Congress, it contains vague provisions for federal regulation of the health insurance market, a responsibility traditionally left to the states. S. 1028 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services disturbingly broad powers in this area.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of just trying to guarantee Americans the right to purchase health insurance, Congress should take careful steps to make sure that Americans of all incomes, health status, and employment status have the ability to buy into the health care market.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, Congress should focus on:
<p><ul>
<li> Group to group portability;<p>
<li> Limiting pre-existing condition exclusions upon losing employer-based coverage;<p>
<li> Reasonable mechanisms to allow small employers and legitimate associations to pool together to get better prices;<p>
<li> Tax equity for individuals and families seeking health insurance outside an employer setting; and<P>
<li> Full income tax deductibility for the self-employed increased to 100 percent.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In his 1996 State of the Union message, President Bill Clinton emphasized that the goal of S. 1028 is to end the loss of portable health insurance among millions of workers and their dependents.<sup>4</sup>  The issue of portability of insurance is a broad concern among Republicans and Democrats alike. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned attempt to address it, as well as the problem of pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes improvements in the areas of guaranteed availability and portability of group coverage. Unfortunately, for jurisdictional and procedural reasons, Senate rules have prevented the addition of several key health care reform components necessary to allow individuals, rather than the companies they work for, to own their health insurance policies. If it is Congress's intention to give workers and their families true portability of health insurance, lawmakers must correct the inherent flaws and inequities that are the unintended consequences of an inequitable federal tax code that penalizes the working poor and self-employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, even though the Senate measure does contain extensive federal regulation of the individual health insurance market, intended to address portability, it lacks the key financial incentive to persuade healthy individuals to purchase health insurance in a timely fashion. Unless Congress is willing to address the core problem of today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code -- health insurance reform will fall far short of its goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The widespread fear of losing employment-based health insurance emerged as the driving force behind the health care debate during the 103rd Congress. An analysis of the March 1994 Current Population Survey showed that 55.3 percent of the uninsured population in 1993 were uninsured because they had lost their jobs or changed jobs.<sup>5</sup>  That insecurity stems from the design of today's employer-based health insurance system, itself the product of perverse incentives created by the federal tax code.<sup>6</sup>  Others worry about not having any form of insurance from their current employer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The best way to achieve portability is to give Americans ownership and control of the financing of health benefits. Where appropriate, financial assistance should be given to low-income working families to help pay for basic care in the form of vouchers or tax credits. If individuals and families are allowed to comparison shop among a variety of health plans and benefit levels offered through their employer, a private organization, or an individual policy, costs can be controlled. True portability also can be achieved, because Americans will no longer face the possibility of losing their health insurance based on a change in job, loss of job, or pre-existing condition. 

<p>
<b>WHAT S. 1028 WOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would create a uniform federal standard for health insurance that is intended to increase the portability of private health insurance policies. Under the legislation, individuals with employment-based health insurance would be able to maintain coverage while changing jobs. In the area of group coverage, the bill would reduce the length of exclusions for pre-existing conditions by crediting enrollees for maintaining continuous coverage through a previous employer. Furthermore, insurers and employers would be prevented from excluding employees from an employer's group health plan based on their medical status or experience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The proposal also would create a new state-based system of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs) intended to give small businesses and individuals greater purchasing power in negotiating more favorable rates from insurance carriers and other health plan providers.

<p>
<b>A Limit on Pre-Existing Conditions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill places a restriction on the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny coverage in group health insurance plans to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. A time credit is applied against the preexisting condition period by reducing it one month for each month that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under a previous group health plan. In addition, the bill:
<P><ul>
<li> Places a ban on further preexisting condition exclusions by any insurer once a worker has been continuously insured for a minimum of 12 months. Thus, workers who change jobs or insurance plans would no longer be subject to waiting periods.
<p>
<li> Prohibits health plans and employers from canceling or providing coverage to any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status.
<p>
<li> Promotes wellness programs by allowing employers and group health plans to provide discounts to employees who participate in activities (approved by state insurance regulators) designed to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of an illness.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guaranteed availability and renewability of health insurance in S. 1028 would alleviate the portability problem facing workers who want to change jobs. This is a welcome and long-overdue improvement in today's health insurance market.
<P>

<b>Group Purchasing Arrangements (Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives)</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 attempts to make health insurance more affordable for small employers and self-employed workers by enabling them to purchase coverage as part of a larger group. The rationale is that small businesses generally pay higher per capita premiums than larger businesses because they lack economies of scale and the power to bargain. Under current law, when an employee or dependent incurs expensive claims, typically the employer's premiums increase sharply the following year, in many cases pricing that group out of the insurance market. The danger to the worker and his family occurs when a health plan provider drops the small employer from coverage, or the employer excludes the particular employee from the group plan due to his previous year's claims experience.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill attempts to correct this problem by promoting small group purchasing arrangements. Referred to as Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs), they are private, voluntary coalitions/alliances developed to purchase health insurance and negotiate with providers and health plans. State laws prohibiting the formation of such HPPCs are preempted. Under the bill, HPPCs would require state certification and would have to be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to purchasing insured products on behalf of members, HPPCs would not be permitted to bear risk,<sup>7</sup> although they would be given discretion in determining the eligibility requirements for employers and whether or not to include individuals -- as long as the individual's health status is not a factor.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To facilitate the formation of HPPCs, and to get them to be active participants in the health insurance market, S. 1028 provides for a limited preemption of state insurance rating laws with respect to group health plans and individual health plans offered by health insurance carriers through HPPCs.<sup>8</sup>  Health plans purchased through other avenues, however, would remain subject to state small group rating requirements, which require carriers to pool all small group businesses for rating purposes. Thus, the Senate bill creates different rules for different insurance arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An Uneven Playing Field.</b> By exempting HPPCs from state small employer group rating laws, Congress would be creating an incentive for small businesses with healthier than average employees to seek out coverage under a HPPC that has procured rate discounts:  Businesses could do this on any basis other than the health status and demographics of the HPPC's members. But there is a significant problem:  Without the premium payments from these healthy employer groups, others seeking coverage through non-HPPC arrangements could face higher than normal rates in a pool dominated by unhealthy employer groups. The Senate bill, in other words, could end up compounding the market distortions in a sector already distorted by an inequitable federal tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the legislative language creating HPPCs would lead to an uneven playing field against commercial insurance companies not selling products through HPPCs. While insurance premiums in the non-HPPC market no doubt would be higher than those in the HPPCs as a result of this provision, it is not definite how severe the impact would be. Congress would be wise to ensure that an even playing field exists in the health insurance market so that competition among health plan providers is fair. At a minimum, Congress should amend S. 1028 so that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or though a non-HPPC, are exempted from state rating requirements. Members of Congress should not worsen the distortions in health insurance markets through federal legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Congress have expressed an interest in enacting a blanket federal preemption of any state-mandated benefit laws that would apply solely to HPPCs. State-mandated benefit laws have added to the cost of insurance, rendering policies unaffordable for many small businesses and individuals. While it is perfectly understandable that Members would want to protect small businesses and individuals purchasing insurance through a HPPC from burdensome and costly state mandates, any preemption of state mandated benefit laws, however well-intentioned, should be applied to all forms of health coverage, HPPCs and non-HPPCs alike. A better approach would be to preempt state laws which:
<P><ul>
<li> Require health insurance policies to cover specific diseases, services, or providers;<P>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to contract selectively with health care providers; or<p>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to impose higher cost-sharing provisions on treatment obtained from providers outside a plan's network.<sup>9</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lower premiums are a desirable goal. However, it would be extremely unwise of Congress to distort the health insurance market further by placing HPPC plans at a marketing advantage over non-HPPC plans. As drafted, the potential for HPPCs' gaining monopoly status is very real because of the legislative language creating these new entities. Although not theoretically exclusive, as under the Clinton health plan, these geographically based HPPCs might become the exclusive means for individuals and employers to obtain fully insured health coverage, if premium rates negotiated by the HPPC are less than those otherwise permitted under state law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this respect, Members of Congress should recall the ill-fated "managed competition" legislation introduced in 1994 by former Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Fred Grandy (R-IA).<sup>10</sup>  Among other things, this health insurance reform proposal also would have established state-based health insurance purchasing cooperatives.<sup>11</sup>  While individual and family enrollment in these HPPCs supposedly would have been voluntary, the regulatory infrastructure and tax code revisions set up in the Cooper-Grandy plan eventually would have forced small businesses and individuals into such entities. Consistent with the managed competition model in the Cooper-Grandy plan, HPPCs under S. 1028 would be required to enroll all employers and individuals within a geographic area as determined by the state. If S. 1028 were enacted into law as reported out of the Senate Labor Committee, the combination of new federal rules with existing state insurance rules could make employee enrollment in HPPCs the only practical choice for insurance coverage. Workers and their families therefore would lose a large measure of personal choice in health plans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most significantly, current ERISA regulations do not prohibit states from establishing voluntary purchasing cooperatives.<sup>12</sup>  Congress should not create a regulatory infrastructure that could establish the groundwork for making such HPPCs mandatory within a state. The danger is that the instability created by the federally designed HPPCs would lead to further federal regulation to "correct" the problem -- resulting in still further problems. The result:  Congress, by degrees, would create a system of purchasing cooperatives similar to those found in the Clinton Health Security Act, which required every American to obtain health insurance through these alliances.

<p>
<b>Group-to-Individual Coverage</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;S. 1028 does take some of the first steps needed to construct a consumer-based health insurance framework -- even though other provisions conflict with this goal. Subtitle B does this by setting up an infrastructure to facilitate individual health plan portability. Insurance carriers that sell individual health plans are required to issue individual coverage when the following criteria have been met:
<p><ul>
<li> Individuals a) must have been covered previously under an employment-based health plan, b) must have paid health insurance premiums on a continuous basis without a gap in coverage of 30 days or more, and c) must have been covered for at least 18 months;<P>

<li> Individuals must not be eligible for coverage under an employee health benefit plan or group health plan, such as one offered by a new employer or by a parent's or spouse's employer;
<p>
<li> Individuals must have exhausted their eligibility for COBRA<sup>13</sup> continuation coverage (which is available for a minimum of 18 months to over 80 percent of individuals receiving employment-based coverage); and
<p>
<li> Individuals must not reside in a state which has adopted a high-risk pool or other means of covering individuals unable to maintain health coverage. 
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of insurance in the individual market are addressed by forbidding insurance carriers to determine coverage or establish eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. Without these rules governing the group-to-individual conversion, the portability of health insurance will not be achieved. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who offers insurance coverage to an employer who does not offer coverage would simply lose this benefit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill also puts rules in place for health insurance carriers to ensure their financial stability and solvency. An insurance carrier or other health plan provider offering coverage to individuals under an individual health plan may deny applicants if the health plan ceases to enroll any new individuals. A carrier also may do so if it can demonstrate to the state that its financial or provider capacity to serve previously covered individuals will be impaired if the state requires it to enroll additional individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concerns have been raised about how these provisions would affect premium costs.<sup>14</sup>  Some critics of S. 1028's group-to-individual portability provision say that insurance premiums in the individual market would increase sharply, perhaps in the range of 10 to 15 percent.<sup>15</sup>  But the American Academy of Actuaries, the national organization representing actuaries of all specialties in the United States, says the increase in premiums would be quite small, ranging between 2 and 5 percent.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since S. 1028 does not impose strict community rating requirements, or otherwise impose price caps on the premiums that insurers may charge individuals,<sup>17</sup> some insurance executives, such as those with one of the leading insurance trade associations, fear that the guaranteed-issue requirement for individuals with prior coverage would "make individual health insurance unaffordable over time."<sup>18</sup>  This concern is premised upon two assumptions:  1) that only unhealthy individuals will purchase health insurance, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse selection in the individual market; and 2) that absent significant public subsidies, healthy individuals will not purchase insurance before they need it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because both consumer choice and competition are frustrated in a health insurance system that is predominantly employment-based, these concerns about insurance costs in the individual market are legitimate in today's tax climate. Since health insurance is entirely optional, those who purchase health insurance on their own must pay the entire cost of the premiums with after-tax dollars. Thus, healthier than average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance in a voluntary market, while unhealthy persons could see an economic benefit in getting coverage. A guaranteed-issue requirement in the individual market would lead to higher premiums since unhealthy people would comprise a disproportionate share of the market. While concerns about rising premiums in the individual insurance market are justified, Congress can and should address this potential problem by providing consumers with financial assistance to help offset any possible increase.
<p>
<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE S. 1028</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill makes improvements in the existing health insurance system, there are several provisions which should be strengthened. Without further changes, the laudable intentions of this legislation will not be realized in good public policy. Millions of Americans are painfully aware of the weaknesses in the current system. The Senate Committee on Labor correctly diagnosed the problem:  "[M]illions of Americans are at risk of becoming uninsured or subject to preexisting condition exclusions under the current system because they change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change insurance policies."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain key policy changes can improve insurance reform legislation and better achieve the goal of portability and security in health insurance. These changes, as proposed in the House legislation, include tax equity for non-employer-based health insurance, medical savings accounts (MSAs), increased deductibility for purchasing health insurance for the self-employed, a clarification of the ERISA laws making it easier for smaller employers and individuals to pool and gain leverage in the insurance market, and medical malpractice reforms.

<p>
<b>Tax Equity Would Offset Most Adverse Effects in the Individual Market </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As noted, policy analysts and insurance industry executives have raised concerns over the effects that guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability could have on premiums in the individual insurance market. Under the current system, unhealthy individuals leaving employment-based coverage find COBRA either the preferable or perhaps the only alternative to being uninsured. Healthy individuals have the luxury of making an economic decision to go with no coverage or purchase an individual-based policy with after-tax income. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that Members of Congress remain concerned about a potential increase in premiums, they should re-examine the core problem behind today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code. Congress should provide an incentive for healthy employees to enroll in the individual market by giving them tax equity. This means giving individuals who purchase their own health insurance policies the same tax treatment as workers who get their health insurance through their employers. As drafted, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would not help college graduates entering the job market for the first time who end up working for small start-up businesses unable to offer health insurance. To fix this problem, Members of Congress need to look no further than the health-related tax provisions passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. A majority of today's uninsured population is made up of the self-employed, those working for small firms, or young individuals. These groups are affected by the distortions in an employer-based health insurance system and are the ones typically suffering from the absence of portability and ownership.
<p>
<b> Introduce medical savings accounts (MSAs).</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a widespread impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other comprehensive forms of tax equity Congress could consider (such as tax credits and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed), MSAs would be a good start. They would provide sufficient incentive for healthy individuals to purchase insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool that offsets the claims of future unhealthy enrollees. MSAs could be constructed as passed earlier this Congress:
<P><ul>
	<li>	Contributions of up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income;
<p>
	<li>	Interest earned on the income would be subject to taxation;
<p>
	<li>	Withdrawals made for non-medical expenditures would be included in the individual's gross income and subject to a 10 percent tax prior to age 59-and-a-half;
<p>
	<li>	Upon reaching age 59-and-a-half, the individual could make withdrawals for any purpose without the 10 percent tax;
<p>
	<li>	In order for a health plan to be classified as such, at a minimum it would have to provide catastrophic coverage in which the minimum deductible for individuals is $1,500 and $3,000 for families.
<p></ul>
<b> Increase and expand tax deductions.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. While a 30 percent deduction provides some tax relief for the nation's self-employed, the federal tax code still provides significant tax advantages for employees by exempting company-sponsored benefits from any federal income or payroll taxes (FICA), as well as from state and local taxes. In addition to pre-existing condition exclusion barriers, the availability of this tax exclusion for workers is one of the major impediments facing employees seeking to leave and start their own businesses. Congress should remove this bias, and also encourage creation of a sound individual-based health insurance market, by increasing the deduction for health insurance of self-employed individuals and their families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation which would have increased the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent between 1996 and 2002. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton. While a 100 percent deduction would provide tax fairness for all individuals and the self-employed, even a compromise of 50 percent would represent substantial progress.
As a condition of regulating private insurance at the federal level, consider pre-empting state mandated benefit laws. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance industry is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy. Before an insurance carrier or health plan provider is allowed to enter and do business within a state, it must satisfy a litany of state requirements and regulations. Regulation of health insurance is usually within the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal government. A key component of state regulation is the imposition of mandated benefits on insurance carriers licensed to do business within their jurisdictions. These mandates are the product of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where medical specialists, marriage and family counselors, therapists, and other professionals have succeeded in imposing coverage requirements. Over the years, the number and scope of these benefits have grown substantially, adding to the cost of insurance plans sold to employers and individuals. Nationwide, there are over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from in vitro fertilization to chiropractic care and psychological counseling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In principle, Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at the federal level. But with S. 1028, Congress is doing precisely that, arguing that the weaknesses of the current insurance market (the absence of portability and the growing numbers of uninsured) outweigh adherence to the principles of federalism. If Congress decides to regulate the individual health insurance market, sponsors of S. 1028 should seek at least a net deregulation of the market by preempting state mandated benefit laws. In return for preemption, Congress may seek to require catastrophic coverage as a consumer protection measure. This would substantially reduce both the regulatory burden and the cost of insurance for small businesses which employ a majority of the uninsured population.
<p>
<b> Avoid a Clinton-style standardized benefits package.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should refrain from imposing any requirements that health plans cover a particular benefit, medical procedure, or service. Several Senators favor requiring health plans to cover specifically defined medical benefits. But while such a proposal is appealing on a superficial level, this approach guarantees higher costs and unintended long-term consequences. Like the Clinton plan, a standardized benefits package forces all individuals to buy benefits they neither want nor need. It does not take into account the different medical needs and desires of individuals and families. While some Americans may want and can afford the inclusion of comprehensive and expensive benefits, millions of others -- especially younger, less well off, and healthier individuals -- may not. If a worker or family member suffers from a particular disease that is not included in the standardized benefits package, that person could be medically worse off if the required extra service he needs is unaffordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specific benefits invariably are required if a Hollywood movie star or celebrity is willing to take up the cause of persons with a particular disease, replete with an appropriately colored ribbon.<sup>20</sup>  During the debate over the Clinton health plan and its variants in 1994, congressional staff, Representatives, and Senators were inundated with office visits, mail, faxes, and phone calls asking that a particular benefit or service be covered. If the group of patients is large and powerful enough, perhaps with the aid of a celebrity, it is likely that the benefit will be added by Congress. Supporters of mandated benefits should be honest about the unintended consequences that come with a mandated benefits package -- higher premiums and the politicization of diseases.
<p>
<b> Do not remove "lifetime limits" from employer-sponsored health benefit plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some Members of Congress are considering a prohibition on "lifetime limit" provisions in private health insurance plans as a way to protect patients facing high medical expenses due to catastrophic illnesses. The danger is that such a rule would raise employers' health care costs. For some companies, the extra cost could be severe enough to prevent a plan from being offered or continued, thus exposing the patient to 100 percent of all medical bills, including catastrophic claims.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime limits are necessary to help private insurance companies meet solvency standards required by the states. The same principle already applies to government health programs. For example, the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Part A Trust Fund imposes a lifetime limit on two major services:  hospitalization (150 days) and skilled nursing facility care (100 days). It is all but certain that if such a rule were applied to Medicare Part A, the Trust Fund would be insolvent long before the projected date of 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While studies have estimated the cost of eliminating lifetime caps would be an additional 2.3 percent for employers,<sup>21</sup> the findings do not take into account the added cost of prohibiting separate "inside limits" on specific categories of services already contained within existing policies. Without lifetime and inside limitations in health insurance policies, many small to mid-sized employers would be unable to purchase any type of health plan for their employees. As pointed out by the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP), a majority of employer-based health benefit plans include "inside limits" on certain benefits and services:<sup>22</sup> 
<p><blockquote>
	The Standard Option benefit package offered to federal government employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) includes a limit of one hospital inpatient treatment program per lifetime for alcohol, drug, and substance abuse.
<p>
	The Segal Company's "1994 Survey of State Employee Health Benefit Plans" also reports that 35 states included "separate annual/lifetime maximums" for mental health and/or substance abuse treatment.
</blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The strongest cost argument in favor of outlawing lifetime limits is that average increases in premiums for employers would be modest. But the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) has cited several consequences that make the removal of lifetime limitation provisions financially unattractive. One is the "[p]otential for increased health care inflation, potential pressure to liberalize limited benefit structures in public programs, and the potential impact on reinsurance companies and insurer premiums."<sup>23</sup>  Another unintended consequence of repealing lifetime limits would be the added cost taxpayers would be forced to bear for the approximately 18.2 million federal, state, and local government employees. A majority of health plans covering government employees already have lifetime limit provisions, and many also contain additional inside limits. While lifetime caps appear onerous, they give employers who voluntarily offer health benefit plans reason to believe that these plans will remain affordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime caps are but one health benefit design feature that allows employers to offer the level of benefits they can afford. During consideration of the Clinton plan, Congress and the American people rejected mandating the level of benefits that employers must provide to their employees. The issue of employer-provided health benefits is a matter best left to employers and employees. Private employers and employees, not Congress, should decide what level of benefits they can afford. Congress should avoid piecemeal additions to benefit packages based on pressure from health industry groups. If Congress bows to pressure from such groups, employers will be forced to scale back or drop the benefits they provide to accommodate a repeal of lifetime limits. Employees and their families will receive fewer benefits, and this will lead to calls for additional mandated benefits, further increasing health care costs. This unnecessary yet inevitable circle of events is sure to be triggered if Congress gets into the perennially unfinished business of benefit setting. 
<p>
<b> Consider medical malpractice reform.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there are federalism concerns involved in legislating malpractice reforms at the federal level, an urgent need exists to confront the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Indian, and Public Health programs; and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state laws, have contributed to these already large costs. In fact, medical malpractice costs have contributed greatly to increased medical costs in both the public and private sectors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In connection with medical malpractice litigation, the current legal system allows unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are separate from, and do not include compensation for, medical costs, rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses. During the first session of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives passed legislation to limit non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice. Significant provisions of the reform included a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages and the option to pay future losses exceeding $50,000 in periodic increments. The Senate should carefully consider the House medical malpractice reform provisions while encouraging substantive reforms at the state level.
<p>
<b> Place no more power and control in the hands of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 110 of S. 1028 requires insurance companies and other health plan issuers to guarantee issue coverage, without any exclusion of coverage for pre-existing conditions, to individuals who meet certain requirements related to prior group coverage. Section 111 requires guaranteed renewal of all individual health plans. Section 112 allows states to be exempt from the requirements of Sections 110 and 111 if, and only if, they have in place (or subsequently put in place) an alternative law or program that meets the same goals and is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In evaluating whether a state meets the goals, the Secretary of HHS is to evaluate state programs according to the four criteria:
<P>
1) Whether the state law or program provides coverage to individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
2) Whether the state law or program provides coverage for preexisting conditions for individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
3) Whether the state law or program provides individuals leaving group coverage with a choice of health plans or a health plan providing comprehensive coverage; and<p>

4) Whether requiring a state to comply with Sections 110 and 111 would have an adverse impact on the number of individuals in the state who have access to affordable health insurance coverage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among insurance experts, there is a wide range of estimates on how much premiums in the individual health insurance market actually would increase under S. 1028. Rather than mandate a single uniform approach, as called for in Section 112, Congress should allow the various states to experiment with alternative approaches and methods. States should determine for themselves the best way to guarantee continued availability of health coverage to their residents leaving the group market. To date, 11 states already have enacted guaranteed issue requirements in the individual market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 112 vests enormous power in the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary, in effect, can disapprove legitimate state initiatives that address the problem of how to guarantee continuation of coverage for individuals and families. For instance, the Secretary could rule that state high-risk pools are not "affordable" because their premiums are higher than prevailing market rates, even though significant subsidies are required to cover the true costs of enrollees. Under this scenario, most states' high-risk pools could be found "unaffordable" and unacceptable to the Secretary.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of allowing the Secretary to control how states regulate their individual insurance markets (a traditional state function), S. 1028 should allow the state insurance commissioner (or the official or officials designated by the state to enforce the goals of this legislation) to determine whether the alternative state law or program meets the goals of S. 1028. No review or approval by the Secretary of HHS should be required.
<p>
<b> Reject Section 121's extension of COBRA.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 121 of S. 1028 changes COBRA (P.L. 99-272) by allowing individuals who have disabled family members, or who become disabled at any time during their coverage under an initial COBRA extension period, to extend their coverage for the additional 11 months. Currently, this extension is available only to workers who are disabled at the time they lose their coverage.<sup>24</sup>  Today, coverage under COBRA may last from 18 to 36 months, depending on the circumstances of the event leading to loss of health insurance. Under current law, covered employees and dependents are required to pay up to 102 percent of the total premium during the 18-month period. Disabled employees and dependents are eligible for 29 months of continued coverage but then must pay up to 150 percent of the total premium during the additional 11 months.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the extension of COBRA sounds appealing to Members of Congress and the public, the reality is that employers, and ultimately workers, are required to pay the actual claims costs incurred by employees opting for coverage under COBRA. In short, such a change is another employer mandate. This extra expense has been particularly burdensome on employers already struggling to give health benefits to their current employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan public policy research organization specializing in employee benefits, "many employers consider COBRA to be a costly mandate. Any expansion of COBRA would almost certainly increase employer cost for health insurance."<sup>25</sup>  And according to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, "Claims costs for COBRA subscribers, on average, are typically 40 percent to 60 percent higher than the costs of active employees. Those people who seek COBRA coverage are people who need, but cannot obtain, affordable coverage as individuals, and their high use of medical services is directly reflected in the unusually high COBRA claims costs."<sup>26</sup>  These higher than average costs, which must be borne by employers, will lead inevitably to a reduction in employee benefits and compensation, or to withdrawal from the market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Suggestions have been made that S. 1028's COBRA provision be extended to all companies. Placing additional mandates on small employers (less than 20 employees) could jeopardize protections for beneficiaries of self-funded ERISA health plans. For example, small employers who insure their employees under federal ERISA requirements have been able to avoid costly state-mandated benefits and taxes on their health plans. It would be ironic for Members of Congress to impose a new layer of federal mandates on a class of employers who have sought protection and relief from state mandates. Furthermore, such an unprecedented reach of federal regulatory power would preempt many of the innovative and effective health reform measures that states have developed and implemented themselves. Finally, the costs associated with such an extension would be too large for small businesses operating on a slim profit margin to bear.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b> Replace the Senate HPPCs with House provisions encouraging multiple employer health plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HPPCs in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill as drafted are vague and will generate intrusive and burdensome federal regulations. Congress should strike this newly created infrastructure and replace it with provisions that would encourage the use of multiple employer health plans, voluntary health insurance associations, and other fully insured arrangements. Legislation to accomplish this (HR. 995) has been proposed by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL).<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of giving small businesses and individuals increased purchasing power in the health insurance market is shared by a vast majority of Members of Congress. Unfortunately, S. 1028 creates an additional federal regulatory framework in setting up its HPPCs while simultaneously placing them at a competitive advantage over non-HPPC plans in the health insurance market. Lawmakers should be cautious in supporting legislation which, in its present form, easily could turn the health insurance market into a government-run entity at either the state or federal levels, reproducing something that looks and works like President Clinton's Health Security Act.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In stark contrast, Title III of the Fawell bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase fully insured coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>29</sup>  Since 85 percent of the uninsured population are in families headed by a worker,<sup>30</sup> it is significant that Title III of the Fawell proposal seeks to use ERISA to preempt state laws that prohibit two or more employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage under any fully insured multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to providing smaller employers and individuals with increased purchasing power, the Fawell proposal eliminates the confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has led to a cottage industry of fly-by-night insurance swindlers who hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. Ironically, states that have enacted statutes regulating legitimate self-insured multiple employer plans often have hurt legitimate arrangements meeting the ERISA plan definitions and caused such arrangements to dissolve. These state actions have been arbitrary and do not follow any consistent pattern of reasoning, either within a state or among states. To remedy this situation, Title III of the Fawell proposal would give states a consistent guideline for the regulation of legitimate ERISA multiple employer plans wishing to continue their operations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title III also would give legitimate self-insured associations (including but not limited to church plans, franchise networks, associations, certain large employers, and collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options. First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in the states permitting such practices. Alternatively, these plans could seek federal certification pursuant to the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Under Title III of the Fawell proposal, entities that are created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would automatically be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business. In turn, the states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage as they attempt to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers, this does not necessitate the creation of new entities and additional federal regulations as prescribed in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Accordingly, the Fawell proposal gives smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the "[e]conomies of scale that large employers and multi-union employer plans have had for years under ERISA [to gain] access to affordable insurance."<sup>31</sup>  Unlike the uneven playing field created in S. 1028, the Fawell proposal would help ensure the ability of traditional insurance carriers to compete with self-insured plans for the small employer, self-employed, and individual market.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate. In Congress, there is a strong desire to reform the broken health insurance market. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned effort to address the portability problem that confronts millions of workers and their families. While the creation of group-to-individual conversion is a positive step toward making health insurance more portable, its impact is diminished by the creation of additional regulatory distortions in the health insurance market. It is unfortunate that S. 1028 fails to address the tax system that currently impedes the ability of the market to function, and that it opens up the dangers of new distortions and sources of instability.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over 80 percent of Americans under age 65 are covered by health insurance. While they generally are satisfied with their coverage, a genuine fear exists that this security could be lost. Reform of the health insurance market should address the source of this fear -- the fact that health insurance is predominantly employment-based and that federal tax policy exclusively favors this type of arrangement. This Senate bill does not address the key problems confronting the millions of Americans seeking to gain access to the health insurance market. The sponsors of S. 1028 attempt, instead, to create a transitional phase from group (employer-based) to individual coverage through federal regulation. Despite its drawbacks, however, S. 1028 could be the vehicle for significant health insurance reform, including the individual ownership of health insurance plans. By incorporating the improvements offered in the House proposal, S. 1028 could advance the security of health insurance for millions of working families. Instead of distorting the health insurance market with unnecessary and detrimental regulations, Members of Congress should promote a free-market policy by creating a health insurance system that is driven by consumer choice and genuine competition.

The health insurance market is one that traditionally has been regulated at the state level. Any congressional reform should not hamper the successes and innovations produced by state initiatives. To its sponsors' credit, S. 1028 challenges the false presumption that health insurance should be exclusively employment-based, and even more important, highlights the problems of portability and affordability that are inherent consequences of such a restrictive system. Members of Congress should build on the positive features of S. 1028 while making improvements that will give working Americans what they want from health insurance reform:  true portability and individual policies that give them long-term health insurance protection against the financial devastation of catastrophic illness.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Congress is expected soon to consider legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the multilateral trade talks concluded successfully last
December. Among other provisions, the new pact for the first time
subjects trade in farm products to GATT's international trading rules.
(For a full discussion of the provisions of the Agriculture Agreement,
see Joe Cobb, "A Guide to the New GATT Agreement," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994.) 
<P>
     This means that U.S. farmers will face substantially lower trade
barriers when trying to export their products. Under the agreement,
the signatories agreed that all existing non-tariff barriers
(including import quotas) must be converted to tariffs, and every
agricultural product must be allowed at least some minimum level of
access to their domestic markets under low or minimal tariff rates.
Countries that export farm products will be required to reduce the
volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent and the amount of the
subsidy by 36 percent over six years. The agreement also calls for
reduction of all domestic agricultural subsidies (such as U.S. farm
subsidies) tied to production of commodities and significant reduction
of all existing direct agricultural export subsidies. (Specific
changes in U.S. law required by the GATT agreement will have to be
made in the implementing legislation. Section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, which provides authority to impose quotas if imports
are undercutting price support programs, will be repealed and replaced
with authority for tariff rate quotas. The implementing legislation
similarly curtails restrictions on imported peanuts, in addition to
limiting subsidized exports of government-held dairy stocks and
repealing the Meat Import Act.)
<P>
     Along with the new regional market opened up by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the prospect of expanding
free trade arrangements involving the United States, (See Michael G.
Wilson, "Building on the NAFTA: Forging a Free Trade Agreement with
Chile," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 991, June 27, 1994.)
ratification of GATT will open up a potential marketplace of six
billion customers for U.S. farmers -- compared with the U.S. domestic
market of only 250 million people. 
<P>
     The ability of American farmers to seize the opportunity provided
by this vast new market, however, will depend upon changes in U.S.
farm policy. America possesses the most productive land resources and
advanced agricultural infrastructure in the world, yet U.S. farmers
have been unable to capitalize on these advantages. Even though world
consumption of food and agricultural products has increased
substantially since 1981, U.S. agricultural exports have decreased
overall, and exports of unprocessed agricultural commodities have
fallen (see chart on page 3).
<P>
     One obstacle that must be removed if U.S. farmers are to take
advantage of GATT is supply-control policies, specifically the annual
acreage reduction programs (ARPs) and the Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP). These programs have removed on average over 15 percent of U.S.
acreage from production annually and thus limited the opportunity of
farmers to export. To appreciate what this means, it is as though
government policies had shut down 15 percent of the U.S. computer
industry while the international market for computers is booming.
Meanwhile, agricultural producers in the rest of the world have
increased their production to fill the void created by reduced U.S.
production. These foreign producers have sold their products at a
lower price, thereby making the United States the "residual supplier,"
or the last seller to be chosen in most markets.
<P>
     Another obstacle that stands in the way of farmers taking
advantage of GATT is the Export Enhancement Program (EEP), which
subsidizes the dumping of U.S. agricultural products on the world
market. Although EEP was intended to make U.S. farm products more
competitive, the program is counterproductive. In fact, U.S. export
subsidies depress world prices while domestic prices remain high,
creating a price differential that has made the United States an
importer of some agricultural products. (This was demonstrated earlier
this year when U.S. supply control programs contributed to a short
supply of durum wheat -- a specialty crop used in making pasta
products -- leading to increased imports of Canadian wheat in order to
supply U.S. pastamakers.)
<P>
     The United States has an opportunity to reverse these policies
and restore the competitive position of American agriculture when
Congress considers the 1995 farm bill. Because farm policy is
reauthorized only every four or five years in the farm bill, next
year's bill will be the first opportunity to revise these policies to
take advantage of GATT.
<P>
     For U.S. farmers to benefit from the world market opened up by
GATT, Congress needs to incorporate the following changes in farm
legislation: (Additional changes needed in U.S. agricultural policy
will be addressed in future papers.)
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction or set-aside programs.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program to include only highly
erodible acres.
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program.
<P>
     The U.S. policy of unilaterally idling massive land resources
already has led to a significant loss in America's share of the
expanding world market. This has shrunk farmers' ability to earn
income from the marketplace, held back the development of agribusiness
infrastructure, and caused economic problems for many rural areas. By
eliminating acreage reduction programs and modifying the Conservation
Reserve Program, Congress could make sure that U.S. agriculture once
again becomes the leading force in the world export market by enabling
U.S. farmers to take advantage of the promised benefits of GATT's
trade liberalization and reform. And by eliminating the Export
Enhancement Program, the U.S. will no longer be employing a trade-
distorting practice that actually undermines the potential of certain
export markets.
<P>
     The enormous export potential of American agriculture has been
held back for years by federal policies that largely ignore the huge
world market. GATT makes that world market potentially even larger and
attractive to U.S. farmers. If the 1995 farm bill revamps policies so
that farmers can make full use of agriculture's productive capacity to
compete in the world's market, U.S. farm income will increase and the
rural economy will receive an enormous boost, creating jobs, producing
greater prosperity, and reinvigorating distressed communities. But if
the farm programs are not revised, rural America will stagnate while
other countries exploit the new markets opened up by GATT.
<P>
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE
<P>
     Implementing GATT will mark the beginning of a new era for world
agriculture and agricultural trade. Before the diplomatic breakthrough
which made the GATT agricultural agreement possible, trade
protectionism in agriculture was practiced throughout the world,
especially by such developed countries as the United States and the
nations of the European Union.
<P>
     This protectionism has not helped domestic producers, even in
developed countries. Explicit import restrictions, including quotas
and tariffs, and non-tariff trade barriers, such as unwarranted food
safety and quality regulations, merely have hindered the ability of
developing countries to penetrate the developed countries' markets. At
the same time, the United States and the European Union have been
waging a mutually destructive and trade-distorting bidding war, using
export subsidies to finance underpriced sales into the developing
countries. The costs of such distortions to agricultural production
and trade have been rising steadily while U.S. market share has
declined, as demonstrated in the chart on the preceeding page. The
GATT Uruguay Round agreement is significant because it reverses this
trend and reopens competition for markets based on productivity, not
protectionist policies.
<P>
     GATT will open up marketing opportunities for U.S. livestock
products throughout the world, including Japan and Europe (where
import barriers have been particularly restrictive). More
significantly, GATT will raise the incomes and standards of living in
the developing world because global economic expansion (the GATT
agreement is expected to expand the world economy by $6 trillion by
the turn of the century) will stimulate growth throughout the world.
This will lead in turn to more demand for higher-protein sources of
food. This trend is likely to be most pronounced in the fastest-
growing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where half the
population is under 15 years of age and the nutritional requirements
are greater than in older populations. By the end of this century, 60
percent of the world's population will be living in Asia, where
incomes are rising dramatically. And before the year 2050, it is
expected that world population will double and that, due to rising
standards of living, world food needs will triple. (Dennis T. Avery,
"Saving the Planet with High-Yield Farming," paper presented at The
Heritage Foundation's Agricultural Policy Roundtable, May 23, 1994.)  
<P>
     For U.S. farmers, this translates into an extraordinary
opportunity to increase the export of many agricultural commodities,
especially corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, and livestock
products. There are also indirect opportunities due to a larger world
market. For instance, the new access into the fast-growing Asian
market for beef, pork, and poultry will mean increased domestic
consumption of grains by U.S. livestock. Thus, the U.S. grain sector
will benefit not only from direct sales of grain, but also from
greater sales of grain-fed livestock.
<P>
     Since U.S. agricultural productivity is rising faster than
domestic food demand, agriculture's well-being depends heavily on
international trade. If U.S. farmers manage to regain the competitive
edge internationally, the share of overall U.S. production going to
export will increase significantly; but if this historic opportunity
is lost because domestic farm policies hold back potential exports,
farming communities will suffer greatly.
<P>
     Existing U.S. agricultural policies already have hastened the
loss of much of the agricultural market in Western Europe. Rather than
concentrate their efforts on the daunting task of trying to regain
limited markets already lost, however, U.S. farmers stand to gain much
more from looking to the growing markets of the future. For instance,
farmers need to develop the Asian and Latin American markets and be
poised to move into Africa as that market awakens. U.S. agriculture is
now at a crossroads where it must use its advantageous position to
capture a greater share of these expanding markets stimulated by the
rising food needs of a growing population.
<P>
DOMESTIC BENEFITS OF GROWTH-ORIENTED PRODUCTION AND EXPORT POLICIES
<P>
     American farmers have much to gain if policies are amended to
take full advantage of GATT. First, however, U.S. policies will have
to be changed to raise output rather than curb it and to make prices
more competitive. U.S. farm programs today use non-recourse loans,
target prices, and deficiency payments to stabilize the income of
farmers producing certain commodities. "Non-recourse" means a farmer
can borrow money from the government on his harvested crop and then
either repay the loan and sell the crop or default on the loan and
forfeit the crop to the government. The farmer's credit rating is not
affected by his default, and the loan in reality is a minimum
guaranteed income from his crop. If a target price is established for
a particular commodity, the government pays the farmer a "deficiency
payment" (the difference between the target price and the average
market price) if the market price falls below that target. Again, this
means the farmer has a minimum guaranteed income.
<P>
     The loan rates also establish a floor under the commodity price
and signal to the rest of the world what a foreign producer must
charge for his product to beat the American price. Because the U. S.
product is usually the higher-priced product in the international
export market, buyers often turn to the U.S. market only after first
exhausting the supplies offered by other exporters.
<P>
     Increasing Farm Incomes. Periods of export growth historically
have been periods of large income gain for U.S. farmers. In the early
1970s, for example, U.S. grain exports doubled in just four years.
According to J.B. Penn, then Deputy Administrator for Economics at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, "net farm income reached the highest
level since World War II and parts of the agricultural sector enjoyed
nearly unparalleled prosperity." (D. Gale Johnson, ed., "Food and
Agricultural Policy for the 1980's," American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy Research, 1981.)
<P>
     In the 1980s, on the other hand, the United States priced itself
out of international markets by setting too high a floor under
commodity prices in the 1981 farm bill. That legislation provided
automatic increases in loan rates to reflect the double-digit
inflation the country was experiencing at the time. These rigid
minimum loan rates effectively established a minimum export price.
(Farm legislation sets loan rates for major commodities which
establish a floor under the commodity price by allowing the producer
to choose to sell his crop and repay the loan or forfeit his crop to
the government and keep the money. The 1981 farm bill established
these loan rates with automatic escalators, which ultimately exceeded
the inflation rate. Rather than selling their crop which conceivably
could then have found their way to an export outlet, most producers
forfeited their crops to the government and kept the government loan,
which was higher than the prevailing world market prices.) Foreign
competitors undersold these artificially high prices, and U.S. exports
fell. 
<P>
     Domestic commodity prices fell even lower because the resulting
stockpile of surplus commodities continued to depress the markets.
Recognizing that the automatically escalating loan rates in the 1981
farm bill priced American agricultural producers out of the export
market, Congress provided flexibility to decrease loan rates in the
1985 farm bill. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, new mistakes were made in the 1985 farm bill.
Target prices were kept relatively high, which meant that U.S. farmers
became dependent on the federal government for an even greater share
of income. Rather than dealing with this budget concern directly, the
1985 farm bill called for a greater reliance on the use of acreage
reduction programs to control costs and created the Conservation
Reserve Program (CRP), also intended to reduce production available
for program eligibility, despite the fact that attempting to bolster
domestic farm prices by restricting supply severely limits the export
potential of U.S. farmers. Thus, after gaining a growing share of
world grain usage in the 1970s, U.S. farmers saw that share fall
significantly after the return to supply management policies in the
early 1980s.
<P>
     As in any other sector of the economy, a farm policy designed to
raise farm incomes should promote growth in world consumption and try
to capture a larger share of that consumption for U.S. exporters.
Fuller and more efficient use of production resources is the key to
this since it lowers unit costs and increases export revenues. In
short, greater and more efficient production increases total volume
and widens the margin of profit.
<P>
     A recent study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed
Foundation indicates that returning 38 million idled acres to
production could increase gross farm revenue by $8 billion and net
farm income by $4 billion. (Abel, Daft and Earley, an economic
analysis consulting firm, located in Alexandria, Virginia, conducted a
study on behalf of the U.S. Agriculture 20/20 Project of The National
Grain and Feed Foundation. The study "Large-Scale Land Idling Has
Retarded Growth of U.S. Agriculture," was released in May 1994.)
Taxpayers also would benefit from such increased production because
farmers would receive a greater share of their income from the
marketplace rather than from the federal government -- which for the
last 10 years has spent an average of some $14 billion annually on
commodity programs (see the above chart).
<P>
     Reinvigorating the Rural Economy. The federal government's supply
control policies have a widespread impact on the entire U.S. economy.
Stagnant economic activity in the U.S. agricultural sector leads to a
loss of jobs not just in farming, but also in the supply, processing,
and marketing industries. In addition, agribusinesses reduce their
investments of capital needed to replace obsolete equipment and fully
utilize technological advancements. This hits major businesses
producing such items as heavy farm equipment. Moreover, without
capital investment, the United States cannot be a dominant force in
processing and selling agricultural products internationally. 
<P>
     Changes in U.S. agricultural policy that stimulate greater
output, on the other hand, will give agribusiness the incentive to
invest in greater economic efficiency. Such a growth-oriented policy
would restore the United States as the world's premier farm producer
and exporter. It also would revive the vast and valuable agricultural
infrastructure, much of which -- though still surpassing that of other
countries -- has been allowed to deteriorate during the past decade. A
free market revolution thus would bring economic growth to rural
communities, generating jobs in businesses that provide inputs to
farmers and that process and market their crops. This expanded
economic activity could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs,
providing a much-needed boost to the rural economy.
<P>
     Increasing agricultural production also would have an impact on
the rest of the American economy. A multiplier effect would spread the
benefits of increased production from producers to processors and
distributors and would include the seed, fertilizer, chemical,
transportation, equipment manufacturing and construction industries.
Thus, the study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed Foundation
concludes that returning 38 million acres to production would not
merely boost farm income by $4 billion, but could "increase national
income by $28.9 billion annually and generate over 225,000 more full-
time jobs." (Ibid.)
<P>
A PRO-GROWTH FARM BILL IN 1995
<P>
     Ten years ago, the one significant reform in the 1985 farm bill
was based on a recognition that the United States, if it was to be a
successful agriculture exporter, had to allow farm prices to be
competitive. The 1995 farm bill could build on this by enabling
farmers to capture the benefits of agricultural trade reform.
<P>
     In order to capitalize on the future expansion of world trade,
the 1995 farm bill must promote and reward growth. The United States
produces more agricultural products than it can consume domestically,
and the gap between its production potential and its domestic demand
base is widening. Agricultural productivity will continue to advance
because of biotechnological breakthroughs and the use of such new
technologies as "site specific production." (When site-specific
production becomes available for commercial use, producers will be
able to use this satellite technology to maximize production by
applying the optimum amount of seed, fertilizer, and nutrients per
acre of cultivation.) 
<P>
     The first goal of the 1995 farm bill thus must be to enhance U.S.
agriculture's position as a competitive exporter. In an increasingly
competitive market, it is the low-cost producer that will capture new
markets and the resultant income. But supply controls and export
subsidies inhibit U.S. agriculture's ability to exploit its
competitive position. Specifically, in order to achieve a pro-growth
agricultural policy and realize the benefits that will flow from such
a policy, the following actions must be taken in the 1995 farm bill:
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction (ARP) or set-aside programs. 
<P>
     U.S. agricultural policy uses subsidy programs that rely
generally on supply control mechanisms instead of the market to
maintain farm income. For most of this decade, the United States has
been the only major farm producer to follow a policy of deliberately
idling productive land. More recently, the U.S. has persuaded the
European Union to begin similar supply control policies. This policy
does more than physically limit the amount of product available for
export, it also undermines the competitiveness of U.S. farm products
overseas because fixed production costs are spread across fewer
producing acres. This raises the farmer's cost of production per
bushel and leaves the established network of agricultural supply,
servicing, and processing industries to operate at a reduced capacity,
which raises handling costs and discourages maintenance and
reinvestment. Moreover, land idling tends to reduce demand for -- and
lower the prices of -- such things as seeds and fertilizers. When
these are exported because of limits on domestic production, the
result is lower production costs for America's competitors, who wisely
do not limit production.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
<P>
     The CRP, authorized by the 1985 farm bill, was intended to target
erodible croplands for removal from production and to encourage
conservation. It now includes over 36 million acres on which
landowners receive rental payments under ten-year contracts in return
for removing the land from production. Much of this acreage actually
is highly productive land that, through utilization of readily
available conservation practices, is not vulnerable to unacceptable
erosion. The CRP contracts will begin to expire in 1995, and about
two-thirds will expire by 1997. A modified CRP should include only
highly erodible acres. Based upon USDA's land capability
classification system, about 22 million of the acres enrolled in the
CRP are in the top land capability classes with relatively low
erodibility. Only 4 million are highly erodible, while the remaining
10 million are of debatable erodibility.
<P>
     In the last twelve years, acreage reduction programs and the
Conservation Reserve Program have removed a total of almost 650
million acres from production. This would cover an area about four
times the size of Texas and is some 45 percent greater than the total
area of U.S. cropland annually under production, which is
approximately 450 million acreas (see the chart on the preceeding
page).
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). 
<P>
     The EEP pays exporters to dump agricultural products on the world
market at discounted prices by providing the exporter a dollar subsidy
price for specified quantities of commodities to be exported. Since
its inception, the EEP has been used primarily on grains. Previously,
the EEP was provided in the form of bonus commodities from CCC stocks.
Then, at least, the program added to exportable supplies. Now, even
that marginal benefit has disappeared.
<P>
     Such a program cannot be justified in a post-Uruguay Round world.
For one thing, the GATT agreement requires governments to cut back
such subsidies. For another, because export subsidies tend to
encourage sales of certain commodities by making the purchase of those
commodities relatively attractive, regardless of actual demand, they
distort markets to the disadvantage of the exporter with the greatest
growth potential, which is the United States. Because the EEP allows
the United States to continue temporarily to export products based on
an artificial stimulus rather than on real demand, it makes the U.S.
agricultural system sluggish and unresponsive and wastes resources
that could be used better elsewhere. 
<P>
     Continued use of export subsidies will serve only to depress
world grain and oilseed prices while distorting buyer-seller
relationships between countries. The elimination of export subsidies
on grain in particular would improve the global competitiveness not
only of grain, but also of oilseeds and livestock produced in the
United States.
<P>
     If these changes in U.S. farm policy are made, U.S. producers
will be the best positioned to serve growing world demand. By using
the natural advantages that enable it to be the low-cost producer, the
United States once again can become a successful exporter of
agricultural products.
<P>
OBSTACLES TO REFORM
<P>
     These reforms will not happen automatically, however. Certain
sectors of U.S. agriculture, such as the National Association of Wheat
Growers, National Cotton Council, and National Farmers Union, do not
seem to recognize the economic and job-creating opportunities created
by the new global marketplace. They believe that GATT will make U.S.
farmers more vulnerable to competition from imports. In fact, in
hearings held this past summer, a number of commodity and farm groups
claimed that GATT reforms will make it even more important to keep
present farm programs with little or no change in order to protect
U.S. agriculture from competition. (The House Agriculture Subcommittee
on General Farm Commodities held hearings in June and July of 1994 to
review the general outlook for the farm economy and commodity
programs.)
<P>
     Such reluctance to change is natural, since very few farmers have
ever known anything other than a system of subsidies and supply
controls. But if this siege mentality prevails, it will condemn U.S.
agriculture to stagnation while other countries enjoy the fruits of
new markets. Fortunately, in a recent survey of readers conducted by
Top Producer magazine, when asked their opinion of a proposal to
reform farm programs that would eliminate deficiency payments and set-
asides, 26 percent responded favorably. Although 31 percent were
opposed, 34 percent were interested but said they needed more
information. (Top Producer, opinion survey, conducted in February and
March 1994.) Some farmers evidently recognize that dependence on
government subsidies also subjects them to a lackluster future.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Entrepreneurial farmers and agricultural groups should join
forces with those agribusiness concerns that led the fight for NAFTA
and GATT. Much of agribusiness understands the economic benefits of
agricultural trade liberalization and reform. Through past experience
with short supply situations, they have learned that supply controls
and export subsidies undermine their ability to do business, both here
and abroad, and to provide jobs and prosperity in rural America. 
<P>
     A strong voice for a future based on opportunity, not
protectionism, is needed now more than ever. U.S. agriculture faces an
historic opportunity, as a result of NAFTA and GATT reforms, to
reestablish its preeminence in the world export market. If Congress
takes the actions necessary to establish America's position as the
world leader in meeting the growing demands of this new market, the
result will be decades of prosperity ahead for farmers and greater
economic growth and stability in rural America. 
<P>
     The 1995 farm bill provides the opportunity to make the necessary
changes in agricultural policy. Four or five more years likely will
pass before farm legislation is considered again. By then, farmers in
the rest of the world already will have taken advantage of the
opportunity to meet the demands of the global marketplace. Thus, if
this opportunity is missed, rural America will face a future of
continued economic stagnation.

<h2>Abolishing the Department of Education In Order to Liberate Parents and Schools</h2><p>
<h3>A Joint Statement by Former Secretaries of Education</h3><br>
<h3>Lamar Alexander and William J. Bennett</h3><p>
<i><b>Delivered before the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigation</i></b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: <p>
 
It is a particular pleasure for us to address this Committee with its 
new name, new majority and new chairman. Thank you for the 
opportunity to set forth our views on the federal role in education. 
You have an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of 
history in this domain. <p>
 
In this statement we outline a fundamental transformation; namely, 
reversing the direction of a mighty river that, for the past thirty 
years, has flowed in the direction of Washington, D.C. We have 
long been convinced that this river -- of responsibility, authority and 
accountability for American education -- should instead flow 
toward our families, schools, communities and states we sketch in 
this statement, and the principles on which they rest, are not new 
for us, for the Presidents we have served, or for many more of our 
fellow Republicans. What has changed is that it is finally within the 
capacity of the Congress to put them into action. <p>
 

<center><h3>What's Gone Wrong </h3></center><p>
 
The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in 
Washington over the past several decades. The national government 
has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes 
more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is 
misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for 
their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of 
distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and 
teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to 
lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the 
renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, 
that Washington knows best and is taking charge. <p>
 
We and Presidents Reagan and Bush did all we could to reverse the 
flow, place the emphasis on states and communities, promote 
flexibility and choice, forge a true partnership with the governors, 
end discrimination against individuals without preferential treatment 
for any group, and halt Washington's growing regulatory apparatus. 
But every such effort was rebuffed by the Democratic Congress -- 
now aided and abetted by the Clinton administration -- which has 
pressed relentlessly in the opposite direction, encouraged in this 
endeavor by education's myriad special interest groups. <p>
 
To anyone who thinks we exaggerate, we recommend reading the 
full texts of Goals 2000 and "H.R.6", the administration's two main 
education bills -- particularly as these were finally enacted by the 
103rd Congress. Especially when they are taken in combination, it 
becomes plain that their authors 'want to substitute decisions made 
in Washington for decisions made by individual households and 
communities. They transform what had been a national movement 
into a federal program. They create new governance structures and 
regulatory mechanisms at both national and state levels. They use 
federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the 
behaviors that other parts of the legislation declare to be 
"voluntary". They throw obstacles onto such promising reform 
pathways as school choice and private management of public 
schools. They strip the bi-partisan National Assessment Governing 
Board of much of its independence. And they do all this while pretending otherwise, by wrapping themselves in rhetoric of 
"helping" education and pasting friendly-sounding titles on the 
cover (H.R.6 was dubbed the "Improving America's Schools Act") 
while in reality their contents were written by and for lobbyists and 
interest groups to whom the skills and knowledge of children are 
not the top priority. <p>
 
Federal education policy has been moving in this direction since 
1965. It took a breather, at least within the executive branch 
between 1981 and 1992, but the past two years have seen the pent-
up "governmentalism" of that decade unleashed upon the land. For 
a time we supposed that it was possible to have a national 
education reform project that worked like a true and durable 
partnership and did not evolve into another rule-bound federal 
program. The last two years have proven us wrong. In addition to 
Goals 2000 and H.R.6, we have seen the executive branch give 
blanket endorsement to scholarships based on race; take the heat 
off those who would use "diversity" as a criterion for accreditation; 
propose the race-norming of state assessment results; and persecute 
states that employ test-based standards for high school graduation. 
It's now clear that the federal government will eventually break 
whatever it touches. Rather than tinker around the margins, 
therefore, the time has come for a great and thorough change. <p>
 

<center><h3>A Different Philosophy </center></h3><p>
 
The essential part of our proposal is not its particulars but the four 
principles on which it rests. It is these, above all, that we commend 
to the Committee's consideration. One can adjust the details that 
follow. Any comprehensive overhaul based on these principles, 
however, will represent fundamental redirection -- and an historic 
accomplishment, worth the new Congress. <p>
 
First, education in America is the constitutional responsibility of the 
states the social responsibility of communities, and the moral 
responsibility of families. <p>
 
Second, except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the 
federal government should never impede the capacity of families, 
teachers, communities and states to decide how best to provide 
education to their children, and should never substitute its judgment 
for theirs. <p>
 
Third, goals, standards, assessments, the dissemination of 
information and ideas, and the encouragement of bold innovation 
are legitimate leadership and "bully pulpit" activities of national 
officials, but they must always be truly voluntary on the part of 
states and communities. Nor should federal funds be used as 
"carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local 
control. <p>


Fourth, insofar as the federal government is engaged at all in the 
field of education, it should dedicate itself to (a) fostering family 
responsibility and local control; (b) assisting states to fulfill their 
responsibilities as they see fit; (c) providing sound statistics, prompt 
and accurate assessment results and other information; and (d) 
safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination. <p>
 

<center><h3>Repairing Recent Damage </center></h3><p>

In the 1,200 or so pages of the Goals 2000 and H.R.6 legislation 
enacted last year is considerable mischief that should immediately 
be defunded and then repealed. Ten leading candidates include: <p>
 
1. The National Education Standards and Improvement Council -- 
the "national school board" that is so vivid a symbol of education 
wrong-think in Washington, and the new state panels mandated by 
Goals 2000. Our states and communities have all the governments 
they need; they don't need new decision-making structures designed 
in Washington. <p>
 
2. Federal ''certification'' of national and state education standards 
and federal approval of state and local education reform plans. 
Those controversial new standards should make their own way 
through the marketplace of ideas without any federal "seal of 
approval." Nor do federal bureaucrats have any business second-
guessing state and local priorities for school reform. <p>
 
3. Prohibitions and disincentives for state/local testing programs 
and accountability systems. Among the most dismaying features of 
Goals 2000 (and recent actions by the Office for Civil Rights) is the 
effort to discourage the very tests that might actually encourage our 
students to learn more -- and give parents and taxpayers better 
information. <p>
4. New "gender equity" programs. The last thing we need is the 
federal government telling America's 15,000 communities how to 
teach little boys and little girls about one another -- or mandating 
how teachers are to handle such matters. Nor do we need a new 
"special assistant for gender equity" to enforce such mandates. <p>
 
5. Federal regulation of schools' weapons policies and sex 
education. That's why we have parents, teachers, principals and 
school boards. <p>
 
6. All references to "opportunity to learn" standards. If the 
experience of American education these past thirty years has taught 
us anything, it's the importance of maintaining a laser-like focus on 
student achievement and of creating accountability systems that are 
based on school results. The recent legislation deflects attention 
back toward such "inputs" as spending levels, class size, and 
degrees conferred by colleges of education -- and invites even more 
litigation based on such spurious gauges while discouraging true 
accountability for schools, teachers and students. <p>


7. Disincentives for states and localities that want to try such 
reforms as vouchers, charter schools and privatization. If we are 
ever to transform American education, we must give families -- 
especially poor families -- the right to choose their children's 
schools from among all the schools in their communities; give 
communities opportunities to create "break the mold schools" that 
are not regulated to death by the bureaucracy; and invite the private 
sector to help interested communities create the best schools in the 
world. Yet the recent legislation places obstacles in the path of 
states and communities that want to try such things. -What sort of 
choice program allows the sending" school to deny children the 
right to leave? The sort enacted in H.R.6. <p>
 
8. Extension of Davis-Bacon provisions to school construction and 
renovation. That means a principal in Moline who wants to hire a 
contractor to rewire his school for new computers must pay the 
prevailing union wage rather than getting the job done for the 
lowest cost. It's a big favor for the unions, but no favor at all for 
schools, efficiency or economy. <p>
 
9. The addition of two more national goals to the original six. 
Parent involvement and teacher training are fine, but goals should 
be limited to specific, measurable results, such as President Bush 
and the Governors (including then-governor Bill Clinton) 
established in Charlottesville. <p>
 
10. Weakening the National Assessment Governing Board. Our 
best source of reliable student achievement data at the national and 
state levels is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the 
integrity of which depends on the absolute independence and 
complete policy control of its Governing Board. H.R.6 undermined 
that board, giving greater influence to education interest groups and 
to a sluggish federal bureaucracy that is easily politicized. <p>
 

<center><h3>Reasons for Devolution</center></h3><p>
 
Mr. Chairman, here is the heart of our proposal for the long term: 
the Congress should take every single activity currently housed in 
the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) 
send it home to the states and communities; (b) entrust it to another 
federal agency that is suited to conduct it in harmony with related 
activities; or (c) abolish it on grounds that the federal government 
can no longer afford to spend money on programs that have 
outlived their usefulness or that can be handled satisfactorily by 
others. We will not endeavor here to fill in every detail or answer 
each question that might be asked about this far-reaching 
recommendation, but the examples that follow indicate its main 
features. <p>
 
<center><h3>Sending responsibility home </center></h3><p>
 
* Virtually all major programs assisting elementary/secondary 
education should be combined into a "block" and returned to the 
states and communities. This can be accomplished in several ways: 
the best, in our judgment, is a "responsibility swap" whereby the 
states assume full responsibility for education in return for federal 
assumption of other burdens now borne by the states; or a resource 
base transfer in which some federal tax is reduced by an amount 
equivalent to the programs in question, thereby leaving it to state 
and communities to raise and deploy these revenues as they see fit. 
A third approach is a no-strings "block grant" of federal fund to the 
state, though we like this least because of the well-known tendency 
of block grants to grow strings as time passes. <p>
 
The core of this block are programs under the headings of 
"education reform" (including goals 2000), school improvement, 
education for the disadvantaged, bilingual education, and vocational 
and adult education -- approximately $10 billion in all. That means 
upwards of a billion dollars a year for a big state like California and 
about $200 million for a smaller one like Tennessee, funds that the 
state and its communities would be free to spend it for any 
educational purpose, including such innovations as charter schools 
and vouchers. (The distribution formula can retain the equity-
conscious fiscal effects of today's programs.) The federal 
government would no longer define legitimate education reform, 
nor would states and communities have to submit their plans to 
Washington for approval. <p>
 
We will leave it to the budget-and-appropriations process to 
determine whether the block should equal the sum of its antecedent 
programs, but we note that a number of governors have made clear 
their willingness to endure a funding reduction in return for the 
freedom to deploy the remainder as their states see fit. We also note 
that eliminating the heavy overhead and "middleman" costs of 
current categorical programs (at both federal and state levels) will 
concentrate more resources on teaching and learning. <p>
 
A block grant to the states should also combine a number of the 
smaller higher education programs, with the exception of the main 
student financial aid programs. These deserve serious consultation 
with the governors and persons knowledgeable about higher 
education and finance. Today, one out of two college students in 
America has a federal grant or loan, and helping needy students 
attend college is a national function worth preserving. But these 
programs are poorly managed, needlessly costly, and full of 
middlemen, each of which takes its cut. In the near term, we 
recommend transferring the main student aid programs to a federal 
agency with greater competence in handling complex financial 
transactions with millions of individuals (and in collecting what is 
owed the government). An obvious candidate is the Treasury 
Department, with its Internal Revenue Service. Over the longer 
term, additional student aid strategies should be fully explored, 
including devolution to the states and privatization. <p>
 
* Special education and rehabilitation services also warrant 
consultation with the governors. This is by far the largest 
"unfunded" education mandate, i.e. federal regulations require the 
expenditure by states and localities of many billions more than the 
federal aid provided. It would, therefore, be reasonable to 
incorporate these programs into the main elementary/secondary 
block grant. Alternatively, they could become a smaller block grant 
of their own. (Total current value: approximately $5.7 billion.) Or 
these programs could be transferred to the Department of Health 
and Human Services. <p>


We want to be clear on this point: protection of the civil rights of 
disabled individuals would remain a federal responsibility, to be 
carried out by the Justice Department. <p>
 

<center><h3>Transfers </center></h3><p>
 
* All civil rights enforcement would move to the Justice 
Department, with the admonition that it be vigorously carried out 
when discrimination against individuals is involved, but not used as 
a tool for granting or withholding rights and benefits on the basis of 
group membership. <p>
 
The gathering, analysis and reporting of education statistics would 
be placed under the jurisdiction of the National Education Goals 
Panel, consisting of governors, legislators, members of Congress 
and senior officials of the executive branch. Assessment of student 
achievement at the international, national and state levels would 
become the unambiguous responsibility of a rehabilitated National 
Assessment Governing Board, overseen in turn by the Goals Panel. <p>
 
* As noted above, any student aid programs not devolved to the 
states would move to a fiscal agency such as the Treasury 
Department, while any special education and rehabilitation 
programs not turned over to the states would move to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. <p>
 
* Indian education programs would be transferred to the Interior 
Department. <p>
 
A small number of federal programs that assist specialized 
institutions (e.g. Gallaudet College, Howard University) and are 
now the responsibility of the Education Department deserve 
scrutiny to see whether the present subsidy arrangements should 
continue. Insofar as they do, any of a number of executive branch 
agencies can oversee future resource transfers. <p>
 
<center><h3>Abolition </center></h3><p>
 
The Education Department currently manages about 250 separate 
programs. Perhaps fifty of these have entirely outlived their 
usefulness, or support activities that the federal government could 
beneficially stop subsidizing, or provide marginal aid for activities 
that are fundamentally the responsibility of others but have been 
maintained as federal "categorical" programs due to the strength of 
special interest lobbies. Such programs should be abolished or "de-
funded" and the savings returned to federal taxpayers. (We estimate 
these at $2 to 3 billion annually, i.e. as much as $15 billion over five 
years.) We will not here provide a complete list, but illustrative 
examples include federal technical assistance centers of several 
kinds, regional "educational laboratories," library support programs, 
literacy programs for prisoners, women's educational equity, law 
school clinical experience, Olympic scholarships and "star schools." <p>


Savings would also result from dismantling the regulatory 
infrastructure, including most of the costs of Education Department 
management (about $444 million) and the National Education 
Standards and Improvement Council. <p>
 

<center><h3>Structural Implications </center></h3><p>
 
Inasmuch as adoption of our substantive recommendations would 
leave  The Department of Education with nothing to do, there 
would be no need to retain it. <p>
 
Although any "news" coming out of our testimony may be that 
"two former education secretaries urge abolition of department they 
once headed," let us be clear that we did not come before the 
Committee to recommend a label change or symbolic beheading. <p>
 
Today's Department of Education has two essential failings. First, it 
has come to contain bad ideas, harmful practices, needless 
expenditures, obsolete programs, dysfunctional regulations and the 
depredations of special interests that care more about the well-
being of education's "producers" than for its "consumers." <p>
 
Second, it has an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse to stick its 
nose into areas where it has no proper business. Most of what it 
does today is no legitimate affair of the federal government. The 
Education Department operates from the deeply erroneous belief 
that American parents, teachers, communities and states are too 
stupid to raise their own children, run their own schools and make 
their own decisions. <p> 
Abolishing the Department will accomplish little if its meddlesome 
ways are transferred intact to another federal bureaucracy. Indeed, 
such a shift could even be harmful to the extent that it serves to 
"hide" those activities in less visible locations. In our view, the way 
to think about the Education Department is first in terms of what it 
does, then in terms of its structure and status. <p>
 
Because we believe that each of the Department's activities that is 
worth preserving in some form could better be handled elsewhere, 
we see no need for a separate federal education agency of any kind. <p>
 
Our purpose is not to reduce the attention that the nation pays to 
education. Indeed, there's never been a time in our history when 
education was more important -- or more in need of a complete 
overhaul. Whether one is concerned with developing virtue in the 
young, preparing tomorrow's adults for life in the information age, 
widening the shared core knowledge base of a diverse population, 
strengthening our economic competitiveness or enabling poor 
people to move from the back of the line to the front, we have few 
assets of greater value than effective education. <p>


"National leadership" can be helpful in focusing people on problems 
and opportunities. We look to the President, with the help of an 
education advisor housed in the White House, to the National 
Education Goals Panel to ensure that the national project of 
educational renewal continues apace. But true leadership means 
energizing people and communities change, not shackling them with 
mandates and regulations -- and calling it leadership. We do not 
need a raft of federal programs. We do not need a giant 
bureaucracy. We do not need a federal department. What we need 
is a national movement. We are convinced that the-- prospects for 
such a movement -- and for real educational renewal in America -- 
will be far brighter when the Congress signals unmistakably and 
irrevocably that responsibility rests with teachers and parents, with 
communities and states, not with federal bureaucrats. <p>
 
Reversing the flow of this river is no small undertaking. But it 
would do immeasurable good for our children, our schools, our 
communities and our future. <p>

<TITLE> Candidates for Rescission in the FY 1995 Education Budget  -- Heritage </TITLE>

<P>
<H3> CANDIDATES FOR RESCISSION IN THE FY 1995              
            EDUCATION BUDGET

<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief #7<br>
          (published at 3 pages, February 24, 1995)
<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

 
     We are here today to determine ways to cut the 1995 education
budget. Let me say at the outset that, despite rhetoric to the contrary, only
a very small percentage of the over $31 billion the federal government
spends on education ever actually makes it into America's classrooms. Most
of the Department of Education's budget and programs go to fund technical
assistance, clearinghouses, information, and specific programs that educators
in our states and communities neither need nor want. I spend a good amount
of my time working with educators in these states and communities. When
asked what the federal government and the U.S. Congress can do to improve
their schools, they overwhelmingly reply, "Leave us alone!"
<P>
     Federal funding for education has tripled in constant dollars from
1965 to the present. Student performance, by contrast, has declined over the
same period. Clearly, additional federal spending on education is not the
answer. Yet, the Clinton Administration, in its 1995 budget, sought $26.1
billion in discretionary budget authority, a $1.7 billion increase over last
year. Similarly, the Administration sought $5.6 billion for mandatory
programs, an increase of $1.1 billion over the $4.5 billion spent in 1994.
They sought a total increase in budget authority from $28.8 billion to $31.7
billion, an increase of $2.8 billion or 9.9 percent.
<P>
     The appropriation for the Department of Education has more than
doubled in the last fourteen years from around $15 billion to over $31
billion. From 1981-1992, the amount the U.S. Congress appropriated for the
Department of Education was actually greater than the amounts that
Presidents Reagan and Bush requested in their budgets every single year.
Since President Clinton has taken office, the President's request for the
Department of Education has exceeded the appropriation. It is also
interesting to note that the amount spent by the Department of Education for
post-secondary education (programs that include student loans, Pell Grants,
research grants, etc.) was greater than the amount spent on elementary and
secondary education from 1981-1990. This was because the original role of
the federal government in education was to ensure access to post-secondary
education and to fund research programs. The Clinton Administration has
reversed this historical breakdown and now spends more on elementary and
secondary education than on post-secondary education. This is unfortunate
since a greater percentage of federal spending on post-secondary education
actually helps individual students gain access to education. By contrast, most
of the federal money spent on elementary and secondary education goes to
fund the education bureaucracies and comes with burdensome mandates to
the state and local education agencies. Students benefit only from a very
small percentage of federal government spending on elementary and
secondary education.
<P>
     The goal of the 104th Congress, both in rescissions for the 1995
budget and in authorizations for future years, must be to evaluate each and
every one of the over 240 Department of Education categorical programs
(up from 140 programs in 1980) and determine whether these programs
actually improve the education of our children. The Congress also must
consolidate effective programs, eliminate ineffective programs, and stop
funding programs that benefit bureaucracies. To meet these ends, Congress
should make the following specific reforms:
<P>
End Several Programs. The Clinton Administration proposed cutting 34
categorical programs from the Department of Education. The 103rd
Congress cut only 13 of the programs. The 104th Congress should start by
rescinding funding for the remaining programs, including: the Ellender
Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation), Education for Native Hawaiians,
Foreign Language Assistance, Consumer and Homemaking Education, State
Student Incentive Grants, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Leadership Program,
Cooperative Education, Assistance to Guam, College Housing and Academic
Facilities Loan Program, Public Library Construction, Library Literacy
Programs, Library Education and Training, Library Research and
Demonstrations, Foreign Periodicals Program, Impact Aid 3(b) Payments,
Educational Partnerships Program, Immigrant Education, Dropout Prevention
Demonstrations, Vocational Education Community Based Organizations, and
Civics Education.
<P>
Change Recently Enacted Programs. There were four major education
programs either created or reauthorized in 1993 and 1994. All of these
programs, including Goals 2000: Educate America Act, reauthorization of
federal elementary and secondary programs in the Improving America's
Schools Act, the Federal Direct Student Loan program, and the National
Service Trust Act of 1993 should be revisited.
<P>
Goals 2000: Educate America Act
President Clinton proposed spending $700 million in 1995 for Goals 2000,
an increase of $595 million over the 1994 level. He called for $1 billion a
year for this program, to continue indefinitely, beginning in fiscal year 1996.
Congress appropriated $403.4 million, up 298.4 percent from the $105
million appropriated in 1994. The Clinton Administration claims that states
must distribute 85 percent of their Goals 2000 grants to local educational
agencies which must then use the money to "create and implement content,
performance, and opportunity-to-learn standards in academic areas, improve
professional development and licensure, and improve curricula and teaching
practices in individual schools." Goals 2000 funds go to three new
educational bureaucracies: the National Education Goals Panel, the National
Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and a National
Skills Standards Board. None of these activities, despite rhetoric to the
contrary, will improve local schools. Many of these activities are merely
new mandates put on the states and localities. This ineffective program will
become much larger, more bureaucratic, and more expensive unless it is
downsized and eventually eliminated through the appropriations process.
<P>
Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act
 <P>    There are many areas in which funding can be cut and rescinded in
this expansive program. President Clinton requested $10.281 billion in his
1995 budget, and Congress appropriated $9.94 billion, a $475 million
increase from 1994. Much of this money goes to fund bureaucracies and
should be cut, including: the Eisenhower Professional Development
Program, Arts in Education, Eisenhower Professional Development Federal
Activities, Women's Educational Equity Fund for Improvement of
Education, Indian Elementary and Secondary Education, and the Ready to
Learn Act, among others. Congress should also alter the expansive Title I
program, perhaps giving the money directly to poor parents in the form of
educational vouchers that they can then use at the school of their choice.
<P>
The Federal Direct Student Loan Program
<P>     This act has done nothing to reduce the complexity of administering
student loans, eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to
students and schools. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the Department of
Education has hired 600 new employees to administer the direct loan
programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when the phase-
in of the program is completed. Congress should cap this program, which
has gone from being an "experimental" program when passed to a
"transitional" program. All new funding for this program should be
rescinded.
<P>
 The National Service Trust Act of 1993<P>
This act created a new bureaucracy, the Corporation for National and
Community Service, and a new entitlement for middle-class students. In
1995, Congress appropriated $575 million for National Service activities,
included in eight programs. This is an increase of $205 million from the
1994 appropriation. These numbers do not include the $791.8 million
appropriated in 1995 for the five programs operating under the Corporation
for National and Community Service. This amount is an increase of $216.4
million from the $575.4 million appropriated in 1994. These funds should
either be eliminated through rescission or merged into means-tested work
study and Pell Grant programs.<P>
Eliminate Institutional Aid. There are currently seven programs, totaling
$229.7 million, that aid specific institutions. Congress increased the
authorization for these institutions by $16.7 million in 1995. These programs
should be eliminated. Similarly, Congress currently appropriates $193
million to Howard University for the endowment and research programs. No
other university in this country receives such a high level of federal support.
The appropriations for Howard should be rescinded and eliminated, and the
university should rely on private sector support as do all other major private
universities.
<P>
     It is impossible, given the time constraints, to go into all of the other
programs that should be merged, eliminated, or rescinded. However, the
104th Congress should consider merging the many higher education grant
and campus-based programs into one grant, one loan, and one work study
program. It should reevaluate many of the programs falling under the
category of "Educational Research and Improvement" since many of these
programs do little to help educate children. It should privatize the student
loan collection program; revisit, eliminate, and consolidate many Chapter 2
block grant programs; and review and cut many of the categorical programs.
The appropriations committees will ultimately make many of the decisions
on which programs to eliminate. This subcommittee has the power actually
to improve American public education by eliminating many of the programs
containing the mandates and regulations that have strangled innovation for
the past 15 years.

<h2>Education Reform: Putting Power in Parents</h2>
<i><b>A column by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin</i></b> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As parents and members of a community, one of the greatest  
responsibilities we have is to educate our children. <p>
As the proverb goes, "It takes an entire village to raise a child." And there  
is perhaps no greater duty for that "village" than to make sure its children  
gain the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed as adults and  
contribute to their community. <p>
Yet as parents and as a community, we have surprisingly little control 
over how our children are educated. Parents and communities are not 
given the tools or the authority they need to make sure their children are 
succeeding in the classroom. <p>
Currently the power and control over educating our children rests in  
Madison. We have an antiquated, centralized system of education where  
faceless bureaucrats decide how your child should be taught, then place a  
plethora of mandates on local school districts. These mandates tie the  
bands of parents and community leaders who want to have a real voice in  
the education of their children, and they stifle innovation and creativity in  
the classroom. <p> 
In short, the current education system trusts government more than it  
trusts parents and communities. <p> 
Somewhere along the way, government responsibility replaced parental  
responsibility. Somewhere along the way, the bureaucracy became more  
important than the children. Somewhere along the way, defending the  
status quo took precedence over pursuing innovation and improvement. <p> 
No more. The challenge now facing our state is to make the needed  
changes to our education system to put power back into the hands of  
parents, school boards, classroom  teachers and local taxpayers. <p> 
We need to put our trust back into the "village," empowering our parents  
and communities to decide what is best for our children's education.  
trusting parents -- what a radical idea. <p> 
If Thorpe is facing a problem with its schools, I trust that the people of  
Thorpe are best equipped to resolve that problem, not a group of  
bureaucrats in Madison. <p> 
When it comes to education, one size does not fit all. We must give local  
communities the flexibility to meet the unique needs of their children. <p> 
My budget provides an array of initiatives that will facilitate the shift in  
power over education from Madison to our local communities. This starts  
with building a new education structure for the state. The current  
bureaucracy is too mired in the past to change and too self-serving to  
seriously pursue a better way.  <p> 
The new Department of Education proposal in the budget will serve as a  
catalyst for change to a system that cares more about the future of our  
children than about the future of bureaucratic jobs -- a system that trusts  
parents, not government. <p> 
The Department of Education's role will be clear: serve the public. The  
department will help set educational standards for the state and make sure  
our children are meeting those standards (via testing, etc.), but otherwise  
it will step aside and give local communities the flexibility to teach their  
children as they see fit. <p> 
Parents, school boards, teachers, community leaders and local  
taxpayers will work together to chart the best course for their children to  
meet the state's educational standards. The Department of Education  
will serve as a resource center, there to help communities when asked. <p> 
The budget also includes unique programs that meet the same goal of  
giving more control over education to the local community. <p> 
The charter schools initiative gives every community in the state the  
ultimate in flexibility to design schools to meet their unique needs. This  
initiative allows -- and encourages - communities to be innovative and  
visionary in meeting its children's needs. <p>
The public school choice proposal would allow every parent the choice of  
which public school to send their child. If a parent is unhappy with their  
child's school, they would now have a choice. There's no doubt that this  
will help improve the overall quality of all our public schools. <p> 
For Milwaukee only, we would allow low-income parents to send their  
child to a private school if they so choose. With nearly half of the  
students in Milwaukee Public Schools failing to graduate we need to try  
radical ideas that empower parents, particularly poor, minority parents.  
Remember, we all pay the consequences when a young man or woman  
fails to graduate and subsequently falls into a life of government  
dependence. <p> 
This budget is dedicatcd to the pursuit of excellence in education. making  
sure our children can compete -- and win -- in the global marketplace. <p> 
We need to restore some common sense to our education system, and that  
begins with returning power to parents and communities. <p>
When Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Howard Fuller resigned  
recently, he recited the words of William Daggett, who I believe puts our  
education priorities in the proper perspective.  <p> 
Daggett said, "We must love our children's hopes, dreams and prayers  
more than we love the institutional heritage of the school system." <p> 
In short, we need to return power to the village so its people can  
properly raise our children. We need to trust parents and communities,  
not government. <p>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
&quot;The enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and
the School-to-Work Opportunities Act signaled the beginning of
a new era in education reform that <I>will over time touch all
schools</I>.&quot;
<UL><I>--Department of Education Justifications of Appropriation Estimates
to the Congress Fiscal Year 1996 Volume I</I></UL>
<P>
America 2000, President Bush's educational reform plan, was the
predecessor of Goals 2000.  &quot;It was a self-proclaimed conservative
Republican... who was advocating <I>a monumental movement away
from local control of education</I>.&quot;    
<UL><I>--John F. Jennings, Institute for Educational Leadership</I></UL>
<P>
&quot;When the legislative dust settles and future historians
examine the Clinton Administration, they will devote a major chapter
to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.... Like President Lincoln's
Morrill Act of 1862 and President Johnson's Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, President Bill Clinton's Goals 2000 Act
will stand as an education beacon.&quot;

<title>Heritage Lecture: Getting Gov't Out of Higher Education -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><b>Heritage Lecture No. 533

<h3>Getting Government Out of Higher Education</h3>
<p>
By Jon Westling
Provost and President-elect, Boston University, delivered May 3, 1995
<p>

One of the pleasures of visiting Washington is the sense of reassurance which gleams from the limestone and marble buildings, the Capitol dome, and the sober monuments. Those of us who live and work far outside the Beltway sometimes need that reassurance, which is a little like the need parents feel when leaving a son or daughter in the safekeeping of a university. After eighteen years of the hard and loving work of raising a child, parents rightly expect a college to be vigilant, caring, and prudent. Nonetheless, as the station wagon pulls away from the curb in front of the dormitory, many a parent suppresses a shudder at what may actually lie ahead.<p>
That feeling is particularly familiar to me because less than a week ago, Boston University submitted an important set of forms to the Department of Education:  our application for continued certification to participate in "Title IV Student Financial Aid Programs."  Except in certain government agencies, of course, eight or nine pounds of paperwork is not the equivalent of a child, but I do feel a certain parental responsibility to this certification homunculus. Boston University labored over it for fourteen weeks and spent about 2,700 hours of employee time feeding it data. We stayed up nights when it had the colic, and we even changed it frequently, as we found that the bureaucrats at DOE who devised the 26 separate schedules hadn't bothered to consult over definitions such as what constitutes an "academic program." <p>

 Anyway, we have now entrusted our little bundle to the DOE and, like the parents in the station wagon, are putting a brave face on our fears. We have confidence that those DOE people are scrupulous and that it was somehow our own fault that it took 2,700 hours --       almost 1 1/2 man-years -- to complete the form, since those scrupulous DOE folk say right on page three of the instructions, "the estimated time to complete the application is three hours." <p>

 The instructions also say, "Most institutions will have the information required for the  application readily available."  This, I admit, is a little more worrisome. I grant that my experience as a university administrator is limited entirely to twenty years at Boston University, so it may be that other colleges and universities routinely permute data on admissions and financial aid according to six or seven disparate formulas. We don't, but Boston University will be able to catch up now that DOE has shown us this remarkable productivity-enhancing tool. <p>

Filling in this application helped Boston University accomplish one of the goals of education:  It made us a little more self-aware. We now know, for example, that of the 35,979 students who enrolled in at least one Boston University course in 1994, precisely ten did not possess a high school diploma. Thanks to the DOE, our cup runneth over with such factoids -- although, I admit, we are not entirely sure what most of them have to do with our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. One would think DOE would observe that our default rate on guaranteed student loans is 4.7 percent, which is 21.3 percent below the so-called "cohort-default rate threshold," and that would be that. <p>

The United States is, by any account, the world's leader in higher education. It has achieved that status by building in the last two hundred years a tremendously diverse array of independent colleges and universities which grew up with distinct educational philosophies and missions. Many were begun by religious denominations, others by self-educated visionaries, some by businessmen and entrepreneurs concerned with the need for educated workers. Typically, they adopted the form that Thomas Jefferson gave to the University of Virginia:  They were governed by boards of trustees charged with making sure the institution lived up to its educational mission. <p>

A lot has changed, little of it for the better. Higher education today is beset with self-inflicted problems. The wrenching of curricula to fit the bizarre doctrines of multiculturalism has left a dislocated and miseducated generation of college graduates. At all-too-many     supposedly elite campuses, students imbibe the theory of writing but can't write beyond a junior high school level. At more than a few universities, we have the shameful spectacle of students -- and faculty members -- shouting down speakers whose views they find exceptionable. Faculty unions, tenured layabouts, charging grant overhead for floral arrangements -- the sweet whiff of corruption -- all these derelictions of responsibility are now well-known, especially to this audience. Tempting as it is, however, I have not come here today to bury these faults deeper in obloquy. <p>

For, in addition to the self-inflicted wounds, higher education bears some other bruises. I draw your attention to the Good Samaritan who thrashes us with a club each time one of us staggers to his feet. I refer, of course, to the federal government and its handy cudgel, the Department of Education. <p>

The DOE no doubt means well. Congress has asked it to fix the problem of soaring default rates in the federally insured student loan program. The problem itself is not intractable, but the combination of experts and tools and instructions which Congress and DOE have assembled is cause for some apprehension. Imagine balancing your checkbook with the aid of three economists, a socket wrench, a can of spray paint, and a copy of Black's Law Dictionary, and you will have some sense of the situation. I'll come to the details in a minute. If matters proceed in this fashion, we still will not have a balanced checkbook, but government bureaucrats will be in charge of virtually every detail of what colleges and universities do. <p>

In speaking of threats, I do not mean to sound like the moping owl in the ivy-mantled tower who "does to the moon complain."  Along with the threats, there are some great opportunities, and this is an occasion to point those out too. If we can pull back from the brink, we will find that American higher education still has tremendous potential to contribute to the vigor, the intellectual and spiritual richness, and the prosperity of American life. <p>

But the brink is real. American higher education is on the verge of losing its most precious asset. It is abandoning or being forced to abandon its robust independence, and it will fade into something worse than mediocrity if the government's regulatory assault is not stopped. <p>

Before describing that regulatory rampage, I should say a word or two about my perspective. "Never confess, never, never confess," says Joseph Conrad's deeply observant man of the sea, Marlowe. I will nonetheless divulge that I was a civil rights protester in the early 1960s. I retain a strong conviction that society can change for the better and that government has an important part to play in that process. I agree with Edmund Burke that, "A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation," and that to criticize is one thing, but "at once to preserve and to reform is quite another." <p>

Until the 1960s, the federal government intruded very little into university management. The GI Bill and the research funding that followed World War Two were accompanied by surprisingly little red tape. Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, however, changed this. By     establishing numerous programs designed to expand access to higher education, the federal government became enmeshed in the attempt to re-shape higher education. <p>

Many of these programs had broad bipartisan and public support. At first, the reams of new government regulations seemed a harmless enough price for programs that promised to benefit everyone, including colleges and universities. Few had the foresight to see that, over the next thirty years, Congress would transform programs meant to open doors to educational opportunities into welfare systems. <p>

Federally insured student loans, for example, were designed with the help of conservative legislators as a means of providing greater access to higher education with a minimum of government involvement. Initially, they expanded opportunity on an equal basis, assisting anyone who met the usual criteria for getting into college. Over these thirty years, however, they have been increasingly used by the government as a low-visibility way to  subsidize selected institutions. <p>

The program began with default rates comparable to those accepted by commercial    lenders. In 1972, the government lifted the ceiling beyond what any commercial lender would tolerate -- and, finding it was good, lifted it again in 1976, in 1978, and in 1983. It is now 25 percent for most institutions and more for "historically black colleges and universities [and] tribally-controlled community colleges."  The average default rate at proprietary schools is over 30 percent. <p>

At the same time, the government began lowering the minimum academic standards   necessary to qualify for loans. Today, neither a high school diploma nor equivalency exam is required for taking out a federally guaranteed loan for what is called "post-secondary" education. Finally, the default rates have soared partly because the government is unwilling to require "disadvantaged" members of society to pay back the loans. <p>

In short, today's student loan crisis is largely the result of permitted defaults by unqualified students who borrowed money to attend vocational schools which provided inadequate education and few job prospects. <p>

Neither universities nor private lenders would have, on their own, permitted the student loan crisis. The key ingredient was Congress, which insisted that the real decisions about who would receive the student loans would be made by the federal government. This is one instance of how the federal government's attempts to direct higher education have gone awry. I do not have time to present anything like a systematic account of the destruction Congress has wrought in this area in the last three decades, but I will try to give you a Cook's tour of the most monumental follies. Our first stop has been the Great Converge,  formerly known as the Great Divide. Rivers once flowed east and west from this point. Institutions, ideas, and people went their separate ways. But Congress, through some elegant diversions, has now ensured that everything flows to Washington. <p>

I should also like to suggest some ways in which these monuments to folly can be replaced with the verdant fields and pleasant vistas of good sense. In the case of federally insured student loan programs, good sense points in one clear direction. The programs should again be made commercially viable. The exemptions for those institutions which are allowed to exceed the 25 percent default rate should be abolished, and the tolerated default rate should be lowered to a commercially acceptable level. No student who is not a high school graduate or who has not passed a high school equivalency examination should be  considered qualified for federally insured student loans. <p>

New educational institutions or ones which have exceeded the default rate threshold should be required to put up an insurance bond to protect against future loan defaults. I would add to this that tuition refund regulations should be clearly defined; the current state of confusing formulae leads to abuse. <p>

We should take a close look at the patterns of abuse and respond accordingly. Physicians, for example, are close to the top in the rankings of those who default on student loans. This could be corrected almost overnight by barring Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to doctors who default on their student loans and who fail to make amends within one year. That principle can be extended. Loan recipients who default and fail to make amends within one year should be barred from receiving any federal funds or contracts. <p>

These initiatives will return student loan programs to what was originally intended:  expanded educational opportunity at modest cost. In 1970, the taxpayer's bill for guaranteed student loans was $2.3 million on a volume of $770 million. In 1993, the bill had grown to $5 billion on a volume of $18 billion. Adjusted to 1993 dollars, the cost to taxpayers per  dollar loaned has risen from about .28 cents in 1970 to 28 cents in 1993. That is a 9,900 percent increase. <p>

If we knew then what we know now, or if the clock could be turned back thirty years,  perhaps we would not choose to go down the road of federally insured student loans. In that case, there would be far fewer colleges and universities, and there would be far fewer students at those which remained. But this is like wishing for a United States with an agrarian economy. We can't undo the past. This society has made a commitment to mass higher education. The attempt to reel in the percentage of the young who attend college to a European or Japanese level is not politically feasible, even in the unlikely event that we   decided it would be a good idea. <p>

Besides, as we have seen, there are simple ways in which the federally insured student loan crisis can be -- and should have been -- solved. Unfortunately, Congress and the Department of Education had an entirely different idea. They responded by adding yet more bureaucratic regulation and by making the programs even less commercially viable. The most intrusive part of this misguided response involves university and college accreditation. <p>


I approach this topic with a little trepidation. H.L. Mencken once called the Bible Belt "the Sahara of the Beaux Arts."  Accreditation is something like the Death Valley of the life of the mind. It is a dusty plain, leagues below the sea level of normal human cogitation, inhabited by scorpions and sidewinders. I could tell tales of college administrators stranded in this desperate landscape and languishing after mirage oases labeled "the assessment movement" and "teaching portfolios."  But that's for another time. What I am concerned with now is the invasion of the dirt-bikers. <p>

Accreditation at its best puts quacks out of business, but it is more typically a technique used by professional interests to feather their own nests. The most egregious example is the American Bar Association, which has a stranglehold on American legal education. Many of the ABA accreditation rules have only gossamer connections to the quality of legal education, but all of them have a laser-like focus on the perquisites of being a law professor -- down to specifying the number of square feet in each faculty member's office. You can get a fair picture of the world of specialized accreditation by imagining 250 or so would-be ABAs, each carping for a finer grade of ivory in its part of the tower. <p>

When all is said and done, however, we university administrators have a certain grudging respect for the specialized accreditors. Some know their business, and at worst they are driven by old-fashioned greed. In any case, specialized accreditors do not come close to the other great branch of academic accreditation, the regional accreditation agencies, for exemplifying lassitude, incompetence, and day-to-day bewilderment, combined with a solemn sense of rectitude and, of course, a desire to augment their authority. I realize that that description could apply rather well to several government agencies, but the regional accreditation agencies are not -- or not quite -- part of government. They are part of that shadowy world of quasi-governmental agencies which enjoy governmental authority but are largely unaccountable. <p>

The six regional accreditation agencies, which accredit whole institutions rather than   specific programs, gain their prominence from the stipulation that only accredited colleges and universities can participate in federal financial aid programs, including the Title IV    student loan programs. <p>

In 1992, when Congress recognized that default rates had gotten out of hand, it observed, correctly, that some of the worst offenders were schools that it had exempted from the   loan-default rate ceilings, along with a small number of proprietary schools. You and I could probably think of several solutions to this problem. I've sketched some of those earlier. But it's unlikely that in our most demented fantasies we would come up with the particular answer that Congress wrote into the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992. Instead of merely shutting off the spigot to the offending institutions, Congress decided to turn the      regional accreditation agencies into an enforcement wing of the Department of Education. <p>

Instead of isolating problem institutions and kicking them out of the program, it told accreditation agencies that they would be responsible for fixing the problem, on pain of losing their ability to operate. This brings us to our current pass, in which the Department of Education and several of the accreditation agencies, operating under the curious but imposing title "The National Policy Board," have developed a proposal to nationalize accreditation. <p>

The arid landscape of accreditation is now roaring with joy-riding regulators, the dirt-bikers of Death Valley. Again, the solution is common sense. Congress must intervene to keep government from taking over accreditation. The linkage between accreditation and the    Department of Education must be broken, and the government-mandated monopoly of    accreditation agencies should be abolished. <p>

I can think of several very concrete things Congress could do to bring some sanity back to this process. First, Congress should change the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992 to eliminate the requirement that higher education accrediting agencies themselves be accredited. This requirement is at the bottom of DOE's attempt to take over accreditation and of the National Policy Board's attempt to nationalize the system. <p>

Accreditation agencies should be, in effect, accredited by their customers. If they have anything worthwhile to offer colleges and universities, colleges and universities will pay them for it. Generally, colleges and universities will pay to be reviewed by the agency which has the strictest standards that the institution thinks it can pass. A free market in accreditation agencies will quickly stratify, with the toughest agencies attracting the best colleges and universities. The public will benefit from a genuine ranking system. <p>

Congress should eliminate the link between accreditation and eligibility for federal funds, including federally guaranteed student loans (Title IV). Accreditation should be about the quality of academic programs, not about the rate at which students default on government-backed loans. <p>

Congress should also stipulate that the Department of Education has no role to play in   accrediting institutions of higher education. The DOE has made clear that it is not a good judge on issues of academic quality, and the prospect of its telling others how to promote academic quality is grimly amusing. <p>

Let us leave Death Valley. I have a great deal of hope that the current Congress will undo the mischief of years past, but it is a vast and bleak landscape, and relief is long overdue. The next stop on this tour is the Old Growth Forest, a place of deep calm, even torpor, where the government has decided there will be no harvesting of even the most mature trees. The Old Growth Forest lies in pleasant Tenure County. The deep calm exists because those who live there know that no matter how feeble their performance, how desultory their efforts to keep up with the times, and how pressing the need to start new seedlings, Congress has determined they can stay put so long as they can breathe. <p>

As of January 1994, universities and colleges are no longer permitted to have a mandatory retirement age for faculty. This intrusion into the terms of faculty employment nominally makes professors like workers in any other sector of the economy. But in reality, it does nothing of the kind, because no other part of the economy is encumbered with the tenure system. This law has effectively given tenured faculty a lifetime appointment. <p>

The problem clearly has two sides. Universities and colleges should be seeking ways to  reform or abolish tenure. The traditional legs on which tenure stands are economic security and academic freedom. Economic security is a fine thing, but in universities it should never trump competence. And the major threats to academic freedom today come not from a repressive society but from repressive ideologies espoused mostly by those who live under the cover of tenure. Boston University successfully abolished tenure in its Medical and  Dental Schools in 1973, and we have been making some inroads in other areas since, most recently by offering some faculty members long-term contracts instead of tenure. It is,   however, a hard nut to crack. A single institution has to have powerful attractions to recruit individuals who have the possibility of guaranteed lifetime employment at a competing institution. <p>

By outlawing mandatory retirement for faculty, the government is making the effort to eliminate tenure even more difficult, and it is -- inadvertently -- closing opportunities for many other people. The life of most senior faculty members is generally not so strenuous. Many faculty members are willing to keep going in the absence of a stick or a carrot that gives them some incentive to stop. The result is that there is less turnover and fewer positions for faculty members who are attempting to establish their careers. <p>

 The Old Growth Forest is getting older. Congress must repeal the law which prohibits universities and colleges from setting mandatory retirement ages for faculty. <p>

The enxt stop on our tour is the High Plateau, the setting for a wonderful new institution, Learning Disabled University. LDU got its start from laws designed to prohibit discrimination against the handicapped. The Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are being used -- perhaps contrary to legislative intention, but nonetheless -- to force colleges and universities to lower academic standards. <p>

Children are now reaching college having been swaddled for years in the comforting illusions of learning disabled theory. Enormous numbers of students in grade school and high school have been diagnosed "learning disabled."  In Massachusetts, almost one in five      students is crammed into this category. The national average is twelve percent. Are we in the midst of a silent genetic catastrophe? <p>

LDU is trying to keep LD philosophy students safe from the perplexities of Aristotle, to accommodate foreign language majors who have foreign language phobia, and to comfort physics students who suffer from dyscalculia, which is, of course, the particular learning   disablement that prevents one from learning math. <p>

I do not wish to imply that Boston University has escaped all the moonbeams illuminating campuses coast to coast. A month or so ago, I discovered that our Office of Disability Services had, without permission, begun issuing exemptions from the language and math  requirements on precisely the bases I described. I put a stop to it, and now I await as intrepidly as a brewer of hot coffee the lawsuits that are sure to follow. I think, for example, of the suit against Tufts University, filed by a student who claimed that Tufts was required  under the ADA to accommodate her psychological disability, which consisted of an aversion to taking tests. <p>

Nor do I wish to mislead you by suggesting that Learning Disabled University is entirely the province of students and their LD counselors. I think, for example, of the former philosophy professor that Boston University fired after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting another faculty member and of forcing his attentions on three undergraduate students. He responded with the novel defense that his lecherous behavior was the result of a disability:  namely, inhibitions chronically lowered by his ingestion of prescription drugs. He is now   suing Boston University, claiming that his behavior was protected by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. I wish I were making this up, but I'm not. <p>

The disability laws are sacred cows, but they must at the very least be tethered so that they cannot be used to force universities to lower academic and other standards. <p>

My tour of follies in higher education has concentrated on sites that have benefited, so to speak, from Congress's helping hand. The Great Converge of student loan programs, the Death Valley of accreditation, the Old Growth Forest of mandatory retirement, and the High Plateau, home to Learning Disabled University, could not have become what they are without the wise counsel of Congresses past. <p>

I am conscious that in this speech I have been finding a great deal of fault with existing  arrangements. Burke, whom I referred to before, also observed that "those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are unqualified for the work of reformation.... By hating vices too much, they come to love men too little."  In fact, I do not think I am    habitually employed in finding fault; this is a rather special occasion. <p>

Also, by concentrating on the evils brought on higher education by the government, I do not mean to suggest that only government can solve the problems it has created. Boston University, for example, has a number of initiatives which show how universities can help get government off the back of higher education. <p>

We have sought to lessen our dependence on federal research funding through Boston University's Community Technology Foundation, a venture capital fund established to develop the commercial potential of the work of our own researchers. We have invested about $60 million in Seragen, Inc., a start-up biotechnology company based on a breakthrough by a researcher in our Medical School. Seragen is currently in Stage III Clinical   Trials for a promising treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. <p>

Disregarding Conrad's advice yet again, I must also note that Boston University has received several large federal grants -- earmarked funds, if you will -- which paid part of the costs of very expensive science and engineering facilities on our campus. The Heritage Foundation is a place where one does not expect such a statement to be met with resounding applause, but I mention it for good reason. Our nation's universities are one of its major sources of commercially developable ideas and patents. The nation as a whole stands to gain a great deal economically and in other ways by treating some universities, in some respects, like venture capital firms. The public should invest in those who have the energy, the  know-how, and the overall promise to deliver -- and then wait and see. Government micromanagement of research grants is wasteful. Perhaps paradoxically, and certainly contrary to the assumptions of many, pork barrel projects often give the public its best return. <p>

That's my apostasy for the day. Boston University has taken some other steps that I am more confident you will agree are in the right direction. We have shown it isn't necessary to take a laissez-faire attitude toward drugs, toward uncivilized behavior in the dorms, and     toward bully-boy political behavior on the streets in order to attract students. <p>

We have shown that it is still possible to have a university that isn't kidding when it says that its principal mission is the pursuit of truth. <p>

I observed at the outset that leaving a child at college for the first time leaves a parent with some anxiety. I rather facetiously compared that to the anxiety a university administrator feels entrusting to the DOE the mounds of make-work the federal government now demands of us. There is, however, a more serious side to this anxiety. Most children learn to live responsibly with the freedom of campus life as a prelude to the responsibilities of full adulthood. With some trepidation, parents grant their children the independence to live up to the challenges. <p>

We'd like a government that has at least that much faith in its citizens. American higher education is one of this country's most outstanding accomplishments. A federal government that is prudently supportive is all we need. Most things we can do better on our own. <p>

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Crime:</B></FONT><P>
Aside from a handful of federal responsibilities, most criminal justice issues are a local matter and the Congress in Washington should let state and local governments deal with them.  If the Congress wants to do more about crime, it should lift the federal tax burden on the states and let them raise money for law enforcement and prisons.  I'm in favor of truth-in-sentencing, but I think John Engler, Tommy Thompson, Bill Weld, and the other governors can run their own prison systems.  If Members of Congress want to set the length of state prison sentences, they ought to resign and run for state legislator.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Drug Legalization:</B></FONT><P>
The last thing we should do is make drugs legal.  That would only make them more available, dramatically increase the number of babies born having been exposed to drugs when their mothers were pregnant, increase the number of children and coworkers who use drugs, and make it almost impossible for addicts to quit.  We made great strides in the late 1980s in reducing drug use and we should keep at it.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  America 2000 v. Goals 2000:</B></FONT><P>
We need to send education back to states, communities and families -- where it belongs.  That was the idea behind America 2000.  The Clinton Administration's Goals 2000 goes in exactly the opposite direction.  They've turned a national movement into a federal program.<P> 
	* America 2000 was all about encouraging high standards in the core academic subjects.  Goals 2000 is about how much is spent on education.<P> 
	* America 2000 was about making schools more accountable for their performance.  Goals 2000 makes it harder to know how well schools are doing.<P>
	* America 2000 sought to give all families more choices of all schools.  Goals 2000 creates more obstacles for choice.<P>
<HR WIDTH=30%> 
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  The Federal Role:</B></FONT><P>
Abolish the Department of Education in order to liberate parents and schools.  On January 26, I testified before the U.S. Congress and argued that it should take each activity currently housed in the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) send it home to states and communities; (b) entrust it to another federal agency; or (c) terminate it and return the money to the taxpayers.  I've been looking at this issue for more than 15 years and I am convinced that the people in a position to know what is best for education are those closest to the child.  Education policy should be geared toward giving parents and teachers more control over what goes on in the classroom.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Gun Control:</B></FONT><P>
I have never thought gun control equalled crime control.  If we are really interested in controlling crimes involving guns, we should have stricter penalties against those who commit the crimes.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Health Care Reform:</B></FONT><P>
Our health care system is still in need of repair.  When President Clinton tried to fix it last year, he went in exactly the wrong direction:  a "one size fits all" plan, run by Washington, D.C., full of new rules, mandates, and penalties.  We shouldn't repeat his mistakes.  We need to involve all 50 governors to help advance some important reforms state-by-state.  A few basic insurance reforms would make health insurance more flexible and easier to keep when we change jobs or move.  We should also amend the tax code so that individuals who buy health insurance get the same break that companies and their employees now receive.  It is also time we started looking at medical IRAs, the most direct way of giving individuals control over their own health care costs.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>History Curriculum Standards Sponsored by the Administration:</B></FONT><P>
They are not standards Lynne Cheney and I had in mind when we encouraged school boards to adopt voluntary educational standards. The history panel ended up presenting a warped view of our nation's past.  President Clinton should condemn these standards and make sure they are not promulgated or endorsed by the federal government.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Medicaid:</B></FONT><P>
We would save money -- and deliver better medical care to the poor -- if we capped the growth of spending but gave governors the power to run Medicaid as they see fit.
<BR>
<BR>
The best way to reform Medicaid is the welfare "swap."  President Reagan tried a version of this in the early 1980s. The first step is to give the states complete responsibility  for welfare in exchange for the federal government picking up a comparable portion of state Medicaid expenditures.  The second step is to delegate responsibility for administering the program back to the states without the mandates from Washington.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>School Prayer:</B></FONT><P>
I signed a bill permitting a moment of silence in schools in 1981 and I would sign one again today.  We should remember that on the first day of the very first session of Congress, the House and the Senate adopted the Bill of Rights.  On the second day, they adopted a national day of prayer called "Thanksgiving."
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Welfare:</B></FONT><P>
Instead of fixing welfare in Washington for the sixth time, we should end welfare reform in Washington. Let's end welfare as a federal program and send responsibility for it back to the states, communities, and private agencies.  States are way ahead of Washington on this one.  Michigan requires all welfare recipients to get a job, go to school, or do volunteer community service.  Wisconsin says two years and you're out.  Massachusetts says 60 days.  California docks welfare checks when kids don't go to school.  New Jersey doesn't pay more to mothers on welfare who have more children.  I would add:  no marriage penalty, no added benefits for children born to unmarried mothers on welfare, a certain end to payments to able-bodied adults after a set time, jail time for deadbeat dads, no payment to anyone who commits a crime while on welfare, reduction of welfare for parents whose children quit school, privatize job finding programs.

 CLINTONITES MISS THE MOON</H2>

<P>
<I> Gary L. Bauer</I></CENTER>
<P>
When Americans look back on the twentieth century, they may well
view the landing on the moon as <I>the</I> most significant event
of our time.  So said historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. 
<P>
Not if they are taught U.S. history according to the National
History Standards.  That's because, incredibly, the team that
labored for two years and spent $2 million in federal grants to
come up with &quot;world class&quot; standards completely missed
the moon.  They include references to &quot;Soviet advances in
space&quot; and to the <I>Challenger</I> disaster, but neglect
to mention that the United States won the space race.
<P>
Hardly an American has been unaffected by the U.S. landing on
the moon.  Thousands of us are alive today because of advances
in medical technology that are a &quot;spinoff&quot; of the space
program.  The computer revolution and the development of worldwide
communications networks are a direct result of the massive U.S.
drive to reach the moon.  Schlesinger is clearly right to signal
its importance.  And it is ironic that the national history standards,
rightly assailed by conservatives as &quot;politically correct,&quot;
should have effaced the memory of Jack Kennedy's most enduring
accomplishment.
<P>
It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the failure.  For the
Department of Education, this embarrassing public fiasco is indisputable
evidence of bureaucratic ineptitude.  If we adopt these amnesiac
history standards, we will succumb to a kind of national identity
crisis.  We will cease to remember who we are and why it matters
that there is an America.
<P>
This gaffe is almost unbelievable.  I say <I>almost</I> because
as Undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Education under President
Reagan, I gained an appreciation for how bureaucracies work. 
And I learned why we can never have national standards in education
determined by political bodies.  However well intended, the Goals
2000 legislation, which drives national standards, is deeply flawed.
 The attempt to have government determine &quot;official knowledge&quot;
in this country cannot help but become a political football. 
What George Will has called a &quot;cranky anti-Americanism&quot;
has come to dominate too many professional historians' worldview.
 That's why their depiction of America's &quot;war of vengeance&quot;
against Japan forced the Smithsonian's <I>Enola Gay</I> exhibit
to be cancelled. 

<P>
The Clinton administration's national history standards project
did not just miss the moon.  Major U.S. advances in medicine have
been lost as well, such as the development of anesthesia, the
conquest of Yellow Fever, and the discovery of the polio vaccine.
 Similarly, there is an anti-free enterprise bias to the history
standards.  Students are encouraged to put John D. Rockefeller
on trial for his sharp business tactics.  But where do the standards
lead young Americans to an understanding of the most productive
and free economic system in history?  Nowhere.
<P>
Defenders of the history standards complain that the criticisms
are all coming from conservatives, from the angry white male caucus.
 Well, the history standards' dismissal of Paul Revere and Robert
E. Lee, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein would appear to fit
this category.  But how can these apologists explain the omission
of leading black Americans like Thurgood Marshall, Gen. Colin
Powell, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins and
the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy?  And how to explain the cultural
importance the history standards give to &quot;Madonna&quot; and
Roseanne, while pushing Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson off
the bus?  Further, how do historians who gave us six references
to the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights explain their
failure to include Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and Ambassador Claire
Booth Luce?  These influential women were Republican leaders and
early advocates of the E.R.A. Was their adherence to the E.R.A.
<I>and </I>the GOP offensive to the panel?  Whatever became of
the big tent?  
<P>
It goes without saying that the history standards' emphasis on
race, gender, and class forces young Americans to accept a secular
world view.  But for millions of us, our religous ties are more
important than ethnicity, gender and geography.  The history standards
panel clearly failed to comprehend the influence of religion in
American life.  How else to explain the fact that they consistently
employ the term &quot;fundamentalists,&quot; a term generally
viewed as pejorative.  Some 30 million Evangelicals, recognized
even by <I>TIME </I>and <I>Newsweek</I>, receive no mention. 
Some groups seem more equal than others.  Catholic Americans will
find it odd that their children will learn of Mother Jones, but
never hear about Mother Seton.  Father Coughlin gets in, but Bishop
Fulton J. Sheen is an &quot;unperson.&quot;  Jewish Americans
will find a similar skittishness about recognizing the accomplishments
of Jews as Jews.  Interestingly, too, for a document that emphasizes
group experience and all claims of victimhood, the national history
standards are strangely silent about America's role in four Arab-Israeli
wars.  
<P>
Tocqueville recognized that centralization of administration was
always the enemy of excellence because it enervates local initiative.
 Not only will national standards in education, bureaucratically
derived and politically driven, fail to overcome a rising tide
of mediocrity, they will become a part of it.  As President Kennedy
often said: &quot;We can do better.&quot;

<title>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</title>

<h2>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Education recently launched a series of
events to encourage greater family and community involvement in
learning.  While it is surely odd for an Administration that opposes
parental choice in education to lead such an effort, this public
relations blitz -- or at least the research that undergirds it
-- truly deserves wide attention.
<p>
Families exert far more influence over their children's intellectual
development than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three
decades of research shows that families have greater influence
over a child's academic performance than any other factor -- including
schools.
<p>
In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James Coleman
led a major research study which found a &quot;powerful relation
of the child's own family background characteristics to his achievement,
a relation stronger than that of any school factors.&quot;  Coleman's
research spawned a number of studies replicating his work and
building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed Coleman's
chief finding that families exert considerable influence over
student achievement.
<p>
What is especially important about this body of research is that
it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really matters.
 That is, differences in student learning are not determined simply
by the quality of one's gene pool or by which side of the tracks
one lives on.  Instead, differences stem significantly from the
values, habits, and relational dynamics at work within the household.
<p>
Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might consider
this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies have found
the frequency of family meals together to be a strong predictor
of student test scores.  In explaining this high positive correlation,
 Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent mealtimes
give parents regular opportunities to ask questions about what
kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give 
parents regular opportunities to broaden children's educational
horizons.  For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public
affairs is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime
discussions his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.
<p>
Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a profound effect on children's learning, especially when these
materials are used in direct parent-child interaction.  For example,
a 1985 report from the National Academy of Education found that
the single most important activity for building the knowledge
required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children.
 Moreover, a 1992 study at the City University of New York found
that average IQ scores of low-income preschoolers are boosted
by nearly seven percentage points for each day of the week that
their mother reads to them.
<p>
The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also be seen
in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time day
care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in language
development.  What is the primary reason for the difference? Young
children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.
<p>
Given the extraordinary influence families have over their children's
learning, it is curious that almost all public discussion about
improving education in this country centers around school-based
reforms of one kind or another.  While no one would deny many
school-based reforms are needed, Seattle public schoolteacher
David Guterson believes the promise of such reforms is often overblown.
 &quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools and
ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed to
fail,&quot; Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that schools
will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;  
<p>
Only families can.  Only families will.
<p>
Unless and until our education debate begins to focus on the family,
significantly improving student performance in America is likely
to remain an elusive goal.

<title>Time To Permit Oil Drilling In the Arctic Refuge</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TIME TO PERMIT OIL DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC REFUGE</i></h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 432<br>
October 17, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska is the subject of heated debate as some Members of Congress, led by Senators Frank Murkowski (R-AK) and Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Representative Don Young (R-AK), attempt to open a small fraction of the area to oil exploration and production. A provision included in the budget reconciliation would open the Coastal Plain area of ANWR. This effort is a sensible approach that could dramatically expand much-needed domestic oil production with negligible impact on the environment.
<p>
	ANWR is an enormous area of land located in the Northeast corner of Alaska within the Arctic Circle. Contrary to the image evoked by opponents of oil production, that ANWR is the last small pristine area left in Alaska, the state has an abundance of hardy ecosystems. In addition to the healthy ecosystems existing on millions of acres of private and state land, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 set aside 100 million acres of land as parks, refuges, and preserves, including 57 million acres of wilderness. ANWR itself covers 19.8 million acres. While eight million acres of ANWR were set aside as wilderness, 1.5 million acres were designated for review by the Department of Interior (DOI) to recommend future management of high potential oil resources. In 1987, DOI recommended that this 1.5 million acres, known as the Coastal Plain, be leased for oil and gas exploration and production in an environmentally sensitive manner.
<p>
	The provision in the budget reconciliation bill would implement DOI's recommendation. But only a tiny fraction -- far less than one percent -- of the Coastal Plain area would be affected. Advancing technology over the last 20 years has reduced the necessary size or "footprint" of drilling operations to less than one-fifth of what was required, say, at Prudhoe Bay. So exploration and production would affect only about 2,000 acres. To put this in perspective, that is an area about one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C., and about 0.01 percent of the total area of ANWR. Even in this very limited area, modern sophisticated operations adopt many environmentally sensitive methods which further limit any ecological impact.
<p>
	Expanded oil production is badly needed. The United States currently imports more than half its oil consumption, and reliance on foreign oil is growing. That raises national security concerns and is an unwelcome factor in foreign policy considerations. This reliance caused a $51 billion oil trade deficit last year -- roughly equivalent to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Foreign energy dependence would be eased considerably if the Coastal Plain produced oil. The area potentially could produce 1.5 million barrels of oil per day for at least a quarter of a century, thereby increasing domestic production by almost 25 percent. Allowing limited drilling in ANWR also would reduce the trade deficit by about $14 billion per year. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal revenues from lease sales would be $1.3 billion over the next seven years, helping to trim the budget deficit.
<p>
	Alaska's residents would be big beneficiaries of lease sales. Alaska has agreed to split the estimated $2.6 billion revenue from lease sales evenly with the federal government (rather than take the 90 percent to which the state otherwise would be entitled), so the state still will receive $1.3 billion. This partially explains why three-quarters of Alaskans support the plan.
<p>
	Not only will Alaskans and the federal treasury benefit from increased oil production, but an estimated 222,000-732,000 jobs will be created throughout the country. There will be new hires in the oil industry and manufacturers, suppliers, and transporters of oil-related equipment will increase hiring dramatically, with fully 98 percent of these jobs in the lower 48 states. Based on a mid-range estimate of job creation, this one action would drop the unemployment rate by 0.36 percentage points.1
<p>
	The only potentially legitimate objection to opening the Coastal Plain of ANWR to oil drilling would be on environmental grounds. But these concerns are without merit because of the very limited impact of modern drilling and production techniques. Even the "pro-environment" native Inupiat Eskimos, who live in or near the Coastal Plain and opposed oil drilling in Prudhoe Bay 60 miles away, support onshore oil development in the area. As Inupiat Mayor George Ahmagak of the North Slope Borough wrote last June, "Our whalers and hunters make maximum use of our few resources, always taking care not to harm the land so their grandchildren may in turn carry on their culture.... As Mayor, I can state unequivocally that the people of the North Slope Borough enthusiastically support the presence of the oil industry in our land.... The wisdom of our Elders teaches us the value of hunting where game is most plentiful. Likewise, it makes sense for our nation to seek oil in an area that even [DOI] has identified as the country's best prospect for new petroleum deposits."2
<p>
	Exploration is opposed by the Gwich'in Indians, who live 120 miles south and have strong ties to the environmental lobby. They are concerned about protecting their hunt of 300-350 animals from the 152,000 porcupine caribou. While the herd size has fallen from its high of 180,000 a few years ago, oil drilling is unlikely to have any negative impact. One reason for this confidence is that the Central Arctic caribou herd living in the Prudhoe Bay area already has increased its population over sevenfold since oil production began 20 years ago, despite dire warnings at the time that the herd would decline sharply if oil drilling was permitted. In fact, the second-largest oil field in the U.S. is the favorite place for caribou to give birth. 
<p>
	 The facts are clear. Permitting oil production in ANWR would spur economic growth, cut the trade deficit, and ease national security concerns. Moreover, it poses virtually no threat to the environment. It is time for Congress to give the green light to limited exploration and production.

INTRODUCTION

<P>   After eighteen high-level hearings, and a review of 29,000 pages
of written material and hundreds of proposals, the Energy Department
earlier this year released its National Energy Strategy. Known as the
NES, this is a wide-ranging list of particular recommendations for
every type of energy and just about every energy issue.
<P>   The report comes at a time of much confusion about America's
energy situation and the policies that will best guarantee America's
energy security. For example, figures recently released by the Energy
Department show the country's oil imports dropping by around 1 million
barrels per day or 12 percent of the country's total use. While some
observers might thus assume that there is no energy problem, in the
long term America's energy needs will increase. More energy will have
to be produced domestically or imported from overseas. In addition,
Congress is considering a higher gas tax. Such a tax would increase
costs for consumers and businesses, reducing American competitiveness
and lowering American living standards. At the levels of taxes being
discussed, perhaps ten cents per gallon, oil consumption would not be
significantly reduced. A tax of, say, 50 cents per gallon would reduce
consumption dramatically -- by bringing the American economy to a
halt. This is hardly a result acceptable to most policy makers.

<P> Sound Recommendations. On the whole, the report is well balanced
and its recommendations sound. Its major dual message is the need to
reduce or eliminate government regulations that discourage energy
production and the need to free entrepreneurs to meet America's energy
needs. 

<P> As important as what the NES does, however, is what the NES does
not do. In particular, it avoids many of the disastrous errors of the
1970s, when the federal government believed that it could control
America's energy supply and demand. The results of this are well
known: soaring energy prices, block-long gas lines, and uncertainty
about America's energy and economic future. To be sure, there are
shortcomings. The NES does tend to call for government research in
energy areas that might best be left to the private sector. And in
some cases the report could be more emphatic about the need for market
reforms. But if policy makers do follow the NES roadmap, in general
they will be taking America down the path to energy security.

<P> Among NES topics and recommendations:

<P> Energy Production and Efficiency. To promote both production and
efficiency, the NES suggests more deregulation of local electrical
monopolies, strict market pricing for electricity, and federal
government purchases of natural gas vehicles.

<P> Domestic Oil. To increase the domestic oil supply, the NES
recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer
Continental Shelf to oil exploration.

<P> Western Hemisphere Energy Security. To reduce America's reliance
on oil from the politically unstable Middle East without raising costs
to consumers, the NES emphasizes negotiating freer energy trade and
investment in the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Natural Gas. To make maximum use of this clean energy source,
found in abundance in America, the NES suggests, among other things,
deregulating pipeline construction and pricing and removing
restrictions on imports and exports of natural gas.

<P> Domestic Coal. To make better use of this resource, also found
in abundance in America, the NES recommends a consistent and
predictable, rather than arbitrary, application of environmental laws,
using coal slurry pipelines and preventing the Environmental
Protection Agency from mandating specific technology and production
methods for coal plants.

<P> Nuclear Energy. The NES points out that this is a safe, non-
polluting energy source, and suggests research to develop better
designs for nuclear plants, to reform licensing procedures, and to
increase the potential sites for nuclear waste disposal.

<P> Renewable Energy and Electricity. The NES recommends removing
licensing restrictions on hydroelectric plants and continuing research
into nuclear fusion.
<P> A major NES failing is the scant attention that it gives some
key issues. For one thing, tax policy needs an overhaul. While the NES
suggests modest changes in the tax code, what is needed is a
restoration of all those tax code pressures dealing with the energy
industry that Congress has eliminated since 1969.

<P> For another thing, the NES should be more emphatic about
developing a Western Hemisphere common market for energy to diversify
supplies and reduce dependence on the Middle East. 

<P> These deficiencies, however, are dwarfed by the achievement of
the NES in presenting, for the first time, a comprehensive review of
America's energy situation and in offering many market-oriented
proposals for America's future energy security. 

<P> The NES already is prompting action on Capitol Hill. On June 4
the Senate Energy Committee approved S.1220, the National Energy
Security Act, co-sponsored by Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana
Democrat, and Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican. Essentially
similar to the Bush Administration's NES, the bill faces an uncertain
fate. Many amendments could be added to it that would make America
less energy secure. The House of Representatives is working on its own
version of a comprehensive energy bill. 

<P> The Free Market Acts. When Saddam Hussein overran Kuwait about a
year ago, crude oil prices shot to record levels. Some lawmakers urged
a return to the interventionist energy policies of the 1970s. The Bush
Administration wisely resisted this. Although the Iraqi crisis reduced
world crude oil production by 4.1 million barrels per day, roughly the
same as the 1973 Arab oil boycott and 1979 Iranian oil embargo, thanks
to the Bush Administration's response, the results were entirely
different. In both 1973 and 1979, emergency government controls
greatly aggravated the effects of the disruption. In 1990, the
Administration allowed the market to operate freely. As a result, the
oil price rise was brief, peaking last October. By this February oil
prices fell to below prewar levels. There were no 1970s-style gas
lines.

<P> History demonstrates that the best government role in the energy
sector is to assure that markets operate without hindrance. Markets,
as even East European leaders now recognize, are the most efficient
means of allocating resources. Yet federal government restrictions
continue to impede the market's function in energy. Removing these
obstacles deserves a high priority if America is to achieve energy
security. 
<P>
AMERICA'S ENERGY SITUATION

<P> The United States is a country rich in energy. Domestic coal,
natural gas, and oil are pillars of America's energy base. Still,
current patterns of production and consumption will have to change in
the future as known resources are exhausted. 

<P> Fossil fuels account for 89.2 percent of all energy used in the
U.S. Oil is America's most important energy source. Last year, oil
accounted for some 40 percent of American energy use. Next came
natural gas, accounting for 24 percent of consumption, followed by
coal at 23.3 percent. Nuclear energy contributed 7 percent of
America's needs, with the rest coming from hydroelectric dams, and
alternative energy sources. 

<P> Even these figures, though, understate the importance of oil.
Some 97 percent of all transportation energy comes from petroleum.
While alternative fuels have made modest inroads in the transportation
market, it will be a decade or more before they can offset oil
consumption significantly.

<P> This May, Americans used an average of 15,844,000 barrels per
day (b/d) of oil, roughly one million less than in 1990. During this
period, America's oil imports fell by 7.2 percent, from 8,649,000 b/d
to 8,027,000 b/d. Still, America relies on foreign oil for more than
half of its needs. More disturbing, America's oil production fell from
around nine million b/d in 1985 to roughly 7.3 million b/d in 1990, a
decline of almost 19 percent. 

<P> Though the Persian Gulf crisis spurred higher American oil
output, the boost was small and as it turns out, temporary. Of more
fundamental importance is the fact that America's "proved reserves" --
essentially the oil that America has on the shelf -- have declined by
over 27 percent since the 1973 Arab oil embargo.

<P> That America imports great quantities of oil is not, in itself,
a problem. The real concern is whether the level of imports leaves
America vulnerable to severe economic dislocation should foreign oil
supplies suddenly be disrupted. This was the case in the 1970s, when
two sudden and sharp price hikes rocked the American economy. When all
factors are taken into account, the combined effects of the 1973 Arab
oil embargo, and 1979 Iranian oil boycott cost America an astounding
$1.5 trillion between 1974 and 1984. 

<P> And the 1970s oil shocks occurred when U.S. oil imports were far
lower than they are today. America now imports over half its oil
compared with 34.8 percent in 1973. Some 27 percent of imports, or
11.8 percent of American consumption, comes from the Persian Gulf,
primarily from Saudi Arabia. The price hike that followed the invasion
of Kuwait cost American consumers nearly $39 billion in higher oil
prices. 

<P> To hedge against abrupt interruptions of oil supplies from
abroad, the U.S. government maintains 587.5 million barrels of crude
oil stored in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). If all imports
from all sources were cut off, the SPR would last about 75 days at
current rates of consumption. Not much more oil could be obtained at
short notice from American sources. The Energy Department estimates
that even under the most favorable circumstances domestic oil
production in the past year could have been increased by only about
100,000 b/d -- and this would have taken about a year. 

<P> Thus security of supply is a fundamental consideration in
American energy policy. This is recognized by NES. Its recommendations
aim at a secure energy future achieved through market-based actions
that improve efficiency, enhance security of supply, assure a clean
environment, and fortify the foundations of America's energy economy. 
<P>
INCREASING ENERGY AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY

<P> The NES devotes 42 of its 189 pages to energy conservation,
attained by boosting energy efficiency. While it is true that the
document does not call for the sorts of mandates, regulations, and
subsidies that were in favor during the 1970s, the dismal failure of
those measures readily justifies their absence. Instead, the NES makes
concrete suggestions for energy efficiency improvements for
electricity generation, residential and commercial buildings use,
industrial use, and transportation.
<P>
** Electricity

<P> Most electricity is generated by utility companies, which are
local monopolies closely regulated by state and federal authorities.
This system stifles competition and is inefficient. The NES addresses
these shortcomings by seeking increased competition within the
electricity market. To do this, the NES proposes amending the 56-year-
old Public Utility Holding Company Act to permit utilities to build,
own, and operate power plants outside their traditional service area.
The NES also would eliminate size restrictions on so-called
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) -- firms that are not part of a
public utility, but that build and operate plants that sell
electricity to utilities. Current size restrictions prevent IPPs from
competing with traditional utilities for the construction of new
generating capacity. 

<P> The NES also supports efforts by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to allow IPPs to use existing electricity
transmission lines owned by local electric utility monopolies.
Currently, local monopolies need not permit IPPs access to such lines.
To expand operations, IPPs must have access to transmission
facilities.

<P> The NES also recommends eliminating subsidies to the federal
Power Marketing Authorities -- or PMAs. Established in 1906 to
distribute the electricity generated by federal water projects, the
PMAs sell power to their customers at prices below market cost; the
taxpayer absorbs the difference. To date, PMAs have cost the Treasury
$4 billion. As a result, PMA customers predictably waste "inexpensive"
electricity. Phasing out the huge subsidies to PMAs would encourage
conservation and promote general economic efficiency, ending the waste
of taxpayer dollars. 
<P>
** Commercial and Residential Energy Efficiency

<P> Residential use accounts for around 20 percent of American
energy consumption. Each year, 90 million American households spend
around $100 billion for heating, lighting, cooking, and other uses.
Commercial buildings account for about 15 percent of total energy
consumption, and about $70 billion in annual outlays.

<P> Residential use of energy dropped by about one-third between
1962 and 1986 because of efficiency improvements in appliances, and
investments by homeowners in energy-saving measures. Yet the use of
the various kinds of fuel consumed to generate power for homeowners
increased as they shifted away from oil and coal for space heating and
water heating. The fastest growing end users of primary energy,
meanwhile, are commercial buildings, as a result of the spread of air-
conditioning and the proliferation of computers, copiers, printers,
and other office equipment.

<P> A main obstacle identified by the NES to improving residential
and commercial energy efficiency are government regulations that
prevent energy prices from reflecting fully the real costs of
generating the energy. Another obstacle is that government-owned
housing is insulated from market forces and public housing authorities
feel no competitive need to increase energy efficiency. 

<P> NES recommendations for commercial and residential energy mainly
aim to spur research and development and education. The NES recognizes
that conservation must be market-driven. One flaw in the NES
recommendation, however, is the call for government efficiency
standards for residences and commercial buildings. Mandating
efficiency in buildings was attempted in the 1970s without success. 
<P>
** Industrial Energy Efficiency

<P> The industrial sector accounts for about one-quarter of American
energy consumption. Industrial energy conservation as a response to
market forces is one of the great success stories of the American
energy economy. Between 1973 and 1989, the value of goods and services
produced in America rose by 50 percent in real terms; the amount of
energy required to produce these actually fell by 6 percent. Private
industry reflexively responded to high energy prices by conserving
energy. 

<P> The NES's primary recommendation to improve industrial energy
efficiency is additional funding for research and development to help
firms find new ways to use waste as a fuel. Yet industries already
spend an estimated $46 billion annually for pollution control. Thus
industry already has a strong financial incentive to find ways to use
waste as a fuel. This is because the process of using waste products
to generate energy consumes many pollutants. NES also recommends
increased use of energy audits by industry. Such audits permit firms
to identify areas in which they can reduce energy consumption and thus
save money with existing technologies. The federal Department of
Energy's help in this is particularly important for small - and
medium-sized firms, which often lack the technical capability to
perform such audits themselves. 
<P>
** Transportation Energy Use

<P> The greatest opportunity for improving American energy
efficiency is in transportation. Last year Americans spent $200
billion on transportation fuels, accounting for two-thirds of
petroleum use and one-fourth of total energy consumption. Since 1976,
the amount of oil consumed by transportation has exceeded American
domestic production. Petroleum use for transportation is expected to
continue growing, rising to more than 42 percent of total energy use
by 2010, and to 66 percent by 2030.

<P> For transportation, the most important NES recommendation
encourages the use of alternative fuels. In principle this is sound.
Yet the NES shies away from evaluating specific alternative fuels. The
only exception is the NES recommendation to extend an already existing
tax credit to oil companies for using ethanol. Because of this tax
break, "gasohol," a blend of 10 percent ethanol/90 percent gasoline,
accounts for about 10 percent of the gasoline supply. This means that
ethanol is replacing about 1 percent of the gasoline, a very tiny
amount. The NES should have evaluated the merits of alternative fuels.
Had it done so, it probably would have concluded that natural gas is
the most promising alternative.
<P>
FLEET CONVERSION TO NATURAL GAS

<P> For America, natural gas is a good substitute for gasoline for
transportation. First, America has an abundance of natural gas. Were
it used in place of oil in all domestic fleet vehicles, current levels
of consumption could be maintained for more than a half-century.
Second, natural gas is clean burning and, as a gasoline substitute,
would reduce air pollution. 

<P> Natural gas would be best suited as a gasoline substitute in
fleet vehicles operated by a single owner such as a taxi company, a
delivery service, or a local government. Although comprising 6.5
percent of the total vehicle population, fleet vehicles consume
approximately 10 percent of all motor fuel. The $2,000 to $3,000 cost
for converting an engine to burn natural gas is currently a deterrent
to fleet use of this fuel. Were there greater demand, however,
vehicles could be equipped at the factory to use natural gas. This
would cut costs from 50 percent to 70 percent. Chrysler Corporation
and General Motors plan to establish experimental production lines for
alternative fueled cars and trucks. United Parcel Service and other
firms are converting part of their fleets. Local governments too may
want to buy natural gas vehicles to help meet air quality regulations.
Even at the current prices, the cost of converting fleets to natural
gas, the amount can be recovered in slightly over three years thanks
to lower fuel and operating costs. 

<P> Fueling Federal Fleets. The NES wisely calls for more public
education on the benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. Better still
is the NES suggestion that the federal government buy natural gas
vehicles for its fleets. The federal government owns more than 200,000
motor vehicles, and in fiscal 1990 alone purchased 49,188 civilian
vehicles. Federal purchases of natural gas vehicles would create
enough demand to justify the mass production lines that significantly
reduce costs. 

<P> This April 17, George Bush issued an Executive Order requiring
federal agencies to purchase as many alternative-fuel vehicles as
possible, and to compute cost/benefit ratios for the purchases on a
"lifecycle costing" basis. This means that the total cost of owning
and operating the vehicle over its useful life, rather than just its
purchase price, will be how a vehicle's cost is reckoned.

<P> Local governments, meanwhile, also could spur use of natural gas
by permitting gas utilities to supply natural gas for the vehicle fuel
market. Such sales would be part of what is termed a utility's "non-
core" business, which is not regulated because it is not part of a
utility's local monopoly. Allowing utilities to sell natural gas for
vehicles would introduce new competition and reduce fuel costs. 

<P> Increased demand for natural gas as a fuel for vehicles will cut
the prices of all aspects of this market. Example: It now costs from
$2,500 to $3,500 to buy a home compressor which can be attached to a
residential natural gas line to fuel a natural gas vehicle. If mass-
produced, the price could drop to under $1,000. A gas utility could
install such a unit and recover its cost over, say, five years through
fuel sales. As the number of natural gas vehicles increased, utilities
could also install natural gas compressors at gasoline filling
stations. Several already exist in the Washington, D.C., area. To do
this, however, utilities must be allowed to sell natural gas fuel as a
non-core business.
<P>
DOMESTIC OIL SECURITY

<P> The principal problems addressed by the NES are the potential
dangers to America's energy supplies. Oil is the most important
component of the U.S. energy mix, accounting for 42 percent of all
energy consumed and more than 97 percent of all transportation fuel.
Last year Americans consumed an average of 17 million b/d. U.S.
domestic production, however, has been falling, from just under 9
million b/d in 1985 to 7.3 million b/d in 1990. This is roughly 19
percent in domestic oil production. As a result, last year Americans
paid some $55 billion for net oil imports. This figure could rise to
$200 billion by 2010 according to Energy Department statistics. In the
first half of the year oil imports actually fell by one million b/d,
or about 12 percent of the total from the previous year. But this was
due to factors other than a change in America's long-term energy
production and consumption trends. First, due to uncertainty over the
situation in the Persian Gulf, American oil companies drew on their
own stored supplies and therefore required less imports. And second,
the recession dampened oil consumption, thereby reducing some of the
need for imported and domestically produced oil. The NES recommends
reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil "shocks" by encouraging increased
domestic oil production.
<P>
** The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

<P> The NES recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
(ANWR) to oil exploration. Originally established in 1980 under
Section 1002 of the Alaskan National Interest Lands Conservation Act,
ANWR covers 19 million acres of Alaska's northernmost territory. About
8 percent of this area holds high promise for petroleum exploration.
According to the Energy Department, it may contain more oil than
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest North American oil field discovered
to date. 

<P> Opponents of exploration in ANWR claim that development would
harm wildlife. Yet more than a decade of experience at Prudhoe Bay,
which steadily produces an average of 1.8 million b/d of oil,
demonstrates that oil can be extracted in the Arctic without damaging
the environment. The 1990 Exxon Valdez spill occurred because of
deficiencies in the transportation system, not in drilling. 

<P> Oil output from production in Prudhoe Bay soon will begin
declining. Unless ANWR is developed, output from Alaska will steadily
fall. With ANWR, however, Alaska could keep pumping around 1.8 million
b/d or even more. The NES conservatively estimates ANWR's potential
output at 870,000 b/d by the year 2005. Oil from ANWR also would
extend the life of the Prudhoe Bay field. This is because without
ANWR, the volume of oil from Prudhoe Bay eventually will fall below
the level required to operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
<P>
** The Outer Continental Shelf

<P> The NES also recommends expanded drilling for new oil on the
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), a portion of the Continental Plate
extending underneath the ocean's surface. The OCS is believed to
contain 7.5 billion barrels of oil and 9.4 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas; this would be 26 percent of America's undiscovered oil
and natural resources.    The Reagan Administration proposed orderly
development of OCS oil and gas resources in a way that would protect
the environment. This was blocked by a series of lawsuits and
congressional actions. Development of the OCS was further delayed when
the Bush Administration halted leasing in several OCS areas including
the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, the North Atlantic
coast, and a portion of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. This leaves only
portions of the Gulf of Mexico and Mid and South Atlantic available
for development. The freeze on new leases apparently remains in force
for most of these areas until 1996, ostensibly to allow environmental
and economic studies. Some OCS areas off California, however, will not
be available for leasing until the year 2000. 

<P> Environmental concerns obviously are important. But so is
American energy security. The two do not exclude each other.
Technological advances in recent years have reduced significantly the
chances of spills from offshore drilling. In fact, there have been no
major spills at U.S. offshore facilities since 1969 when a well off
the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out, fouling miles of
beach. Safety measures developed as a result of this spill make a re-
occurrence unlikely. Today, indeed, there is far less environmental
risk from drilling offshore wells and transporting oil to shore by
pipeline than there is from transporting oil from other nations by
tankers. 

<P> The NES recommends that those areas in which leasing has been
halted be considered for inclusion in a five-year leasing plan being
drafted by the Department of the Interior. The NES also suggests that
Congress ban none of the new areas under consideration for the five-
year leasing plan until a study is completed that weighs resource
potential and environmental effects of energy development.
<P>
** The Tax Problem

<P> For more than two decades, unfavorable tax treatment of the oil
industry has contributed significantly to the decline of American
domestic oil production. Addressing this, the NES recommends some tax
code changes. These would give somewhat more favorable tax treatment
to so-called "marginal oil production." This is the output from wells
that are nearly exhausted. The NES also calls for better tax treatment
for "unconventional" natural gas production, such as that from coal
seams. 

<P> In its proposed tax changes, the NES stops far short of what is
needed to remove the tax code's penalties on domestic oil production.
The oil industry is treated more harshly by the tax code than any
other sector of the economy. Since 1969, for example, most oil
producers have lost what is knowm as "the depletion allowance." This
is the accounting mechanism that recognizes that as oil is extracted
from the ground, the oil company's capital is depleted -- just as a
manufacturing firm's capital would be depleted as machinery
deteriorated. The depletion allowance for mineral development is the
equivalent of depreciation for a manufacturing business. It is an
allowance that is used as a deduction from taxable income. Loss of the
depletion allowance of course drives up the cost of oil production in
America.

<P> Also driving up the cost is the 1976 law, enacted by Congress
and approved by Gerald Ford, that imposes a minimum tax on what it
called "intangible drilling costs." These typically are the costs of
building roads to oil well sites, of the "muds" used to lubricate the
rotating shaft of an oil rig, and of the energy used to operate the
rig. Such costs from 1976 to last year were taxed at 10 percent of
their value. Last year's tax hike package boosted this tax to 24
percent. The tiny tax credit given to the oil industry last year
offers little real relief. Why drilling costs themselves should be
taxed is, of course, the question. In every other industry these would
be treated as normal business expenses to be deducted from revenues.
Yet for oil drillers they are effectively treated as income.

<P> Further adding to the burden on the oil industry is the 1980
special tax on oil companies to finance the Superfund, the federal
program to clean hazardous waste sites. Other taxes harm the oil
industry as well. Taxes on refined petroleum products were increased
several times for such diverse reasons as to fund mass transit and
help reduce the deficit. These taxes are imposed specifically on the
oil industry; other industries do not pay them.    A 1987 Energy
Department report on energy security concludes that American oil
production would be increased were the full depletion allowance
restored. The report also calls for a 5 percent tax credit for oil
exploration and development costs and for the removal of tax penalties
on the industry. Taken together, these changes would add 1,233,000 b/d
to domestic production within a decade. While the 1987 report also
found that these changes would reduce Treasury revenues by $7.622
billion over roughly the same period, it failed to take into account
the new revenues that would be received by the Treasury from wages
paid to workers employed to develop the new oil, and from royalties on
oil and gas produced on federal lands. With these new revenues, the
Treasury would collect an extra $40 billion over the decade.
<P>
WESTERN HEMISPHERIC ENERGY SECURITY

<P> The NES strongly supports developing non-Persian Gulf oil
supplies. The NES specifically targets Eastern Europe and the Western
Hemisphere for development. The NES also urges a review of U.S. laws
to ensure they do not discourage energy development. If production
outside the Persian Gulf is not encouraged, 41 percent of world oil
supplies will come from that region by the year 2010. Known oil
reserves outside the Persian Gulf total about 337 billion barrels;
this is about half the 654 billion barrel reserve in the Persian Gulf.

<P> The greatest opportunity for expanding secure production outside
the Persian Gulf is in the Western Hemisphere. The nations of North
and South America have proved oil reserves of over 156 billion barrels
and natural gas reserves of over 518 trillion cubic feet. The
hemisphere also has 30 percent of the world's coal reserves and 42
percent of its hydroelectric power capacity. 

<P> Latin American countries, of course, generally are more
politically stable and friendlier to the U.S. than are Middle Eastern
countries. 

<P> To increase use of the Western Hemisphere's energy resources,
energy trade should be allowed to flow freely across the borders of
all nations in the Americas through the creation of a common market
for energy. The Western Hemisphere readily could meet its own energy
needs, and even export energy. Latin America could produce as much as
3.5 million more b/d. 

<P> For Latin America, increased energy trade with the U.S. could
help reduce the enormous Latin American foreign debt. For the U.S.,
increased reliance on hemispheric energy sources would improve energy
security. To increase cooperation on energy trade within the
hemisphere, a number of steps must be taken. One of the most important
is the elimination of barriers to foreign investment common in Latin
America. 

<P> The U.S. and Canada made a good start towards a hemispheric
common market in energy with their 1988 Free Trade Area agreement. It
provides for unrestricted oil and electricity trade across borders.
Natural gas so far is not covered by the agreement, since it is highly
regulated in both countries. 

<P> A key element to an energy free trade area would be the
reduction and eventual elimination of laws, especially in Mexico and
the Latin American countries, that prohibit foreign investment in
resource development, or set confiscatory tax rates on profits from
such investments.
<P>
** The Venezuelan Example

<P> A promising development is the proposed Cristobal/Colon joint
venture in Venezuela. The project involves the export of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from Venezuela to the U.S. The partners include
Exxon Corporation, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mitsubishi Corporation,
and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan National
Oil Company. This is the first time in decades that Venezuela is
permitting foreign participation in an energy project. Venezuela is
expected soon to revise its tax laws to make the Cristobal/Colon
project economically viable. A successful Cristobal/Colon project
could serve as a model for cooperation throughout the Hemisphere. The
government of Argentina, meanwhile, is privatizing its oil industry,
one of the most inefficient in the Hemisphere. This should increase
production and foreign participation and give Argentina an incentive
to seek freer energy trade in the Hemisphere. Though Mexico still
resists privatizing its oil industry or allowing foreign companies to
own equity shares in the industry, this will be addressed in the
current U.S.-Mexico free trade area talks.
<P>
DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS

<P> Natural gas accounts for more than one-fifth of America's
primary energy, and is used to heat nearly half of all homes. The NES
cites natural gas as one of the most promising alternatives to oil,
suggesting that it could replace up to 600,000 b/d of oil use by 1995,
and 1.7 million b/d by 2000. 

<P> Natural gas when burned as fuel produces less air pollution than
oil or coal, and the technology to convert from oil to natural gas is
well established. Most important, America has natural gas in vast
quantities.

<P> Natural gas competes directly with oil in the industrial boiler
fuel market, with natural gas accounting for 37 percent and oil only
36 percent of all industrial energy used in 1989. Coal accounts for
most of the balance. Virtually all of the oil burned in industrial
boilers, or roughly 24.7 percent of total American oil consumption,
could be replaced by natural gas. Many boilers are designed to use
either fuel and can be switched back and forth in response to the
relative price of the two fuels. 
<P>
** Pipeline Construction Barriers

<P> The NES finds that statutory and regulatory impediments are
reducing American natural gas usage by 1 trillion cubic feet per year.
This amount could displace 470,000 b/d of oil. In some cases,
particularly in the Northeast, industrial boilers cannot use natural
gas because there are no pipelines to deliver it. Pipeline
construction often is stymied by a federal regulatory approval process
which can take five times as long as it does for the actual pipeline
to be built. 

<P> The cumbersome regulatory system was designed in the days when
some pipeline firms enjoyed near monopoly power in some regions.
Today, with over 1.3 million miles of pipeline and a choice of routes
available in most cases, monopoly no longer is a problem. Yet the
antiquated approval process remains, hurting rather than protecting
the consumer. Reducing regulations would speed pipeline construction,
significantly lower transportation costs, and make natural gas more
attractive as a fuel.

<P> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the body that
oversees approval of interstate natural gas pipelines and regulates
their rates, recognizes the problem and is trying to reform its
procedures administratively with the support of the Bush White House.
The NES endorses this and suggests clarifying confusing provisions of
the 1938 Natural Gas Policy Act. It recommends that pipeline companies
be allowed to proceed without federal certification if they forego the
right to exercise federal eminent domain in obtaining the private
property needed for the pipeline. Under current regulations, federal
certification of a pipeline entitles the pipeline company to invoke
eminent domain.
<P>
** Natural Gas Pipeline Pricing

<P> The price that natural gas pipelines charge for their services
has been regulated by Washington since the Natural Gas Act of 1938.
The NES calls for a reversal of this and for deregulation of pipeline
prices so long as pipeline customers have access to alternative
sources of energy supplies. Today, pipeline companies can refuse to
transport natural gas for producers not affiliated with them. But
because these companies usually enjoy a monopoly in their service
areas, such refusals restrict competition. Requiring pipeline
companies with local, government-supported monopolies to transport
natural gas for other companies would improve competition.

<P> The NES recommends reforming the pipeline rate structure to
encourage efficient use. Current rules often force pipeline owners to
charge higher prices for their services during periods of low use, to
cover the pipeline costs even though demand is low. Conversely, during
periods of peak use, pipeline owners are forced to underprice their
services to avoid making profits higher than those allowed by the
regulators. The NES suggests that FERC permit pipeline owners to sell
their excess capacity during periods of low use, and to buy additional
capacity from other pipelines during peak periods. This would help
even out the pipeline transportation load and increase efficiency. 
<P>
** Regulation of Gas Imports and Exports

<P> Natural gas imports and exports are regulated by the Department
of Energy. America last year imported about 8 percent of its natural
gas, primarily from Canada. By the year 2000, American natural gas
imports are expected to rise to around 12 percent of natural gas
consumption, and by 2010 to 14 percent. The U.S exports a small amount
of liquefied natural gas to Japan. Vast amounts of Alaskan natural gas
could be sold to Japan were it not for the federal limits on exports.
The NES recommends ending the Energy Department's authority over gas
import and export transactions. 

<P>
DOMESTIC COAL

<P> Coal is America's most abundant fuel, accounting for 90 percent
of American energy resources. Coal use has grown sharply in recent
years. In 1970, for example, the U.S. consumed 523.2 million tons of
coal, in 1980, 702.7 million tons, and in 1990, 894.6 million tons,
accounting for 23 percent of American energy needs. By 2010, American
coal use could rise to 1.6 billion tons. Coal also is a major export,
with more than 100 million tons sold last year. Increased use of coal,
however, could be hindered by the tightened environmental regulations
in the Clean Air Act of 1990. The NES cites the Energy Department's
Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program, initiated in 1986, as a way to
permit increased coal use and still protect the environment. To
accelerate the CCT program, the NES recommends reforming federal coal
leasing policies, reforming regulations concerning coal mining safety
and health, and encouraging greater use of coal slurry pipelines. 
<P>
** Promoting Coal Production

<P> The Clean Coal Technology Program aims at developing new
technologies to burn coal cleaner, with less pollution. For the CCT to
succeed, sufficient quantities of low-sulfur coal must be burned. Much
of this type of coal is on federal land. The NES recommends that the
Department of Interior's Federal Coal Leasing Program insure that
adequate low-sulfur coal areas are offered for lease. At the same
time, NES calls on the Bureau of Mines to continue research and
development on technologies to address environmental concerns about
underground coal mining. It also calls for continued tax credits for
extracting the marketable methane gas found in the underground coal
beds. 
<P>
** Regulatory Reform 

<P> The NES stresses the need to eliminate the uncertainty about the
kind of environmental regulations that are to be imposed under the
1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. This act has been
inconsistently applied. Reform is especially important to low-sulfur
coal production, most of which is extracted from surface mines.

<P> The NES also calls for performance-based standards for mine
safety and health regulations. Adopting performance-based standards,
where results, rather than specific federally-imposed methods, are
used to measure compliance, will permit a more rapid introduction of
technological improvements and improve worker safety.
<P>
** Coal Slurry Pipelines

<P> Coal slurry pipelines, in which pulverized coal mixed with water
is transported as a liquid, reduce coal transportation costs. Since
almost all prospective slurry pipeline routes will cross over or under
highways, rail lines, and other private property, slurry pipelines
require that government exercise the right of eminent domain to obtain
the right-of-way for the pipelines. This is done for right-of-way for
electric wires, roads, and rails. Because slurry pipelines use large
amounts of water, there has been great opposition to granting pipeline
builders eminent domain in Western states where water is scarce. Yet
large deposits of low-sulfur coal are in the West, and rail transport
of the coal to Eastern markets is much more costly than transport by
slurry pipelines. The NES correctly supports granting eminent domain
to slurry pipeline builders once all questions concerning water rights
and usage have been satisfied.
<P>
** Clean Air Act Amendments

<P> The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandates that annual emissions of
sulfur dioxide in the U.S. by the year 2000 will be at least 10
million tons below the 1980 level. The act further decrees that the
emissions level reached in the year 2000 will never be exceeded. The
act requires existing coal-burning electric utility plants to install
expensive devices to control emissions of nitrogen oxides. 

<P> These new requirements could seriously constrain American coal
use. While accepting the clean air goal set by the 1990 act, the NES
stresses that the goal can be met by accelerating the Clean Coal
Technology Program. This would be much less costly to the economy than
the devices called for by the Clean Air Act.
<P>
** The WEPCO Decision

<P> When the first Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, most existing
electrical generating plants were exempted from the new air quality
rules. At the time it was assumed that existing plants soon would be
replaced by new facilities that would be subject to the law. Yet, as
the expense and difficulties associated with building new electrical
generating plants increased, utilities typically decided to refurbish
existing plants rather than build new ones. In 1988, a decision by the
Environmental Protection Agency involving a plant refurbished by the
Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) held that when a utility
makes "non-routine" changes in the operation, repair, or maintenance
of a unit, the plant may become subject to air quality rules. This
meant that the utility was required to install specific pollution
control devices mandated by regulations.

<P> Skyrocketing Cost. The effect of this decision on the WEPCO
plant was enormous. The capital cost for refurbishment jumped from $80
million to $120 million. It became necessary to cut the plant's size
from 400 megawatts to 320 megawatts. As a result, the cost of re-
outfitting the WEPCO plant rose by 87.5 percent overall. Worse still,
the EPA indicated that it will determine what constitutes a "non-
routine" refurbishment case by case. As a result, utilities deciding
how to meet future power requirements must assume that any
refurbishment will fall under the WEPCO precedent. 

<P> The WEPCO decision illustrates the uncertainties that the
inconsistent and unpredictable application of regulations can
introduce into the market. The NES correctly suggests that the Energy
Department work with the EPA to identify the areas of regulation that
create planning uncertainties for electric utilities with older
plants, and strive to make the revisions necessary to clarify them. A
more basic question, however, as with the WEPCO decision, is whether
the EPA will continue to resist performance-based standards for public
utilities. Unlike the more traditional command and control "cookbook"
approach, such standards emphasize results. If EPA resists this
approach, the Administration should take direct action against EPA to
assure the adoption of such sound policy.
<P>
NUCLEAR POWER

<P> Although nuclear plants generate around 20 percent of American
electricity, for all practical purposes American nuclear energy
development is at a standstill. Because of public opposition and
excessive regulation, no new nuclear plants have been ordered in
America since 1978; only three remain scheduled for construction. More
than 100 orders have been cancelled or deferred. 

<P> Still, nuclear energy remains an attractive way to generate
electricity. It is clean and relatively safe. America has huge
deposits of uranium, the source of nuclear fuel. The NES estimates
that America will need from 190 gigawatts to 275 gigawatts of new
electrical generation capacity by the year 2010 (a gigawatt is one
billion watts). Currently it takes two coal-fired plants or one
nuclear plant to produce a gigawatt. Most of America's added energy
will be generated by large, centralized plants, known as "base load
generation." These are best suited to nuclear power.

<P> To give nuclear energy a new chance, the NES addresses several
important issues.
<P>
** Advanced Powerplant Designs

<P> The accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in
Pennsylvania in 1979 and at the Chernobyl facility in Ukraine in 1986
heightened public concern over plant safety. Since 1979, the
Department of Energy has been researching advanced light-water
reactors (ALWRs), which will be safer than current designs. By 1995,
the ALWR design should be complete and a prototype could be operating
by 2000. Other advanced designs are also being developed. Among the
most promising is the Modular High-Temperature Gas Reactor. With it,
if all external power systems were to fail, the reactor would simply
shut itself down. The NES endorses these research and development
efforts.
<P>
** Licensing Reform and Design Standardization

<P> Delays encountered in licensing nuclear power plants long have
been among the nuclear industry's greatest problems. The licensing
process in America can take up to fifteen years compared to less than
five years in Japan or France. Unlike other governments, Washington
reserves key licensing approvals until after a plant is built. As a
result, a utility can have a completed plant costing a billion dollars
sitting idle because of a regulatory delay.

<P> This process is complicated further by the tendency of electric
utilities to order unique designs for each plant. This subjects each
plant to its own exhaustive review process. In France and Japan, by
contrast, it has long been the practice to use standardized models for
nuclear plants. Besides reducing licensing delays, standardization is
believed to improve safety by reducing the number of new and untried
components. The NES agrees that power plant designs should be
standardized so that reviews need take place only once. 
<P>
** Managing High-Level Nuclear Waste

<P> Another major problem facing the nuclear industry is the growing
backlog of undisposed high-level nuclear waste, that is, highly
radioactive byproducts of nuclear power production that require
special disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 directs the
Department of Energy to establish a permanent repository for such
waste, and a monitored retrievable storage facility (MRS) to hold the
waste prior to permanent disposal. Yet just about all localities
strongly oppose being the site of these repositories. As with other
problems facing the nuclear industry, establishing these repositories
is as much a matter of public perception as of technology. Although
the NES suggests that Congress establish disposal sites, the political
battle surrounding such decisions will result in further delays.
<P>
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES

<P> Renewable energy sources are those that are not depleted. The
three principal renewable sources in America are hydroelectric power,
geothermal power, and ethanol, produced from corn, grains, and other
biological material. Solar power is a much less important renewable
source. In 1990, renewable energy supplied 8 percent of American
energy needs. Of this, about 47 percent came from hydroelectric dams.
Solar power of all types accounted for under 6 percent of all
renewable energy and less than one half of one percent of American
energy needs. Renewable energy sources other than hydroelectric power
or wood have grown in importance significantly since 1970, when they
were virtually nonexistent. The NES strongly endorses the use of
renewable energy, and calls for continued research and development in
this area. 
<P>
** Renewable Energy and Electricity

<P> The NES recommends removing from the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) restrictions on the size of renewable
energy plants. These restrictions are a holdover from the Carter
Administration's emphasis on so-called "soft-path" energy schemes,
which emphasized small-scale plants. These provisions made neither
economic nor technological sense.

<P> All hydro-electric plants are licensed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, and the licenses periodically must be renewed.
The licensing process has become extremely cumbersome. The NES
suggests exempting very small hydro projects from FERC regulation, and
streamlining the licensing process for all other plants.
<P>
** Ethanol

<P> In 1978, Congress allowed a five-cent per gallon exemption from
the federal gasoline tax for motor fuels blended with ethanol. And in
1980, the federal government granted a tax credit for refiners
producing gasoline blended with ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), an
ethanol-based gasoline additive. Because ethanol is more expensive
than gasoline, its advocates believe a tax credit is warranted to
allow ethanol to compete with gasoline. A look at the performance of
ethanol in the market, however, suggests that such a credit is not
needed. With around 10 percent of all gasoline being blended with
ethanol or ETBE the need for the subsidy has passed. Ethanol is well
established in the market and now competes with gasoline additives in
about the same price range, rather than with gasoline. Clean Air Act
of 1990 regulations effectively require many motorists in urban areas
to use gasoline with ethanol, ETBE, or some similar additive. The NES
thus errs in recommending that the ethanol tax credit continue.
Instead, the subsidies for ethanol and ETBE should be eliminated. 
<P>
** Fusion

<P> Fusion long has held out the promise of tapping a virtually
inexhaustible supply of energy without endangering the environment and
without producing hazardous wastes. The NES calls for continued
support of fusion energy research. This is wise, yet too much should
not be expected of fusion soon. Under the most optimistic assessments,
the first practical fusion energy plants will not be available until
the year 2035. 
<P>
IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

<P> The needs to make America more energy secure and to protect the
environment too often have been in conflict. Measures designed to
protect the environment often wasted energy or restricted the use of
such plentiful sources as coal. 

<P> The NES emphasizes the need to clarify uncertainties about some
environmental issues that have impeded energy development. Typical of
these issues are the claims about global climate change. NES stresses
that research on these issues is essential before imposing regulations
that could have disastrous economic consequences for American
industries. The NES does call for measures to reduce the emission of
"greenhouse gases," which may contribute to atmospheric warming, while
the global warming issue is being studied. But NES specifies that
these measures be limited to those justified for reasons other than
potential global climate change.

<P> The NES wisely rejects the notion of a so-called "carbon tax" to
discourage fossil fuel use. Some environmentalists call for a $135-
per-ton tax on the carbon content of fuels. This would damage the
American economy enormously. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P> In the past, talk in Washington of an "energy policy" has meant
cumbersome regulations, expensive new bureaucracies, and costly
"conservation" programs and gas lines. How much energy, if any, is
saved by these measures is debatable. What is not debatable is the
enormous economic pain inflicted on Americans. A sound energy policy
is not built on more regulations. A sound policy rather should remove
impediments to the energy market, eliminate barriers to energy
production, and facilitate innovation. This is what the National
Energy Strategy recommends. America's level of foreign oil imports is
too high -- not because oil imports are "bad" for America but because
dependence on oil from unfriendly and insecure parts of the world
carries the risk of future damaging economic shocks. 

<P> Removing Tax Bias. America can increase domestic energy
production and increase exploration to find new reserves if Congress
and the White house amend the tax code to remove the bias against
firms taking the risks necessary to find new energy supplies, if
Congress and the White House allow exploration in the most promising
areas for new oil discoveries, if Congress and the White House remove
the regulatory impediments now discouraging gas producers and
utilities from fostering greater use of natural gas, and if Congress
and the White House encourage conservation by permitting the market to
reflect the true cost of energy. 

<P> Americans, too, could move closer to secure foreign sources of
supply if the U.S. were to negotiate a common market for energy
throughout the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Core Strategy. Americans enjoy one of the world's highest
standards of living in large part because they have had ready access
to abundant, inexpensive sources of energy. Continued access to
abundant energy is essential to America's economic future, and history
teaches that the best way to achieve this access is to permit markets
to operate. Reliance on markets assures both abundant supplies and
judicious use. As such, above all else, the core of any national
energy strategy must be to permit markets to operate.

<title>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With a National Sales Tax</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<center>
<h3>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With A National Sales Tax</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
This proposal is aimed at addressing the basic problems afflicting the U.S. economy, as well as liberating Americans from the intrusive burden of the income tax.<p>
We cannot raise wages, create new jobs, or eliminate our national debt if the American economydoes not grow.  Nothing short of sustained economic growth will solve these problems and create opportunity for all Americans.<p>
Economists agree on a few things, but the vast majority agree that we will not grow if we do not save more and invest more.  Tinkering wiht the income tax system is not the answer.  Last year's reforms are reversed the following year.  This year's complexity is made more complex next year.  All the while, no significant improvement is achieved in the U.S. savings rate, and Americans struggle on with a needlessly complex and intrusive tax system.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>OUTLINE OF THE LUGAR PLAN</h4>
<br>
<br>
A National Sales Tax (NST) on goods and services would replace the federal personal and corporate income taxes.  The capital gains tax and the estate tax would be eliminated as well.<p>
Economists who have studied the national sales tax estimate that the NST rate of about 17% would replace the revenue generated by our current tax system.  The rate would be somewhat higher or lower depending on exemptions, although exemptions should be minimized.<p>
The federal government should work with the states to collect the national sales tax.  The federal government should ensure that it is done without extra cost to the states.  Most states already have sales tax collection systems in place.<p>
Social Security taxes and payment benefits would not be affected by this proposal, except that no
social security benefits would be taxed.<p>
The IRS would be eliminated.  A vastly smaller office or agency would be required to administer the national slaes tax and the FICA tax.  For most Americans, tax record keeping, audits, and filing of forms would be things of the past.<p>
Legislation to implement a national sales tax would have to reflect choices on a number of issues, including the methods used to prevent regressivity.  Any system of taxation requires such decisions.  Like the income tax, a national sales tax can be designed so that it is not regressive.<p>
As increased savings and investment fuels more economic growth, the sales tax should be lowered.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Advantages of the National Sales Tax</h3>
An NST will leave more money in American paychecks.  Because the government would no longer withold income taxes from paychecks, citizens would decide how much of their total income to save and how much to subject to taxation through purchases. <p> 
The NST would be a powerful incentive for savings in America.  Currently the United States has one of the lowest savings rates of any industiralized country.  According to a study by economist Laurence Kotlikoff, an NST would increase the savings rate from roughly 2% to about 7.6% in the first year.  Increasing the U.S. savings rate is a key to achieving strong economic growth, lower interests rates, improvements in real wages, and the expansion of revenue necessary to balance the budget.<p>
The national sales tax would allow for the dismantling of the current IRS and the intrusive, inefficient and costly enforcement of the current tax code.  Estimates of uncollected income tax range as hight as $150 billion per year.<p>
Businesses and individuals devote billions of man hours each year to comply with the tax code.  Under an NST, that time could be spent more productively on other activities.<p>
The simplicity of the NST and the absence of the IRS would have the effect of discouraging frequent tinkering with the tax code which complicates business activities, leads to loopholes for special interests, abd creates uncertainties for many Americans.  Thirty-one tax reforms have been enacted in the last 41 years.<p>
The NST, unlike the income tax or a value added tax (VAT), is transparent.  Individuals will know what they are paying to the government in taxes.  A transparent tax would contribute greatly to achieving the national political will to curb spending and balance the budget.<p>
Most states already have mechanisms in place to enforce a sales tax, and most taxpayers already understand how sales taxes work.  Therefore the establishment of a national sales tax could be achieved with a minimum of expense and confusion.<p>
American exports would no longer be put at a competitive disadvantage by the income tax.  Under our current system, the costs of corporate income taxes are built into the price of goods.  This raises the price of exports and make them less competitive overseas.  The NST would helpus export, thereby reducing the trade deficit and creating more jobs.  Economists estimate that for every additional $1 billion in exports, 20,000 jobs are created.  Imports, on the other hand, would be taxed at the time of sale, like all other goods.<p>
Under the NST, drug dealers and other criminals who currently escape or evade the income tax would pay the national sales tax like any other consumer.<p>
Because companies will not have to add the costs of the income tax to their products, the underlying price of most goods and services will be lower under and NST.<p>
An NST would end intrusive enforcement of the tax coe , which harms personal privacy.  It also would eliminate the ambiguity of the income tax, which causes many conscientious Americans to live in anxiety over the possibility of mistakes that could lead to penalties or charges.<p>
Although a flat tax would be a step in the right direction, an NST is preferable because the flat tax would retain many of the complexities of the current income tax system.  The IRS income tax collection aparatus would continue to exist.  Furthermore, the flat tax retains the corporate tax and the complexities involved in its calculation.  Also tinkering with the flat tax would be a constant temptation.  Many would seek to amend the tax code to promote special interests or social agendas.  The history of revisions to the 1986 Tax Reform Act demonstrates that the government  will always be tempted to ament the income tax code.<p>

<title>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar
In Front of the House Ways and Means Committee, June8, 1995</title>
<center>
<h3>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar<br>
In Front of the House Ways and Means Committee<br>
 June 8, 1995</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Mister Chairman, I thank you for your strong leadership in the area of tax reform.  Your oft quoted comment that our current tax system should be "pulled out by the roots" has been an inspiration as I have traveled the country advocating the elimination of the federal income tax.<p>
What I have found during my travels is that American families are frustrated, and even angry, with their economic predicament.  They feel like they are running on a treadmill and that treadmill is winning 
The problem is that rnany Americans suspect there is diminishing hope for a better future. 
The economic facts justify these beliefs.  From 1950 through 1973, hourly compensation including both wages and benefits increased an average of 3.0 percent per year.  Since 1973, the average wage mcrease has been less than one half of one percent.  During the past two decades, economic growth has been cut in half averaging only 2.4 percent annually. And if this isn't depressing enough for the average American family, limiting growth to 2.5 percent is the stated economic policy of the Federal Reserve Board.<p>
This we must chance. The American public is demanding it.<p>
The cause of America's economic doldrums is twofold: the huge federal budget deficit that robs us of the capital we need to grow, and a federal tax stystem that not only discourages, but confiscates our savings and investment.<p>
Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels. After averaging close to 9.0 percent in the 1960's, we recemty saw our nation's savings rate bottom out at 1.1 percent in 1992.  Because of this low rate of savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce. As a result, our annual productivity gain has averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994. The Concord Coaltion estimates that had our productivity held its pre 1974 annual rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $5O,000 a year instead of the current level of  S35,000 a year.<p>
Americans celebrate that both houses of Congress have now passed budget resolutions that will bring us to balance in seven years. We now face the more difficult task of actually implementing this budget guide m our spending measures. We must be resolute m this endeavor and not fall victim to buiness as usual in Washington.<p>
As part of the effort to balance the budget, I support providing the American public with tax relief But I strongly believe it is time to stop working around the edges of the tax code We must transform It completely.<p>
The federal income tax system is inherently flawed. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to economic growth in tbe country. It represents the worst form of big govemment intrusion into the lives of all Americans. Each year it costs Americans morr than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal to the tolal worker output of my state of Indiana.  It is unfair.  It is riddled with loopholes. It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. And finally, it doesn't work.<p>
By its own admission, the Internal Revenue Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, worth an estimated $127 billion in uncollected taxes annually.<p>
Anything this bad, this broken and this ineffective should be ended decisively, and that is what I propose. I want to scrap the income tax completely and replace it with a national sales tax.<p>
Mr. Chairman, you have outlined the criteria for evaluating an effective tax system. It must be: (1) simple, (2) the least intrusive (3) fair, (4) border adustable, and (5) friendly to savings and investment.  I have added that it also must be transparent.  I have studied all the recent tax proposals with these six factors in mind.  Many are better than the current tax systesm.  But f we are going to overhaul our tax system we should choose the one that meets these criteria.  I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative.<p>
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity.  Under a national sales tax, tbe burden of complying with the income tax would be lifted.  There would be no records to keep or audits to fear.  The money a person makes is his or her own. You don't have to report it. You don't have to hide it. You may decide if you want to save it, mvest it, or give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a tax.  Although I applaud the efforts of  flat tax advocates to simplify tax forms, nothing could be more simple than no forms at all.<p>
The national sales tax is tbe least intrusive of the tax proposals. The IRS would be substantially dismantled under ny proposal.  The IRS would no longer look over the shoulders of every American.  There wil be no audits. Americans would not waste time and effort worrymg about record keeping, deductions or exemptions that are part of the current tax code. Although the flat tax proposals tax consumption, they do so by giving the income tax a facelift and leaving the IRS largely intact You have stated, Mr. Chairman, "If the roots remain, the tree will grow back"<p>
The national sales tax is the fairest. Everyone pays the tax including wealthy individuals, criminals illegal aliens, and others who currently avoid taxation.  Wealthy Americans who consume more would pay higher taxes under the national sales tax.  Individual who save and invest their money will pay less.  Gone are the loopholes and the deductions.<p>
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy. When criminals and illegal aliens consume the proceeds of their activities, they will pay a tax. Foreign tourists will pay the tax.  Tax systems that rely on reporting will never collect any of this revenue.<p>
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited means to pay taxes. An integral part of my plan is protection for Amencans who need it -- senior citzens, the unemployed, and Americans with low paying jobs.<p>
One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level of goods and services
consumed from each American from the national slaes tax.  Each citizen who has a social security number will receive this exemption.  For example, if the exemption level were $5000, a family of four would have its first $20,0000 exempt from the sales tax.  This figure is approximately 33 percent above the 1994 poverty threshold for a family of four.<p>
Another strategy might be the exempting of items such as housing and medicine.  This is the method the majority of states have chosen and the one advocated by this committee's chairman.  Americans understand and are comfortable with this practice.  In the end it will be up to this committee and the Finance Committee in the Senate to decide the desirable path.<p>
The national sales tax is the most transparent of the tax reform proposals. A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster effiorts in Congress to achieve prudence m federal spending. There should be no hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or with holding mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes.  Every year the public and Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for federal government to meet its obligations.  If average Americans are paying that rate everyday, they will make sure that Congress spends public funds wisely.<p>
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national sales tax.  In January, the United States registered one of tbe largest trade deficits in our nation's history. We must adopt a tax system that encourages exports. Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border adjustable.  They are able to strip out their tax when they are exporting goods. In comparison the  income tax, and for that matter the flat tax, are not border adjustable.   American goods that are sent overseas are taxed twice -- once by the income tax and once when they reach their destination.  In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports.  It would level the playing field with our trading patners.  And best of all foreign imports would be taxed when they are consumed in the United States.<p>
Mr. Chairman, the last and most imperitive reason for replacing tbe income tax with a national sales tax is that it would liberate our economy by encouraging savings. For the first time in the modern era, the next generation of Americans may be worse off than the previous one.  Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average income of families has fallen.  They feel trapped in a box with diminishing hop of escaping.<p>
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough.  Savings are vital because they are
the source of all investment and productivity gains  -- savings supply the capital for buying anew machine, developing a new product or service, or employing an extra worker.  According to a recent poll, seventy two percent of Americans realize that they are not saving enough for the future.  Our net national savings rate in the 1990's has been 1.8 percent of GDP compared with a rate of 8.1 percent in the 1960's, 7.2 percent in the 1970's, and 3.7 in the 1980's.<p>
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans greater than Americans and the Germans save five times as much as we do.  Today, many believe that Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for the future.  Few realize that before WWII, before the income tax reached its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their earnings than the Japanese.<p>
A national sales tax would reeverse this trend by directly taxing consuption and leaving savings and investment untaxed.  Economists agree that a broad based consumption tax would increase our savings rate substantially.  Economist Laurence Kottlikoff of Boston University estimates that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year.  The implementation of a national sales tax is expected to create one million new jobs over a ten year period and a three percent rise in wages over that same period of time.  Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard Universityhas concluded that had a consumption tax like the national sales tax been put into place in 1986 instead of the current system, The U.S. would have experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic rowth.  Mr. Chairman, our citizens and our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.<p>
As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the best tax system to replace the income tax.  It is simple.  It protects privacy.  It is fair and transparent.  And it promotes economically beneficial behavior.  For these reasons, I encourage it enactment.<p>

When July comes to mind one conjures up visions of backyard barbecues, sipping iced-tea on the
front porch, long weekends at the beach, or  Independence Day.  Summer is often thought of as a
less strenuous time, a time when "every night is a Saturday night," a time when Americans can
relax and escape from the burdens of everyday life.  Americans work all year so that in the
summer they may enjoy the fruits of their labor.  However, the reality is that this year the average
American had to work past Independence Day to pay their taxes.  Thus, from New years Eve to
July ninth Americans are working for the government -- that is 190 days out of the year.<p> 

There is little disagreement that our current tax system, in which the average American sends
40% of what they earn to the government, is severely flawed and must change. In describing our
current tax system, Grover G. Norquist, President of Americans For Tax Reform wrote that our
current system, "...favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt
over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.."  Mr. Norquist continues by pronouncing
that: "The current tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:
Once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make
the current tax code much less a barrier to long-term growth just don't get made."  The numbers
back-up Mr. Norquist's claims.  A report on the IRS shows that over the past 10 years some 2000
tax code provisions have been released and the agency has doubled in size.<p> 

 Fortunately, the November elections have brought the tax debate to the forefront of political
discourse for the first time in thirty years.  Today, most politicians agree that the tax code is very
much in need of reform.  However, there is enormous disagreement on how this change should
be orchestrated.  Whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat, chances are you have a
plan to reform the tax code.<p>

From House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt who has attempted to bring the Democrats into
the great tax debate with his 10% progressive tax plan to House majority leader Dick Armey who
has spearheaded the tax debate by giving life to what has been dubbed the "Flat Tax," the
leadership of  both parties in the House are responding to the cries of the American people who
are demanding a fairer tax code.  Presidential hopeful Richard Lugar has also joined the debate,
coming out in support of House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer's National Sales Tax
proposal.  Whatever the plan may be one thing Washington can certainly agree on, whether for
philosophical or political reasons, is that Americans are demanding a new tax code, one that
allows them to work most of the year for themselves and their families.<p>  

Here are three of the most talked about plans.  Judge for yourself, the merits, (or lack- there-of)
for each, and then go to the Cyber Personality Forum to let people know what you think.  We
promise it won't be too "taxing."<p>

<TITLE>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS</TITLE>

<H2>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE <BR>
TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS </H2>

<P>
People who do paid work from home so that they can care for their
children are presently in most cases denied any meaningful deduction
for their legitimate home-office expenses under the Internal Revenue
Code. Not only is this result inequitable for these taxpayers,
but it also puts them at a competitive disadvantage with their
colleagues who rent or own workspace away from home. Furthermore,
it discourages people who want to spend more time with their children
from establishing home-based businesses or from making a home-based
work arrangement with their employer.
<P>
Taxpayers who conduct a home business while caring for dependents,
particularly small children, often fail to qualify for the home-office
deduction under Section 280A of the Code, because it requires
that the space used for a home business to be used exclusively
for such purpose. The home-based businesswoman needing to keep
an eye on small children or struggling with one income needs to
be physically proximate to her children and may not be able to
afford a separate room or space used for no other purpose. In
either instance, no deduction is allowed for depreciation, rent
(if the taxpayer doesn't own his or her home), maintenance, utilities
and insurance expenses allocable to the home office space if,
for instance, the work room is used also as a family room or guest
bedroom.
<P>
In another related development, the IRS has taken the position
that day care providers (presently, the only home-based businesses
that are not required to satisfy the &quot;exclusive use&quot;
rule) must keep elaborate records on the time any room is used
for personal and business purposes. This recordkeeping requirement
would presumably apply to any future exceptions to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule such as taxpayers who operate home businesses while
caring for dependents. It imposes an unworkable burden on the
home-based business not required of their non home-based competitors.
<P>
Moreover, the value of a new exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule would be minimal unless the existing rule for allocating
time of use was amended.  Applying the existing allocation rule to a home-based business
where there is mixed use of space, even if the business were operating a full
40 hours per week, results in a deduction worth only 25 percent
of the amount a competitor in an office receives for the same
expenses.
<P>
Finally, employees who are &quot;telecommuters&quot; and who would
otherwise qualify for the deduction for home-office expenses under Section 280A's
&quot;exclusive use&quot; test, are often denied the deduction under Section 67
enacted in 1986. Section 67 disallows home-office expenses of
an employee to the extent that such expenses along with other
certain &quot;miscellaneous itemized deductions&quot; do not,
in the aggregate, exceed two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted
gross income. Such other deductions are defined sufficiently broadly
that it would be the rare case where the two percent floor was
exceeded, and then, only the excess of expenses above the floor
is deductible.
<P>
<B>Suggested Solutions</B>:
<P>
Consequently, in order to provide the growing number of home-based
employees and business owners proper tax treatment that recognizes
legitimate business expenses in a way that is comparable to their
competitors and colleagues who are not home-based, the following
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code are needed:
<UL>
(1) Amend Section 280A(c)(1) to allow an exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule permitting mixed use of space for business and
personal purposes in the case of taxpayers who conduct home-based
businesses while caring for dependents. Dependents should be defined
to include not only children, but also elderly parents or a sick
spouse.
<P>
(2) Amend Section 280A(c)(4)(C) to revise the allocation rule
for mixed uses to only compare only the amount of time a room
is in fact used for a business or personal purpose and not count
the time a room is used for no purpose at all (e.g., nighttime).
This would eliminate the reduction in the deductions for business
use for the time the mixed use room is used for no purpose and
put home-based taxpayers on a par with non-home-based taxpayers
who do not suffer a loss in deductions for their office space
when the office is closed.
<P>
(3) Provide some statutory &quot;safe harbors&quot; in Section
280A(c)(4) on calculating the mixed use of space for home day
care providers and, if the amendment suggested in (1) above is
enacted, for taxpayers with home-based businesses caring for dependents
to eliminate, in most cases, a burdensome recordkeeping requirement.
<P>
(4) Amend Section 67 to exclude home-office expenses of employees
from the miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the two
percent floor.

<title>Income Tax vs. Sales Tax -- PFF</title>

<h2>Income Tax vs. Sales Tax</h2>
<P>
By Grover G. Norquist
</center>
<P>
<p>
<p>
 The political class is approaching a consensus long held by the
American people: The federal income tax system is economically
destructive, overly intrusive, unfair and far too complicated.
<P>
 Historians will marvel at how quickly Members of Congress shifted
from Bill Clinton's view, as expressed in his $200 billion dollar
tax hike in the summer of 1993, that the only problem with the
income tax was that it did not tax successful wealth creation
at high enough rates.  We now confront the present debate between
moving to a flat rate "consumed income tax" or scrapping
the income tax completely and replacing it with a national sales
tax.
<P>
 Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader and a former economics
professor, has been the leading proponent of moving to a flat
tax that would tax all income once at a flat rate of 17 percent
after a personal exemption for a married couple of $23,000 and
of $36,000 for a family of four.  Should an American save and
invest any portion of his income during the year that money saved
would be exempt from tax. In effect, every American would have
an Individual Retirement Account with no limit on how much one
can save, no requirement that the money stay in the IRA until
retirement and no tax upon withdrawal. In effect this creates
a super turbo- charged Individual Retirement Account.
<P>
 Congressman Bill Archer and Senator Dick Lugar have proposed
replacing the present income tax with a consumption tax or a national
retail sales tax respectively.
<P>
 Michael Rothschild has criticized Mr. Armey and all advocates
of the flat tax for missing what he sees as a golden political
opportunity and advocating reforming the present system rather
than uprooting the IRS and moving to a national sales tax.
<P>
 Rothschild is correct in his criticisms of the present income
tax system, although he could have gone further.   But is he correct
that the sales tax would be a long-term improvement over Armey's
flat tax?  For political as well as economic reasons the answer
is no.
<P>
 The great strength of the flat tax is that it treats all American
citizens equally. This is a central tenet of American civilization.
Dividing citizens by income class is a European affliction that
Americans have rejected in most areas of civic life.  We are outraged
by the implication that a persons income would affect his standing
in court. We would not permit wealth or income to determine whether
one could vote, serve on a jury, attend public school, or engage
in freedom of speech and religion.
<P>
 The demagogic politicians who would exploit class divisions in
America are of a cloth with those who would divide Americans by
race for their own political gain.  It is not by accident that
the move towards a flat tax comes at the same time as the nation
is rejecting affirmative action, quotas and racial preferences
of all kinds.  We are Americans and we cannot allow the politicians
to continue to divide us against each other.
<P>
 For this same reason the flat tax is difficult to increase. 
In 1993, Bill Clinton told Americans to pay no attention to  his
1993 tax-and-spend budget increase as only "the rich"
would pay more.  Then, when the tax hike on "the rich"
was locked in, he moved to then tax only "social security
recipients" and only "small businesses that file as
subchapter S corporations" and then "only" those
who buy gasoline for their cars.  In Massachusetts the pro spending
interests --government workers unions -- have tried five times
through the initiative and referendum process to change the state's
present constitutional requirement for a flat tax to allow graduated
rates. Five times voters have publicly rejected this "populist"
measure despite assurances that "only the rich" would
be targeted. Voters recognized that once income groups were divided
they would be attacked one by one and divided against each other
until they fell.
<P>
 It is important to Americans that they have the same relationship
to the state as all other Americans. Equality before the law is
central to American life. It is also the best protection against
attempts to raise taxes.  An increase in a flat tax is opposed
by all taxpayers. A cut in a flat tax benefits all taxpayers.
 What a change that would make in the dynamics of the politics
of taxes.
<P>
 Mr. Rothschild overstates the virtues and understates the sad
history of national sales taxes in other nations.  First, sales
taxes are shot full of loopholes and gradations around the world
and in the 50 states.  Every year lobbyists swarm state capitols
asking that their product be exempt from sales taxes as a necessity.
California just went through the debate about the snack tax, which
included defining what a snack is.
<P>
 But a sales tax to replace the income tax -- and the social security
tax and inheritance tax and gift taxes if we are to be rid of
the Internal revenue service that enforces all these taxes --
is not a real option.  As economist Bruce Bartlett has calculated,
any sales tax would have to be 13.3 percent  to replace the income
tax, another 13.6 percent to replace the social security tax,
and another 3.3 percent to replace the corporate income tax. A
sales tax this high would be forced to be collected as a Value
Added Tax or VAT at every level of production.  No one would buy
retail. As in every European nation the sales tax would almost
immediately become a Value Added Tax which taxes goods and services
at every level of production. VAT's like income taxes are very,
very intrusive in the lives of businessmen and women, just like
the hated income tax.
<P>
 Worse, advocating a sales tax to replace the income tax could
well lead to the imposition of a sales tax/VAT in addition to
the present income taxes.  Every nation in Europe that has a VAT
also has a personal income tax and a corporate income tax as well
as wage taxes like social security.
<P>
 Americans of good will should work together to support the present
strategy of the House Republican leadership; to match spending
reduction with tax cuts that move us toward a flat tax.  The tax
cuts passed by the House include moving toward eliminating all
taxes on savings and investment and toward a larger personal and
dependent exemption.  Tax cuts alongside spending reductions makes
it clear that the purpose of reducing federal spending is not
simply to get Washington's sorry budget in order, but to protect
the American family's budget which has the first claim to money
it earns.
<P>
 And while it is important to move to a flat tax  on consumed
income to simplify the code, reduce the destruction American savings
and investment and treat all citizens equally -- without risking
burdening the people with an additional sales tax -- the true
challenge for Americans is to reduce the total size, scope and
power of the central government. Ultimately there is no nice,
pleasant, non destructive way to wrest 20 to 25 percent of the
total economy away from those who create wealth and distribute
it to the political class.  The total tax burden must be reduced
while we work to minimize the costs of the tax system upon our
freedoms, our families and our civil society. 
<P>

<h3>COMMENTS ON DEPLOYMENT OF 25,000 U.S. FORCES<br> 

IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA</h3> 
<P>
<B>TESTIMONY OF JEANE J. KIRKPATRICK</B> 
<P>
<B>before</B> 
<P>
<B>THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE</B><br> 
<B>UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</B> 
<P><i>NOVEMBER 15, 1995</i> </center>
<P><hr><P>
<B>Introduction</B> 
<P>
I thank the Committee on National Security for inviting me to
testify today on this important subject. I will try to restrict
my remarks to subjects directly relevant to the Committee's concerns.
<P>
I welcome the Committee's hearings on U.S. troop deployment. Obviously
it is difficult no, impossible for the Committee or its witnesses
to decide whether it will be necessary or desirable to support
and to implement an agreement which does not exist, whose terms
are unknown, and about which there remain large differences among
the parties.
<P>
We do not know whether defensible borders will be drawn for Bosnia
Herzegovina, whether the arms embargo will be lifted and a Bosnian
army trained to defend its country from well-armed neighbors.
We do not know who else will be participating in a multinational
peace force, nor how they will be integrated and commanded, nor
under what rules of engagement they will operate, nor what kind
of exit strategy is planned.
<P>
It is impossible, therefore to decide now that the United States
should or should not participate in a hypothetical force to defend
a hypothetical agreement, but it is possible to address questions
relevant to the deployment.
<P>
<B>II. United States National Interests in Bosnia</B> 
<P>
The Committee asks: Are there important national interests at
stake in Bosnia? My answer to this question is yes, Americans
have many important interests in this conflict.
<P>
I have believed from the onset of the war in former Yugoslavia
that important moral, political and strategic interests are at
stake in the Balkans. Recall that two world wars have spread from
the Balkan tinder box wars which engulfed the European continent
and eventually involved the United States as well. Because we
are a part of the Western world, we cannot be indifferent to brutal
aggression and mass murder in the heart of Europe.
<P>
More than two and one half million Bosnians have been displaced
from their homes in this war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration
camps, torture, mass rape and mass murder have become familiar
again in the region. The methods used against the people of Bosnia
slaughter, starvation, forced population transfers and other instruments
of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; dehumanize the victims. Indifference
to these dehumanizes us.
<P>
The Committee requests a description of the &quot;precise connection&quot;
between stability in Bosnia, the Balkan peninsula and the balance
of power in Europe. But &quot;precise connections&quot; are known
only after events have developed. Often they come as a surprise.
<P>
But we know violence is contagious. And that conquest is contagious
as well. Former Yugoslavia is centrally, strategically located.
Location is not everything in international affairs, but the centrality
and ethnic-diversification of former Yugoslavia give developments
there greater geostrategic significance than if those countries
were more isolated or remote. Moreover, the countries of Central
Europe recently released from the Soviet Empire have new regimes
and new borders which leave them more susceptible to destabilization
than established regimes.
<P>
In the current conflict, violence sponsored by the Serbian government
has already spread from Kosovo to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina.
It has already extended across Macedonia's borders. We cannot
know where it might end if permitted to continue. Russia, too,
has a stake in the region, and Ukraine, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania,
Greece, Turkey, Italy.
<P>
We should not forget that Benito Mussolini and his Black Shirts
inspired Adolf Hitler and others, nor that Mussolini's aggression
against Ethiopia presented the League of Nations and its members
a challenge they could not meet and the League collapsed, that
Hitler was encouraged by the Italian's success to consolidate
his own powers, and that Hitler's success in occupying the Rhineland
encouraged him to move again into Austria, Czechoslovakia and
beyond, to the ovens of Auschwitz and the graveyards of Normandy.
<P>
Through it all, our European Allies watched, never dreaming that
Hitler's appetite would extend so far or with such consequences.
They had vital interests and no prescience. Much the same combination
has guided the European response to Serb expansion.
<P>
The harm done by violent tyrants in this century always comes
as a surprise.
<P>
The United States and the whole of democratic Europe have a large
stake in ensuring that extreme nationalism, instability, xenophobia
and Serb conquests do not whet the savage appetites of would-be
tyrants and conquerors in the Balkans and among their neighbors.
<P>
<B>III. The Proposed Deployment: Is it Necessary?</B> 
<P>
To say the United States has an interest in ending violence and
conquest in Bosnia and an interest in promoting and preserving
stability and democracy in the region is not to say we must send
25,000 U.S. troops to take part in a 60,000 man peace operation
much less that such an operation would succeed.
<P>
No new style peacekeeping operation undertaken by the United Nations
and the Clinton Administration in an area of conflict has secured
peace. U.N. peace operations conducted in Somalia and Bosnia over
the last three years have achieved virtually none of their goals
although Phase I of the Somalia operation, undertaken by President
George Bush, succeeded in delivering large quantities of food
to prevent mass starvation in Somalia.
<P>
These &quot;peace operations&quot; have suffered from disorganization
and disagreement among participants, lack of coordination and
political will, military incompetence and ineffectiveness. Some
of their shortcomings were a consequence of the United Nation's
lack of skill and experience. Some were a consequence of the diverse
interests, priorities, goals and perspectives of participants
which are common to multilateral operations.
<P>
But it is not clear that a multinational operation involving many
governments, languages and organizational habits can succeed in
coping with difficult military problems. Clearly, however, an
operation under NATO command has a better chance of success than
one under U.N. command. That is what is now proposed.
<P>
A) Does American credibility requires 25,000 U.S. troops on the
ground?
<P>
U.S. credibility is at stake only if the Clinton Administration
made commitments to supply such a force without consultation or
consent of the Congress. But America's allies understand that
the Congress plays an important constitutional role in U.S. foreign
policy. Failure to provide ground troops might do superficial
damage to America's credibility, but committing troops and failing
to achieve our goal would constitute a devastating blow to the
credibility of the U.S. government at home and abroad. <I>The
worst outcome would be an effort that first committed U.S. forces
to the task and then failed as in Vietnam and Somalia.</I> 
<P>
Moreover, it is not clear that the Clinton Administration understands
how to use force and the threat of force to establish and maintain
credibility, and achieve goals.
<P>
B) Is deployment of U.S. troops necessary to preserve NATO? We
do not know what kind of commitment was made by the Administration
to NATO. Neither do we know how many NATO countries have committed
to participate, nor on what terms.
<P>
Several NATO countries Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey,
the United States and France (the French are still not members
of NATO) have had troops in and around former Yugoslavia for two
or three years operating as part of a United Nations force, under
U.N. command and as part of a NATO force as well. Much effort
and billions of dollars have achieved almost nothing.
<P>
U.S. forces have participated in the conflict in Bosnia through
air and sea missions conducted under the auspices of NATO. U.S.
ships have monitored enforcement of economic and arms embargoes.
U.S. planes and pilots have relieved pressure on UNPROFOR forces
under attack, carried out air drops of food and medicine to populations
under siege, monitored the &quot;no fly&quot; zones established
in U.N. Security Council Resolution 781, monitored the installation
by Serb forces of air defenses, rescued Capt. Scott O'Grady, conducted
the first non-lethal air strikes ever, and provided high altitude
surveillance of Serb activities including confirmation of the
movement of Serb tanks across the border to participate in the
assault on Srebrenica and of mass murder of Bosnian males following
the fall of Srebrenica last July.
<P>
Until now NATO's participation in former Yugoslavia has been carried
out under a &quot;double key&quot; command system which requires
United Nations' authorization for each operation authorization
that was granted slowly and with reluctance.
<P>
NATO air power has not been used effectively and has not been
successful. More serious is the fact that these arrangements have
reflected the preferences of the United States' NATO allies.
<P>
<I>Our NATO allies</I> the British, Dutch, Belgians and French
(the French are still not members of NATO) <I>preferred peacekeeping
under U.N command.</I> The United States, stung from the Somalia
experience, did not place U.S. forces directly under U.N. command
in former Yugoslavia, but closely coordinated U.S. and NATO operations
with and recognized the authority of the U.N. Secretary General
and his Representative over NATO operations. <I>The result was
to undermine NATO's credibility and effectiveness.</I> 
<P>
So, is it true that U.S. refusal to participate with ground troops
in a new phase of peacekeeping in Bosnia would weaken NATO? I
find it unpersuasive that U.S. refusal to send 25,000 ground troops
for peacekeeping duties on the ground would further weaken an
already weakened NATO.
<P>
Deployment of 60,000 troops may simply bring inside NATO disagreements
among allies on tactics that have so far taken place outside the
NATO framework.
<P>
<B>IV. Taking into account these factors, should the United States deploy 25,000 troops in former Yugoslavia?</B> 
<P>
Not unless President Clinton makes a persuasive case for this
deployment.
<P>
Not if there are alternative strategies that could contain aggression.
<P>
So far the alternatives have not been authoritatively tried or
even considered at least publicly. They should be. Bill Clinton
should make his case to the people and take his case to the Congress.
<P>
Not unless there is clear understanding and agreement among NATO
members concerning command it should be an American and rules
of engagement they should authorize the use of overwhelming force
in response to attacks on people.
<P>
Not unless there is a realistic prospect that the peace in the
region can be maintained after the departure of U.S. troops.
<P>
That requires 1) <I>defensible borders for Bosnia Herzegovina</I>,
and 2) <I>lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia Herzegovina
and helping equip and train Bosnian armed forces</I> so that they
can defend themselves as Croatia can now defend itself.
<P>
I continue to believe that there is promise in a &quot;lift and
strike&quot; policy in which the United States (and NATO if so
inclined) accepts responsibility for the arming and training of
Bosnian military forces. I think such a policy could prevent recurrence
of aggression and the spread of war if it were reinforced by an
active American diplomacy and a substantial U.S. presence in the
area.
<P>
I do not know why the Clinton Administration has not tried a &quot;lift
and strike&quot; strategy to create a peace which could last.
I suspect it is because of the reluctance of our allies to &quot;take
sides.&quot; But only a policy which faces facts, takes sides,
punishes aggressors, and leaves defensible borders can meet American
standards and American goals.
<P>
I fear the same reluctance of the same Allies may encourage the
Administration to design a strategy that does not provide a solution,
but requires 25,000 U.S. ground troops. That would be a great
mistake.
<P>
We need realistic plans, realistic means, and goals consistent
with our ideals.

<title>Clinton Fails to Make Case for American Troops -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3>CLINTON FAILS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICAN TROOPS IN BOSNIA</h3>

By John Hillen<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 437<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>

	The Clinton Administration's plan to use 25,000 American troops to implement a Bosnian peace accord is being exposed as a haphazard and risky enterprise.  In hearings on Capitol Hill last week, members of the Senate and House questioned the political and military rationale behind the Bosnia peace plan deployment.  These questions focused on the mission's political goals, its military objectives, the probability of success, the risks entailed, and the support of the American people.  Robert McNamara recently noted in his memoirs that the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations failed to address these fundamental issues in the early debates over Vietnam.  It appears that the Clinton Administration is ready to fall into the same trap.
<p>
	The Clinton plan puts the cart before the horse.  Instead of making a troop commitment that is tailored to support a specific and workable peace accord, President Clinton made a commitment for 25,000 U.S. ground troops before he knew what the peace accord would entail -- an arbitrary pledge over two years ago. This backwards strategy forces a political plan onto an abstract military force requirement.  Members of Congress were correct to question why the Administration is attempting to force 25,000 U.S. ground troops onto a plan that does not yet exist.  In addition, the congressional hearings last week made it clear that the Clinton troop request is a mission looking for a purpose.  These hearings raised many prescient questions and issues that remain neither answered nor resolved:
<p>
	<b>1)  What are the objectives, and how does America know when they have been achieved?</b>  The American "Implementation Force" has no clearly defined and attainable military goals and no specific criteria by which the U.S. commanders can measure their success.  The Clinton plan fails to address military objectives and commits American forces to static picket duty in an interpositional buffer zone.  The American forces are supposed to sit there and "monitor" infractions of the peace accord.  General Lewis MacKenzie, a Canadian who commanded the first United Nations troops in Sarajevo, told Members of Congress last week that, of all the various national contingents, U.S. troops would be the primary targets for disgruntled belligerents.  He also told the House National Security Committee that while the Administration may try to portray the Implementation Force as a neutral "peacekeeping" presence, the United States will be perceived as the enemy by one side in the conflict.  He re-emphasized the danger to U.S. forces by adding that if he were an American military officer, he "wouldn't touch this mission with a ten-foot pole." 
<p>	<b>2) There is no exit strategy.</b>  Precisely because American forces do not have well-defined and achievable military goals, "mission creep" is inherent in the Clinton peace plan.  With the Administration under enormous pressure to succeed after deploying 25,000 troops, President Clinton will be sorely tempted to escalate American military efforts when faced with the inevitable resistance of the warring factions. To forestall this, the Administration plan calls for a time-driven scenario in which the American forces will be pulled out in twelve months.  Almost all the Members of Congress recognized that this is a purely political decision and were extremely skeptical when General John Shalikashvili defended this timetable for unexplained "operational reasons."  This is shameless political grandstanding on the part of President Clinton, and Congress rightly called his bluff.  As former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified, "An exit date is not an exit strategy."
<P>	<b>3) The Clinton team has anticipated and planned for a best-case scenario.</b>  Military planning, down to the lowest levels, always takes into account worst-case scenarios.  Military leaders must plan for what to do when anything and everything goes wrong.  Because this plan represents an ill-defined mission taking place in the volatile Balkans, there is every reason to believe that unexpected events will be a fixture. Senators were rightly astounded when Secretary of Defense William Perry stated that he "could not conceive of circumstances where troops would stay longer" than the one-year target date. This comment exposed the political and military naivet that permeates the Clinton Administration. There are no contingency plans to address a scenario other than the fanciful best-case scenario anticipated by the Administration.  Should there be anything less than cooperation by the Bosnian parties, America would be forced either to cut and run or to reinforce troops in Bosnia and escalate military efforts to make the peace plan succeed.  The testimony of General MacKenzie made it clear that, despite Secretary Perry's optimism, American troops will have a rough time of it in Bosnia.
<p>	The Administration plan to deploy American ground forces has much to answer for, especially in regard to the fundamental questions that policymakers must address when contemplating the deployment of American combat troops into dangerous environments.  The Clinton team did not provide satisfactory answers to Congress, either on these fundamental issues or on a host of other questions about the mission.  The Administration has not clearly articulated its political and military goals in Bosnia. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher himself admitted after the hearings, "No, we haven't yet made the case." Most important, the Administration has not explained why the U.S. needs to send 25,000 ground troops to Bosnia and how a 12-month deployment can make a decisive contribution to a lasting peace in Bosnia.

<title>Conditions for Sending U.S. Troops to Bosnia -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><i><h3>CONDITIONS FOR SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO BOSNIA</h3></i>

By John Hillen, Policy Analyst <br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 66<br>
October 11, 1995<br></center>
<p>

	The President has promised to send 25,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia to police a peace settlement. He should not do so without the approval of Congress. Any operation as risky and potentially long-reaching as this one demands the full participation and approval of the House and Senate, and Congress should ensure that certain conditions are met before American troops are sent to Bosnia. While affirming the principle that all American forces, including ground troops, can be used in lesser regional conflicts and peacekeeping operations in Europe, Congress also should note the special risks and dangers associated with the Bosnian peace plan and ensure that specific criteria are met before American troops are deployed.
<p>
	As Congress debates whether U.S. troops should be committed in Bosnia, it should remember that:
<p><ul>
<li>America must lead in NATO, but sound leadership demands that the U.S. question a mission with ambiguous goals and ill-defined objectives. Washington should commit to NATO operations in principle but should not support losing propositions.
<p>
<li>The promised 25,000 American troops would cost two to three times more than the $1 billion - $2 billion estimated by the Clinton Administration.
<p>
<li>The Administration has not spelled out a coherent military plan that specifies the exact mission of the troops, the criteria to determine the success of that mission, timetables, rules of engagement, or command and control arrangements (especially concerning Russian participation).
<p>
<li>The plan to send 50,000 - 70,000 heavily armed NATO troops is clear evidence that this mission is an exercise in peace-enforcement, not peacekeeping, as the Administration claims. NATO troops will be authorized to undertake limited offensive operations against warring factions that violate the conditions of the peace accord. 
<p>
<li>Because of this, "mission creep," the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into this plan. As in Somalia, there will be pressure to increase operations and reinforce troops in order to "succeed."
<p>
<li>U.S. forces will not be accepted as impartial peacekeepers. The U.S. recently launched a comprehensive air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs and announced plans to train the Bosnian Muslim Army during the Bosnian deployment. The U.S. is no longer neutral in this conflict. This phenomenon also occurred in Lebanon in 1983 and Somalia in 1993, where the lives of American Marines and soldiers were needlessly lost because America failed to appreciate that belligerents viewed the U.S. as a combatant.</ul><p>

<b>THE ROLE OF CONGRESS</b>
<p>
The Congress should:<p><ul>

<li>Insist on full congressional approval for any deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia;
<p>
<li>Hold hearings to determine the feasibility of U.S. participation in a Bosnian peace force; and
<p>
<li>Insist that the President meet the following conditions prior to any deployment of U.S. forces:
<p>
<li>Establish that U.S. national interests are threatened in Bosnia-Herzegovina;
<p>
<li>Publicize exactly what military commitments the Administration has made to both NATO and the Bosnian government;
<p>
<li>Establish that the peace accord is not merely another transient cease-fire, but a politically sustainable agreement;
<p>
<li>Confirm that all parties have withdrawn to clearly recognizable lines of demarcation that can be policed efficiently by a NATO force;
<p>
<li>State strategic and operational objectives for the U.S. force that are clearly defined, attainable, and sustainable; 
<p>
<li>Describe the exit strategy and clear criteria for determining mission success, including an "escape clause" in case the peace accord proves ephemeral;
<p>
<li>State the deployment, rotation, and redeployment timetables, as well as whether they are event-driven or time-driven;
<p>
<li>State clearly the mission cost and the effect on U.S. strategic readiness posture;
<p>
<li>Present a well-defined command and control structure that clearly addresses the role of Russian forces;
<p>
<li>Ensure that there is no overlap of responsibility and authority with the United Nations Protection Force, which should be entirely separate from the NATO chain of command;
<p>
<li>Present contingency plans for various scenarios that realistically address additional resources, cost, and operational feasibility;
<p>
<li>Submit a multinational force structure and command and control plan that ensures unity of command and effort among the many nations taking part; 
<p>
<li>Demonstrate that there are clear rules of engagement that are compatible with U.S. training and doctrine, with American forces not to be given static and passive missions that allow them only to react to initiatives of the warring belligerents;
<p>
<li>Ensure that U.S. troops will be deployed in sufficient strength to guarantee force protection and fully supported operations (no "token" force should be deployed in a dangerous theater); and
<p>
<li>Explain how past U.S. actions in Bosnia are consistent with a "peacekeeping" role.	   
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
There is clear evidence that American ground troops could imperil a Bosnian peace force by discrediting its impartial standing. Instead of committing large numbers of ground forces, the U.S. should play to its strengths by supporting this mission with capabilities that only the U.S. can contribute. These include strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and combat air support if necessary. American ground troops offer no tactical or operational advantage to a Bosnian peace force. They offer only political advantage for reluctant European allies.
<p>
	The U.S. should agree, in principle, to deploy its military forces (including ground troops) to assist in peacekeeping operations in Europe. But the Bosnian peace plan is not peacekeeping; it is peace enforcement. As yet, there is no reliable or sustainable peace settlement in Bosnia. When there is, the U.S. should consider sending in any forces necessary, but only if the foregoing conditions are met.

<title>The Risks of Clinton's Bosnia Peace Plan -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<i><h3>THE RISKS OF CLINTON'S BOSNIA PEACE PLAN</h3></i>
By John Hillen, Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 262<br>
October 10, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder Update</i> No. 250, "Clinton's Bosnia Folly," June 2, 1995, and <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	The impending diplomatic breakthrough in the Balkans has raised the prospect of a substantial American and allied military operation to police a Bosnian peace accord. Such an operation undoubtedly would entail an exercise in "peace-enforcement," with United States and allied troops using limited and selective enforcement measures to ensure the compliance of warring factions. 
<p>
	Knowing that this will not present U.S. forces either with a clearly defined, attainable military mission or with a decisive political objective, the Clinton Administration will try to sell the plan as a temporary and innocuous "peacekeeping" operation. The Administration maintains that this would involve only the limited deployment of approximately 25,000 American troops at a cost of $1 billion. But some experts have concluded that the operation would cost two or three times this much and that it probably would involve more than 25,000 American troops over a period of several years. 
<p>
	In much the same way, the Bush Administration tried to sell the Somalia operation as a limited humanitarian enterprise. In fact, the Administration's initial pronouncements even suggested that the troops would be home in seven weeks, by Inauguration Day. But American troops did not leave Somalia until some 16 months later, their good work obscured by the Ranger debacle in Mogadishu, the incoherence of a United Nations-managed peace-enforcement operation, and the renewal of clan warfare in Somalia. The Clinton Administration's planned deployment of American troops to Bosnia is fraught with much greater danger than was faced in Somalia and raises several strategic dilemmas. Some of these, concerning mission objectives, timetables, command and control, and rules of engagement, have been raised by GOP leaders in Congress. Others still need to be addressed:
<p>
<b>NATO Involvement.</b> Because of a rash promise by President Clinton, the U.S. is committed to a major role in implementing a Bosnian peace plan. This in itself should spark a major debate. How did NATO, America's principal security alliance, become a back-door conduit for heavy ground involvement in a conflict of marginal interest to U.S. security concerns? 
<p>
	In 1992, the world heard that this was the "hour of Europe"; in 1995, the U.S. hears once again that its European allies are leery of decisive commitments in the absence of American leadership. The U.S. obviously must lead NATO, but saying no to an ill-conceived peace-enforcement mission with vague and undefined objectives is clearer evidence of leadership than throwing troops into a losing cause. Significant U.S. participation in any NATO enterprise should be contingent on two things:  a clear and present danger to the security and stability of Europe, and a mission with clearly defined political and military goals.
<p>
	Is NATO the proper vehicle for a Bosnian peace force?  Should an alliance starved of credibility and uncertain of its future structure tackle internecine, ethnic conflict in Bosnia?  A NATO Balkan peace-enforcement force could have several unfortunate consequences. For example, it could unleash dissension at the very time NATO is trying to expand. Much as Somalia split the U.N. coalition, the ups and downs of the Bosnian mission could split the European alliance. Faced with the demonstrated intransigence of the belligerents, NATO could experience a resumption of the divergent approaches and internal squabbling that plagued its response to Bosnia in 1993-1994. A Bosnian peace force, under current circumstances, has precious little to offer NATO during a critical phase in its evolution. NATO should not allow a poorly crafted, self-fulfilling prophesy to lure it into accepting this mission.  
<p>
<b>U.S. Troops as "Peacekeepers."</b>  Peacekeeping is an exercise in which the peacekeepers are accepted as honest brokers, neutral and impartial. Because peacekeepers are deployed after an accord has been reached, they operate only in a supervisory role and are forced to rely on the good will and cooperation of the belligerents. President Clinton claims that the U.S. force would be structured for a "peaceful" and "uneventful" mission. 
<p>
	But as currently planned, this would not be a classic peacekeeping operation. So far in Bosnia there is no peace to keep. If U.S. ground troops are sent into Bosnia without a firm peace settlement, they will not be going in as neutrals. The United States, for better or for worse, has just completed a sustained air offensive against one side in the Bosnian conflict. While America may see itself as the impartial hand that "leveled the playing field," the Bosnian Serbs most certainly do not. They were on the receiving end of hundreds of airstrikes from NATO aircraft and American cruise missiles. In addition, the Clinton Administration plans to train the Bosnian Muslim forces while simultaneously acting as peacekeepers. Does the Administration really think the Serbs will accept American ground troops as impartial and neutral peacekeepers? 
<p>
	The U.S. has made this hazardous assumption twice before in recent years:  In Lebanon, in 1983, U.S. air and naval forces attacked Druze and Shiite militia positions while maintaining a "neutral" peacekeeping force in Beirut. Within days of the strikes, over 240 U.S. Marines were dead after a terrorist suicide strike against their barracks. 
<p>
	In Somalia, the U.S. also chose to attack one belligerent party while professing neutrality. The actions against Mohammed Aideed's party drew American troops into the conflict as if they were yet another local faction -- the only one without the political will to slug it out in the bloody back streets of Mogadishu.
<p>
<b>"Mission Creep."</b> Mission creep, the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into the Clinton plan for a Bosnian peace force. A force of 25,000 American soldiers is the absolute minimum needed to give the U.S. the security it needs to operate in Bosnia. A smaller force would be hopelessly exposed and unable to accomplish much of anything.  
<p>
	Since 25,000 troops are the minimum for protection alone, the question becomes how a peace plan will be imposed on the belligerents. The answer could be:  Call for more troops. This is exactly what happened in Somalia after the street battles of October 3, 1993. Within weeks, Clinton was forced to deploy an additional 15,000 troops to Somalia to ensure the security of a few thousand American soldiers operating with the U.N. mission. A force of 25,000 American troops for Bosnia anticipates a best-case scenario. Any deterioration of this scenario must lead to greater American participation. 
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The President's idea of peacekeeping in Bosnia would not be peacekeeping at all.  As yet, there is no peace to keep. The Clinton plan amounts to peace-enforcement in a dangerous and hostile environment. This is why NATO is planning for 50,000-70,000 heavily armed combat troops and not the lightly armed observers more common to peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
	Should a truly conclusive peace settlement be reached in Bosnia, and peacekeeping become possible, America should support a NATO peace force with strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and -- in the case of extreme emergency -- combat air support and possibly some ground troops. There is nothing to gain, either for America or for the peacekeeping force, by deploying substantial American ground forces in this risky adventure. American ground troops offer no operational advantage to the force. They are merely a political backstop for reluctant European allies. Based upon America's experiences in Lebanon and Somalia, it is obvious that participation by American ground troops could damage mission credibility and undermine the peace America and its allies are attempting to preserve. 
<p>
	While the U.S. should agree in principle to support NATO peace-enforcement operations when they make sense -- in other words, when the mission and political objectives are clear -- it should not commit itself to a deal that is bound to fail. In order to honor U.S. security commitments, America should be willing to deploy troops for lesser regional conflicts, and even for peacekeeping. However, it should do so only in cases where the benefits of success outweigh the risks of failure. The Clinton "peacekeeping" plan is not one of those cases.

<H2>Bennett: Politics Aside</H2>
</center>
During the last three decades, America has experienced an unprecedented degree of social regression. If things continue the way they are going, we may well see the end of the American experiment in ordered liberty. To be more specific: if current trends in juvenile crime, illegitimacy, family disintegration, community breakup, education, and drug use continue, this experiment in self-government will end. This is a conclusion based on a disinterested analysis of social facts. After all, there is nothing inevitable about this experiment. Our system of ordered liberty was brought about by will and thought and reflection, not by chance. The Founders said that we would have to maintain certain efforts to keep it together. Some of those efforts are being maintained. But many are not.
<p>
During our Candidate School, you have heard from some people we regard as among the ablest and smartest around in various policy areas. Public policy is crucial; here at Empower America, we are trying to advance the most intelligent and thoughtful policies we can. But I believe the cultural arena is even more important. That is not to say that cultural ideas can't be significantly influenced by people in politics. Indeed, they can. But I have to say, I think it probably matters more for the cultural future of this country what happens in movies and television, and on the radio and in classrooms, than what happens on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Talk to a group of teenagers and tell me if they sound more to you like they're listening to C-Span or MTV. And I will tell you: they sound a lot more like MTV. This doesn't diminish the political task. It just makes it clear that there are other tasks as well. And of course the two are related.
<p>
I think that if the philosophy of life being promulgated in TV commercials, movies. television and other cultural media changed, it would probably bring about more of a positive change in American life than virtually any piece of legislation we can imagine.
<p>
There is the belief among many of the people who have the most power and influence to shape attitudes that the most important obligation in life is to yourself, that your duties are to yourself - not to God, not to country, not to work, or family, or wife, or children, but to self. And if self is not happy or satisfied. then it must take priority. This, in my view, is a social disaster and an invitation to barbarism. It is a dagger aimed at the heart of our society. But it prevails in many quarters . It has been given to us by some intellectuals. Much of Hollywood pushes that view. And it is central to much of contemporary liberalism. I think it is poisoning the moral environment of America.
<p>
Bad philosophy has destroyed the lives of many people in this country. It has destroyed many homes, many communities, and will continue to unless we confront it directly. If you do try to fight this thing by taking on its proponents, you will be in for one heck of a fight. But it is a fight worth having. Indeed, it is one of the fights that matters most.

Empower America's <i>Highlights</i>

<H2>Kemp: Growth and Hope</H2>
</center>
Empower America was founded to present conservatism's positive face, on the premise that the instincts of the American people arc naturally optimistic and that their values are predicated upon the virtues of a Judeo-Christian society . We believe that conservatives should always be forward looking, not backward looking; optimistic, not pessimistic; confident, not timid; and inclusive, not exclusive.
<p>
You cannot lead anybody with pessimism. Can you imagine a quarterback going into the huddle and saying, "Gosh, it's hot out here. Wow, those guys are big over there. I know this play has never worked before, but I don't know what else to do. Let's try it again." No great adventure has ever been led by anybody who says it can't be done. Leadership has to be predicated upon confidence in one's own abilities as well as on a belief in the inevitability of ultimate victory.
<p>
Leadership should be centered around a world view of hope, optimism, confidence, and the ultimate achievement of victory - for the right reason. The Bible says overcome evil, overcome it with good. Conservatives are obligated morally, not only to indict darkness, but to also light candles; not only to be against that which is bad, but also to be for empowering and unleashing the potential of the human spirit.
<p>
A great conservative named Oswald Spengler wrote <i>Decline of the West</i> in 1931. He was pessimistic about democracy. He thought that democracy wouldn't survive against fascism and Nazism. One of the founders of <i>National Review</i>, James Burnham, wrote <i>Suicide of the West</i>. He said we were going to commit suicide because democracy wouldn't work. Jean Francois Ravel, another leading conservative, wrote a book in which he said democracy will turn out to be a parenthesis in the history of the world.
<p>
Unlike these men, I'm an optimist. I always knew we would win. Sometimes, however, it has been tough maintaining this positive outlook. I know there are problems. Human rights abuses continue in China, the Middle East, and Bosnia Despite these problems, democracy has defeated all of the "isms" of years past - absolutism, fascism, Nazism, and communism.
<p>
Socialism is dead intellectually. Isolated pockets remain in Cuba, North Korea, and in the economics departments of some of our Ivy League colleges, but very few people today talk about socialism as an answer to poverty. In my view, there is only one real answer to poverty: a system based on private property, limited government, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial capitalism. The Left has tried to make Americans feel guilty about this kind of a system - to envy the rich, to desire a redistribution of wealth, and to centralize power. Thanks to computers and the telecommunications revolution, much of the world now has instantaneous access to information. This revolution will be the ultimate undoing of modern liberalism's centralizing tendencies. Markets will be energized, unleashed, and individualized. In this new environment, mistakes in government policies can cause capital to flow out of a country as fast as it flows in. All of this means that governments cannot control commerce like they used to.
<p>
My entire political career has been dedicated to the proposition that conservatives should be positive and optimistic and demonstrate a concern for the underdogs in our society. It is outrageous that conservatives have allowed liberals to steal genuinely good words - welfare, for instance. Don't think of welfare in terms of what the Left has described. I care about the "welfare" of my family. Welfare is not a bad word. We have allowed it to become synonymous with government handouts . What welfare really means is the well-being of someone. Conservatives <i>should</i> care about the welfare of the American people. We <i>should</i> want everyone to be able to get a good education, get a job, get married, have children, and move up the economic ladder.
<p>
People don't care how much you know until they know that you care. That is why conservatives must be inclusive. We have got to show South Central Los Angeles that we care about them just as much as we care about Wall Street. If our policies will not work in East Saint Louis, how can we sell them to Russia or Eastern Europe?
<p>
I proposed the idea of free enterprise zones for the District of Columbia in order to enhance the city's ability to recover its middle class. Two hundred thousand families have moved out of D.C. over the past 15 years because of taxes, crime, and a lack of educational quality. I helped introduce a Hong Kong-like tax code for D.C. because we have to do something radical to save the nation's capital. Many liberals in Washington knocked my head off, saying, 'There goes Jack Kemp again, trying to help the rich, only thinking of himself." Recently, D.C.'s Delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduced a Hong Kong-like tax code for the District of Columbia. A flat, 15 percent income tax for the whole city. She is an African-American and a liberal Democrat. She introduced my bill for D.C. within 24 hours. She called it "The Economic Recovery Act." With that kind of a strategy, how can the Left say that conservatives don't care about the welfare of the poorest among us?
<p>
Liberals have shown that they care by putting people on welfare. Conservatives have got to show people how to get off of it, and how to get into jobs and education and the type of opportunity for which we are working. Every single voter - regardless of color, regardless of residence - is a potential consumer you have to communicate with. If you understand your job, your product, and treat people with care and concern, even though they may not vote for you, you've done a service for conservatives. If we have a good product, conservatives ought to be able to sell it in any area and to anyone in the United States.
<p>
Conservatism and optimism are not mutually exclusive. I believe that successful candidates for public office in 1996 and beyond will be the ones who embrace policies and strategies that exhibit both of these qualities. It means advocating a message of hope and it means supporting ideas that will spur economic growth. How you execute your campaign, how you approach leadership, what your attitude is toward people is essential to the outcome. Does anybody doubt that? Whether it's a huddle, a home, a business, or politics, your attitude will determine the outcome of your endeavor. If you've got the right outlook, the willingness to succeed, and the love in your heart for this country, your message and the strength of your ideas will be more powerful than any army in the history of mankind.

<p>
<H2>Kirkpatrick: US Credibility</H2>
</center>
I am pleased to be at this Empower America event with all of you candidates who are running for office and hoping to turn good ideas into the policies of the United States, at the local, state and national level. I'm sure you're going to know what to do after you're elected: to implement the policies that create free people, that strengthen free people, that expand and protect freedom, and that encourage the ingenuity, enterprise and energy that free people apply in situations where initiative and enterprise are permitted to prevail.
<p>
Our foreign policy is - always and inevitably - an expression of our government and our society, our will and our purpose, as is every government's foreign policy an expression of the morality and purposes of that society and that government. Policies of a government are not likely to be much better than the quality of its government - at least not for long. This is especially so in national security matters, where credibility depends directly on the government's strength and also its will. I firmly believe that American credibility, and the appreciation of our strength and our purpose, is our most important asset in the conduct of foreign affairs and national security. I believe the Clinton Administration has been squandering American credibility, power, reputation and respect in the world. I think our credibility has declined along with our military strength. There is a very real correlation - it is an unfortunate correlation when you are weak, and a fortunate one when you are strong - between strength and respect. We have been the strongest government and country in the world. We probably still are the strongest country in the world, but we are a good deal less strong than we were four or five years ago. We are a good deal less strong than we were when the Berlin Wall came down. We are a good deal less strong than we were when Bill Clinton was inaugurated.
<p>
When our credibility suffers, those leaders contending for ultimate power, in, for example, China, are strengthened. Those most likely to use force, like firing missiles to threaten Taiwan, are strengthened. And when our credibility suffers, North Korean dictators, like Kim Jong II, are more likely to violate the demilitarized zone, and more likely to offer new challenges to South Korea and other neighbors. And when American credibility suffers, the governments of countries like Iran, Syria and Libya are greatly encouraged.
<p>
We are becoming less strong because our military - our forces and our weapons, our research and development - are being permitted to decline by the refocusing of attention and reallocation of resources in the Defense Department. Generals in the Defense Department are confessing, reluctantly, to committee chairmen in the House National Security Committee that the level and rate of procurement which the Administration is providing for our future is not adequate to provide for our future. The military will be short of a good many things that we need. Already training budgets have been displaced by what are thought to be more urgent needs. Our armed forces' spare parts budgets have been raided for what are thought to be more urgent needs. And our research and development is just simply neglected.
<p>
The Clinton Administration has doggedly declined to invest in a missile defense for the United States, not facing the fact that if we don't develop a missile defense, we will not be able to help anyone else defend themselves against missiles either. Apparently, it occurred to the President recently that Israel might need some help with missile defense, and announced that the United States would assume that responsibility. The fact that some systems exist for missile defense comes from the research and development that was undertaken in the Reagan Administration. This was for a much larger missile defense program, one which would be able to defend you and the citizens you hope will vote for you, one to protect and defend the whole country. Unfortunately, Bill Clinton has shut down almost all of this program in the last three years. One hopes that he will reconsider missile defense for the United States.
<p>
This President is not oriented toward thinking about defense. He is not oriented toward providing for American strength. He is, in fact, reluctant to think about strength. The whole Administration is reluctant to think about strength, including even the Defense Department, of all the places to be reluctant to think about strength. The President and the Administration, the Secretary of Defense, have gone forth into the world again and again, carrying a very large carrot to deal with very disagreeable dictators, like Kim Jong II of North Korea, like Syria's Assad, like Fidel Castro, like some of the Chinese some of the time.
<p>
I believe that the decline in our credibility has already produced unfortunate experiences, such as the shooting down of American planes and the murder of American pilots over international waters near Cuba. Even though our media kept talking about Cuban exiles, those were American citizens flying very small, unarmed, American planes, which were shot down near Cuba. And what happened after they were shot down, unprovoked, these unarmed planes which had done no harm to anyone? What happened? Actually what happened, of course, was nothing happened. Nothing at all, there was no retribution of any kind. I don't know what Ronald Reagan would have done in that situation. But the point is, we don't know because Fidel Castro wouldn't have done something like that when Ronald Reagan was president. Muammar Khaddafi did something like it when Ronald Reagan was President, and he found out what Ronald Reagan would have done. <p>
The fact is that when America is strong and America is purposeful, and we stand with democracies, and we stand with freedom, we strengthen peoples and countries who share our values. The whole world profits. When our strength declines, and our credibility, strength and purpose are questioned by thugs, the world becomes more dangerous.

<H2>Candidate School Sets Out Fall Course</H2>
</center>
The notion that "ideas have consequences" is central to the work and mission of Empower America, and was at the core of Empower America's 1996 Candidate School held on April 29th in Washington, D.C. Candidates and campaign strategists from local, state and national races in twenty-four states met with Empower America's Co-Directors and leading policy experts for a detailed discussion of the issues that are central to the 1996 elections.
<p>
In his welcoming remarks, Empower America Co-Director Vin Weber told the candidates, "Our organization was founded in order to bring important political ideas to the forefront of our national debate, where they can be vigorously deliberated and acted upon. Empower America's candidate training school and briefing book are just one part of that broad effort. Our intention is to reach beyond the necessary issues of campaign management (i.e., polling, fundraising, advertising and organization) to the <i>intellectual</i> content of the political process. Our ambitious goal is to help seed the national political debate with substantive thought. We believe it is that dedication to ideas and issues that distinguishes this instruction."
<p>
The seminar was opened by Empower America Co-Director Jack Kemp, who spoke of unleashing America's economic potential. The path to the American dream must be opened, said Kemp, by reforming the tax code; removing barriers to work, savings and investment; and by opening the possibilities for all citizens to gain access to capital and credit.
<p>
Jack Kemp's remarks were followed by a panel of economic policy experts discussing three of the most significant reforms necessary for economic growth. Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation offered a detailed discussion of tax reform; Mike Horowitz of the Hudson Institute described the need for tort and regulatory reform; and John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis (N.C.P.A.) addressed a topic that is about to become a leading economic and political issue: the privatization of Social Security.
<p>
A second panel, entitled <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>, tackled the fragmentation of American society. Stuart Anderson of the Cato Institute described the benefits of legal immigration and the unwise nature of current anti-immigration initiatives; David Murray of Statistical Assessment Service offered an excellent explanation of the true nature of American "oneness" and the pitfalls of "multiculturalism"; and Brian Jones of the Center for New Black Leadership spoke of the social harm produced by preferential policies based on race and gender.
<p>
Panel three turned its attention to devolution of societal responsibilities from government to civil society, and the need to rebuild and strengthen community institutions. The speakers were three leaders in that effort Adam Meyerson of the Heritage Foundation, editor of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship;</i> Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a pioneer in community and individual self-help efforts; and Mike Gerson. policy director for Sen. Dan Coates, who spoke on behalf of the Senator's 19-point legislative program to strengthen civil society, the Project for American Renewal.
<p>
At lunch the candidates heard from former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick discussing foreign policy and the erosion of America's hard-earned credibility and worldwide leadership during the Clinton presidency.
<p>
Two afternoon panels instructed the participants on a wide range of domestic issues. and on the experiences of the 104th Congress . Domestic issues were covered by five of the top thinkers in their fields. John J. DiIulio covered crime; former assistant Drug Czar John P. Walters discussed drugs; Chester E. Finn of the Hudson Institute spoke on education; Merrill Matthews of the N.C.P.A.'s Center for Health Policy Studies reviewed health care; and the former Director of the U.S. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Douglas Besharov, spoke about welfare.
<p>
Three leaders of the Freshman class of the 104th Congress conducted a lively question and answer session during the final panel, informing the candidates from their own experience. Congresswoman Sue Myrick (9-NC), Congressman Sam Brownback (2-KS) and Congressman Dave McIntosh (2-IN) urged the attendees to join their "revolution" to reduce government and return power and responsibility to Americans.
<p>
The final remarks were delivered by Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett. Dr. Bennett spoke of the need for cultural and societal renewal in America, and of the forces and policies that have weakened our culture. His address wrapped up a day that several candidates described as bringing focus and a winning edge into their strategy. "So much good information." said a candidate for U.S. Senate, "I'd do it again."

<H2>EA Releases Influential lmmigration Study</H2>
</center>
At a recent press conference in Washington, DC, William Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study sponsored by Empower America about employment-based immigration. The report, <i>Employment-Based Immigration and High Technology: Issues and Recommendations,</i> examines the impact on the wages and employment opportunities of native-born Americans produced by the employment of foreign-born engineers and scientists.
<p>
The author of the study, Stuart Anderson, a visiting scholar at the Cato Institute, compiled data from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and conducted interviews with engineering and computer industry corporate leaders to determine if immigrants hurt job opportunities for American engineers and scientists, as is commonly believed. The study concluded that U.S. high tech companies hire foreign-born engineers and scientists because, in these highly specialized industries, they frequently possess unique skills and fill key technical niches in the U.S. Iabor force.
<p>
Foreign born high-tech employees are not paid less than their U.S. counterparts, which is also commonly believed. Indeed, data from the NAS show that the median salaries of foreign-born engineers and scientists are significantly <i>higher</i>, not lower, than their native-born counterparts who completed their Ph.Ds in the same year. Furthermore, the study demonstrates more generally that foreign-born engineers and immigrants play a significant role in creating jobs in the high technology fields through entrepreneurship and innovation.
<p>
Calling the study a "wakeup call," Dr. Bennett and Secretary Kemp called the report "a warning specifically to those who believe that scaling back on legal immigration will help the American worker. Friends of the American worker are by necessity defenders of immigration, for immigrants serve as a catalyst for economic growth. This study dispels the myth that employing immigrants displaces American workers."
<p>
The study was distributed to all the members of the U.S. Congress as they considered legislation aimed at curbing legal immigration. Empower America's role in shaping the final outcome of this legislation was significant. Provisions aimed at reducing employment-based immigration were eliminated from the Senate bill; and, ultimately, the Senate voted to split their immigration reform bill by considering legal and illegal immigration separately. Similarly, the House passed a bill that cracks down on illegal immigration, but rejected provisions that would have reduced legal immigration by nearly one-third.

<H2>EA Announces New Leadership</H2>
</center>
The Board of Directors of Empower America has appointed Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Weisel served as Acting Chairman when Steve Forbes took a leave of absence as EA's Chairman to run for President in the Fall of 1995.
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco one of the nation's leading securities firm. Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery Securities' annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million. Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and has served as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. ski team.
<p>
EA Co-Director Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream." Kemp continued, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works. He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success. His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice. Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited <i>Making Government Work A Conservative Agenda for the States</i>, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977. In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo - an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense and time-honored values. He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics. We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Steve Forbes will rejoin the Board of Directors and William Dal Col, Empower America's former President, will be working with Forbes while continuing to informally advise Empower America.
<p>
Nick Forstmann, Partner at Forstmann Little & Co., is Empower America's new Vice Chairman. He is a long-standing member of EA's Board of Directors.

<H2>Co-Directors Support Missile Defense</H2>
</center>
<i>The Defend America Act of 1996 (H.R. 3144) would mandate the development and deployment of a national missile defense by 2003 to protect all Americans against the threat of accidental or limited ballistic missile attack. Empower America Co-Directors Kirkpatrick, Kemp, Bennett, and Weber sent a letter to the entire House of Representatives urging that they vote in favor of this vital legislation. Excerpts from the letter follow:</i>
<p>
"Today, dozens of countries have or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. These include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, to name a few. Incredibly, America still has no defense against this threat. Even a single missile launched at our nation - whether deliberately or by accident - would have tragic consequences, and, if it were armed with a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, the results would be catastrophic.
<p>
The technology exists today to move forward with a limited ballistic missile defense that is able to protect Americans in all 50 states - and to do so at an affordable cost. The Defend America Act would make it clear that Americans will no longer remain hostage to unlawful states and the decisions of their unpredictable rulers.
<p>
The Clinton Administration still refuses to take our vulnerability to a missile attack seriously. The Administration has said it does not foresee missile threats to the United States emerging in the next 15 years. They ignore the still formidable Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and place an historically unwarranted faith in the intelligence community's ability to recognize Third World missile threats in a timely manner - before they materialize. Our underestimation of the scope and magnitude of Iraq's missile program prior to the Gulf War is proof enough of this.
<p>
It is crucial to ensure that all Americans have the protection they deserve against threats to their security. But today, Americans have no protection against ballistic missile attack. We therefore urge you, in the strongest terms, to vote for the Defend America Act."

<H2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</H2>
</center>
<b>About "Same-Sex" Marriage </b><br>
"I believe that overall, allowing same-sex marriages would do significant, long-term social damage...Recognizing the legal union of gay and Iesbian couples would represent a profound change in the meaning and definition of marriage..Marriage is not an arbitrary construct; it is an 'honorable estate' based on the different, complementary nature of men and women - and how they refine, support, encourage and complete one another. To insist that we maintain this traditional understanding of marriage is not an attempt to:put others down. It is simply an acknowledgment and celebration of our most precious and important social act....It is exceedingly imprudent to conduct a radical, untested and inherently flawed social experiment on an institution that is the keystone in the arch of civilization. That we have to debate this issue at all tells us that the arch has slipped."<br>
      William J. Bennett, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 21, 1996<p>

<b>About Expanding NATO</b><br>
"Support for the admission to NATO of Eastern European democracies has been growing in Washington. A bill for which bipartisan support is expected has been drafted in the House International Relations Committee calling for NATO 'at early date' to include, at a minimum, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.... There is no spirit of Munich here. The bill's authors believe - as I believe - that it is about time that the new democracies begin to enjoy the full benefits of freedom, including credible security. Should such a bill be acted on before the Russian elections? Will it damage Yeltsin's chances - as some have argued? I think not. A weak, timid West would be far more damaging. Yeltsin and the Russian democrats will win if it is clear that the resurgent communist/fascist spirit cannot prevail. Enlarging NATO will send just that message."<br>
      Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>New York Post,</i> April 10, 1996<p>

<b>About a Flat Tax for Washington, DC</b><br>
"Our nation's macro economy is a democratic-capitalist economy based on private property and rewards for productive human activity. However, we also have a concurrent, micro economy that is almost a Third World socialist welfare state...and nowhere is it better illustrated than in our nation's capital, Washington, DC.... Spending cuts and fiscal restraints must be an integral part of any plan to relieve the current financial burden and restore credibility to the nation's capital. But we believe the most important step is for the District government and Congress to fully embrace the proposal to reinvigorate the District announced last month by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. Norton has introduced the DC Economic Recovery Act, also known as a progressive flat tax plan, which will create much needed jobs, expand the tax base and serve as a great enticement to middle-class families to come back home to Washington."<br>
      Jack Kemp, with DC Council member Kevin P. Chavous, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About Stable Money</b><br>
"Businesses bringing their goods and services to the international market place should not have to contend with unpredictable exchange rate fluctuations that transform legitimately earned profits into currency losses. What is necessary in today's global economy is not a European Monetary Union so much as a viable plan for international monetary reform aimed at serving the needs of an open world economy dedicated to free trade."<br>
      Judy Shelton, EA Board Member, <i>Wall Street Journal Europe,</i> April 25, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Reform</b><br>
"What's truly driving voter frustration is a desire for clarity - for sharp-edge, distinct alternatives on how to move the country ahead...instead of beginning our debate by arguing over what appears on Page 6,743 of the tax code, why not begin on Page One? If we're sincere about wanting the public to participate in the debate over tax reform, shouldn't we start deciding whether we want to keep the current system we have?"<br>
      Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman and Member of the Tax Reform
      Commission, <i>Washington Times,</i> April 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About "Rap Rubbish"</b><br>
"A question for parents: What would you do if you discovered that someone was encouraging your sons to kill people indiscriminately, to find fun in beating and raping girls, and to use the word 'motherf---er' at least once in every sentence?" <br>
      William J. Bennett, Joe Lieberman and C. DeLores Tucker, <i>USA Today,</i> June
      6, 1996

<H2>Rapping Obscene Music, Empower America Launches "Round Two" in Values Campaign </H2>
</center>
On May 30, Empower America launched "Round Two" of the campaign against obscene and harmful music Iyrics being produced and marketed by major entertainment companies. Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett announced the venture at a joint press conference in Washington, DC, with Senator Joe Lieberman (CT), and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women.
<P>
In this second round of the ongoing campaign, Dr. Bennett, Senator Lieberman, Dr . Tucker and Senator Sam Nunn (GA) released a radio ad calling on five of the largest music companies to end their involvement with degrading and indefensible music Iyrics. The ad targets music that glorifies murder and drug use, and that celebrates the beating and raping of women. The companies named in the ad and at the press conference are Time Warner, as well as foreign-owned Sony of Japan, Thorn EMI of Great Britain, PolyGram (owned by Philips Electronics) of the Netherlands, and Bertelsmann of Germany. The ad is airing on both national and local talk shows.
<P>
Listeners who hear the ad are encouraged to call Empower America's hotline to add their names to a petition being sent to the companies. The goal is to reach as many people as possible, who will, in turn. contact these companies and ask them to reconsider their support for this music.
<P>
Time Warner, the target of Empower America's first campaign against obscene music,took a positive step with their sale of Interscope Records last September. However, since that time, they have not limited their production and distribution of offensive music on some of their other labels. As a result, Empower America is again calling on Time Warner, as well as the other four foreign-owned corporations, to refuse to sponsor this cultural rot.
<P>
Prior to the press conference announcing the campaign, letters were sent to the heads of the corporations, and to their American subsidiaries, asking them to "make normative judgments about what is acceptable to produce and market" and calling on the corporations to "refuse to sponsor this vicious, vulgar music."
<P>
Empower America plans to continue efforts to focus scrutiny on obscene music Iyrics, and to ask major corporations to refuse to sponsor garbage. Said Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, "We are going to continue to put the heat and light on these guys...We're in it for the duration."

<H2>Virtue on Public Television This Fall</H2>
</center>
William Bennett's highly acclaimed anthology, The Book of Virtues, is being brought to life in a new, fully animated television series: "Adventures from The Book of Virtues." The new television show will premier in the fall on PBS.
<P>
Produced by PorchLight Entertainment in association with KCET in Los Angeles, "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will air during prime time on PBS stations nationwide for three consecutive evenings, beginning on Labor Day, 1996. The series draws its themes from Dr. Bennett's collection of classic American stories, Greek mythology, European fairy tales, African fables, Asian folk tales, Native American legends and Bible stories.
<P>
The characters and stories in each adventure will exemplify the traits of good character and depict the virtues illustrated in the The Book of Virtues, which has sold over two million copies. Many well-known Hollywood stars will be lending their voices to the heroic characters and villains in the series.
<P>
William Bennett has been highly critical of network programs aimed at our nation's youth and believes that the way to respond to poor television programming is either to turn the television off or to try to put something on that will lift up spirits and minds. Dr. Bennett is hopeful that "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will add some much needed lift to family viewing time.
<P>
<B>Call your local PBS outlet for viewing times on Labor Day.</B>

<FONT SIZE=5>Bennett: Educating America on Crime<BR>
</center>
</FONT>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America's William Bennett was recently named
co-chair of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America. The commission
will present hard data to educate both the public and the media
on the nature and extent of the crime problem in the United States,
and identify policies and initiatives that protect citizens and
promote justice. Dr. Bennett co-chairs the Council on Crime with
Griffin B. Bell, who was Attorney General in the Carter Administration.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Council on Crime's first report, The State of
Violent Crime in America, generated widespread media attention.
It revealed that despite the recent drop in crime rates in certain
cities, the dangers law-abiding citizens face are near an all-time
high. These dangers are compounded by the reality of &quot;revolving
door&quot; justice which allows criminals to walk free on probation,
parole or pre-trial release. In fact, one out of every three convicted</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> criminals is under the &quot;supervision&quot; of
the justice system at the very time they commit more murders,
rapes and other violent crimes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This study paints a realistic and sobering
picture of violent crime in America,&quot; Bennett said, &quot;but
it is not without its rays of hope. If the success that cities
such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American
people is right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement
is a necessary part of the solution.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council's report also corrects some of the misinformation
about criminal justice spread by the popular press. For example,
the widespread myth that too many people are imprisoned in America
is refuted by the Council' s finding that only one criminal for
every 100 violent crimes actually goes to jail. Evidence that
over 90 percent of all state prisoners have been violent criminals
or are recidivists dispell inaccurate reports that prisons are
populated with nonviolent offenders. And the report presents calculations
which demonstrate that imprisoning violent offenders saves dollars
as well as lives: a single rape costs its victim and society an
average of $87,000 - many times greater than the cost of
keeping a rapist in prison for a year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This is an important report,&quot; Bennett
noted, &quot;it is rigorous, toughminded, and common-sensical.
It provides important information on the nature of the crime problem
in the United States. But more importantly, it points to the problems
in the American justice system that can be fixed, and if fixed,
can and will save lives. I am convinced that the first and fundamental
responsibility of government is protecting the citizenry. It is
the key provision in the social contract. And there is simply
no way that civil society can flourish if there is lawlessness
in the streets.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council on Crime will be holding several grassroots
hearings across the nation over the next several months to highlight
innovative policies and citizen initiatives to counteract crime.
The final report, which will offer policy prescriptions to cut
crime, increase the effectiveness and responsiveness of the criminal
justice system, and promote citizen safety will be issued in the
summer of 1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Along with Bennett and Bell, other Council members
include Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, former U.
S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney General Robert
Butterworth, Princeton Professor John DiIulio, California Prison
Commissioner John Gillis, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith
and Colorado Attorney General Gail Norton. H</FONT>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kemp: Flatter, Fairer Tax System Urged<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>In January of 1996, the National Commission on Economic
Growth and Tax Reform issued a comprehensive report to Congress
and the country. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich created the Commssion last year to analyze the current
system and develop proposals for an entirely new tax system. Empower
America Co-Director Jack Kemp was appointed Chairman of the Commission.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The &quot;Kemp Commisson&quot; held hearings throughout
the country to learn the views of the American people about the
current tax system and their ideas for a new tax system. The Kemp
Commission found that the current tax code is far too complex,
intrusive and unfair, and is, in effect, a dead weight on the
American economy. As stated in the report, <i>Unleashing America's
Potential: A Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax System for the 21st Century:</i>
&quot;We believe the current tax code cannot be revised, should
not be reinvented, and must not be retained. Therefore, the commission
is unanimous: It is time to throw out the seven-million word mess
of tax laws and regulations and begin a new.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Commissioners outlined six working principles
they believe a tax code must have to ensure that the system is
fair while accurately reflecting and fostering the high ideals
of the American democratic-republic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> These principles include: <i><b>fairness</b></i>, treating citizens
equally before the law;<i> <b>simplicity</b></i>; making compliance as easy as possible;
<b><i>neutrality</i></b>, so that people and not government make the choices;
<b><i>
stability</b></i>, so that people can accurately plan for their futures;
and <b><i>visibility</b></i>, so citizens will have an honest sense of the true
cost of government. The Commission also stressed that <b><i>economic
growth</i></b> must not be inhibited by the tax code.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With these firm principles anchoring the Commission's
vision, it offered recommendations for a new tax system to stimulate
a vigorous national debate about how best to change the current
system. The Commission proposed a low, single-rate of taxation
with a generous personal exemption&Ntilde;to remove those people
least able to bear a tax burden from the tax rolls. Such a system
would remove the biases against work, saving, and investment present
in the current system's double, triple, and quadruple taxation
of income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another major recommendation was to make payroll
taxes fully deductible for working men and women. And it recommended
abolishing separate taxation of capital gains.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Addressing the current pattern of a constantly changing
tax code, the Commission also strongly recommended a 2/3 super
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> majority vote in Congress be required to increase
tax rates in the future. This will provide a measure of stability
in the tax system so people and businesses can better plan future
savings and investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Secretary Kemp and other members of the Tax Reform
Commission recently testified before the Senate Finance Committee
where they outlined the very real and substantial problems with
the current system and strongly advocated the creation of a new
tax system for a new millennium, one that accomodates the new
information age and stimulates technological revolution.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tax reform will be a key issue in the 1996 elections,
and many candidates have endorsed the single-rate model outlined
by the Kemp Commission. The dissatisfaction with the current code
is producing a groundswell of support for radical tax reform.
The Kemp Commission made a substantial contribution to this rising
tide of change by providing the philosophical justification for
a new, single-rate tax system for America's 21st century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fourteen Commissioners came from large and small
business sectors, academia, and the public sector. Empower America'
s Founding Chairman, Ted Forstmann, served as one of the Commissioners.

<FONT SIZE=3>Kirkpatrick: Facts on National Security<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America Co-Director and former US Ambassador
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick has taken issue with President
Bill Clinton's State of the Union (SOTU) assertion that his administration
has &quot;enhanced the security of the American people.&quot;
In a series of recent speeches and articles, Ambassador Kirkpatrick,
who is also a syndicated columnist, stated that &quot;almost everything
President Clinton said in his State of the Union address concerning
foreign policy is misleading, much simply untrue.&quot; Some major
national security issues which merit examination include:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>National Missile Defense</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton's statement that &quot;for the
first time, since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian
missiles pointed at American children&quot; is misleading, as
it ignores the overwhelming need to defend the United States from
attack by ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The evidence that rogue regimes hostile to the United
States - such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea - are undertaking
extraordinary efforts to acquire advanced missile and weapons
technology is overwhelming. Two years ago, then-CIA Director James
Woolsey testified to the Congress, &quot;More than twenty-five
countries, many of them hostile to the United States and our friends
and allies, may now have or are developing nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons, and the means to deliver them.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton vetoed the Defense Bill on December
29, 1995, in large part because he objected to the Congressional
increase in ballistic defense program funding and mandate to deploy
the defense system by 2003. In his veto message, Mr. Clinton argued
that deploying this defense system would violate the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States and the former
Soviet Union. As EA Co-Directors Jeane Kirkpatrick and Jack Kemp
wrote to Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC), Chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, last fall: &quot;The ABM Treaty, designed
for a bipolar world, always had dubious value. It is now wholly
outdated .... It dismays us that instead of focusing on our current
needs, opponents of ballistic missile defense worry about outdated
arms control treaties with countries that no longer exist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of missile defenses today is technologically
and economically feasible. We can speak and act with confidence
in the world only when we can defend ourselves.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is interesting to note that public opinion polling
and focus groups indicate that most Americans are unaware that
the United States is unprotected from ballistic missile attack,
and believe this capability already exists. When they learn this
is not the case, they support national missile defense. President
Clinton did not mention the need to develop this defense capability
in his State of the Union speech. But as Ambassador Kirkpatrick
has said repeatedly, &quot;This is the most important issue in
defense policy for our times.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Bosnia</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a candidate for the presidency more than three
years ago, Bill Clinton pledged to use air strikes and lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims so they could defend
themselves against Serb aggression. Instead, in recent testimony
before the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that &quot;more than two and
one half million have been displaced from their homes in this
war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration camps, torture, mass
rape and mass murder have become familiar again in the region.&quot;
President Clinton's State of the Union assertion that &quot;we
stood for peace in Bosnia&quot; - while, as Ambassador
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> Kirkpatrick wrote, &quot;prisoners starved, young
men died, war and refugees spread across the country - is
shameless.&quot; Had President Clinton kept his campaign promise
to help the victims of aggression defend themselves, 25,000 U.S.
troops may not have had to spend this past Christmas enforcing
a tenuous peace agreement in Bosnia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Clinton's Use of Force</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton said that he has kept our military
strong, and has used force &quot;only where we must.&quot; But
as Ambassador Kirkpatrick has written, &quot;In truth, the Clinton
administration has not used force only when it must.&quot; In
Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, it used force when other policies would
have been equally or more effective, and the expressed goals for
these military interventions have not been achieved. &quot;A 'proud
nation' was not constructed in Somalia; 'democracy' was not restored
in Haiti; Bosnians were not protected from ethnic cleansing.&quot;
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>
Neglecting Major Powers</b><BR> 
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2>Ambassador Kirkpatrick also cites the Clinton administration's
neglect of relations with major powers. &quot;Here,&quot; she
writes, &quot;there is a sad contrast to the Bush administration,
which focused on building and enhancing US relations with Western
Europe, Japan, China, Russia. All these relations have now deteriorated.
The President - off in pursuit of unconventional goals - is
neglecting the store.&quot; </FONT>

<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America and the Heritage Foundation recently
co-hosted the 1996 &quot;Congressional Advance&quot; for many
conservative freshman Members of the House of Representatives.
The Congressional Advance, held on January 25-26 in Baltimore,
marked the one-year anniversary of last year's Congressional Retreat,
which introduced the new conservative Members of Congress to Capitol
Hill. The Congressional Advance, like the Retreat, provided an
important forum to help the freshman Members plan the enactment
of a conservative agenda. Empower America CoDirector William Bennett
delivered the keynote address entitled &quot;The Republican Revolution:
The Next Steps.&quot; The conference also included panels on &quot;Government
Downsizing,&quot; &quot;Empowering Citizens,&quot; and &quot;Strengthening
America' s Families and Culture.&quot; More than fifty Members
of Congress attended the Advance, including several sophomore
Members of Congress.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Gallup Poll Finds Public Still Wants Tough Drug Control
Policy<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><i>According to a recent Gallup Poll, Americans still
view drug abuse as one of the most serious issues facing the country
in spite of decreasing public discussion by the media about the
&quot;war on drugs.&quot; Fully 94 percent of poll respondents
ranked the drug problem second only to violent crime. William
Bennett, former director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (&quot;Drug Czar&quot;) under President George Bush, was
invited by the Gallup organization to review the polling results
and comment on their implications for public policy. His remarks follow.</i>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<center><FONT SIZE=2>Statement by</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>WILLIAM J. BENNETT</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>to accompany the release of the Gallup Poll</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>December 12, 1995<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Toward the close of my tenure as Secretary of Education,
in a speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free 
America, I called for a &quot;transformation of government
policy to match, and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;
I was referring to the public' s recognition that drug use was
no longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but
a personal, medical and economic catastrophe. That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to 1992 - with
real results. Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war. But public sentiment, as this Gallup Poll attests,
has not changed. Americans still want a tough and decisive
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> drug control policy with the federal government rightfully
leading the fight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine
in ten Americans seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that
the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.
Americans should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use
among adolescents is once again on the rise after the steady and
dramatic decline of the 1980s and early 1990s. According to the
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
&quot;the jump in marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals
that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their
lifetime. Of that number, about
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts.&quot;
More bad news is that drug related hospital emergency-room cases -
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts - have
reached the highest levels since 1978. Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>What Americans have witnessed - and reacted
to in the Gallup Poll - is the result of a failure of public
policy brought about by a moral torpor on the drug issue. Policy
follows attitude. But the public' s attitude is not one of indifference
toward the scourge. When asked what they wanted to see <i>a lot more</i>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <i>two-thirds</i> cited reduction
of the supply of drugs coming into the United States. By contrast,
<i>fewer than 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>half</i> - 43 percent - asked for more treatment
programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot;
presents a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support
it received in the Gallup Poll. Unlike the effective and modest
treatment programs sponsored by churches and using variants of
the 12-step method, thc government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly
wasteful and ineffective. From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment
spending almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment
slots actually declined. And the discouraging result is that overall
cocaine treatment is not significantly reducing the population
of hard core addicts. We must 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>turn our support toward the proven models of treatment,
while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine and crack addiction
as yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use
by the young - the first step on the path to addiction - is
so important.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gallup Poll respondents put drug interdiction high
on their list - the percentage of those calling for increased
efforts to reduce the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was
88 percent. Those respondents are right - the government
should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of
illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control
over the entire interdiction</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> process. We know that strong interdiction works.
In 1989, the U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down
on the cocaine cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking
and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from
the Andean countries north. These events 
produced substantial disruption in the cocaine supply
to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991. Drugs were less available on
the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined; reported
cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy users
fell; and casual use dropped dramatically. Today, U.S. foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated. We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict
people for the use 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents. Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America. The response is wise on both counts.
Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels. The federal role requires 
the identification and dismantling of all major drug
trafficking organizations known to be operating in the U.S. Law
enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are state
and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should
be block granted without mandates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose
legalization of drugs send a strong message to those who would
propose such an option. Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not
dangerous and threatening to society because they are illegal.
They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to
American society. Any relaxation 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible. On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization - and
the overwhelming body of the American people who reject such a
policy of despair. In the Gallup Poll, the people have again made
that point.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Success in the drug war depends above all on what
happens in America' s homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations,
television and movie screens, city streets and civic halls. It
depends on the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy, police chiefs,
judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush' s &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better. I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is, we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Gallup organization has given us <i>A 1996 View
of The Drug Problem in America</i>. That view clearly shows that the
American people also understand what needs to be done and are
ready to renew the fight.</font>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>EA to Host Spring Candidate School<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Building on the success of EA's efforts in 1994 to
inform candidates for office about Empower America's political
message, EA Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William Bennett, and Jeane
Kirkpatrick invite 1996 candidates to join them in Washington,
DC on Monday, April 29 for Empower America's 1996 Candidate School.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Educating candidates for local, state and national
office is one of EA's most important functions. While most candidate
schools concentrate on the nuts and bolts of running for office,
Empower America's training is devoted entirely to a discussion
of issues and their philosophical and political foundations. The
EA messages of economic opportunity, cultural renewal and international
leadership are stressed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the day-long event, a variety of political
instructors will address the attendees:
individual leaders, policy experts, political
analysts and elected officials. EA will bring together the best
thinkers and the best ideas to help each candidate form a solid
base of information and craft a winning message. Another valuable
component of the sessions is to learn from participating candidates
about issues and concerns being raised by citizens in their districts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As in 1994, Empower America will prepare a detailed
candidate briefing book for all participants, and will make the
book available to candidates who are unable to attend.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994 Empower America worked with candidates for
office ranging from local school boards to the U.S. Senate. &quot;Graduates&quot;
include some of the leading &quot;revolutionaries&quot; of the
104th Congress - Congressmen Joe Scarborough (FL), Bob Barr
(GA), Ron Lewis (KY), Dick Chrysler (MI), Phil English (PA) and
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. Jack Kemp, William Bennett
and Jean Kirkpatrick look forward to exchanging ideas with the
1996 candidates who want to become better informed about Empower
America' s policy agendas.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For further information, write: Candidate School,
Empower America, 1776 I St., NW, Washington, DC 20006, or call
202-452-8200, or 1-800-761-2044. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Campaign Tackles Trash TVTalk Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ads aimed at shows' advertisers having effect<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the past several months, Empower America Co-director
William Bennett has been involved in a public campaign with Senators
Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Sam Nunn (D-GA) to focus scrutiny on
certain 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>daytime television talk shows. The campaign has resonated
strongly with the American people, many of whom have contacted
Empower America to express their relief that someone has finally
given voice to the concerns they have about the filth paraded
on television.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Consider the subjects discussed on a number of talk
shows during the past year, according to <i>Electronic Media </i>(April, 1995):
a l3 year old discussing her sexual experiences which began when
she was 10; a male guest admitting to sleeping with his girlfriend's
mother; a woman claiming to have been impregnated while making
a 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>pornographic movie; or the following titles: &quot;Sex
Caught on Tape,&quot; and &quot;I'm Marrying a 14-year Old Boy.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clearly, shows such as these cross the line of decency.
They celebrate the perverse, and they normalize trashy behavior.
The campaign against trash television is based on the premise
that companies should stop their support of this kind of demeaning,
degrading content. And if they continue their support, they should
be able to justify publicly what they are doing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The campaign has had a number of different components.
Dr. Bennett and Senator Lieberman have written letters to the
heads of major corporations - Sony, Tribune, Time Warner,
National Amusements, King World, Gannett - which own the
companies that produce the shows, asking them to reconsider their
support of trash television, and questioning whether profits these
companies derive from such degrading, valueless products are really
worth it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, advertisers have been targeted
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>for their support of trash talk television.
On December 7, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman and Nunn unveiled
a television ad calling on major advertisers to stop sponsoring
cultural rot, and asking them to reconsider
their support of these programs. There are
indications that some of them already have: Sears Roebuck, Unilever
NV, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Mars Inc. have said they are withdrawing
advertising from some of these programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>And on January 22, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman
and Nunn called on the owners of local stations to use their influence
to take the trash out of talk TV, with an open letter that ran
in the daily newsletter of the annual conference of the National
Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the campaign began, we've had evidence from
a number of quarters that the tide is turning. Not only have some
advertisers pulled out, but a number of shows have been canceled.
Several station managers in 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>California and in Colorado have decided to discontinue
airing shows they deem unacceptable. And a January poll by <i>Broadcasting
&amp; Cable</i> of TV general managers shows that 83 percent agree
that talk shows are purveyors of &quot;sleazy, tasteless subject
matter with little if any redeeming value.&quot; And the new shows
being offered up for next year focus less on sensationalism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Viewers also have a responsibility. Instead of simply
lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need
to take action. While turning off these shows, or requesting companies
to 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>stop producing this kind of material won't eradicate
all of the garbage on our television screens, it will make an
important step toward relegating this trash to the sidelines,
and out of the mainstream. And so the campaign continues to petition
men and women of good will - viewers, sponsors, producers - to
do something about it. </FONT>

to have more respect for peoples' privacy. Here is indecent exposure
as a virtue. And it used to be the fact that if you had failures

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We laid out a philosophical framework for revising
the tax code for the twenty-first century. And we suggested quite
specifically that the tax rate should be a single rate with a
large exemption for low-income people to remove the burden that
a woman or man would face as they take the first two or three
rungs in the ladder. And we came out specifically for the deduction
of the payroll tax, which is a huge burden on working men and
women throughout this country. That's to make the system fairer.&quot;

<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America is making an impact! In this important
political year, when American citizens and candidates will be
participating in the long process which will culminate in the
selection of America's president and Congress, Empower America's
ideas and issues have become an essential part of the debate.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Whether the issue is a flatter, fairer tax; crime,
drugs and television trash talk shows; or U.S. military forces
in Bosnia and the need for national missile defense - Empower
America's ideas are shaping the agenda. We urge Empower America
Associates to get even more involved in the days ahead. There
is so much to be done, and each of you has an important role to
play.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Re-ordering the size and scope of government in our
nation and in our lives is an immense project. By attending your
local town meetings, writing letters to your elected representatives
and the editor of your local newspaper, calling in on radio talk
shows, meeting with your neighbors and discussing the issues,
you can make sure that your concerns and your ideas are heard.
And by doing so, you demonstrate the most fundamental tenet of
our shared beliefs: that individual citizens, not government,
are responsible for setting the nation's priorities and deciding
how best they are met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We have never been better positioned to make a difference.
In January 1996, Empower America celebrated its third birthday.
In this short time, we have established an organization unlike
any in Washington today. The energy, commitment and involvement
of Empower America's Co-Directors and grassroots Associates have
made us a formidable team. Like you, Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and
Jeane Kirkpatnck share a positive vision of America's future.
Our shared belief in economic growth and opportunity, social and
cultural renewal, and strong international leadership can lead
a vibrant Amenca into the twenty-first century and the information
age.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Your continued involvement and commitment are essential.
and we are grateful for your support and activism.<BR>

<H3>"Beyond the Contract: The Next Steps"</H3>
Speech by Rep. Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House
</CENTER>
<p>
MAY 9,1995, WASHINGTON, DC-- This is V-E Day, and there is a parallel about which we need to be aware. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that our generation has a rendezvous with destiny. He was referring to dealing with Italy, Japan and Germany. That generation ultimately, reluctantly, rose to that challenge, driven in part by Pearl Harbor, and ultimately succeeded.
<p>
We then had a rendezvous with destiny in containing the Soviet empire until it collapsed. For 45 years we did that. We led the largest worldwide coalition in history, and we sustained forces against the Soviet empire far longer than anybody thought a democracy could. So we've won two enormous victories on the world scene in the last two generations.
<p>
The surprising thing, I think, is that our current rendezvous with destiny is here at home. We have to renew American civilization because if it continues to decay, we will literally be incapable of being effectivein the world and the world market.
<p>
The situation is very grave. It is obvious to all of you if you watch any local television news anywhere in the country, that we have a level of violence, a level of decay, a level of brutality which is not sustainable in a free society. I've often said that you can't maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, with 15-yearolds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, with 18-yearolds getting diplomas they can't even read. And all four of those things are happening in our country.
<p>
There is much more to do. For starters, we will be building on the success of the Contract. We adopted the Contract last summer and fall. We stood on the Capitol steps in September and introduced it to the American people; then we based our campaigns on it. We ran a TV Guide ad that had no negatives, no attack on Bill Clinton and no antiDemocratic rhetoric. It just said, "Give us a chance, here's what we'll do," and outlined the Contract With America. We then got elected.
<p>
Starting the opening day, we kept our word. We passed nine reforms in a 14 hour opening day--the longest in United States history. We continued keeping our word. We brought up every item we said we would. We passed 30 out of 31 items. The only legislative item we lost from the Contract was term limits, where we got 85 percent voting "yes" from the Republican side, 82 percent voting "no" on the Democratic side, and because term limits require a Constitutional majority of 290, we couldn't get it to pass. In the first 93 days, we had a total of 302 recorded votes.
<p>
We're now looking at "where do we go from here?" I think the answer lies in three large projects at the vision level, and then, nine strategies. Let me very briefly run through these visions and strategies:
<p>
We have three major things we have to do. We've got to communicate to the American people that there is an American future that's better--better economic growth, better technology, better services, better opportunities, better safety--and we want to work with the American people to get to that better future.
<p>
Second, we have to have a dialogue. I think it's very important for us to go beyond just debating liberals. We have to have a dialogue with the American people. We have to get people engaged and talking about their future.
<p>
Out of that new vision of a successful America, and new dialogue with the American people, we want to establish a new partnership. Remember, this is not government-to-citizen, this is citizentocitizen. The Constitution begins, "We, the people of the United States," and what we've got to do is go back and reestablish that as a reality in everyone's life.
<p>
I also believe that if our children are going to compete in the world market they have to do a whole lot more homework than they've been doing. My guess is they've got to do probably two hours a night. I think we literally cheat them if they don't have enough homework to learn how to study, to acquire the information they must have in order to compete with Germany, Japan and China. However, I do not suggest that that means we need a "Federal Department of Homework Checkers." Instead, we need to reestablish a partnership where we expect parents to care about their children's education, and we make that a standard and a routine expectation.
<p>
This is why I believe that what we're doing is as much a cultural change as it is a political change. We are reasserting the core of American civilization. The road there is made up of nine strategies.
<p>
First, we have to renew American civilization. That means reasserting the work ethic, family, savings--all the core values that started with the notion that we're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. Remember that is the most radical statement of human rights in history--that power comes from God to you, and then you loan it to the government. The power doesn't come from God to the government.
<p>
Second, we need to be competitive in the world market. We get high economic growth by reestablishing a system in which entrepreneurs are encouraged to go out and compete, in which there are enough savings, and in which we're prepared to create American jobs through world sales. To do that we have to rethink litigation, regulation, taxation, education, the welfare system, and the bureaucratic structure of government, because we are not a competitive society today. If we want our children to have the best jobs on the planet with the highest take-home pay, it's going to take real effort.
<p>
Third, we have to accelerate moving into the information age. The fact is there are extraordinary opportunities out there, and we are doing too little to take advantage of them.
<p>
The fourth strategic change we need is to replace the welfare state with the opportunity society. We can design a volunteercentered, spiritually-centered replacement for the welfare state that dramatically improves the life of the poor. Every time you hear a liberal jump up to defend the current-system, just remember that what they're telling you is that they are prepared to use the children as the device to keep the bureaucracy. It is inexcusable what we do to poor children in the inner city. We have to replace the welfare state with an opportunity society.
<p>
Fifth, we have to decentralize power and disperse power. They are two different things. Decentralization gets it out of Washington; dispersing it gets it back to you. Ultimately, block grants are, in my mind, a first step toward a dramatic degovernmentalizing of America. One of the reasons we were so strongly for the $500 child tax credit was to make the flat assertion: "parents who earn it have a higher claim than bureaucrats who want to spend it," and that we want the money to stay with the parents, not go to a bureaucracy. That's a very different model of how you organize America.
<p>
Sixth, for the parts of government that we do keep, I think they should be the best in the world. I think our principle ought to be that if you're going to have a federal government it ought to be excellent. I am not anti-government. I think we need a lean, effective government. What we have today is a big, fat, sloppy, ineffective and weak government, incapable of setting priorities and incapable of doing well the things government should focus on.
<p>
Seventh, we should balance the budget. It is a practical matter, and I can give you the simple moral test. For most of American history we paid off the family mortgage and we left the children the farm. In this generation, we're gradually selling off the farm and leaving the children the mortgage. A child born this year will pay $187,000 in taxes in their lifetime, just to pay interest on the federal debt, that is $3,500 per working year just to pay interest. Interest on the debt will be larger than the cost of national security in 1997. That gives you some sense of scale. More and more, your taxes will go to pay interest to the bond-holders than will go to pay for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, intelligence agencies, and defense bureaucracies combined. Now, that is not sustainable, which is why I think we do have a profound challenge to balance the budget.
<p>
In addition, Medicare has its own freestanding problems. The Clinton Administration's Medicare Trustees reported that Medicare literally runs out of money by 2002. And when you look further into the future to when the baby boomers retire, it's dramatically worse. We have the challenge to be prepared to implement the reforms that are necessary to save Medicare now, and then to have a commission which will look at how you save Medicare in the baby boom years, which is a massively bigger challenge than trying to save it now.
<p>
Eighth, I think we have to have a strategy of safety for the American people. If your government can't protect you, then you have no constitutional liberties. We have an obligation to reassert and reestablish the legitimate right of every citizen, that they ought to be able to live without fear in a safe country which loves its children enough to protect them from the predators who right now dominate all too many of our streets.
<p>
Lastly, we have to have a strategy for leading the planet. We are the only country large enough, complex enough and strong enough to lead the human race. If in fact we allow our culture to collapse and our economy to decay, there is nobody who can replace us. If we can't do the first eight things in order to set ourselves up to be able to lead, and we collapse as leaders, you will in fact, I think, leave your children a dark and bloody planet. In that sense I think Chechnya and Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia are harbingers of the kind of future that could come if America grows weaker.
<p>
I think over the last couple of years that Empower America has been a very helpful part of this. I think that it really has given us a range of ideas. There is a whole series of things we've done over the last couple of years that I think have been very, very helpful. We can continue building this momentum; we need as many voices and as many systems out there as we can get that are educating, encouraging, and pushing in the same general direction. And so I appreciate very, very much the chance to be here with you today, and I thank you all very much for coming.

<H3>Empower America's Victory Against Time Warner</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America has scored an important victory on the cultural front. For the past several months, William J. Bennett, Co-director of Empower America, and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women, have been involved in a public campaign against offensive and misogynistic music Iyrics. They have targeted their efforts on Time Warner, one of the greatest perpetrators of this kind of cultural filth. This spring, Time Warner increased its investment in "gangsta rap" by expanding its stake to 50 percent of Interscope Records, the label behind such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, Nine Inch Nails, and Tupac Shakur. Such "artists" extol the rape, murder, and torture of women. Some of these Iyrics glorify sexual abuse and even celebrate the murder of police officers. Columnist John Leo called Time Warner's investment "the cultural equivalent of owning half the world's mustard gas factories."
<p>
As a result, Bennett and Tucker called on Time Warner's sense of corporate responsibility and citizenship to end their sDonsorshiD of such music. They asked Time Warner to stop producing music which was unworthy of human consumption or corporate support.
<p>
In May, Bennett and Tucker met with Time Warner executives to present their case. At that time, their appeal fell on deaf ears. Bennett and Tucker then expanded their efforts to include a television ad, press conferences in New York and Los Angeles, as well as radio and television programs. In addition, Dr. Bennett wrote to Gerald Levin, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and both Tucker and Bennett wrote letters to members of the Board of Directors of Time Warner, informing them of the kind of music Time Warner was involved in producing and distributing. In June, Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) joined Tucker and Bennett in a radio ad and press conference calling on Time Warner to exercise corporate responsibility.
<p>
The campaign has had strong resonance with the American public. The New York Times, The Wall Street Joumal, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Time, and Newsweek have all covered the story. Political figures from both parties, including President Clinton, and Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, have voiced their support for Empower America's efforts.
<p>
On September 27, Time Warner announced that it planned to sever its ties with Interscope Records, selling its 50% stake back to Interscope founders Ted Field and Jimmy Lovine--an indication that shame and a call to corporate responsibility do work. Dr. Bennett applauded Time Warner's decision, and said that the company was "acting like a leader" in its decision to sell Interscope. Said Bennett, "I congratulate them, they did the right thing. I hope this is a statement about a larger point--that there are some things so bad that no responsible company will market and sell them to our children."
<p>
Empower America will continue to monitor the fate of Interscope, to see which music company, if any decides to purchase it. If other major companies pick up Interscope, they will hear from us. We will continue to press our case against corporations which peddle filth as entertainment for children.

<H3>EA Letter To Our Readers</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
The level of change effected in the first session of the 104th Congress has been unprecedented. Members passed more bills and worked more hours than during any previous congress. The battle over the size of the federal budget and the scale of Washington's bureaucracy is being won by those who would cut the size and scope of government.
<p>
This coongress accomplished policy goals that the cynics and skeptics dismissed as impossible. Nine of the ten components of "The Contract with America" passed the House of Representatives during the first hundred days of the 104th Congress and were sent to the Senate for consideration. Many of those measures have now passed the
<p>
Senate, while others continue to move through the legislative process under the guidance of those who understand the rightful limits of federal power.
<p>
The majority of members elected in November, especially those serving their first term, are committed to the empowerment agenda. They believe that individuals --not the federal government--should make the choices that affect their own lives. They know that high taxes hurt families and businesses at all income levels.
<p>
We have many friends in Congress, but we must remain active. This puts us in a position to get things done. We are working with individuals who understand the ideas that are important to us and who can act to promote them.<p>

Continue to write your representatives in Congress. Attend local town meetings and other events that allow you to meet with your representatives and articulate your views on national issues. This focal point of American politics allows you to become active in the governing process at the grassroots level.
<p>
We greatly appreciate your continued support and activism.
<P>

<H3>Empower America On The Hill</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Co-directors and board members have-been busy and active with the new Congress. We have been working with the Congressional leadership since January of 1993 to advocate the principles we represent. The new 104th Congress has provided us with a heightened opportunity to work for change. Our Co-directors and board members have tes fied before numerous Congressional committees promoting the empowerment agenda. Following are some highlights from the testimonies of Jeanne Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, and Jack Kemp.
<p>
<b>Jeanne Kirkpatrick:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick spoke to the House Foreign Relations Committee on January 24, 1995 about "National Security and International Affairs in the Context of Cooperation and Limitation." She was one of the select foreign policy experts chosen to give remarks on stability and instability in the international arena, and policy directives America should pursue.
<p>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said, "I believe this Congress and the National Security Revitalization Act have arrived just in the nick of time. Our military forces are beginning to 'go hollow,' and are feeling the full impact of schedules and budgets which have left them over-deployed and undertrained, overworked and underpaid."
<p>
<b>William Bennett:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director William Bennett testified several times before the new Congress. Of particular interest were his remarks to the United States Senate Budget Committee on January 24, 1995. His testimony was in regard to the topic, "Governing in the 21st Century." The new Congress has the opportunity to change the role and enormous size of the federal government, which Dr. Bennett strongly advocates in part through a "radical devolution" of decision-making.
<p>
Dr. Bennett told the committee, ":..it is critical to take a step back and establish once again a clear delineation of government's role. We need to articulate once again the proper responsibilities and limits of government--things like providing for the defense of the nation, waging war, building infrastructure projects, administering transfer payments, keeping the streets safe, and the like."
<p>
<b>Jack Kemp:</b>
<p>
Jack Kemp testified before the Senate Small Business Committee on October 19th in support of Senators Abraham and Lieberman's enterprise zone bill. The bill, entitled "The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995," is closely patterned after Kemp's -bill from the 80's.
<p>
i In his testimony, Kemp pointed out, "How can we possibly begin to address the problems of crime, drugs, and education without first recognizing that without jobs and opportunity, there is little hope and few reasons to graduate from school, stay off drugs, and resist the underground economy? Without the expectation that there is a good job waiting out of college or high school, there will be no link between effort and reward, and no way to address fully the social pathologies that are all too prevalent in our inner cities."
<p>
Kemp went on to say that "over the past several years, the federal government has created an economic climate in America that is indifferent at best, and hostile at worst, to the agents of economic growth. Washington now imposes a vast array of income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, regulations, and mandated benefits that encourage businesses to keep employees to an absolute minimum. Today, the combined tax and regulatory burden on risktaking-- the process by which new enterprises and jobs are created-- has climbed to the levels of the early 1980s."

<H3>Kemp Heads National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp was chosen to chair the newly formed <a href="http://www.townhall.com/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich appointed Kemp to lead the eight member commission in proposing a new economic pratform.
<p>
The goals of the new commission are ambitious and sweeping. Senator Dole charged the commission with moving "beyond tax reform toward a complete overhaul of the entire tax system." He added, "that's why we have asked Jack to reexamine the entire 4,000 page federal tax code... to start with a blank piece of paper." Kemp promised that the commission will focus on "reforming our tax code, restoring incentives to entrepreneurial capitalism, lowering tax rates, helping create jobs, and assisting low-income persons escape the conditions of poverty and welfare dependency."
<p>
In this effort, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform will design, and push for the passage of, an alternative tax system that is fairer, flatter, and simpler. Speaker Gingrich noted that Kemp and the commission will "reach out to all of the presidential candidates, to all of the Republican governors, to all of the members of the House and Senate, to corporate America, and to the American people to put together the kind of reforms that are vital."
<p>
Both Dole and Gingrich asserted that naming Kemp to chair the commission carried both symbolic and practical significance. Speaker Gingrich asserted that "it is clear that there is a yearning in America for a very profound rethinking of the tax code, and Jack Kemp is the one to provide that type of leadership, having given President Reagan the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981." Dole added, "For over two decades Jack has been one of our most innovative thinkers on economic policy. No one can speak to these issues more creatively and more credibly."
<p>
The commission will issue a final report at the end of 1995--in time for the 1996 presidential primaries.

<H3>A Fairer, Simpler 21st Century Single Tax Rate System</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Recent polling shows almost twothirds of all Americans are interested in replacing the current income tax system with a single rate tax system which would require all American citizens and businesses to pay one, simple, low tax rate--around 17 percent.
<p>
Today, American economic policy is a mess. The tax code is now more than 5 million words long, understood by few, and oppressive to all. Washington's 60,000 pages of federal regulations further stifle entrepreneurial spirit while government spending remains out of control. The bottom line is lethargic economic growth and the loss of opportunity for millions of Americans.
<p>
The tax increases in the budget acts of 1990 and 1993 reversed the trend toward lower tax rates and fewer federal regulations that spurred the unprecedented growth and job creation of the 1980s. To put the tax code in perspective, it is worthwhile to look at how much the average family of four pays in taxes. In 1950, the typical middleincome family paid about 2 percent of its income in federal taxes. By 1993, that amount had increased to about 24 percent of income.
<p>
The only thing more costly to America than its tax system is its system of federal regulations. Experts estimate that these regulations cost Americans nearly $1 trillion a year.
<p>
The U.S. spends more money on its federal government than all other countries, except Japan, spend on their entire economies. In 1950, federal spending was about 16 percent of total gross domestic output. Today it has ballooned to 23 percent of GDP.
<p>
Taxes, regulations, and spending have produced an economy with anemic growth, slow job creation, and hindered entrepreneurship, and one in which the American Dream is not yet secure for enough of our people. Since the current economic recovery began, GDP growth has averaged just 2.4 percent in real terms, less than half the 5 percent growth rate usually associated with recoveries.
<p>
Job creation has lagged even further behind, increasing by only 3 percent instead of the average 9 percent recovery.
<p>
There is a straightforward way to deal with taxes, regulations, and spending-- the single rate tax system. The need to address all of these concerns is precisely what has piqued the American public's and Congress' interest in this revolutionary idea.

<H3>EA Brochure Lets You Make Federal Budget Cuts</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Washington, DC--Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp, along with Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK) and other members of the House Budget Committee, unveiled Empower America's new brochure on the budget process, entitled "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget."
<p>
Described by Largent as "a great way for people to become better informed about the budget process and to see for themselves what it is like to balance the budget," the brochure includes a worksheet which outlines current budgetary expenditures. Readers are also invited to enter their own numbers in an effort to develop a balanced budget reflecting their priorities.
<p>
Both the House and Senate have passed plans that would bring the federal budget into balance over a seven-year period, by slowing the rate of growth in many federal programss and targeting many others for elimination--those that are outdated or duplicative.
<p>
The share of the federal debt held by every man woman and child today totals over $18,500. Without fundamental change, children born today will pay nearly $200,000 over their lifetime in taxes to sustain the interest on the debt, and face a total tax rate (for all local, state, and federal spending) of 84 percent of their earnings over their lifetime, according to calculations in President Clinton's own budget.
<p>
Once the federal budget is balanced, for the first time since 1969, the government will be able to pay off its debt, which has grown over the 219 years of our history to nearly $5 trillion this year.
<p>
If you are interested in receiving your own copy of Empower America' s brochure, "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget," to discover how the process works, and make your own choices, then please send your request to Empower America at 1776 I Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Leadership Council's Conference Forum</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Leadership Council held its second Conference Forum in early May. One hundred members attended the day and a half conference set against the backdrop of our nation's capitol. Focusing on the state of the 104th Congress, "The Contract with America," and the future of our government, the conference's main objectives were to inform, enlighten, and empower its participants.
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick kicked off the formal program with a dinner address titled, "Beyond the Contract: Foreign and Domestic." In her remarks, Ambassador Kirkpatrick outlined the position that the United States government has taken on several foreign policy issues, her thoughts on those policies, the future of our government, and the changes that are necessary to ensure maximum peace and protection for the world.
<p>
The next day was packed with various speeches and discussions. Breakfast keynote speaker Co-director Bill Bennett remarked on the cultural impact of "The Contract with America," as well as giving his thoughts on the upcoming presidential election. Following Dr. Bennett, Senators Connie Mack (R-FL) and John Ashcroft (R-MO), and Congressmen John Boehner (R-OH) and Chris Cox (R-CA) shared their experiences and insight on the phenomenal first one hundred days of the Senate and House. 
<p>Two freshmen members of the House, Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS), spoke about being part of a freshman class which retains the same hope and enthusiasm that they had when the 104th session of Congress began. Perhaps the most anticipated speaker of the day was the Speaker of the House and Empower America Board Member, Newt Gingrich. Speaker Gingrich, introduced by Co-director Jack Kemp, eloquently argued that "our rendezvous with destiny is here at home." He illustrated this point with his three vision levels and nine strategies for Congress to follow up 'The Contract with America."
<p>
The sessions and speeches successfully wrapped up with an inside look at the work of pollsters and their influence on elections. As the day drew to a close, Council Members were invited for a private tour of the Capitol.

<H3>Empower America Pushes the Single Rate Tax System In New Hampshire</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America continued its ad campaign advocating a low, single rate tax system by running radio spots in New Hampshire. Since the 1996 presidential race begins in New Hampshire, Empower America wanted to produce a radio spot that would influence the debate on the single rate system. William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber have been strong proponents of a low single rate, and hope their efforts will influence the 104th Congress, and the presidential hopefuls.
<p>
William Bennett was the voice behind the message Empower America sent to the people of New Hampshire. The 60 second radio ad ran 88 times on five news and talk radio stations in New Hampshire.

<H3>Empower America Launches Campaign
Against Daytime TV Talk Shows</H3>
<i>Statement by William J. Bennett 
<br> October 26, 1995</i></CENTER>
<p>
First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman. Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea. It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure--public pressure--on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<p>
Earlier this year, Senator Lieberman joined C. DeLores Tucker of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc. Today, we turn our attention to television. Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television--the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas. Most of the criticisms are justified. But this is not the worst of it. The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified. In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.
<p>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment. But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<p>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics. The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year-old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men--well, you get the idea.

<p>
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about. We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee. The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency. They are at the bottom of the television barrel. Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it. So here we are.
<p>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed --"Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote--and to petition men and women of good will--producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers --to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<p>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs? In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust. Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality? Do the sponsors think not? If so, why not?
<p>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.
<p>
What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid. This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift. We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.
<p>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about. So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine. We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.<p>

Let me conclude with a personal note. Joe Lieberman is a Jew. I am a Catholic. Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image. And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves. <P>

<li>"Early deployment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system ... is the only way the U.S. government can fulfill its constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. If we start now, immediately, and work as rapidly and well as possible, we may achieve an operationally effective missile defense in time to prevent a tragedy."

<p>
<li>"I'm here to defend the idea that the [tax] rates ought to come down, that it will be flatter, fairer, simpler; they've got to be lower across the board on labor and capital, the factors of production, and we ought to raise revenue for government and not try to redistribute the wealth of America. I don't think that is the purpose of the tax code--the tax code from time immemorial was to raise revenue and reduce the burden on those least able to bear that burden. And frankly, all of our plans--or all of 'the' plans are going to be judged on that basis. Does it raise revenue? Is it efficient for the economy and does it remove the burden on those least able to bear that burden?"
<br>
<b>Jack Kemp,<br> 
CNBC Inside Opinion, July 20,1995</b>
<p>

<li>"Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education and White House Drug Czar, may have just won his biggest political victory: According to The New York Times, Time Warner is trying to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the home of socalled gangsta rap...."
<p>
He and Mrs. Tucker both took their concerns directly to Time Warner, where they argued that distributing albums that glorify violence, murder and the abuse of women is fundamentally immoral. Instead of wielding political power against Time Warner, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Tucker brought moral authority to bear: They sharned Time Warner executives, both in private and in public....
<p>
This success should be a paradigm for culture warriors.... Culture cannot be dictated from Washington, it is a matter of millions of personal choices made by millions of people every day. Moral persuasion can affect those personal choices in a way that laws and regulations can't. Snoop Doggy Dogg may not be particularly open to suasion, but if the corporation that made millions off of him is able to rethink its place in the market, and maybe figure out how to make millions of a less noxious product, there is hope.<br>

<b>"Culture War Victory"<br>

Washington Times, August 14,1995</b>

<p>
<li>"It is significant that today nobody--nobody--is willing to defend the current welfare system. And for good reason; it is a complete wreck. After thirty years, we have finally reached a consensus that much of the anti-poverty strategy of the 60s arid 70s has failed--and failed horribly. Poverty today is more widespread, more deeply entrenched and more pathological than it was three decades, and $5 trillion, ago.... It is time to encourage poverty fighting-efforts that are both compassionate and effective, rather than maintaining a system that is neither."<br>

<H3>The Battle for School Choice in Milwaukee</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Milwaukee has long been the standardbearer for the school choice movement. In 1990, the nation's only government-funded school choice program was enacted in Milwaukee. And in early 1995, Governor Tommy Thompson submitted an expansion plan of the program, which allowed students to redeem vouchers at religious as well as non-religious schools. The plan was approved and passed by the legislature as part of the 1995-97 state budget bill. However, on August 25, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued an injunction barring the state from paying tuition for students attending private religious schools until the court rules on whether it is constitutional. Several hundred children had already begun classes as participants in the voucher program. As a result, Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) set up an emergency fund to provide funds for children for the school year.
<p>
Empower America Co-director William J. Bennett traveled to Milwaukee to affirm his support for school choice, and for a program that allows parents to choose either religious or non-religious private schools for their children. Said Dr. Bennett, "This moment in Milwaukee is probably the breakthrough point. This is the beachhead." Bennett toured St. Matthew's, an elementary school participating in the choice program, and was a guest on Charles Sykes' radio program on WTMJ-AM (620). Bennett was joined by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and by another former education secretary. They then held a press conference praising the expanded program at Messmer High School, an independent Catholic school. Dr. Bennett summed up the objective of the school choice movement: "This is not an anti-public school effort. This is a pro-good school effort ... Good public schools have nothing to fear from school choice."

<H3>Empower America Sets Conservative Agenda</H3>
<P>
<I>Baltimore Conference Launches 104th Congress</I>
<P>
BALTIMORE, MD: In this city, an hour's drive north of Washington,
DC, three&#171;busy days of seminars, workshops, discussion sessions
(and a bit of speechmaking) in early December brought home the
latest example of how the political landscape of America has changed.
<P>
Previously, under the control of the Democrat House leadership,
only one institution, the Kennedy School of Government in Boston,
had run freshman orientation for incoming members of Congress.
This monopoly had lasted for over
 twenty years. New members would 
have to travel to Massachusetts to actually I 
participate, and topics were often narrow 
and unambitious.
<P>
But in 1994, the Boston organization had to cancel its program
due to lack of interest, since the vast majority of newly-elected 
House freshmen chose to attend an orientation program organized
by Empower America and the Heritage Foundation.
<P>
Held December 811 at the Radisson Plaza in Baltimore, MD, the
conference drew 
a majority of the Republican members- elect, as well as a couple
of their Democrat counterparts. This high energy gathering demonstrated
that the incoming Republican majority plans to hit the ground
running to deliver the real change America endorsed on November
8.
<P>
The days were packed with programs and presentations designed
to supplement incoming members' knowledge of issues they'll face
in the 104th Congress, as well as highlighting dramatic, conservative
alternatives to 30 years of Great Society philosophy. Nearly 50
conservative experts in all major issues of domestic and foreign
policy attended.
<P>
New members took the lead in debating innovative alternatives
on issues such as welfare reform, crime, defense and farm policy.
They also worked to plan legislative strategy and tactics on reforming
Congress, strengthening America's health care system, tackling
the over regulation that the Federal government imposes on states
and individuals, and limiting congressional terms.
<P>
They discussed how to draw on the new conservative majority in
the country to construct coalitions necessary to effect change
in Washington. And how to balance their professional obligations
with the needs of their families, so that families will always
come first.
<P>
All five of Empower America's co-directors, Lamar Alexander, Bill
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber spoke at the
conference and participated in smallgroup meetings, sharing advice
and insights which they hoped would be valuable to the attendees,
both personally and professionally.
<P>
One of the orientation's highlights came at its conclusion, with
an address by radio/TV talkshow host Rush Limbaugh- whom many
of the freshman credit, in part, with their victory. According
to Bill Bennett, Limbaugh is &quot;a symbol of encouragement.
He's a pretty reasonable read on what a lot of America thinks.
Rush is a way conservatives know that they're not idiosyncratic.&quot;
To express their appreciation, the freshmen voted to make Limbaugh
an honorary member of their incoming class.
<P>
Limbaugh was quick to return the compliment. 
 &quot;I am in awe of you,&quot; Limbaugh told them, &quot;You took the risks.
You are the ones who engaged the opposition ... You actually went
out and did the work.

<H3>Grassroots, With Message of Change, Made Difference at Ballot Box</H3>
<P>


Political observers are calling what happened on November 8th
a &quot;tsunami.&quot;
<P>
In Japan, that' s the word for tidal wave. In America, that's
the term for the overwhelming victory conservatives gained at
the federal, state, and local level in 1994's midterm elections.
<P>
Beginning in January, Republicans will control both Houses of
Congress for the first time since 1954. In the U.S. Senate, the
margin will be 5347, a gain of nine seats. All 11 Senate freshmen
will be Republicans. In the U.S. House, Republicans picked up
52 seats, for a 230-204 edge, with one independent. Of the 86-member
freshman class, 73 are Republicans.
<P>
For the first time since 1970, Republicans also have the lion's
share of governors' mansions. They'll control 30 governorships,
in states with 70 percent of the U.S. population.
<P>
But the victories weren't just wide, they were deep. Republicans
now control both houses of 19 state legislatures, while Democrats
control 18.
<P>
In the South, for the first time since Reconstruction, a state
legislative body will be led lay Republicans. The South Carolina
House, which went Republican, hasn't had a GOP majority since
1886. Down the ballot, at all levels, candidates
supporting a powerful and vigorous conservative message won election.
<P>
Keeping this in mind, Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp observes,
&quot;The 1994 elections rivaled Ronald Reagan's 1980 victory
in its importance to the conservative movement.&quot;
<P>
What made the difference in the 1994 election was the dedicated
effort of grassroots activists, who constructed a network of information
and support that bypassed both the media and, in many cases, the
established political parties. Compared to previous midterm elections,
turnout was up. Polling data indicates that many of those who
voted intended to send a message for conservative change. This
turnout was the key difference in many close races - the defeat
of House Speaker Tom Foley, House Judiciary Committee chairman
Jack Brooks, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman (and
likely next Senate Democrat leader) Jim Sasser.
<P>
So dramatic was the mandate for change voiced in November that
no less than the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, dean of
the Washington pundits, saw in the results the evidence for a
massive political realignment - a return to the political landscape
as it looked before the New Deal.
<P>
However, to make re-alignment a reality requires even more effort
in 1995 and 1996, to make sure the 104th Congress delivers on
the change its leaders promised. According to a recent Times-Mirror
poll, 52 percent of Americans approve of the GOP's plans for the
future. Reducing crime, reforming welfare, cutting the deficit,
cutting middle class taxes, and a balanced budget amendment are
all supported by a majority of Americans.

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
<I>Dear Empower America Members: </I>
<P>
Our hard work during the last two years has definitely paid off!
Because of your dedication to ideals and policies that empower
individuals and families, our country has witnessed one of the
most historic elections of our time. As a result, we have elected
a new Congress committed to the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Through our candidate schools, issue briefs, radio actualities,
newspaper editorials and numerous other media opportunities, Empower
America has been pleased to play its role in the 1994 elections.
We look forward to the months and years ahead as a continuation
of our responsibility to help shape the conservative future of
America.
<P>
Therefore, this is not a time to rest. We must remain an active
voice in all the debates on policy that affect our daily lives.
This is an opportunity for us to propose progressive ideas for
the future of our country and our children. The days of the tax
and spend liberals controlling the agenda and our pocket books
are over!
<P>
It is because of concerned citizens like yourself, the ones that
only want a strong and stable country for our children, that this
Congress is like no other one before. It is
important that you remain in the fight. We will need you for every
battle that comes up on Capitol Hill. This new Congress must know
what the American people need and want from their government.
You are the only way they will know.
<P>
Thank you for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
<B>Bill Dal Col</B>
<P>
<I>President</I>

<H3>Kirkpatrick Unveils Foreign Policy Critique</H3>

<P>

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On the fifty-third anniversary of Pearl Harbor
Day, Dr. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick released a new Empower America publication
entitled <I>Security and Insecurity: A Critique of Clinton Policy
at MidTerm </I>at a crowded, well-attended press conference at
the Willard Hotel.
<P>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that given the &quot;major events through
which we are living ... responses that would be required are much
stronger than have been given. And the leadership that is needed
is much stronger, more purposeful, serious leadership than has
been available. And the strength that is needed, both I think,
moral, political and strategic, of the United States is greater
than has been available.&quot;
<P>
In opening remarks, Empower America Chairman Malcolm S. Forbes,
Jr. said that &quot;We believe that the midpoint of this 
Administration - the
two year mark - is a good time to do a thorough examination
of its foreign and defense policies. A variety of experts were
brought together by Jeane to do this book.&quot;
<P>
But the volume is not just limited to criticism. In an article
entitled &quot;U.S. Security Policy for the Nineties&quot;, Dr.
Kirkpatrick outlines what Mr. Forbes described as &quot;Empower
America's foreign policy approach . . . pro-democracy, pro-growth,
pro-opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Calling Dr. Kirkpatrick &quot;perhaps the seminal thinker of America's
role in this emerging world,&quot; EA Codirector Jack Kemp said
that one of &quot;lessons of the 20th century is that weakness
is provocative,&quot; and while &quot;foreign policy, trade policy,
defense policy have been bipartisan in support .. . we at EA have
been quite moderate in our critique of the first two years of
the Clinton administration.&quot;
<P>
Twenty-one of the more than thirty experts who contributed essays
to <I>Security and Insecurity </I>attended the press conference.
The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the Clinton national
security record, including foreign, defense, intelligence, information,
international economic, regional and countryspecific analyses.
It is available by sending $3.00 to Empower America, 81776 I Street,
NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Ads Tout Flat Tax</H3>

<I>Radio and Television Campaign for Reform</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Moving the empowerment agenda forward, Empower
America began airing a new radio ad the week of January 9th. The
60second spot advocates replacing the current variablerate tax
system with a flat tax.
<P>
The ad, the first in an advertising campaign supporting the flat
tax, will be heard on news and talk radio stations in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Arizona. Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp set
the stage for the flat tax with an advertisement, run last month,
calling for lower acrosstheboard taxes, cutting and indexing capital
gains taxes, and raising the personal exemption for all families.
This generated considerable support.
<P>
The ad's text is as follows:
<P>
<B>Announcer</B>
<P>
<I>
Two years ago, President Clinton raised
taxes by over 250 billion dollars.
Now Clinton says he wants to cut taxes by
just 60 billion dollars. It's not enough. 
Clinton's high taxes, big spending, and
soaring interest rates are a blueprint for 
recession. To get the economy going, we need 
a real tax cut. It' s called the flat tax - 
and it' s one low rate of 17 percent will 
really cut taxes, while needy and working 
families will pay even less. The flat tax will
eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and 
capital gains - encouraging savings, invest-
ment, and new jobs. Tax cuts worked for 
President Kennedy; they worked for President 
Reagan. What' s more, Americans could file 
their income taxes on a post card. 

To tell Bill Clinton you want a real tax cut, 
join the fight for the flat tax by calling 
Empower America at 1-800-332-2000.
</I>
<P>
Striking these same themes, Kemp along with Co-director Bill Bennett
delivered a one minute message on national CNN just prior to President
Clinton's January 24 State of the Union address.
<P>
The time, purchased by Empower America, criticized the Clinton
tax proposals and offered an economic vision for America's future,
renewing the call for a flat tax that will bring jobs and tax
relief for America's families.
<P>
The television spot, promoted by radio spots on January 23 and
24, reached a large and politically diverse audience. Empower
America hopes that such widespread exposure to these views will
encourage national discussion.
<P>
Congress is receptive to dramatically changing the tax system,
and both the House and Senate will be holding hearings during
the next several months to examine ways to reform the system,
simplify tax collection, and reduce tax rates. Empower America
will work energetically over the next several months to keep its
members informed and involved, to organize grassroots efforts
supporting the flat tax, and to let Congress know that Americans
support a flat tax.
<P>

<H3>Empower America Interview: Michael Harrison</H3>

<P>
<I>Michael Harrison is the editor and publisher of </I><B>TALKERS
Magazine, </B><I>the major trade publication in the talk radio
industry. As such, he presides over the nation's largest data
base about the medium in addition to researching the opinions
expressed by hosts and callers. In this role, Mr. Harrison has
emerged as the leading spokesman for talk radio and what he refers
to as the &quot;new media&quot; and is one of the most sought
after analysts of American public opinion. Mr. Harrison is a regular
guest on radio talk shows and network television in addition to
being constantly quoted in most of the nation's major news publications.
He also hosts </I><B>TALKERS Magazine's </B><I>nationally syndicated
weekly program, &quot;The Talk Radio Countdown Show,&quot; which
overviews the hottest topics of theweek on talk radio, and continues
to guesthost local talk shows whenever he has the time regularly
filling in on WRC Radio during his many visits to the nation's
capital</I>
<P>
<I>EMPOWER AMERICA:</I> What impact did talk radio have on the 1994 elections?
<P>
<I>MICHAEL HARRISON: </I>First of all, talk radio proved to be
an accurate bellwether of American public opinion foretelling
the results of the election as early as two years ago. As a spokesman
for the field, I've had to defend the accuracy of talk radio to
the mainstream press more than a hundred times during the past
couple of years. TV news and many of the daily papers would downplay
the sentiment expressed by both hosts and callers on talk radio
as representing a &quot;small but vocal&quot; segment of the population
of reflecting a &quot;conservative Republican bias.&quot; Or worse,
they denigrated it as playing to a &quot;radical fringe.&quot;
The point is, talk radio did not cause the election to happen
the way it did. Talk radio forecasted it. As such, talk radio
has shown itself to be more in touch with the American people
than any other of today's mass media. In doing so, it provided
the people of this nation with the opportunity to discuss the
real issues of the day and exchange populist views. It is only
in that context that talk radio impacted the election. It provided
a vehicle for public opinion which
already existed to play itself out and reach some sort of collective
resolution.
<P>
<I>EA:</I> Will there be an increase in &quot;liberal&quot; talk
radio as a result of the 1994 election?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Only if the newly elected politicians who call themselves
&quot;conservatives&quot; are ineffective, corrupt, arrogant and
elitist and besmirch the concept of popular conservatism. You
see, I don't believe that the ever-growing talk radio audience
is inherently Democrat or Republican in a partisan sense. Nor
are they unilaterally liberal or conservative. I think the average
thinking American here at the end of the Twentieth Century is
more prone to be an active Independent. At the moment, the conservatives
are more accurately addressing these concerns than the liberals.
But actions speak louder than words and more and more, the American
public is able to perceive the difference between talk and deed.
The biggest mistake politicians on both sides of the fence can
make is to think that the electorate is primarily composed of
party faithful. In the old days the term &quot;independent&quot;
was usually associated with &quot;apathetic.&quot; Today, however,
the independent voter is more likely the most active. That's today's
gigantic difference.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What will the state of the industry be two years from
now, during the 1996 elections? What role will talk radio have
on the next election cycle?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Talk radio will set the pace for the entire mass media. Now
that the mainstream media, particularly the press, have caught
wind of talk radio's position in the political scheme of things,
its proclivity to play the leader, will insure this prediction
coming true. The 1996 election will be played out on talk radio
and that ensuing scenario will be amplified and cemented in the
mainstream media. As far as the details of the next election are
concerned, I'm not an astrologer&#151;but I can give you this
insight, this hint: Talk radio does not choose its good guys and
bad guys simply based on party line or academic political ideology.
It bases these things on personality, character and the handling
of &quot;people&quot; concerns on an issue to issue basis. Look
what's going on in Massachusetts. The same hosts who beat the
daylights out of Dukakis for his ultraliberalism have just turned
like vicious dogs on the conservative William Weld for supporting
a 55 percent legislative pay raise on the heels of the election.
<P>
EA: Do you consider talk radio to have more entertainment, news
or education value?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Ah, now that's the question talk radio programmers
are constantly wrestling with. Finding the perfect balance between
information and entertainment. This is not a media characteristic
peculiar to talk radio. Television news, newspapers, even Presidential
campaigns are preoccupied with capturing attention and developing
interest. Or to put it another way, to avoid being boring at all
costs&#151;even if it means leaving out important information
or glossing over serious, complex issues. Fortunately, we live
at a time when a growing portion of the American public finds
news and public affairs entertaining. The problem is when the
public expects and demands that it be entertaining first and foremost.
Remember during the Persian Gulf War when people talked about
going home at night to &quot;watch&quot; the war on CNN and began
to complain when it started to get &quot;boring?&quot; At least
half the audience viewed it as just another miniseries. So yes,
talk radio is entertainment. . . but so is Connie Chung. And so
are political debates. And so are political conventions. That's
why the networks no longer cover then gavel to gavel. Shakespeare
understood this hundreds of years ago.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What is the proper role for talk radio in the political
debate?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>To create an environment that will draw a large audience
while maintaining a fair and even playing field. That's the ideal.
Uq,fortunately, the fair and even playing field often suffers
in the process of drawing the large audience. I only hope that
the bean counters who ultimately control talk radio&#151; or at
least will gain more control over the medium as it continues to
show itself to be a potential moneymaker&#151;don't overresearch
and package it to the point that it loses the rough edges and
accessibility to the people that I believe is at the core of its
impact.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What new technologies can we expect from talk radio,
such as interaction with online computer services, etc.?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Fifty years from now, today's talk radio will be looked
back upon as the
<P>
primitive public address system of the emerging 21st century electric
age democracy. As far as the present is concerned, talk radio
makes maximum effective use of existing technologies to make twoway
mass communications fantastically accessible and immediate&#151;
telephony, satellites, and digital transmission technology make
talk radio amazingly flexible and ubiquitous. The next step is
universal interaction with online computer services. <I>TALKERS
Magazine is </I>about to go online with CompuServe. The relationship
between talk radio and online services, the Internet, will be
close.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Why has there been a recent resurgence in interest
in talk radio, and when did it begin to come into its own?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Talk radio's been around for ages, but I trace the
real beginning of the modern era of talk radio to the removal
of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 which opened
<P>
the door up to stations feeling free to tackle controversial issues.
Prior to that, the Fairness Doctrine actually had a chilling effect
on the discussion of public policy in the electric media. But
that's just one factor. In the late eighties, you had all these
AM stations being beaten up by FM music stations so they turned
to talk which sounds just fine on AM. Also, talk radio addressed
issues and reflected public opinion in a way that was largely
ignored by the mainstream press and media, so it filled a massive
void and garnered tremendous public support. Other factors that
contributed to talk radio's growth have been the changing demographics
of the nation&#151;boomers are extremely interested in public
policy&#151;as well as the fact that talk radio is great company.
People are lonely and talk radio provides a sense of community
that's missing in the modern world. Then there's the advertising
aspect of talk radio. It's a powerful advertising medium <B>because
</B>it has such an active and interested audience.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Are stations moving away from locally produced talk
shows to carry more nationally syndicated shows, or are they still
cultivating local talent?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Both! The average talk station in America is a blend
of the two - and both have proven to be a vital part of the
programming success of talk radio. The networks are providing
local stations with the chance to get into the talk radio business
and provide a solid, national product. That, in turn, creates
the need to supplement the network stuff with a local perspective.
For every job that Rush Limbaugh has taken away, he's created
the need for two.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Do you see any future Rush Limbaughs on the horizon?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Yes and no. Yes, I do see tons of new and exciting
talents up and coming in talk radio and I find that very exciting.
But no, I don't think we'll see another &quot;Rush Limbaugh,&quot;
per se. He's one of a kind phenomenon that is actually historical.
If talk radio were rock and roll, then Rush Limbaugh is Elvis
Presley. Of course, as we know, there was only one king of rock
and roll - but that didn't stop him from self-destructing, and
the medium was certainly able to thrive without him.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>How can the public and grassroots organizations best
utilize the power of talk radio?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>The key is to tap into its accessibility without abusing
it. The public, of course can always listen. Callers should avoid
overdoing it as &quot;regular&quot; callers. No one wants to hear
the same person whining on and on using talk radio as a personal
soap box. Organizations should maintain the same rule. Be in touch
with the stations and hosts. Give them information that they want
and believe the public will be interested in. Do not flood them
with self-serving hype and minutia. Remember, talk radio is a business.
Put yourself in its shoes and it'll respond much more readily.

<P>
<H3>The Republican Agenda in the 104th Congress</H3>

<P>
<I>Now in control of both the House and Senate for the first time
in four decades, Republicans face the challenge of legislative
leadership. Fortunately, preparation for this welcome challenge
began during the campaign season when Republicans gathered on
the steps of the Capitol to sign their </I>Contract With America.
<I>This contract lays out the blueprint for thefirst 100 days
of the 104th Congress. The ten points of the </I>Contract <I>are
as follows.</I>
<P>
<B>Fiscal Responsibility Act</B>
<P>
Under this Act, Congress will vote on a balanced budget amendment
and the line item veto. The aim of this legislation is to force
Congress to live within its means and to restore financial accountability
to the budget.
<P>
<B>Taking Back Our Streets Act</B>
<P>
This provision takes a get tough approach to crime fighting;
calling for stiffer punishment, placing more police on the street,
and implementing truthinsentencing legislation that requires convicted
criminals to serve their full sentences.
<P>
<B>Personal Responsibility Act (Welfare Reform)</B>
<P>
The focus of this Act is twofold: (1) to encourage people to work,
and (2) to discourage people from having children out of wedlock.
Most Americans agree that the welfare system is seriously flawed
and must be dramatically reformed. Dramatic reform is what the
Republican leadership hopes to achieve through this legislation.
<P>
<B>Family Reinforcement Act of 1995</B>
<P>
The federal government has, in the past two decades, intruded
upon the parent/child relationship. This provision seeks to reverse
that trend by placing control of a child back where it belongs - with
the parents. The Act would also strengthen penalties for child
pornographers, and create tax breaks for those who adopt a child.
<P>
<B>The American Dream Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This Act provides a tax credit for families, reforms the &quot;marriage
penalty,&quot; and improves the tax treatment of IRAs. Beginning
in 1996, the bill would allow a $500 per child tax credit for
families with annual incomes up to $200,000. In addition, Americans
would be allowed to contribute up to $2,000 a year into an American
Dream Savings Account (ADSA).
<P>
<B>The National Security Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This provision would reform the Department of Defense by placing
an emphasis on a strong national defense through ensured funding.
It would also ensure that U.S. troops are only deployed to support
missions in the U.S.'s national security interests.
<P>
<B>Senior Citizens' Equity Act</B>
<P>
The senior citizens' earning limit would be raised. This would
end age discrimination for those who choose to work after a certain
age.
<P>
<B>The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</B>
<P>
Rolling back government regulation has long been a priority for
Republicans; this Act would slash many burdensome regulations
that strangle small businesses, thus making it easier for investment
and job creation.
<P>
<B>The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act</B>
<P>
This Act will curb excessive lawsuits and limit abuses of the
legal system by overzealous lawyers. This type of reform is crucial
to American competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Citizen Legislature Act</B>
<P>
This Act would force a vote on the issue of term limits for Senators
and House members. This would help put an end to career politicians
and give the American people a citizen legislature.
<P>
<I>These 10 points represent the backbone of the legislative agenda
for the 104th Congress. Empower America will work closely with
Congressional leaders to go forward with these initiatives endorsed
by the American peoples ' vote in November. Empower America 's
Codirector William J. Bennett is fond of telling audiences that
this is a </I>Contract With America, <I>it is not a handshake
with America. It is in this spirit that Empower America will continue
the fight for true reform in the days to come. </I>
<P>

<DD>&quot;Bennett, the former education secretary who took to the
campaign trail this year for an array of candidates, said he was
utterly clear on the meaning of this election. 'It was about limited
government, about the end of the nanny state,' he says. It was
about beginning to reverse 'the discharge of responsibilities
from families and communities and local government onto the federal
government,' and reviving personal responsibility.&quot;

<P><DD>
&quot;As opposed to Bill Clinton's effort to 'reinvent government,'
Alexander wants to dismantle it. One problem lies in making sure
someone else&#151;individuals, community groups or local entities&#151;does
the work that federal agencies have been doing for decades.
Alexander's first effort to deal with these and other questions
will come at a &quot;Send Washington Home&quot; conference November
14 sponsored by Empower America.&quot;

<H3>New York Gala Honors Innovative Governors</H3>

<I>Governors Tommy Thompson, Christine Todd Whitman and John Engler
accept Empower America 's first annual </I><B>Empowerment Awards.</B>
<P>
On November 17th, Empower America held its second annual New York
Gala Dinner aboard the historic USS Intrepid aircraft carrier.
The evening's dinner and discussion were particularly eventful
as Empower America honored Governor John Engler for his changes
in Michigan education policy, Governor Tommy Thompson for the
overhaul of Wisconsin's welfare system, and Governor Christine
Todd Whitman for her bold economic policies in New Jersey. These
governors were the recipients of Empower America's first annual
<I>Empowermerlt Awards&#151;</I>in recognition of their ingenious
and innovative policies benefitting the men and women, business
leaders, families, and children of their states.
<P>
The evening' s patriotic celebration was heightened with the presentation
of the colors by the USS Inchon Color Guard. Empower America Chairman
Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. presided over the event and began the evening
with an introduction of New York Governorelect George Pataki.
The Empower America Board of Directors welcomed over 500 friends
and supporters as Lamar Alexander, William Bennett,
<P>

Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick presented the awards to the Governors.
The energized crowd and impressive lineup of state and local leaders
set the tone for the debate which will resume in the new congress.
<P>
The discussion shed light on the emerging discussion surrounding
illconceived policies at both the national and state levels, in
addition to addressing the federal government's stream of unfunded
mandates. The progressive agendas of Governors Engler, Thompson
and Whitman will be on the leading edge of change -- to restructure
the relationship between the federal government and the states,
and comprehensively change the way that our elected leaders do
business.
<P>

<H3>Issue Conference Campaign Tackles Gold Standard</H3>
<P>


<I>Bretton Woods</I>
<P>
On September 8th, Empower America hosted a conference on monetary
policy which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the historic
Bretton Woods Conference. The anniversary conference, which took
place in Washington, DC, featured reputable experts in the field
of economics including Lawrence Kudlow, Arthur Laffer, Lawrence
Lindsey, and Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., in addition to Empower America
Co-directors Jack Kemp and Vin Weber. 
<P>
Communications Campaign Proves Effective
<P>
Over the past couple of months, Empower America has been waging
an intensive television and radio advertising campaign. Issueoriented
ads have been placed throughout the country opposing bad legislation,
like the Clinton health care plan, and promoting good proposals,
like tax cuts and the A to Z spending cut plan.
<P>
These ads often put Empower America squarely in the middle of
major issue debates. For instance, Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala publicly attacked an ad that
called President Clinton's welfare reform plan &quot;cynical and
deceptive.&quot; The resulting debate brought to light many of
the Clinton plan's flaws, helping to defeat it.
<P>
Empower America produced one of the most critical television ads
that ran during
the health care reform debate. The ad pulled no punches in asserting
that &quot;President Clinton wants to socialize our health care.&quot;
This ad, with an intensive buy, helped put Empower America on
the front lines of the battle that eventually saw the Clinton
health care plan soundly defeated.
<P>
&quot;Because Empower America is a non-profit non-partisan organization,
our ads can also be run by TV and radio stations as public service
announcements, which many do. Also, stations can hear each ad
through a special digital phone line established to transmit radio
actualities. By absorbing the production cost, Empower America
thus is able to support friendly and conservative TV and radio
stations throughout the country by producing professional issue-oriented
messages. &quot;

<P>

<H3>Lamar Alexander Joins Empower America</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151;Lamar Alexander, former secretary of education
and governor of Tennessee, recently joined the leadership of Empower
America. He will serve as a codirector elong with Bill Bennett,
Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber.
<P>
Since leaving government, Mr. Alexander has remained active in
national politics. He launched a satellite TV network based in
Nashville, TN, which conducts a monthly public policy discussion
through nearly 3,000 town meetings across the country. Alexander's
satellite network will provide another vehicle for the organization
to advance its empowerment agenda among a broad coalition grassroots
activists.
<P>
&quot;Our neighborhood meetings and Empower America fit together
perfectly ' Mr. Alexander said. &quot;I'm delighted to be on the
same team as Bill, Jack, Jeane and Vin, who are constantly challenging
conservatives to say more clearly what we are for.&quot;
<P>
Lamar Alexander is also an advocate for congressional reform and
champions the idea of &quot;cut their pay and send them home.&quot;
His plan includes cutting a congressman's time in Washington and
pay in half.
<P>
Alexander explains, &quot;If members ate their breakfasts in hometown
diners instead of Capitol Hill restaurants such harebrained notions
as turning the health care system over to the government to run,
raising taxes to create jobs, 'reinventing
<P>
welfare' from Washington, DC for the 7th time, would never see
daylight.&quot;
<P>
The new codirector's colleagues, Bennett and Kemp, praised his
addition to the group.
<P>
&quot;I have always respected and admired Lamar's outspoken advocacy
of creative
<P>
solutions to our nation's problems:' Kemp said. I'm thrilled that
he's agreed to join our team and help advance the conservative
cause.&quot;
<P>
Bill Bennett added, &quot;I'm very glad to have Lamar join our
organization. His is another clear and experienced voice on the
cause of empowering Americans.&quot;

<P>

<H3>Making Ideas Matter in the Fall Elections</H3>
<P>
EmpowerAmerica plays key role in development of popular message
in the fall elections.
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: As the fall elections draw near, political
experts across the country are predicting big gains for proponents
of the principles of empowerment. In the House of Representatives,
most experts predict a shift of twenty five or more seats into
the conservative ranks. In the Senate, gains of four to seven
seats are not only possible, but likely. The same is true at the
state and local level. Several statehouses and several state legislatures
may move from the domination of liberal control to majority empowerment oriented
control.
<P>
One of the reasons for this success is the ability of conservative
candidates to define a coherent message of limited government
distinguished from that of President Clinton and his liberal allies.
Empower America has played an important role in the development
of this agenda.
<P>
We recently completed a series of successful Candidate Schools,
in which candidates from across the country learned about effective
and viable messages of family and community empowerment over massive
governmental bureaucracy. Now, Empower America has turned its
efforts to helping primary winners develop that same message.
<P>
While not endorsing or supporting any particular candidate, Empower
America has been actively involved with candidates in advancing
the message of empowerment.
<P>
As Congress struggles through the final weeks of the current session,
it is becoming increasingly clear that President Clinton is going
to be a huge millstone around the necks of big-spending, big-government
congressional candidates across the county. This stands in stark
contrast with Empower America's message.
<P>
Candidate School attendees and winners from across the country
are succeeding on the Empower America message. In Rhode Island,
Dr. Kevin Vigilante is running for Congress in the first congressional
district. Faced with strong opposition from Patrick Kennedy, son
of Senator Edward Kennedy, he has overcome huge Kennedy advantages
in name identification and fundraising to be within points of
Kennedy in the polls. Dr. Vigilante is utilizing the facts, theories
and vision advocated by Empower America. Crime, welfare, education
and economic growth define his campaign.
<P>
In Tennessee, attorney and former actor Fred Thompson is running
for the Senate against Congressman Jim Cooper.
<P>
Principal sponsor of the &quot;Clintonlite&quot; health care plan,
Cooper entered the race as the heavy favorite. Thompson, however,
has closed the gap significantly by running a campaign based on the 
principles of empowerment. Advocating a strong welfare reform package as well
as crime and real health care reform, Thompson has made this race
&quot;too close to call&quot; as the days count down to November.
<P>
Empower America also has been briefing candidates who did not
attend the Candidate Schools. Through weekly faxes on issues to
all primary winners and other periodic &quot;urgent updates&quot;
on breaking issues, Empower America is ensuring that all candidates
have access to the powerful message of empowerment.
<P>
When the November elections have come and gone, America will have
taken a step closer to returning power to citizens and local governments
and a step away from the big government control of the last thirty
years. 
<P>

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
 
Dear Empower America Members:
<P>
These past few months have been very exciting at <B>Empower America</B>
 and we must thank you, our membership, for this. Your continual
interest and involvement in this organization makes it possible
for us to promote the empowerment agenda across the country and
play a leading role in the national debate.
<P>
We are pleased to welcome Lamar Alexander to our leadership as
a codirector. There is no doubt that his involvement with us will
bring vigorous new energy to the public policy debate.
<P>
Empower America has been actively involved in the fight against
the costly crime and health care bills using an aggressive television
and radio advertisement.campaign to deliver our message on
both. Our goal was to activate Americans to participate in the
political system by contacting their representative and senators
and persuading them to vote against these economically destructive
pieces of legislation.
<P>
As the debate over health care continues in the months ahead,
Empower America will lend its voice around the nation to promote
insurance availability, affordability and portability for everyone
without government mandates.
<P>
<B>Now, we are encouraging all of you </B>to become active
in the fall midterm elections. This is a cridcal time for all of
us. This election represents the opportunity to make changes that
will affect the policies governing all of our futures. This is
the time to elect individuals who support the advancement of freedom,
the promotion of
economic growth and the pursuit of solutions to cultural and social
problems.
<P>
The best way to do this is to vote! Research the candidates in
your state and district. Then cast your vote for those who will
support legislation that empowers people and not government bureacracies.
Let's elect individuals to office who represent the most important
special interest: the American people.
<P>
Once again, thank you very much for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Bill Dal Col
<P>
President

<P>

<H3>Crime in America: A Nation Held Hostage</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Over the past three decades violent crime
has increased by more than 500 percent. America leads the industrialized
world in rates of murder, rape and violent crime. As these
disturbing numbers continue to grow, nearly three out of every
four convicted criminals remain on the street, and the American
public's faith in its government's ability to fulfill its first
priority, to protect its citizenry from enemies foreign and domestic,
steadily erodes. As a result, parents are afraid to let their
children freely roam the neighborhood with their friends; individuals
are afraid to walk the streets of many cities at night;
and law-abiding, hardworking citizens in the nation's inner cities
live with the constant fear of being the next victim of a random
act of violence while traveling to and from their home. In short,
the lawlessness of an incorrigible few has been allowed to alter
the lifestyles of law-abiding citizens throughout the nation. The
Democratic leadership, sensing the urgency of the problem, has
delivered a crime 
bill to the American people. This type of legislation will help,
right? Wrong.
<P>
The recently passed crime bill is being hailed by supporters as
a tough assault on crime, but the specifics of the legislation
betray their rhetoric. Instead of focusing on the principles of
apprehending criminals quickly and sentencing them to terms which
they will actually serve, the bill continues the liberal tradition
of fighting crime by pouring taxpayer money into more untested
social programs aimed at the &quot;root causes&quot; of crime
(e.g. poverty, boredom, low self-esteem). For example, in the recent
legislation one can find:
<UL>
<LI>A provision to teach arts and crafts and establish dance programs;
<LI>A provision designed to increase self-esteem;
<LI>A provision establishing Midnight Sports Leagues.
</UL>
Regardless of what one might think of these programs, it is ludicrous
to present them as answers to the very serious crime problem facing
our nation. Such an ivory tower approach by the social scientists
on 
Capitol Hill who drew up these provisions is an insult to the
average hardworking American who is looking to Washington for
some real help. Most Americans who pay their taxes and fear for
their personal safety would probably not agree that funds, desperately
needed by local law enforcement agencies, would be more wisely
spent by social workers (in the name of crime fighting) to establish
late night basketball leagues.
<P>
Even though there are some meritorious provisions such as the
community policing and prison provisions, these are so encumbered
with restrictive federal language that their beneficial effects
will be severely hampered. Overall, the bill simply possesses
too many untried provisions, is too complex and is too cost-inefficient
to be accepted by an American public under siege and seeking real
reform.
<P>
What can we do? Plenty. First, we must reform our criminal justice
system.
Punishment needs to be swifter, more certain and longer than it
is now. We need to build more prisons, hire more police officers
and prosecutors, implement truth-in-sentencing provisions and overhaul
the current juvenile justice system.
<P>
Numerous police officers and prosecutors around the country tell
of the frustration they face when they see the same offenders
arrested time after time as our 
revolving door justice system places these lifetime criminals
back on the street. Stories of a brutal attack by a criminal on
early release from his or her sentence are becoming all too common.
The system must be altered and it must be soon. The problem is
that legislation such as the crime bill will spend billions of
taxpayer dollars and do little to slow down the revolving door.
<P>
America also needs more police officers and more prisons (the
diluted provisions of the current bill are not sufficient) to
attack the rise in crime seriously. Each time a federal judge
orders a state to release prisoners because of overcrowding, justice
takes another blow and society comes face to face with criminals
who have not served their full sentence all because the state
could not house the offenders. If society expects criminals to
take its laws seriously, then society must be willing and able
to enforce those laws and the punishment that is given to those
who break the law.
<P>
America also faces the problem of juvenile crime. As John DiIulio
of Princeton University has stated, &quot;America is facing a
ticking youth crime bomb. We have burgeoning numbers of young
people who, from all the statistical profiles, are at risk of
becoming violent and repeat criminals.&quot; Once again, this
is a problem we must address by altering the justice system's
handling of young offenders; again, the crime bill presented by
the Democratic leadership does not. There is hope; however, it
is just not in Washington, DC.
<P>
In Richmond, Virginia, Governor George Allen is attempting to
reform a parole system that allows criminals to avoid 
large portions of their sentences. His administration is looking
past the failures of the last three decades and saying it is time
we apply basic principles in our fight against crime. The main
principles are age-old: justice must be swift and it must be sure.
If it is not both of these, it will not be justice. Criminals
seem to understand this very well. It is unfortunate that
President Clinton and those members of Congress who voted for
the most recent crime bill do not.

<H3>How To Cut Government Spending...From A To Z</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; A bipartisan coalition of representatives
has presented Congress with the opportunity to restore some measure
of fiscal sanity to the federal budget. Their initiative, known
as the A to Z Spending Cuts Plan after its primary co-sponsors,
Democrat Rob Andrews of New Jersey and Republican Bill Zeliff
of New Hampshire, would hold every member of Congress accountable
for wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary government spending.
<P>
Ever wonder why Congress can't just repeal the federal Helium
Act (started just after World War I to supply helium to our fleet
of military blimps) and save $1.7 billion? Or save $74 million
over five years by ending treeplanting grants offered by the Small
Business Administration? Or eliminate the $26 million the government
will spend this year to subsidize vacant public housing?
<P>
The answer is that these and hundreds of other federal boondoggles
costing billions are hidden deep inside huge pieces of legislation.
These omnibus spending bills are much more difficult to defeat
than individual examples of ridiculous government spending.
<P>
Liberals argue that the cuts outlined above won't make much of
a dent in the projected 1994 budget deficit of $220 billion. Maybe
so, but that's just a start. Citizens Against Government Waste,
a congressional watchdog organization has published a list of
556 &quot;Prime Cuts&quot; that would reduce federal spending
by nearly $187 billion this year and more than $1.3 trillion over
five years. People can argue the merits and demerits of these
and other spending programs. But supporters of these initiatives
don't want to encourage debate, they want to stifle it.
<P>
Until now, spending cuts which everyone purports to support, such
as the infamous Honey Bee and Mohair subsidies, have been allowed
to escape the budget ax. But for the first time, the A to Z plan
will force legislators to defend absurd special interest spending,
instead of denying responsibility .
<P>
The plan is simple and straightforward. Congress would set aside
an entire week &#151;56 hours of debate&#151;to consider nothing
but spending cuts. There would be no &quot;sacred cows.&quot;
Every government program would be on the table, vulnerable to
an amendment to reduce or eliminate its funding. Each individual
proposal would receive a recorded &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;
vote. It would only take a simple majority of House members to
eliminate once and for all hundreds of federal programs that serve
no legitimate public purpose. Outdated and wasteful programs will
no longer survive by clinging onto popular proposals. Each member
will be held accountable for his or her vote with no excuses.
<P>
But in Washington, there has to be a catch for any proposal that
makes this much sense. Despite the fact that a strong, bipartisan
majority in the House of Representatives supports the A to Z plan,
Democratic leaders will not allow the proposal to come to the
floor for a vote. If all of the bill's 230 cosponsors would sign
what's known as a &quot;discharge petition,&quot; the legislation
could be discharged from the committee, where it is being bottled
up, and brought to the floor. As of press time, only 204 members
have signed the petition, 14 short of the necessary number.
<P>
Why would someone cosponsor the bill but then refuse to allow
a vote on the plan? Members of Congress sometimes use this tactic
to safely demonstrate support for a popular proposal knowing all
along that they will never have to cast a vote. By doing so, they
are blocking an important deficit reduction tool and contributing
to the deepening level of public cynicism toward Congress as an
institution.
<P>
Pressure is building on A to Z cosponsors who refuse to sign the
discharge petition. The bill continues to inch forward as more
and more legislators feel the heat of public scrutiny. More and
more Americans are demanding responsibility and accountability
in the federal budget process. Constituents want to know exactIy
where their representatives stand on helium reserves, mohair subsidies,
and treeplanting grants.
<P>
The fate of A to Z will help determine the legacy of the 103rd
Congress. That legacy can either be one of missed opportunities,
or one where Congress helped restore the public's faith in America's
elected of ficials. For now, the choice is up to Congress. In
November, the voters will decide.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Speaks at Foreign Policy Forum</H3>
<P>
<I>Calls For Missile Defense Program; says no justification for invasion
of Haiti</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; Empower America Codirector Jeane Kirkpatrick
called on the Clinton administration to develop a defense for
America against ballistic missile attack. The former U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations said, &quot;I believe that it is impossible
today for any president to fulfill his pledge to provide for the
defense of the United States without developing an effective missile
defense, period. That is just a fact. Like it; dislike it; it
is a fact of life in our times. And it is incredible to me that
the current Administration should continue its blindness in this
regard.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that efforts to control
the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
of mass destruction and to stem the development of ballistic missiles
that can carry these weapons to targets long distances away have
reached a &quot;point of breakout&quot; that &quot;simply cannot
be tolerated.&quot; Ambassador Kirkpatrick said we need &quot;to
complete a missile defense program, a space-based missile defense
program which would enable us to defend ourselves and for
us to defend our friends and allies in the world against weapons
of mass destruction.&quot; She concluded by adding that &quot;the
problems are all of our making today in this regard. And this
president bears a heavy responsibility for his decisions in this
area.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also stated that &quot;there should be
no use of force of Haiti.&quot; She
added that &quot;I do not believe that there is an
 American national interest that justifies an
 invasion of Haiti.&quot;
 Ambassador Kirkpatrick was one of
 four distinguished speakers at a recent
 Foreign Policy Forum held by the
 Republican National Committee at which
 she made these remarks. She was joined
by former Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and former Secretaries
of State Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker III at the Forum to
address current international relations problems and to discuss
the Clinton administration's foreign policy.
<P>
Regarding the current government, Ambassador Kirkpatrick said
that she &quot;believes this administration underestimates the
danger in the world today, under
estimates the role of power and of force in the world, and, in
a curious kind of way, underestimates the force of American values
and institutions in the world.&quot; The countries of the former
Soviet Union are turning to America's values and institutions
as the model for their developing democratic and free market systems.
Therefore,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick said, &quot;It is as terrible a mistake
to underestimate the force of American values, as it is to underestimate
the value of American force.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also evaluated various aspects of the Clinton
administration's foreign policy, pointing out that their actions
stemmed in part from conceptions about the limits of American
power and that &quot;multilateralism was to be at the center of
their foreign policy.&quot; Another key Clinton administration
belief is that America is, &quot;in some fundamental sense, in
a process of inexorable decline. Therefore, they think we should
not seek to act unilaterally in the world, but should act only
multilaterally. Moreover, they clearly believe that multilateral
action is more moral and more legitimate than unilateral action.&quot;
<P>
Further, the Clinton administra
tion has moved to &quot;dramatically
draw down American military
forces, to diminish American weapons and
weapons procurement, to downsize the mil
itary's industrial complex, to reduce
research and development and to concen
trate on producing enough weapons and
maintaining just enough military forces
only, as they always put it, to defend our
own country.&quot; The problem, Ambassador
Kirkpatrick asserted, is that &quot;we can only
do good in the world if we have the power
 to do good in the
 world.&quot; Under the
 Clinton administration, &quot;American
 Power is being 
neglected and dissipated.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick's address, 
&quot;U.S. Leadership: The Uses and Abuses of
Multilateralism,&quot; is available from
Empower America's <I>Speeches and 
Lectures</I> senies.

<H3>Empower America Interview: Public Opinion Pollsters 
Edward Goeas and John McLaughlin</H3>
<P>
<I>Mr. Edward Goeas is President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Tarrance Group, a survey and research company located in Alexandria,
Virginia. Mr. Goeas has served as the pollster for a number of
senate and congressional campaigns. He is also the pollster for</I>
U.S. News and World Report.
<P>
<I>Mr. John McLaughlin is a partner of Fabrizio, McLaughlin &amp; Associates,
a national public opinion polling and strategic consulting firm
in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. McLaughlin has worked on hundreds
of campaigns, most recently as strategist and pollster on Governor
George Allen's campaign in Virginia.</I>
<P>
<B><I>Empower America:</I>What do you perceive to be the major issues
and concerns that will ultimately affect the 1994 elections? What
do you believe to be the &quot;mood&quot; of the nation and what
is on voters' minds?</B>
<P>
<I>Edward Goeas:</I> Issue concerns of the American public are being
voiced at two levels as we enter the final months of the 1994
election. One level is the actual problems voters are concerned
about, and on a second level they are judging incumbents and challengers
alike on their ability to address those concerns with common sense,
workable solutions.
<P>
As concerns over the economy (unemployment, taxes and the deficit)
have dissipatedeover the last year, the American electorate has
refocused on &quot;lifestyle&quot; issues. Crime has been the
major &quot;lifestyle&quot; concern that voters have focused on
for almost a year now, with nearly 41 percent of the electorate
mentioning crime as the number one problem facing the country.
Voter concern over health care, welfare reform, declining values
and education have rounded off these &quot;lifestyle&quot; concerns
now mentioned by six out of ten voters.
<P>
Candidates' ability to put forward credible solutions to these
problems has become much more difficult because of the skeptical
mood of the American elec
torate. After a brief period of optimism, voters have turned even
more cynical about government's ability to effectively address
the problems that they face on a daily basis. This cynicism has
increased as the voters have seen the solutions coming out of
Washington to be more government, more bureaucracy and the demand
for more of their hard earned money.
<P>
<I>John McLaughlin:</I> The Clinton administration appears to be better
able to run a campaign than a government. There is a large policy
gap between their rhetoric and the actual legislation they support.
This leads to three overall themes that appear to be undermining
Clinton's success among the voters. First, since Clinton's election,
American voters have repeatedly told us by a 2 to 1 margin that
they favor less government with fewer services as opposed to larger
government with more services. Clinton talks about less government,
but the facts reveal that all his policies point to larger government.
Americans are becoming more freedomoriented in a technological
age rather than the biggovernment orientation of the Industrial
Age.
<P>
Second, in June we asked voters if they were more concerned about
where a candidate stands on the issues, or about the candidate's
honesty. By a 7 to 3 ratio, the vast majority of Americans prefer
voting for someone who is honest. This is a direct
reflection upon President Clinton's character, or lack of it.
<P>
Finally, American voters are in the midst of a spending revolt.
In the late 1970's we saw America generate a tax revolt. From
our surveys of this year, the voters believe that the federal
government wastes $.42 cents out of every dollar it spends. By
margins of 7080 percent, they prefer cutting government spending
over any measures to raise taxes. Overall, it appears that the
1994 elections will be a state by state referendum for the Senate
and House on Bill Clinton.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> In your opinion, is there an empowerment agenda that voters
want?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Voters are looking for three things; accountability from their
elected officials, the opportunity for individuals and communities
to take more personal responsibility in both their daytoday lives
and their future, and the hope that a renewed emphasis on the
values of honesty, hard work, and a commitment to family and community
will once again put the American Dream within reach for middle
class Americans. The overwhelming majority of voters are certainly
not looking for government to do everything for them, nor are
they looking for an ineffectivc government that is always getting
in their way and hampers their ability to move forward. Proposals
like term limits and national initiatives and referenda receive
support from over 70 percent of the electorate because they are
searching for ways to have a greater say in their government.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The voters are looking for new ideas. They want to turn away
from the old failed policies of the past and try creative solutions
to their current problems. Voters seem to be very receptive to
the idea of cutting taxes to create jobs. And on a local level,
voters who elected Republican mayors Tom Fetzer in Raleigh, and
Bret Schundler in Jersey City, are efljoying more police on their
streets while at the same time seeing their local taxes cut. Other
ideas to which voters are extremely receptive include: term
limits, workfare, common sense solutions to crime, school choice,
and tax credits for health care coverage. All these ideas would
give people greater control over their lives, and less control
to government. Finally, technology is driving voter beliefs that
they can have more direct democracy.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>From your data, do you see a major shift on the horizon
in either the House of Representatives or the Senate for 1994?
Will 1994 be a vote on Bill Clinton's policies?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> As we enter the fall elections, it appears there will be a
substantial gain for Republic ns in both the House and the Senate.
In the Senate, it is likely that Republicans will pick up five
or six seats (with a chance of tak
ing control). In the House Republicans look to gain between
twenty-five to thirty seats (The last time GOP numbers in the House
were over 200 seats was 1954). The reality is that significant 
gains are likely for Republicans come November's elections.
 There is no question that significant gains will force Bill
Clinton to reevaluate the course of &quot;bigger government is
better&quot; that he has set for the country.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Since last year, it has been apparent from Clinton's lack
of success on the stimulus package and the budget that the Republicans
would have large midterm gains in both the Senate and the House.
In the House, there is a minimum gain of about 15 seats, which
are mainly seats the Republicans should have gained in 1992 after
reapportionment. Add to that the usual historical antiincumbent
setbacks in Congressional elections to the party that controls
the White House, and it's likely that the Republicans will gain
30 seats. A similar antiClinton trend in the Senate would find
the interesting outcome of a 5050 tie, where Vice President Gore
might have to cast deciding votes in the Senate the last two years
of Clinton's term. On the gubernatorial level, Republicans may
have 
the potential for even greater gains. The growing trend for Republicans
with new ideas to attract Perot voters and disenchanted Democrats
is one that appears to be wellfounded for this November's election.
Only the Republicans themselves could lose this opportunity if
they compromise on principle.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From what you see, what are the bellwether races in the
country that will show whether a shift is underway?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Without going into the numerous races that could be highlighted
as bellwether races, look for surprises in two areas&#151;the
South and West. The South is where resistance toward Bill Clinton's
overall philosophy of governance is
strongest. In the West, voters have increasingly felt that Clinton's
policies coming out of Washington are hostile to the West, and
they are looking to force Washington's policies to either help
or get out of the way.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The bellwether races in the country certainly include high
profile Senate races, however, for the Republicans to make gains
in the Senate, they are going to have to win in states where Bill
Clinton may still be popular, and the trend towards Republicanism
is less strong. For example, in the Senate, wins by Republicans
that would point to a landslide would include Maine, Ohio, New
Jersey, California, Wisconsin and knocking off Ted Kennedy. A
more important trend regarding ideas could be the successful reelection
of innovative and pioneering governors that Republicans brought
to office four years ago. Voinovich of Ohio, Thompson of
Wisconsin, and Engler in Michigan have all experimented with ways
to keep taxes low, keep the size of government in check and find
creative solutions to problems. At the House level, there are
very interesting races which are absolute bellwethers of change
in the nation.
<P>
Mark Sharpe defeating Sam Gibbons, the House Ways and Means Chairman
of Florida, would be a strong sign that goodoldboy politics is
over with. Tom Davig' strong showing in Virginia's northern suburbs
would show that a successful progressive local executive would
be able to bring new solutions to Washington. And in Rhode Island,
Kevin Vigilante's victory over Patrick Kennedy would be another
setback for the failed liberal policies of the past. Across
the board, the message is change. Republican candidates are
running with the message of change, and all the previously 
mentioned contests will show whether that  message has a
very partisan edge, or whether American 
voters are still confused about who will give them the leadership
they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>How much change do Americans really want in health care?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> After numerous delays and a year of debate, concern over government
control of health care, the threat of declining quality and increasing
costs, the possible loss of choice in the selection of their personal
doctor has left a bad taste in voters' mouths. Adding to these
negatives is the perception that, with the elections right around
the corner, it would be best to delay final action until the next
legislative year. In fact, the harder Congress pushes for a health
care bill this year, the more the voters are made to feel that
there is something to mistrust in Washington's motives. To many
Americans it looks like Congressional Democrats are rushing health
care reform only to improve their political health and not America's
health.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans want their health care system improved, however,
they don't want the quality of their health care reduced. An early
warning to the Clinton administration came in June when Governor
Lawton Chiles called a special session precisely to enact the
Florida Health Security Act. Republican legislators stood firm
in the state Senate and the House, and nothing passed. There was
very little outcry; in fact, there was a sigh of relief among
Florida voters. Our polls showed that the vast majority had health
care and did not want the government to take it over. Furthermore,
twothirds of the voters were not willing to pay more than $100
a year in higher premiums or tax increases for universalhealth
care. As the details about Clinton's health care plan surfaced,
the voters became extremely concerned that these changes will
reduce the quality of care while increasing the cost. With the
prospect of larger government intervention in health care, the
potential decrease in quality, and an increase in taxes or premiums,
Americans agree this is not the change they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your information, how do you perceive the American
people's response to the Clinton administration's welfare
proposals? Do they find them dramatic or cosmetic?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> The President has lost his &quot;New Democrat&quot; effort
to take over the welfare system as his own. Last year voters felt
that
 Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress would do a better job
reforming welfare over Republicans in Congress by nineteen percentage
points. After delayed introduction, and then introduction of a
plan that clearly missed the mark of voter concerns, Republicans
are, once again, seen as best able to address welfare reform.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans responded very well to Clinton's rhetoric to end
welfare as we know it, but it's just rhetoric. Since his first
proposal, they have found out that among those people who currently
receive welfare, over 80 percent of them will continue to 'receive
it under Clinton's welfare proposal because he has exempted the
vast majority of them from work lre requirements. Also, 
the voters are underwhelmed by Clinton's promise of government
subsidized jobs for those who cannot find work in the private
sector. This sounds like merely a shell game rather than an actual
improvement in the system. This is why Clinton would increase
welfare spending by $9 billion dollars. In contrast, there is
a real vacuum in the media to present more popular alternatives.
The best piece of legislation, by Senator Lauch Faircloth and
Congressman Jim Talent, has gone unnoticed. Although endorsed
by Empower America, no one has yet drawn the direct contrast to
the Clinton bill. While Clinton would increase welfare spending
by $9 billion, FairclothTalent would cut it by $5060 billion dollars.
Clinton would only take 12 percent of the people off the rolls,
FairclothTalent would take 50 percent off the welfare rolls, and
FairclothTalent has more initiatives within it to keep families
together and end the destructive disincentives in the current
welfare system.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your research, is America's
international standing an issue with the voters?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Traditionally foreign affairs does not play a major role in
nonpresidential elections. In this election cycle, however, background
noise from Bill Clinton's continual mishandling, and sometimes
total incompetence, in the international arena, has made nervous
voters, even more skittish about where our nation is really heading.
It is puzzling to the voters how, in two short years, international
respect for the United States can so quickly plummet with misdirected
foreign policy. The one issue that will play a major part in this
year's election is Bill Clinton's policy to place U.S. troops
under United Nations command. American voters reject this Clinton
policy in overwhelming numbers and want it reversed.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> At present there is very little immediate concern among the
voters with foreign policy, defense, or international issues.
This is primarily because there is no perceived threat to the
voters' freedom and international security. Nevertheless, Clinton
scores very low ratings compared to the previous Republicans.
It is paramount in the voters' minds that Presidents Reagan and
Bush collapsed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; while Bill Clinton
withdrew in the face of embarrassing opposition from a warlord
in Mogadishu and a band of thugs in Haiti. If there is an intemational
crisis where the United States cannot succeed to preserve this
feeling of security among our voters, Bill Clinton would suffer
drastically in 1996. The last election was an aberration, in that
it was the first election since 1932 where the economy was the
dominant issue. Every other presidential election in between had
an international issue as the dominant or leading factor in deciding
who would win.
<P>
For Clinton, the true wildcard would be a foreign policy setback.
Just like the Panama Canal became a symbol of weak leadership
under Jimmy Carter, Clinton's legislation to force the military
to accept homosexuals, illustrated from the start that he was
more interested in social engineering than.in protecting national
security. The subsequent defense cuts have actually provided reasonable
grounds for voters to believe any foreign policy setbacks are
the direct result of Clinton's policies.

<H3>THE SATELLITE MEDIA TOUR: Empower America's venture into communications
technology</H3>
<P
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;Reaching the public through earned media
opportunities poses a challenging task for any grassroots organization.
There are many methods for getting the message out, ranging from
the conventional news release, a static relic of oldstyle politics,
to building a new traditionl television or radio network, a costly
and cumbersome undertaking which ultimately reaches a minimal
audience.
<P>
Is there a better way?
<P>
New technology and the '90s information explosion have opened
the door to cheaper, more efficient, and more targeted means to
raise an organization's name and mission profile through the media.
<P>
One such method is the satellite media tour, which Empower America
has utilized with remarkable results.
<P>
Research shows that Americans are more likely to watch their local
news than network news. That means, in order to shape the debate
on current issues, it becomes critical to gain access to local
news broadcasts.
<P>
Using only a studio and uplinks to satellites, Empower America's
opinion 
makers can talk directly with your local TV news anchors and reporters,
free of the &quot;insidethebeltway&quot; news filter.
<P>
Empower America has conducted four satellite media tours. In September
1993, Bill Bennett discussed the results of the American Legislative
Exchange Council and Empower America Report Card on American Education
with local news stations across the country. Through the use of
fiber optics, Empower America chairman Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr.,
and other Empower America leaders, conducted a remote satellite
media tour in December 1993, live from Empower America's national
summit on the Clinton economic record. On June 6, 1994, Jack Kemp
and Jeane Kirkpatrick reflected on the 50 years since DDay during
a one and onehalf hour satellite tour for local TV stations doing
original reporting marking the 50th anniversary of that historic
day. And on August 11, 1994, Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. conducted
a tour on health care reform plans and the debate in Congress.
<P>
Satellite media tours have enabled 
Empower America's leaders to talk with 27 TV stations, in roughly
ten minute increments each, for live broadcast or livetotape for
later use.
<P>
And the cost? The D-Day anniversary satellite tour tells all. On
June 6, 1994, Empower America reached 2 million actual viewers
at a cost of onefifth of a penny 
per viewer.
<P>
Empower America used satellite communications to make available
its 60-second TV ad on the Clinton health care plan to 1,800 television
stations and cable carriers across the country, for their use
in original news coverage or as a public service announcement.
In this case, satellite technology enabled Empower America to
greatly expand coverage for an alreadyproduced product, at modest
additional cost.
<P>
Satellite communications technology is costeffective and highly
efficient for grassroots organizations to harness the same power
as tbe major television networks.
<P>
Empower America is helping lead the conservative movement through
this exciting information revolution.

<P>

<B>Remarks by George Gilder<BR>
<I>At EmpowerAmerica's
San Francisco Regional Conference</I></B>
<P>
...What's going on in electronics with this exponential upsurge
is not comrnodity competitioh, it's dynamic competition. It's
creative destruction. And what is optimal now in technological
competition, technology competition focuses on innovation, and
innovation is the pursuit of the temporary positions of monopoly&#151;that's
what innovation is. And innovation is an advance that nobody else
has for a while. It's a monopoly...That's what motivates high
levels of investment and risktaking in technology advance. But
if you begin a race by saying nobody can win, and nobody can make
any money, you essentially prohibit the creation of a real broadband
infrastructure in dynamic advances in electronics and communications...

<B>&quot;Building Bridges To Build
A Better Michigan&quot;
<BR><I>
By John Engler, Governor of Michigan Addressing the Greater Detroit
Chamber
of Commerce Mackinac Conference</I></B>
<P>
...How did we turbocharge Michigan's economy? By cutting taxes,
cutting red tape and holding the line on government spend
ing. We made tough decisions, built partnerships, and we worked
together. Just as Michigan companies are reengineering the way
they do business, we are reinventing state government&#151;from
top to bottom...
<P>
<B>&quot;Capitalism and Democracy
American Style: Can They Co-Exist?&quot;
<I>
By Theodore J. Forstmann,
Founding Chairman, Empower America Grants Political Conference</I></B>
<P>
..No political freedom, their words echo down to us, is secure
where the right to property, the fruit of one's own intellectual
or physical labor, is not strong. Government's job, our Founders
all believed, was basically to create a stable environment in
which free people could operate; to provide the permanent political
conditions in which economic changes would inevitably occur. This
was all basic noncontroversial stuff. And so, for example, in
Wilson's day, Americans paid no more than 10 percent of their
earnings to all levels of govemment. When the income tax was first
proposed in l909, one senator rose to suggest a constitutional
limit of ten percent. And it's staggering to reflect how this
suggestion was greeted. After further heated debate, the idea
was rejected on the 
grounds that if a ten percent maximum were set, the income tax
might inevitably rise to that ominous level...
<P>
<B>&quot;The Real War On Crime: 
States On The Front Lines&quot;
<I>
By George AUen, Governor of Virginia
Addressing The Governor's Forum</I></B>
<P>
...The surge in violent crime is more than a &quot;thief in the
night&quot; stealing some one's belongings. It is stealing something
much more precious: our freedom. It is denying our citizens their
unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
their right to work, live and raise a family without being terrorized
and victimized by violent criminals and lawlessness...
<P>
...There is only one way to stop it [crime], and that is to take
the people who are committing the violence&#151;that small percentage
of criminals who commit the vast majority of crime&#151;and get
them out of the free society that they have declared war on. Because
one thing is certain: The one place a violent career criminal
won't harm more innocent people is in prison...
<P>
..But the last thing we need from Congress is more expensive social
spending designed to fight crime. If social welfare spending were
the answer to crime, the street corners of America would be far
and away the safest in the world. This approach has failed us
for the past 30 years, and will continue to fail. We in the states
need flexibility, we need to cover the costs of prison construction,
and we need the freedom to combat violent crime with the commonsense
methods our citizens demand.

VOL. 2 NO. 3 FALL 1994
<P>

<H3>Empower America Draws the Line on Health Care</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151; Empower America's goal in the health care
debate has been to defeat any health care reform plan that includes
individual or employer mandates, price caps or controls, standard
benefit packages, more government interference, or higher taxes.
<P>
Empower America advocates more sensible, targeted health care
reform and is promoting marketoriented reforms that include tax
breaks for individuals and the selfemployed; making insurance
affordable, accessible, and portable; instituting taxfree Medical
Savings Accounts; medical malpractice reform; and voluntary purchasing
pools.
<P>
Empower America has been advancing its health care goals on a
variety of fronts, including an aggressive advertising campaign,
an effort to mobilize members and numerous television and radio
appearances.
<P>
The advertising campaign consists of a widely shown television
commercial and a series of more targeted radio commercials. Using
an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio of a normal
heartbeat, the television ad
states that President Clinton's plan would &quot;socialize our
health care&quot; system. The ad notes that small businesses will
be called upon to pay the bill for what amounts to &quot;the largest
government bureaucracy in history.&quot; As the text and the narrative
continue, the EKG and heartbeat steadily increase in speed and
severity, culminating in a flatline across the bottom of the screen
and a terminated heartbeat.
<P>
The impact of Empower America's television ad is best demonstrated
by the outcry from the White House and the Democratic party. The
administration and the Democratic National Committee have made
the following critical comments about Empower America's television
ad on health care.
<UL>
<LI>On May 21, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos appeared
on 
CNN's &quot;Capital Gang.&quot; A clip of Empower America's ad
was shown during this particular show. Stephanopoulos commented
that the ad was a &quot;scare tactic&quot; and that &quot;people
aren't going to buy it.&quot;
<LI>Democratic Media Consultant Mandy Grunwald called Empower
America's radio ads on health care &quot;partisan politics&quot;
in the Wall Street Journal on June 30. She went on to assert that
Empower America and The American Cause &quot;believe in doing
whatever they can to damage the president.&quot;
<LI>On a PBS panel discussion on July 18 addressing health
care advertising, Democratic National Committee
Communications Director Ed Lazarus called the Empower America
television ad the most irresponsible and offensive ad of the entire
health care debate. He characterized the ad as misleading and
called the use of the word &quot;socialize&quot; a scare tactic.
Lazarus went on to criticize Empower America for the negative
tone and the absence of an alternative solution to the health
care problem in the ad. At the same event, AARP Policy Director
John Rother and Health Care Reform Project's Bob Chlopak agreed
with Lazarus' assessment of Empower America's ad.
<LI>Also on July 18, Vin Weber appeared on PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour&quot; along with the DNC's Ed Lazarus, the RNC's Chuck
Grecner,
 and Bob Chlopak of the Health Care Reform Project (a group closely
tied with and partially funded by the DNC) to discuss health care
advertising. Chlopak said the television ad was &quot;aimed at
inflaming public opinion...There are no facts, no documentation
in the ad.&quot;
<P>
In addition to the television ad, Empower America has run a series
of radio ads on health care reform. An ad advocating a delay on
health care legislation until after the November election aired
nationwide and two other ads, which quoted prominent Democrat
senators, played in targeted markets. One ad quoted Senator Jay
Rockefeller saying, &quot;We're going to push through health
care reform regardless of the views of the American people,&quot;
and the other quoted Senator Ted Kennedy speaking of health
care saying, &quot;We l want people to understand very quickly
what they are entitled to and what they're not entitled to.&quot;
<P>
Empower America began its first targeted  state ad campaign
in Nevada recently. Nevada was chosen because a 
majority of its Congressional delegation has expressed support
for the Clinton health care proposal. The television and radio
ads created a great deal of media attention in Nevada and nationwide.
The ads generated a significant grassroots campaign against the
health care position of Nevada ' s more liberal members of Congress.
Massachusetts soon followed and other states will be targeted
as the debate continues.
<P>
Empower America's ads have also been featured in news stories
by ABC News, CBS News, CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; and &quot;Capital
Gang,&quot; PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,&quot; <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I>, Associated Press, and dozens of other media outlets.

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
<P>
<I>In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates substantial coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a snapshot of recent news stories that discuss
Empower America:</I>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>&quot;Empower America, the conservative coalition founded by
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, has
hit the airwaves with their own ads, which warn that the
Clintons' plan would 'socialize our health care.' These ads reflect
the growlng opposition to anything that smacks of another entitlement
program. That is the last thing that our fragile economy and debt-ridden
government needs.&quot;
<DD><B><I>The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, </I>May 26, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative political organization,
urged members of Congress to postpone final passage of any health
reforms until after the November elections. Its leaders, including
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Vin Weber, attacked the 'ttzggered'
requirement that employers pay for health insurance as 'merely
a rest stop on the road to socialized medicine.&quot;' 
<DD><B><I>The Ketchikan Daily News,</I>Ketchikan, AK, June 14, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;EMPOWER AMERICA CHOOSES NEVADA: Empower America (EA)
launched a TV and radio ad campaign in NV to oppose Clinton's
[health wcare] plan. The 60sec. ads are airing in Las Vegas and
Reno. 'Using an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio
of a normal heartbeat,' the TV ad maintains Clinton's plan would
'socialize' the system. The radio ad 'urges Congress to postpone
health care legislation until next year.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Hotline; </I>American Political Network, July 13,
1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America criticized Mr. Clinton's plan as socialized
medicine and urged that the health care debate be delayed until
next year after the November election when Republicans stand a
good chance of making significant gains.&quot;

<DD><B><I>The New York Times, </I>July 12,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;[William 1.] Bennett said that he prefers a [welfare] policy
that cuts off benefits for any illegitimate child born after a
certain date... 'If they know they will not get anything from
the government, people will have to change their behavior. The
real message is you should not have children...unless you are
able to support them.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Courier-Journal, </I>Louisville, KY, June 19, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;'This is classic Clinton [on welfare reform], except to
the nth degree: Overpromise, underdeliver, and then try to fudge
the difference, 'said William Bennett, former education secretary
and drug czar in Republican administrations who now heads an advocacy
group called Empower America. 'What we've got here is marginal
tinkering which will cost more money.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>Newsday,</I> New York, NY, June 15,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;A leading spokesman for conservative ideas, Bennett thinks
the nation can still recover its triedandtrue social standards.
'This is America,' [William J.] Bennett says. 'You know the American
capacity for selfrenewal. Look at what we have overcome in 200
years: England, King George, slavery, the Great Depression, fascism,
communism. This country has a tremendous record of going up against
very tough things and prevailing. But this one's a little different
because it's internal. But you never count this country out.&quot;'
<DD><B><I>The Dispatch, </I>Cookeville, TN, April 24,1994</I>
<DT>Jack Kemp, Codirector of the think tank called Empower America,
and a hope for imbuing capitalism with compassion, reminds again
how the most vulnerable among us were hurt by a welfare system
that sent a destructive message that was indifferent to a moral
life. 'It is an exarnple of how the capital of the human spirit
can be squandered in the course of a few generations,' he said
in a recent call for cultural and spiritual renaissance.&quot;
<DD><B><I>The Morning Herald, </I>Hagerstown, MD, April 13,1994</B>

<P>

<H3>Empower America Continues the Fight for Real Welfare Reform</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;At present, those pushing for welfare reform
in Washington must await the outcome of the health care debate,
and may have to wait until the next Congress to see any legislation
actually reach the House and Senate floors. Even so, the lines
of disagreement have been drawn during the 103rd Congress. The
benchmark for the debate was set by President Clinton during the
1992 campaign when he promised to &quot;end welfare as we know
it.&quot; Unfortunately, like many of his promises, this bold
statement has not been supported by any meaningful legislative
language from the White House.
<P>
Eighteen months into his administration, President Clinton introduced
his long awaited welfare reform plan. After capitu l lating to
the liberal special interests in the House of Representatives
(specifically the Congressional Black Caucus), Clinton unveiled
a plan draped in conservative rhetoric, but founded upon the proposition
that risking a rift between the White House and the liberal wing
in Congress would be too high of a price to pay in order to help
repair the societal damage being inflicted by the present welfare
system. The result of this capitulation is legislation that proposes
mere tinkering with the present system instead of true reform.
<P>
On the Republican side there is dis l agreement as well. As was
mentioned in the spring newsletter, Empower America
has helped lead the fight for legislation that will truly &quot;end
welfare as we know it.&quot; This means moving past the original
House Republican bill to a more ambitious bill. This approach
is embodied in the TalentFaircloth Welfare Reform Act of 1994.
The TalentFaircloth bill is based on three basic principles:
<UL>
<LI>Ending the subsidization of outofwedlock births;
<LI>Enhancing work requirements for individuals on welfare;
<LI>Controlling welfare spending.
</UL>
<P>
Although the Republican bill has some worthwhile provisions, it
does not take the bold steps found in the TalentFaircloth approach.
And while President Clinton gives lip service to the basic principles
found in the TalentFaircloth bill, his legislation violates all
of them.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Empower America effort on behalf of reform is continuing.
Empower America Codirector William Bennett has appeared at one
press conference on Capitol Hill to endorse the TalentFaircloth
bill, and at another press conference to decry the fraudulent
reform being proposed by the Clinton administration. In a USA
Today article, Bennett was quoted as saying &quot;the Clinton
proposal is a onehalf joke, onehalf fraud.&quot;
<P>
In addition to Dr. Bennett's many efforts, the policy division
of Empower America is lending its help to reformers 
such as Congressman James Talent and Senator Lauch Faircloth by
providing information to members of Congress as to the necessity
for dramatic reform. &quot;Many individuals on the Hill simply
don't understand the suffering being wrought by the current system,&quot;
says Peter Wehner, policy director for Empower America. &quot;We
are finding more members of Congress are willing to support the
TalentFaircloth bill once they are given all the facts.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will, according to Wehner, &quot;use all its resources
to help bring about real reform.&quot; The reason for Empower
America's tenacity is obvious&#151;the current welfare system
has wrought havoc on the American poor. After three decades of
welfare programs the nation is faced with an underclass that is
much larger, more violent, less educated and which consists of
an alarmingly high number of singleparent families. In short,
the system is destroying the American social fabric.
<P>
In addition to the TalentFaircloth legislation, Empower America
is supporting initiatives aimed at loosening the restrictions
on adoption (particuarly interracial adoptions), as well as initiatives
to bring economic development to the inner city through incentive
based programs. Hopefully, many in Congress will begin to see
the need for real reform and join in the fight to rescue our culture.
Until that happens, Empower America will stay on the front lines
of the fight.

<H3>Empower America Hosts San Francisco Conference</H3>
<I>Regional Meeting Draws 500 Local Activists</I>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, CA&#151;Empower America drew over 500 local activists
to its fifth regional conference, held in San Francisco, California,
on June 1, 1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage
conference participants in an open discussion with Empower America's
Codirectors William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and
Vin Weber.
<P>
The conference focused on the future of entitlements. Panel discussions
addressed different aspects of entitlement programs ranging from
the information superhighway, to welfare policy, to the current
debate over health care reform.
<P>
The first session covered America's newest entitlement, the information
superhighway and the direction of the current administration's
technology policy. Famed author and economist George Gilder advocated
free market alternatives to President Clinton's government managed
approach to developing information technologies. Other panelists
included Larry Ellison, Chairman of the Oracle Corporation and
Tom Hazlet, a professor at the University of California at Davis
who specializes in telecommunicadons policy. A lively discussion
followed panelists' presentations in which several conference
attendees shared frustrations with a governmentrun technology
policy.
<P>
Empower America Co director William Bennett led the discussion
on welfare reform from which several suggestions were offered
by both panelists and conference participants. Addressing the
status of the welfare system, BenneK told the grassroots activists,
&quot;The current system is a complete failure. We have spent
enormous sums over the past three decades on welfare programs
and what do we have to show for it?&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp provided the luncheon 
address entitled, 'Yhe Assault on Personal Liberty: The Clinton
Administration and the Growth of Entitlement Programs.&quot; Addressing
the recent growth and creation of entitlement programs, Kemp said,
&quot;Government- not the entrepreneur- is the centerpiece
of the Clinton economic plan. The notion that government can guide
America to prosperity is the fundamental flaw that fuels Clinton's
belief that 'government must do more.' This is wrong- individuals
must do more. The future of American prosperity depends on whether
we can roll back government's interference in our lives and allow
the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish again.&quot;
<P>
The afternoon session, chaired by Empower America's Chairman of
the Board, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., addressed health care reform.
Forbes opened the session by airing Empower America's latest health
care television commercial which criticizes President Clinton's
nationalized health care plan. Joining Mr. Forbes in the discussion
were health care policy experts Stuart Butler of the Heritage
Foundation, Merrill Matthews, Jr. of the National Center for Policy
Analysis and Sally Pipes of the Pacific Research Institute. Each
pol
icy expert stressed the need for free market health care reforms
as opposed to government managed proposals.
<P>
Forbes criticized the Clinton administration's assumption that
individuals can't be trusted to make sensible decisions about
health care and that the only solution is a government run system.
He advocated a new health care system based on private sector
decisions and reforms, such as tax incentives like medical taxfree
savings accounts. He emphasized that individual based plans have
eliminated health care inflation, and that individuals are very
capable of making free market decisions regarding their specific
coverage needs.
<P>
Empower America's regional conferences have served to unite grassroots
activists around the country in an effort to promote the conservative
agenda of limited government. The San Francisco conference received
national media attention which has helped Empower America deliver
its message to the American people. It is this message that; Empower
America will build upon as the'se issues are discussed during
the 1994 elections. For more information about Empower America's
upcoming events, call 1-800-4-EMPOWER.

<H3>Empower America Launches Candidate Schools</H3>
<i>Seminars in Atlanta, San Francisco, Detroit, New York and other
U.S. Cities To Teach 1000 Candidates How to Run and Win on the Empowerment
Agenda</i>
<P></CENTER>
ATLANTA, GA--More than 120 candidates and campaign managers gathered
in Atlanta, Georgia March 9, 1994 to attend Empower America's
Atlanta Candidate School, the third in a series of candidate training
seminars that the political advocacy group is holding this year
in cities across the United States. The schools are designed to
help teach candidates for local, state and national offices how
to run and win on the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Candidates for offices ranging from mayor and state legislator,
to Governor, Congressman and U.S. Senator, gathered at the Atlanta
Hilton and Towers to meet with Empower America's distinguished
faculty of policy experts, elected officials and campaign consultants.
Instead of discussing campaign management, fundraising and &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot;
techniques, they attended panels on the elements of effective
welfare, education, crime and health care reform policies, and
the importance of economic growth, free trade and lower taxes.
<P>
&quot;Our schools are unique,&quot; said Empower America Vice
Chairman Vin Weber, who is heading up the candidate schools program,
&quot;because unlike most traditional candidate schools, which
teach the 'nuts and bolts' of campaigning, Empower America's schools
are focused on ideas and issues. We are teaching candidates how
to campaign effectively on the empowerment message.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school followed two schools hid earlier this year,
in Washington, DC on January 11th, and at Stanford University
on February 17th. Empower America will be holding candidate seminars
in cities such as Detroit, Denver, New York and a second school
in Washington, D.C.
<P>
&quot;By the time the 1994 elections come around, we expect that
some 1000 candidates for local, state and national office will
have attended our schools,&quot; said Weber. &quot;We are essentially
working with the next generation of public officials, building
a cadre of new political leaders who share our belief in the empowerment
agenda, and who will help us turn those ideas into real public
policies at all levels of government.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school opened with a panel discussion on economic
growth and empowerment. Mayor Tom Fetzer of Raleigh, North Carolina
discussed the growing movement towards privatization and individual
empowerment in America's inner cities. &quot;From Raleigh to Jersey
City to Indianapolis, a whole new generation of leaders is rising,&quot;
Fetzer said. &quot;These leaders represent a political view that
emphasizes the empowerment of people over government and families
and communities over spending and programs.&quot;
<P>
At lunch, Empower America Co-Director Bill Bennett suggested that
candidates for all offices emphasize a message that focuses on
returning power to people and private institutions, not on government
solutions. Cultural renewal, Bennett said, &quot;has to do with
what comes out of TV and the radio, it has to do with the composition
of families, it has to do with the health and well-being of schools,
neighborhood institutions, communities, churches and the like.
If the country is to get better, to improve, it will depend much
more on the health of those institutions than it will on the things
that government does.&quot;
<P>
Ed Goeas, President of the Tarrance Group, a leading national
potting firm, told candidates that his recent studies indicate
that &quot;the American public wants change, and they want change
that is reasonable and rational. Policies which encourage real
welfare reform, real change in education, real economic growth,
and real reductions in crime comprise the real winning platform
for 1994, 1996, and beyond.&quot;
<P>
The earlier schools drew an equally stellar faculty and were also
heavily attended. At the Washington, DC school, for example, more
than 170 candidates and campaign workers from 31 states and American
Samoa participated in panel discussions featuring House Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich, Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, New Jersey,
former Attorney General William Barr, former Chief of Staff to
Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and Empower America's William
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. At the San Francisco
area school, more than 100 candidates participated in a program
highlighted by an address from Dr. Edward Tetter, former director
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the &quot;father&quot;
of the H-Bomb.
<P>
During his luncheon speech, Teller urged the candidates not to
shy away from foreign policy as a campaign issue: &quot;I don't
think I need to tell you of President Clinton's mistakes in the
realm of foreign policy. In the former Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia,
in Somalia, in North Korea, in Haiti, in every continent with
the possible exception of Australia, there have been mistakes.
These mistakes should indeed be discussed because of the widespread
belief that people will vote on the economy, on family values,
and not on foreign affairs.&quot;
<P>
All candidates who attend the Candidate Schools receive Empower
America's &quot;Candidate Briefing Book,&quot; with detailed chapters
on each of the issue areas discussed at the schools. Throughout
the course of their campaigns, candidates will also receive, by
mail and fax, &quot;94 Issue Briefs,&quot; expanding on the chapters
in their briefing books, &quot;Urgent Updates&quot; giving them
information on breaking issues that might be of importance to
their campaigns, and packets of material giving them more information
on the hot issues of the 1994 campaign cycle.
<P>
Candidates or campaign managers interested in attending upcoming
candidate schools should write to: Candidate Schools (Attn: David
Kuo), Empower America, 17761 Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington,
DC 20006.

<P>
<H3>Kemp, Bennett, Weber Call GOP Welfare Bill &quot;Too Soft&quot;
Urge Republicans to Unite Behind More Aggressive Reforms</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--In a move that drew wide attention in the media
and on Capitol Hill, Empower America Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William
Bennett and Vin Weber issued a memorandum April 14th, in which
they criticized the welfare reform bill backed by House Republican
leaders, and urged them to scrap the current plan and replace
it with a &quot;bold, principled and fundamentally different alternative.&quot;
<P>
The Empower America memo, released to coincide with a meeting
of GOP lawmakers to discuss their welfare reform package, sparked
coverage in several major newspapers, including The New York Times,
The Washington Times and several dozen regional dailies. In it,
the Empower America Co-Directors argued that the House Republican
bill &quot;falls short in three important areas: It contains no
serious attempt to curtail out-of-wedlock births, its work requirements
are weak, (and) its hidden costs are exorbitant.&quot;
<P>
According to Kemp, Bennett and Weber, welfare is illegitimacy's
&quot;economic lifeline.&quot; They argue that &quot;direct welfare
payments that subsidize illegitimacy must cad,&quot; and recommend
that &quot;beginning a year after the enactment of legislation,
women under 21 who have children out-of-wedlock ... be ineligible
for direct welfare payments.&quot; They also called for ending
benefit increases to women who have more children while on welfare.
<P>
In an interview with The Washington Times, Kemp stated that Republican
leaders must &quot;recognize that there has to be a more dramatic
effort at welfare reform if we are to end welfare as we know it--a
socialist, Third World trap permanently subsidizing dependency.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It would be irresponsible and politically unwise for Republicans
to assist the President in perpetuating welfare reform that is
too costly and too soft on illegitimacy and work requirements,&quot;
he said.
<P>
&quot;The central issue is people having babies out of wedlock,&quot;
said Bennett, in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Babies
are coming into this world with no fathers and ill-prepared mothers.
It adds to the welfare rolls, education problems and criminal
problems. It adds to the social breakdown of this country. We
have seen enough of the carnage, the cruelty, the 19 kids living
in the (Chicago) tenement, the babies left in dumpsters.&quot;
<P>
Asked what the goal of the Republican alternative legislation
should be, Weber, a retired Member of Congress and former House
GOP Conference Secretary, said that Republicans should frame their
welfare reform plan in a way that &quot;stops President Clinton
from passing a phony welfare proposal that sounds tough, but really
does nothing to bring about fundamental reform.&quot; The GOP
leadership, Weber said, must &quot;prevent passage of a bad welfare
reform package by using their plan to show just how bad the Clinton
bill is, and to force improvement.

<H3>Empower America Economic Summit Findings: Jobs Deficit Is Nation's No. 1 Economic Problem</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--America's number one economic problem is not the
budget deficit, but the nation's 5.4 million jobs deficit, according
to testimony delivered at Empower America's recent national economic
summit. Held in Washington, DC, December 14, 1994 exactly one
year after President Clinton's Little Rock Economic Summit, the
Empower America meeting brought together some of the nation's
leading economists, entrepreneurs and business leaders to assess
the state of the economy one year into the Clinton Administration,
and to develop pro-growth alternatives to Clintonomics. The goal
of the economic conference was to assess past and present economic
policies, and to propose an alternative growth plan for the economy.
<P>
In his presentation, Lawrence Kudlow, a noted economist and Empower
America board member, argued that ever since Congress voted to
raise the tax on capital gains from 20 percent to 28 percent in
1986, our nation's economic growth has fallen dramatically below
historic trendlines. This has cost America 1.3 million new businesses,
and has created a 5.4 million jobs deficit--the difference between
the jobs that should have been created and those that actually
were.
<P>
This jobs deficit is being created, according to testimony given
during the conference, because the largest job creator in the
country--the American entrepreneur--has been under continual assault
in the 1990's from higher taxes, more government red tape, and
diminishing incentives to risk-taking.
<P>
Chief among the problems with &quot;Clintonomics&quot; identified
at the conference is the Clinton Administration's core belief
that government is the most important actor in the economy. The
risk-taking entrepreneur is the most important actor in the economy,
argued Kudlow, not government. &quot;Far more important is the
individual man or woman, driven by a dream or an idea--the person
who is willing to sacrifice everything, to mortgage the home or
borrow from the family, friends and neighbors to start a new business.
So any true economic growth model must place the individual, the
investor and the entrepreneur at the center of the economic equation.&quot;
Kudlow said.
<P>
Kudlow argued that a direct link exists between several critical
economic policy mistakes and the plunge in entrepreneurial activity
in the country over the past eight years. The policies that have
caused this decline in job creation, which he compiled into a
list called &quot;The Assault on Capital Formation &amp; Growth,&quot;
include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> 1986 Capital Gains Tax Hike (20% to 28%),
<P>
<li> 1986-90 Social Security Payroll Tax Hikes (14.1% to 15.3%)
<P>
<li> 1989-91 Regulatory Reign of Terror owl bank credit
<P>
<li> 1990 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (28% to 31%) and temporary phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions
<P>
- Alternative Minimum Tax hike (to 24&#162;)
<P>
- Luxury and business tax hikes
<P>
<li> 1991-1992 Regulatory Mandates
<P>
- Clean Air, Americans with Disabilities, and Civil Rights Acts
<P>
<li> 1993 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (31% to 39.6%) and permanent phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions - Medicare tax cap eliminated
(2.9% tax rate) - Corporate tax hike (34% to 35%) and other business
tax hikes including entertainment deduction limits from 80% to
50%) - Other tax hikes: Alternative Minimum I Tax (24% to 28%),
Gas Tax Hike, Taxation of Social Security income.
</ul>
<P>
As a result of these higher taxes, business start-ups since 1986
have dropped dramatically below the historic trend costing millions
of jobs (see accompanying chart). According to Kudlow, &quot;When
taxes were low in the 1980's, we surged above the (historic) trendline
for business startups. Since 1986, as capital was taxed and incentives
diminished, we've fallen sharply below the trend, creating a 1.6
million business start-up deficit&quot; and the 5.4 million new
jobs that should have been created, but never were. Kudlow argued
that if the U.S. continues to &quot;strangle entrepreneurial activity,
America will find itself with European-like economic stagnation
and rising unemployment.&quot;
<P>
Also addressing the conference were Empower America Co-Director
Jack Kemp, Empower America board member Malcolm S. Forbes, Ir.,
and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-GA), who argued that
closing this jobs deficit required the creation of entrepreneurial
incentives through lower taxes on capital investments and income.
Gingrich took the Clinton health care plan to task, arguing that
the Clinton plan is an anti-capitalist proposal &quot;designed
to seize control of the health system and centralize power in
Washington.&quot;
<P>
The conference was aired live, gavel-to-gavel, by C-SPAN and covered
by both CNN and CBS, which broadcast Empower America's message
to millions of viewers across the nation. It was also covered
in 167 newspapers in 37 states, reaching well over 10 million
people. Since the conference, Empower America has been flooded
with requests for transcripts and videos of the event. To accommodate
this demand, Empower America has made available a 60 minute video
presentation covering the conference.

<H3>Simon &amp; Schuster Publishes Bennett's Index of Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--With the tremendous response last year to Empower
America Co-Director William Bennett's release of his Index of
Leading Cultural Indicators, Simon &amp; Schuster has released
the ground breaking study of our culture in book form. The new
book, published under the Touchstone Books insignia, is a significantly
enhanced version of the original Index, with new and updated data
on a wide range of cultural indicators.
<P>
The new Index is the most comprehensive statistical portrait available
of social and behavioral trends over the last 30 years. It consists
of five chapters: Crime; Family and Children; Youth Pathologies
and Behavior, Education; Popular Culture and Religion; along with
appendices on social spending and various economic indicators.
The cultural index is based on the government's &quot;Index of
Leading Economic Indicators,&quot; a set of statistics which track
the health of the nation's economy. The Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators is designed to provide a similar window into the state
of our nation's cultural health.
<P>
Unlike the first edition of the Index, this edition contains extensive
factual analysis of our current cultural condition, with commentaries
by experts and commissions that interpret and provide perspective
on the raw data.
<P>
Among the key findings: Over the past three decades there has
been a 560 percent rise in violent crime, a 400-plus percent increase
in illegitimate births, a quadrupling of divorce rates, a tripling
of the percentage of teenagers living in poverty.

<H3>Recent Visitors to Empower America:  Dr. Edward Teller, Father of H-Bomb, Criticizes Clinton-Gore Defense, Technology Policies</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--Dr. Edward Teller, father of the H-Bomb and one
of this century's greatest minds, visited Empower America, March
29, 1994 to meet with Empower America's staff and offer his perspective
on the Clinton administration's defense and technology policies.
America, Teller warned, is in a critical state of transition,
and the current administration is making serious policy mistakes
that he-said &quot;could lead to-very great trouble ... (and)
must be corrected &quot;
<P>
Teller specifically criticized Vice President Gore, who has taken
the lead in the administration on technology issues. Teller said
that Gore has been moving America from being a &quot;progressive
country&quot; into a &quot;reactionary country&quot; in terms
of its receptivity to new technologies.
<P>
&quot;When I came to this country in 1935 everything new was good,&quot;
Teller remarked.
<P>
&quot;Now everything new is under suspicion.&quot; As an example,
Teller cited the Clinton administration's gutting of the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). &quot;The Strategic Defense Initiative
is new and is good,&quot; Teller said. &quot;I don't see any argument
that would say otherwise. But in the book of Al Gore, SDI is a
form of aggression.&quot;
<P>
Teller argued that, with the rapid spread of technology throughout
the world, America's era of isolation and invulnerability is over.
&quot;America is no longer isolated. America today is as vulnerable
as Poland was at the outbreak of the Second World War, or even
more vulnerable.... Today Iran or Iraq could put a missile loaded
with biological material on a ship and deliver it from a distance
of ten miles to New York or Los Angles and actually kill 50 thousand
people,&quot; Teller said.
<P>
Teller further added that, while the danger of attack from small
hostile powers which are rapidly acquiring nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, is less awesome than that once posed by the
Soviet Union, it is also much more likely to occur. The danger
today, Teller said, is &quot;not as terrible as the danger (was)
from the threat of the Soviet Union during the Cold War --that
was a much bigger but much less probable danger. Now we have dangers
that are smaller but more probable.&quot;
<P>
But Teller argued that, despite the dangers posed by rapidly expanding
access to technology, government should not try to stop or interfere
with the progress of technology. &quot;We scientists are responsible
to find the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so far as we can; including potentialities, what can be done,
and how to use it,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not to be determined
by any elite, not by the religious community, not by the scientific
community and not by the political community, except to the extent
that the political community is an honest representative of the
people.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Teller expressed his support for the &quot;very widespread,
very thorough declassification of information&quot; which the
Clinton administration has recently proposed, because he said
that this declassification would encourage public understanding.
Public understanding, he said, is the only way to combat fear.
<P>
But he also emphasized the potential dangers of such declassification,
and cautioned that it not be misused. &quot;While general principles
and ideas can't be kept secret,&quot; he added, &quot;detailed
blue-prints and precise weapons procedures can be kept secret
and in some cases they should be.&quot; Limited access to this
information does not interfere with increasing public understanding,
he explained.
<P>
Teller said that instead of teaching people to fear technology,
or controlling technological advances, government should harness
technology to protect us. The United States, he insisted, must
use the technological know-how at its disposal to develop defenses
aimed at protecting the lives of its citizens.

<H3>Empower America Interview: David Kay Former Chief of U.N. Nuclear Inspection Team in Iraq Discusses North Korea,Emerging Threats to American Security</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In 1991, following the United States' successful prosecution of
the Persian Gulf War, the United Nations sent a team of nuclear
arms inspectors to Iraq to enforce Saddam Hussein's compliance
with the terms of surrender and supervise the dismantling of Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. What the U.N.
team found was horrifying--unbeknownst to the West, Iraq was less
than 18 months away from &quot;going nuclear.&quot; For the next
several months, Iraq played a cat-and-mouse game with the U.N.,
trying to hide and preserve as much of its nuclear capability
as possible.
<P>
David Kay led the U.N. team that discovered Iraq's nuclear program,
and stood down Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard when they tried
to forcibly prevent him from bringing proof of that program to
international attention. An eminent authority on nuclear proliferation
and national security issues, David Kay recently spoke to Empower
America about the current nuclear stand-off with North Korea and
the new threats to American security emerging in the post-Cold
War world.
<P>
Empower America: The conventional wisdom today seems to be that,
with the Soviet threat gone, America will face no major threats
to its national security in me foreseeable future. Do you agree?
If not, what are the emerging threats to our security in the post-Cold
War world?
<P>
David Kay: No, I do not agree. While the Cold War held the potential
for the destruction of our society as we know it --and we are
clearly better for its end-- the Soviets and the U.S. also had
forty years to learn to manage the Cold War in ways that limited
the likelihood of direct nuclear conflict. Today we are witnessing
the emergence of states and groups that are quite unrestrained
in their hostility to the West and willing to run what to most
Americans must seem like irrational risks to advance their interests.
Saddam Hussein's massive miscalculation in the Gulf and North-Korea's
dash for nuclear arms are but two examples of this new development.
<P>
The United States now towers above all others as the only state
in the world with the power to restrain the lust for domination
of renegade states and radical ethnic movements. It is inevitable
that these states will seek to threaten us and diminish our willingness
to stand in the way of their ambitions. Further, even under the
best of circumstances, the vast Soviet nuclear arsenal will take
more than twenty years to dismantle. In the worst of circumstances
some of the former Soviet nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
could well leak into the hands of states and groups hostile to
the U.S. or become the tools of a resurgent Russian dictatorship.
<P>
EA: How soon do you believe it will be before hostile states like
Iran and North Korea are able to directly threaten the continental
U.S. with nuclear or biological weapons?
<P>
DK: North Korea probably already has the capability to threaten
the U.S. with the terrorist use of biological weapons. Biological
weapons have undergone a largely unpublicized revolution in their
lethality and ease of production, and the Director of the CIA
has recently testified that two dozen states have active biological
weapons programs. North Korea's long range missile program is
surging ahead at a rate well ahead of estimates of only two years
ago. I would not be surprised to see North Korea, particularly
if its missile program is assisted by unemployed Russian experts,
able to field an intercontinental missile that could strike the
United States during the mid-part of the next decade. Well before
then it will be able to threaten U.S. bases in Japan and Guam.
Cruise missile technology provides an even easier path than intercontinental
missiles to reach the continental U.S. from ships off our coast,
and this threat will almost certainly be with us by the end of
this decade. The Iranians have already benefited from North Korean
military expertise, and it is reasonable to assume that North
Korea will continue to sell weapons and technology to all bidders.
<P>
EA: What can the U S. do to prepare for this eventuality? Where
should we be directing our resources today, in terms of defense
and intelligence spending?
<P>
DK: First, every effort should be made to slow and disrupt the
advanced weapons programs and cooperation between states such
as North Korea and Iran. While general export controls of the
type that were applied against the Soviet Union during the height
of the Cold War are no longer practical, it is possible to maintain
highly targeted controls on exports and technology assistance
against rogue states such as these. We should do this and be sure
that our allies and states such as China and Russia that want
to benefit from Western trade and assistance do so as well.
<P>
Second, we must develop the capability and political will to destroy
their leadership and political society if they threaten their
neighbors. While we are rightfully proud of the accomplishments
of the coalition military forces in the Gulf, the fact is that
poor intelligence and the lack of suitable weapons for penetrating
deep underground bunkers allowed much of Iraq's military might
to escape attack.
<P>
And finally, we must develop a credible defense capacity able
to handle the most likely threats to American forces abroad and
our people at home. By the end of the decade, we must either have
a workable cruise missile defense and the ability to intercept
a small number of long range missiles aimed at the continental
U.S. or be prepared to accept intimidating military threats to
our society.
<P>
EA: What is at stake with the crisis In North Korea today? Why
should Americans be concerned about North Korea's nuclear program,
and why is it In our national interest to stop it?
<P>
DK: Without a doubt the most dangerous place in the world today
is the Korean peninsula. Within 60 miles on each side of the Demilitarized
Zone (DMZ) that marked the end of the Korean War, approximately
37,000 American troops, 600,000 South Korean and upwards of one
million North Korea troops face each other. The North Korean regime
of aging Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-II, rule over an impoverished,
isolated relic of Communism which, if it were not for its military
might and its craftily constructed Image of unpredictability and
irrationality could be ignored until it collapsed into the footnotes
of history.
<P>
But the military might of North Korea is real. Its army is equipped
with Russian, Chinese and Korean-improved armaments that make
up in sheer numbers what they may lack in Gulf War-type quality
and precision. It also fields a battlefield rocket force capable
of reigning, with almost no warning, terror on the South's capital
of Seoul and U.S. bases in the South. Its recent testing of the
Rodong I missile with a range of at least 600 miles now brings
large areas of Japan into range. And most frightening of all,
the U.S. intelligence community is widely reported to have concluded that North Korea has deployed one or two nuclear devices from plutonium
illegally diverted from its IAEA safeguarded reactors. So nuclear
arms must now be added to the regime's armory of chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
Beyond the fate of South Korea lies the reaction of other Asian
states who have grown used to leaving to the U.S. the management
of regional security concerns. The Japanese may well view the
outcome of a U.S. policy that leaves them to live with a North
Korean bomb as just the opening move in the inevitable retreat
of U.S. power and political influence from Asia. Allowing North
Korea to cheat its way into possession of nuclear weapons could
easily bring an end to this stability and open the way to a less
safe, less open Asia. In this case, foreign policy does matter
even if you believe, &quot;it's the economy, stupid.&quot;
<P>
EA: What is your assessment of the Clinton Administration's approach
to the crisis in North Korea thus far? Is the U.S. approach today
making a conflict more, or less likely' What should the Administration
be doing differently?
<P>
DK: North Korea's nuclear bomb program has faced this Administration
with a set of circumstances that must seem to them depressingly
familiar:
<ul>
<li> Presidential rhetoric has set out a policy that on reflection
the Administration has neither the will nor the ability to implement
and now must find a way to abandon.
<P>
<li> US allies are unwilling to support the announced position of
the President.
<P>
<li> The existing intelligence committee and military capabilities
inherited from the Cold War are inadequate to either implement
the President's policy or to cope with the failure to implement
it.
<P>
<li> Even the best of what are now viewed as possible outcomes, leaves
the US hostage to the actions of irrational, unpredictable leaders
of a regime that has demonstrated implacable hostility to our
ally, South Korea, and to the U.S.
</ul>
<P>
But the allocation of blame should be the least of our concerns
now. There are three important steps that must be taken soon to
ensure that the least possible damage results from the situation:
<P>
First, the U.S. decision must clearly convey to North Korea that
any use by them of weapons of mass destruction, whether they be
chemical, biological or nuclear, would immediately result in the
annihilation of their society. If this is not to be dismissed
as just more overheated U.S. rhetoric then the forces that would
implement this policy must be visibly put in place. If we are
going to have to learn to live with a North Korean bomb, then
we must make it clear to the North Koreans that the use of any
of their arsenal-of weapons of mass destruction would mean the
end of the history of their political leadership. To live with
a North Korean bomb is to live with a regime that has cheated
and won. We will discover that the task of ensuring that victory
does not feed the North Korean appetite requires a toughness of
policy and resolution that has not yet been seen in Washington.
<P>
Second, the inadequacies in U.S. intelligence and military posture
which left the Administration with only a series of bad options
for eliminating the North Korean program must be put right. Proliferation
has already occurred, and North Korea will not be the last case.
The highest priority must be finding effective defensive measures.
As the Administration has discovered, it is impossible to build
a coalition in favor of standing up to a nuclear cheat when the
cost of doing so involves the destruction of one's own country.
Unless we can provide our forces and our allies with meaningful
defenses against missiles and aircraft, the prospect of controlling
proliferation will become much more difficult.
<P>
Third, we must make it clear that North Korea will not be allowed
to export its military technology to others. If North Korea will
not accept effective international inspection and controls on
its nuclear program (and this seems clearly unlikely), and if
the Administration is unwilling to run the risk of a war on the
Korean peninsula to eliminate the North's nuclear capability (and
this seems clear despite occasional Presidential rhetoric to the
contrary), then it is incumbent that we and our allies use our
individual and collective rights to ensure that all of the North's
attempts to export this capability are interdicted.
<P>
EA: You led the weapons inspection effort in Iraq after the Gulf
war which uncovered Saddam Hussein's advanced nuclear program.
What lessons can you draw from your experience in Iraq for how
the Administration should approach North Korea?
<P>
DK: The clearest lesson from Iraq is that the world is better
off to intervene before a rogue state acquires a nuclear capability
than to deal with such a state after it has acquired even a crude
nuclear capability. Korea is in many ways a tougher case than
Iraq. The North is capable of inflicting truly horrible damage
on South Korea with little or no warning. Our closest ally in
the region, Japan, can now be reached by missiles from the North.
While our ability to make the North pay a high price for any such
attack remains, we have little if any ability to truly defend
against such a blow and prevent massive damage to allies and significant
American casualties. Korea, like Saddam's Iraq is a revolutionary
state bent upon overturning the regional order. It is wrong to
assume that we share common objectives with such states and that
more or better negotiations will lead to an acceptable solution
that will provide long-term stability. North Korea under its present
leadership will not play a constructive part in a stable and prosperous
Asia. Our policy should be directed toward containing the destructive
forces of North Korea while waiting for the inherent destructive
forces of the failed regime to bring about its own collapse.
<P>
EA: Can the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
be stopped, or is their proliferation inevitable?
<P>
DK: Every effort should be made to limit the further spread of
these weapons. But regardless of how vigorous such efforts are,
I believe that further significant proliferation is inevitable.
It is therefore vitally important to ensure that U.S. forces and
our allies are able to defend themselves against the use of such
weapons. We must make clear to any rogue state that the United
States cannot be intimidated from protecting its vital interests
by their possession or use of such weapons. If these states come
to believe --and this is the long-range danger of the situation
in North Korea--that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would
stop the U.S. from protecting our allies and our own interests,
then the forces of proliferation would become unstoppable. The
most effective nonproliferation policy would be rooted in a vigorous
U.S. military capability to operate and advance our foreign policy
objectives in the face of such weapons.

<H3>Kudlow, Shelton, Coulter Join Empower America Board</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America announced that two of the nation's
most respected economists, Lawrence Kudlow and Judy Shelton, and
one of America's leading entrepreneurs, Jamie Coulter, have joined
the organization's Board of Directors.
<P>
Mr. Kudlow, former Chief Economist with Bear Stearns, served as
Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
in President Reagan's first term, and was one of the principal
architects of the Reagan Administration's economic and budget
policy. Most recently, Mr. Kudlow served as Co-Chairman of the
Economic Recovery Council in New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman's election campaign, where he co-developed the tax cut
plan that helped Whitman win the 1993 race against incumbent Governor
Jim Florio.
<P>
Dr. Shelton is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, and is one of the nation's
foremost experts on international monetary, financial and economic
policy. She is the author of several highly-acclaimed books, including
1989's prophetic The Coming Soviet Crash (which was translated
into German and Italian), and the forthcoming Money Meltdown,
to be published by the Free Press in April of 1994.
<P>
Mr. Coulter, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of
Lonestar Steakhouse and Saloon, Inc. since 1992, is one of the
nation's most successful entrepreneurs.
<P>
He has been responsible for developing and operating more than
250 restaurants throughout the United States. And, under the umbrella
of companies he controls, more than 8,000 people are employed
in 30 states. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Young Presidents Organization, Chairman of the Venice International
University of Leadership, and as a Member of the Board of Advisors
of the Wichita State University Center for Entrepreneurship.
<P>
&quot;Larry Kudlow, Judy Shelton and Jamie Coulter bring a wealth
of experience to Empower America,&quot; said Chairman Malcolm
S. Forbes, Jr. &quot;They will play a crucial role in helping
us develop progrowth alternatives to the Clinton economic agenda,
and to champion policies that encourage entrepreneurship, create
jobs and expand opportunity for all Americans.&quot;

<P>
<H3>Following Washington State Vote, &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; Initiatives Gaining National Attention</H3>
<i>Empower America Was Early Supporter of the Innovative Anti-Crime Proposal</i>
</CENTER>
<p>


WASHINGTON, D C - Last November, when voters in Washington state
passed Prop. 593, the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; and-crime
initiative, they had no idea they were starting a national movement.
But since the historic vote, in which the ground-breaking initiative
won by a margin of more than 3-to-1, versions of the Washington
state &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law have been proposed across
the country, at both the federal and state level, drawing support
from both Democrats and Republicans alike.
<P>
Empower America was one of the earliest active supporters of the
Three Strikes idea, which would place criminals convicted of their
third violent felony in jail for life, no chance of parole. Co-Director
William Bennett -- campaigned in Washington state on behalf of
the initiative, making public appearances, publishing op-eds in
favor of the proposal, conducting interviews with local media
and preparing taped radio &quot;actualities&quot; supporting the
initiative. &quot;When this thing passes,&quot; Bennett argued
during the campaign, &quot;a lot of other states are going to
do the same thing. We do not have a health crisis in this country.
We do have a violent crime crisis.&quot;
<P>
Bennett's prediction has come to pass. Since Washington state
passed Three Strikes in November, legislation has been introduced
in Washington, DC, and as many as thirty states are considering
Three Strikes proposals. An initiative process is underway in
California to place a Three Strikes measure on the 1994 ballot;
legislation was passed last March in California to require a life
prison term with no chance of parole for 25 years for third-time
felons convicted of two violent crimes. Governor Mario Cuomo (D-NY)
has indicated support for legislation involving Three Strikes-type
provisions, and even President Clinton stated his support for
Three Strikes measures for federal crimes during his State of
the Union address this January. Some leaders, such as Gov. Zell
Miller (D-GA), have even claimed that three strikes are too many.
Miller has called for a two strikes and life law.
<P>
The Three Strikes law is intended to target the small group of
repeat offenders who commit the vast majority of violent crimes.
Studies indicate that less than 10 percent of all criminals commit
some two-thirds of all crimes.
<P>
The popularity of the Three Strikes proposal stems from the growing
concern many Americans have about the safety of their communities.
Recent national polls have shown that Americans consider crime
the number one issue facing the country, and politicians have
responded to this sentiment by proposing a number of &quot;tough
on crime&quot; initiatives, both in Washington, DC and in the
states. In addition to the various Three Strikes proposals, both
Florida and Oregon are gathering signatures to put initiatives
on the 1994 ballot which have truth in sentencing provisions prohibiting
the early release of prisoners. The Florida initiative would ensure
that prisoners serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.
<P>
Critics of Three Strikes proposals raise the cost of incarceration
as an issue. But while the average annual cost to incarcerate
an inmate is $25,000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates
that the average annual cost to society of allowing a career criminal
to roam free is $430,000. Thus, the costs of keeping criminals
on the streets and out of prison is much more significant than
the cost of keeping them in prison.
<P>
Critics also cite the discrepancy in the severity of crimes covered
by the law. The initiative passed in Washington state includes
40 crimes as violent crimes, a list which some view as too long.
Critics also argue that the Washington law does not provide rules
to prove Three Strikes, an omission which is likely to set off
a Constitutional challenge.
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the Three Strikes idea has gained significant
popular support in the current and-crime climate. Three Strikes
proposals signify a tough, realistic approach to crime and get
multiple offenders off the streets and into prison where they
belong.

<H3>Issue Briefing</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
<b>The Clinton Health Care Plan: The Making of a Crisis</b>
<P>
There is an emerging consensus that the current health care debate
is perhaps the most consequential domestic public policy debate
in recent American history. The stakes are so high because of
what the 1,364 page Health Security Act, reduced to its essence,
represents: a power-grab by the federal government that is unprecedented
in its scope, its dimensions and its political ambition.
<P>
As the health care debate proceeds, it is important that we establish
a clear concept of what constitutes (and what does not constitute)
real victory by advocates of responsible health care reform. We
believe, for example, that the defeat of the Clinton health care
plan would be an unambiguously good thing. But we also believe
that the passage of a modified version of the plan or an &quot;alternative&quot;
plan which accepts many of the flawed premises of the Clinton
plan--the Chafee plan and the Cooper-Grandy proposal come immediately
to mind--is unacceptable because they, too, would inflict real
long-term damage on the country. In sum: many of the &quot;alternatives&quot;
to the Administration's health care proposals are merely distinctions
without essential philosophical differences. Their passage would
result in a ratcheting leftward--a steady, incremental march toward
statism and collectivism. And so they, too, need to be opposed.
<P>
The good news is that a thoughtful, humane, and essentially conservative
reform of the health care system is now within the realm of legislative
possibility. Opponents of the Clinton plan should therefore resist
the calls for premature capitulation or accommodation and build
on the momentum for intelligent reform. At the same time, we need
to provide a coherent philosophical framework by which to judge
various proposals--to better establish in the public mind what
we believe should be central, and what we believe is unacceptable,
to any health care reform. . .
<P>
<b>Crime and Punishment in America</b><P>
...Crime is one of the most important issues facing America. Government's
first responsibility is the protection of its citizens from &quot;all
enemies, foreign and domestic.&quot; Those who terrorize the lives
of law abiding citizens are, by any measure, enemies; citizens
deserve protection against them. Unfortunately, under our current
system, crime often pays; high crime rates reflect this. The odds
need to be changed back in society's favor.
<P>
The Solution: Incarcerate prisoners, build more prisons and correctional
institutions, enforce prison sentences, increase the police force,
focus on juvenile crime, reduce illegitimacy...
<P>
<b>School Choice</b>
<P>
...The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority. The American people sense this: more than 70 percent
of Americans support school voucher systems, and as of 1992, thirty-four
states had some form of choice legislation pending or introduced.
Increasingly, even teachers and education bureaucrats lack faith
in the system they defend--22 percent send their children to private
schools, for example, and the number is far higher in urban school
districts. The widespread support for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents--regardless of income
level--with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents now have
a choice --they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school. This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University...
<P>
<b>Clinton's SDI Cuts imperil America</b>
<P>
(Prepared exclusively for Empower America by Henry F. Cooper,
former Chief Negotiator at the Geneva Defense and Space Talks
and the first civilian SDI Director)
<P>
...In 10 years with $30 billion, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) made dramatic technical advances enabling the deployment
of systems to protect the United States, our troops abroad, and
our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack. The 1991
Gulf War demonstrated the importance of defending civilians against
missile attack, and Congress directed that advanced defenses be
developed for deployment as soon as technology permitted. The
Bush administration left a fully funded plan, approved by a comprehensive
Pentagon acquisition review, with options to deploy advanced defenses
for our troops, friends and allies as early as 1996 and for the
American homeland as early as 1999. After Clinton's first year,
what remains is barely a shadow of the Reagan-Bush SDI legacy.
<P>
The Bush plan to protect the American homeland against limited
missile attack by as early as 1999 called for 5-times the Clinton
budget, which aspires only to support a &quot;technology readiness
program.&quot; The Bush plan included 60 percent more for advanced
technology to assure that America excels at the very competitive
edge of the technology frontier. The Clinton cuts severely constrain
efforts to respond to reactive threats that will follow from the
inevitable measure-countermeasure competition--and will stop development
of new technologies...
<P>
<b>Goals 2000</b>
<P>
...President Clinton's $420 million education bill, Goals 2000,
falls far short of the mark of qualifying as education reform,
and provides for no real change such as more choices, greater
accountability, more
<P>
local control and flexibility to teachers. Instead, the bill contains
a number of &quot;business as usual&quot; options as well as a
number of potentially harmful provisions. Unfortunately, the Clinton
Education Department receives its marching orders from the education
establishment, which has opposed every meaningful education reform
proposal during the past 20 years. The establishment is largely
responsible for engineering the worst decline in the history of
American education. And they are now in the posit ~~n of defending
one of the worst-performing systems in the world.
<P>
Our education system needs entrepreneurial reform. Here's what
that might look like: reform measures providing for accountability,
decentralization, national standards in the core subjects, merit
pay, alternative certification, and allowing parents to choose
the public, private or religious school to
<P>
which they send their children. These proposals, if implemented,
would dramatically improve American education. . .

<H3>Bennett's <I>Book of Virtues Reaches</I> Nation's Best Seller
List</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett's
<I>The Book of Virtues</I> has reached number one on the national
best-seller lists, including those complied by The New York Times,
The Los Angles Times, and The Washington Post. The book, an anthology
of great moral stones, focuses on ten virtues: self-discipline,
compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance,
honesty, loyalty and faith. The purpose of the collection, Bennett
writes in his introduction, is &quot;to aid in the time-honored
task of the moral education of the young.&quot;
<P>
The book has proved not only a popular success, but a critical
success as well. It has received rave reviews in both the general
press and opinion journals from across the political spectrum,
including <I>Newsweek, Time, People, The Washington Post, The
Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, National Review</I>, and
<I>Commentary</I>.
<P>
However, despite the wide attention it has received, Bennett is
quick to emphasize that <I>The Book of Virtues</I>, was in no
way animated by politics. &quot;I commit a lot of political acts,&quot;
he recently told the Associated Press. &quot;This book was not
a political act.&quot; In a recent essay, Time magazine columnist
Lance Morrow echoed this sentiment, writing: &quot;Bennett is
not demagoguing the verities. He anthologies the old republic
and the old virtues, but he addresses virtue at a level of commonality
that is deeper than politics or nostalgia.&quot;
<P>
Perhaps what is most encouraging about the success of <I>The Book
of Virtues</I> is what it may say about changes in our culture.
The book's popularity seems an expression of the American people'
s desire to hear again --and to read again --about time honored
virtues. As U.S. News &amp; World Report put it in a recent article,
&quot;the Public longing for moral anchors helps to explain how
William Bennett's anthology ... was able to push shock-jock Howard
Stern's autobiography from the top of the bestseller list earlier
this year.&quot; Asked why he feels these moral tales have struck
a chord with the American public, Bennett answers simply: &quot;Unless
you're a criminal, these are your values.&quot;

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates a great deal of coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a sample of recent news stories that discuss Empower
America.
<P>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative organization, said Clinton's
(State of the Union) speech had one purpose: 'to resuscitate his
faltering health care plan,' which it said 'has steadily been
losing support with the American people.' 'He has manufactured
a phony health care 'crisis' to scare people into accepting his
plan to nationalize the health care industry,' said the group,
led by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and other conservatives.&quot;
<P>
--<I>San Jose Mercury News</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;Many conservatives say Clinton's (health reform) plan is
a liberal power grab based on the illusion that there is a health
care crisis. 'The crisis will come only if the Clinton plan becomes
law,' said a press release Tuesday from Empower America The White
House responded to such criticism with offers to back off some
of its more ambitious goals...&quot;
<P>
--<I>Orlando Sentinel</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;William Bennett--the former education secretary and drug
czar under the Reagan and Bush administrations--called for an
end to welfare, saying it fosters the dissolution of low-income
families. He advocated instead programs to strengthen the family.
He said polling data shows a change in values in America that
has worsened the crime crisis, with few modern parents looking
at their children as their most important priority. 'We have conducted
a social experiment in the last 30 years in this country along
these lines--what happens if we have lots of children and don't
raise them?' said Bennett. 'The results of that experiment are
now in.&quot;'
<P>
--<I>Pensacola News-Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick ... took Clinton
to task, saying his just-concluded trip to Russia and Eastern
Europe was a pullback of the historic U.S. commitment. 'The U.S.
performance was largely interpreted as a retreat,' said Kirkpatrick.
Kirkpatrick ... (was) in Miami for the third regional meeting
of the new organization, Empower America.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Palm Beach Post</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;During his visit to Miami Wednesday ... Kemp says his organization
(Empower America) is reshaping the party. He called Clinton's
foreign policy in general 'a disaster' and U.S. policies in both
Bosnia and North Korea 'an empty shell.' As for the problem of
ending the cycle of poverty in American cities, 'President Clinton
doesn't have a clue.' 'We've turned our cities into socialized,
almost Third World economies,' he said. Kemp shared the podium
with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
and former Education Secretary and war-on-drugs czar William Bennett
....&quot;
<P>
-- <I>The Miami Herald</I>, January 16, 1994
<P>
&quot;Jack Kemp ... blasted the Administration's first year as
a failure in foreign policy .... 'The President's administration
has been close to a disaster in terms of credibility,&quot; Kemp
said Wednesday. Kemp ... Ridiculed Clinton for allowing 'a bunch
of thugs with AK47 submachineguns' to force a U.S. Navy warship
to leave Haiti. He criticized Clinton for being too soft on North
Korea's nuclear threat, and said the administration has fumbled
the Bosnia crisis with its inaction.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Marietta Daily Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Vin Weber, Co-Director of Empower America ... (noted) that
the version of the (balanced budget) amendment sponsored by Senator
Paul Simon, D-Ill., that is being debated on the Senate floor
would make tax cuts designed to stimulate economic growth unlikely,
largely because any tax cut would be seen as adding to the deficit.
<P>
--<I>Investor's Business Daily</I>, February 25, 1994

<B>&quot;A Cultural Renaissance&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Jack Kemp, Co-Director, Empower America, delivered at Hillsdale College
<P>
...A government conceived in liberty has none of the tools of
tyranny. It depends, instead, on other institutions-- structures
between the individual and the state--that instill character,
purpose, and virtue. Churches and synagogues that raise a moral
standard. Parents who provide a moral and spiritual example to
their children. Schools that teach, not only the basics of math
and history, but the basics of citizenship and character that
come from an understanding of the Decalogue as well as the Declaration
of Independence.
<P>
Can we separate economics and values? The choice is not necessary.
The achievements of capitalism depend on the achievements of the
human spirit, nurtured in families. I am a believer in the power
and promise of free markets, free minds, and free nations. I am
also a believer in fostering the values that make them possible.
And I will admit no conflict between them. . .
<P>
<B>Commencement Remarks at Pepperdine University's School of Business
and Management</B> 
<P>
By Theodore J. Forstmann, Founding
<P>
Chairman, Empower America
<P>
...Basically, there are just two ways to organize society. The
first is the statist society, in which inequalities are reconciled,
resources are redistributed, and interaction is regulated through
the machinery of the state. The other is the civil society, in
which people organize themselves through voluntary association.
It's an old argument, filled with a lot of ideological 'isms'
and intellectual pretensions, but it basically comes down to a
question of who has the power to make some of the most important
decisions in your life. Do you invest your money, or does someone
else invest it for you? Do you choose your children's schools,
or are they assigned? Can you give to the charity of your choice,
or is the money funneled to state welfare programs? When you get
sick, can you pick your doctor or is your health-care plan prescribed.
<P>
The irony of the politicization of American life is that no country
on the face of the earth could be more ill-fitted for statism
than the United States of America. This is not a value judgment.
It is a simple statement of fact. For better or for worse, the
American spirit is not a bureaucratic spirit. It's a risk-taking,
rulebreaking, establishment-shaking spirit. While Western Europe
was groomed for statism in its centuries of monarchical rule,
America was born of revolution. For 60 years now, we have been
subjected to the materialist wisdom of the state as it imposed
ever increasing levels of social engineering. Today, sadly, we
all reap its non-spiritual devastating rewards...
<P>
<B>Closing Remarks at Empower America's National Economic Conference</B>

<P>
By Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., Chairman of the Board, Empower America
<P>
...We're living in a world where, more and more, capital is intangible.
It's in the mind. And if people don't have an education, don't
have that tool, they're never going to get ahead. They're never
going to fulfill their potential. This new age is symbolized by
the microchip which is extending the reach of the human brain
the way machines extended the reach of human muscle in the last
century. The microchip, which is doubling in power every 18 months,
will dramatically expand our standard of living.
<P>
Our nation must take the lead to create and preserve not only
a national environment but an international environment where
democracy, pluralism, tolerance and free markets can take root
and flourish. Only we can guarantee that this will happen. If
we don't take the lead in making sure that there is a benign world
order, an environment where freedom can flourish, no one else
will. . .
<P>
<B>&quot;An Agenda for Economic Growth&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Lawrence Kudlow, Economist and Member of Empower America's
Board of Directors, Delivered at Empower America's National Economic
Conference
<P>
...During the Bush Administration some Republicans became ashamed
of their support for a lower capital gains tax. They cowered before
anyone who cried 'fairness' and abandoned the effort to reduce
it further and index it for inflation. By doing so, they surrendered
a core principle of successful economic policy: the idea that
growth comes from dynamism, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship
and that we cannot punish productive capital with a confiscatory,
unindexed tax on capital gains.
<P>
The entrepreneur suffers the most from bloated government spending
because he or she looks to government for little, but pays the
most every time taxes go up. Government &quot;investment&quot;--the
latest euphemism for more spending--may help a special interest
group, but the rest of society will suffer as incentives are blunted
and risk-taking is punished. Our economic and cultural policies
should nourish and support the family and the family-owned business,
not undermine them. We must pass an end to economic and social
policies which obstruct risk-taking in the marketplace and traditional
values at home. We need a vision that offers people maximum incentive
to succeed and a complementary vision that offers them maximum
faith and hope when they go home to their families...

<i>Regional Meeting Draws 400 Local Activists</i>
<P>
MIAMI, FL - Empower America drew over 400 local activists to its
fourth regional conference, held in Miami, Florida, January 19,
1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage participants
in open discussion with Empower America's Co-Directors William
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Vin Weber and other political
leaders, in an effort to promote conservative grassroots activism
throughout the nation.
<P>
Participants in the Miami meeting discussed issues such as crime,
foreign policy and the economy at the one-day meeting. The morning
session, led by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett, focused
on national and community crime issues. Looking back on his tenure
as Drug Czar in the Bush Administration, Bennett told the grassroots
activists, &quot;I traveled to more than 100 communities in America,
most of which were poor communities. And whenever I visited these
communities I never heard people say 'let's deal with the root
causes of crime.'
<P>
What they kept asking me is, 'why can't you keep criminals off
the streets?' Our poor communities deserve the same protection
that society provides its more affluent communities.&quot; Joining
Dr. Bennett in the discussion were local experts who addressed
issues such as local law enforcement and community policing.
<P>
Among the highlights was a presentation by U.S. Senator Connie
Mack (R-FL), who addressed the conference on the Clinton administration's
domestic policy. Mack told the audience that since taking office,
President Clinton had largely backed away from his conservative
campaign promises. &quot;I'm very disappointed,&quot; Mack said,
'I'd give him a 'D' for his first year.&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp chaired the afternoon discussion on community empowerment
and conservative prescriptions for economic renewal. As for the
problem of ending the cycle of poverty in American cities and
promoting economic growth for all, Kemp said, &quot;we've turned
our inner cities into socialized, almost Third World economies.
President Clinton is moving in the wrong direction. Instead of
easing government's burden on the American taxpayer and entrepreneur,
he's raised taxes, discouraged entrepreneurship and now he's trying
to nationalize health care, all under the disguise of a recovering
economy he has inherited.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will be hosting its next regional conferences
in Houston on May l9th and San Francisco on June 1st. For more
details on how you can participate in upcoming regional meetings,
call Empower America toll-free at 1-800-4EMPOWER.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Assails Clinton Policy in Europe</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>


MIAMI, FL--At Empower America's recent regional conference in
Miarni, former UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick gave an assessment
of the Clinton administration's policy in Europe, arguing that
President Clinton's recent statements, and the U.S. performance
at the recent NATO Summit, were viewed by the Europeans as &quot;a
broad policy of withdrawal, (and) a weakening of America's NATO
role in Europe.&quot; According to Kirkpatrick, the Europeans
believe foreign policy is more concerned with power than democratic
ideals, and the Clinton administration's fitful responses to the
reemergence of Europe's historical balance of power concerns has
produced an unnecessary and growing ambiguity about U.S. purposes
in Europe and in NATO.
<P>
By its failure to exercise U.S. Leadership in Europe and in NATO,
and by delegating too much authority to the United Nations Secretary
General, the Administration, Kirkpatrick asserted, has permitted
collective security to be weakened and &quot;has had a difficult
time finding common ground with our European allies.&quot;

<P>
&quot;I am delighted and honored to be working so closely with
a unique organization that effectively combines ideas with activism,&quot;
said Forbes. &quot;This organization has grown to nearly 400,000
members in less than one year, and has an ambitious agenda for
1994. I look forward to building on this record of success.&quot;
<P>
In other organizational changes, Vin Weber will move up from President
to become ViceChairman of the Board. Weber will also join Kemp,
Bennett and Kirkpatrick as a CoDirector of Empower America, and
will continue to serve as chief spokesman for the organization.
Bill Dal Col, former Chief of Staff to Kemp, will replace Weber
as President.

<H3>What's Ahead for 1994</H3>
<P>
1993 has been a very successtul year for EmpowerAmerica. 
We created and built a brand new organization from the ground 
up, and with your support has forged it
into a powerful political voice for promoting
innovative ideas in the public arena. 
<P>
Now, as 1994 approaches, we have kicked off a number of exiting
projects for our second  year:
<UL>
<LI>To make sure that the campaigns of 1994 are tough on the
issues you and I care about, next year Empower America will be
hosting candidate training schools across the United States.
<LI>On Decomber 14, 1993, the one year anniversary of  President
Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock, Empower  America will
be hosting an economic summit of its own to assess the Clinton
Administration's perforrnance and to begin developing alternatives
to Clinton's economic agenda. <A HREF="/empower/aehigh21_2.html">
(see article)</A>.
<LI>In 1993, Empower America worked hard to promote Proposition
174, the California school choice initiative, and Proposition
593 the anticrime initiative  in Washington State, which places
repeat offenders convicted of their third felony in jail for life,
with no chance of parole, probation or work release. In 1994,
we will be backing more of these kinds of grassroots campaigns
in states across the country.
<LI>As the Clinton team continues to grope for a coherent foreign
policy we believe it is time for a serious dialogue on preserving
America 's leading role on the world stage. To this end, Empower<B>
</B>America plans<B> </B>to host its first major conference on
international issues.
<LI>And finally we will continue to expand Empower America's
efforts to bring our message of empowerment, opportunity and entrepreneurial
capitalism to new groups of citizens by establishing Empower America's
&quot;Community Empowerment Project.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
As you can see, 1994 will be an important year for us. We look
forward to working with you, and to seeing you at our 1994 regional
conferences. Please keep us informed about your ideas on how we
can make EA more effective in fighting for the ideas we believe
in.
<P>

<H3>NAFTA Approved by Congress</H3>
<P>
<I>Empower America Campaign Credited as Central to Securlng NAFTA
Victory</I>
<P>
<B>Washington, DC  </B>On November 17, the House of Representatives
voted 234 200 to approve The <B>North American Free Trade
Agreement</B> (NAFTA), the historic accord which will now link the
economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada into the world's
largest and most powerful free trading bloc. Days later the accord
easily passed the Senate, and will now be implemented beginning
January 1,1994.
<P>
The battle for NAFTA was hard fought, and Empower America's efforts
to help pass the trade pact were described by many as central
to the victory in Congress. In an article published before the
House vote, columnist Morton Kondracke praised Empower America's
efforts on behalf of NAFTA, calling them a model for other conservative
leaders to emulate. Empower America and its CoDirector Jack Kemp,
Kondracke wrote, &quot;are doing what the entire GOP leadership
should be doing: making passage of NAFTA one of its top priorities
for 1993... Kemp boosts NAFTA in every speech, blankets the nation's
oped pages with proNAFTA columns and is circulating a...proNAFTA
(open letter to America) among the nation's governors. Now other
GOP leaders need to take up the cause in an equally public way.&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Empower America was one of the earliest vocal supporters
of NAFTA. Early on, Kemp published proNAFTA opeds that ran in
newspapers in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois,
Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Texas, Georgia, Arizona and
Massachusetts, spreading the NAFTA message to some 4.17 million
Americans. And, as the House vote neared, Kemp played a key role
delivering the GOP vote for NAFTA and winning over undecided House
Republicans
<P>
Empower America concentrated its efforts on bringing in the votes
of undecided Republicans, many of whom supported NAFTA in principle
but were hesitant to &quot;deliver a big victory for Bill Clinton.&quot;
Just one week before the vote, Kemp held a private, closed door
meeting on Capitol Hill with some 40 undecided GOP House Members
to discuss their concerns about the vote. Paraphrasing Lincoln,
Kemp told the Republicans to vote on their convictions on NAFTA
because &quot;you serve your party by serving your country.&quot;
Immediately following the meeting, Kemp held a Capitol Hill press
conference, at which several previously undecided Members announced
their support for NAFTA.
<P>
The following Sunday, Kemp appeared on &quot;This Week With David
Brinkley&quot; to argue the case for NAFTA. The next night, just
two days before the vote, Kemp took on conservative NAFTA
opponent Pat Buchanan in a oneonone debate, broadcast on CNN's
&quot;Larry King Live&quot;. The day before the vote, Kemp published
an editorial in the Washington Post, cowritten with Rep. Dick
Armey (TX), laying out the reasons why conservatives should support
NAF TA. And Kemp worked the phones lobbying Members who were still
wavering.
<P>
In the end, all these efforts paid off, as Republicans came through
for NAFTA, voting in favor by an overwhelming 132-43. The solid
GOP support provided the margin of victory for NAFTA&#151; as
the final tally showed, Clinton would never have succeeded in
passing the accord had he depended solely on his party's vote
in Congress.
<P>
With NAFTA now signed into law, Empower America is now calling
on the Clinton Administration to use the momentum the GOP has
provided him on free trade, and move quickly to expand NAFTA to
other Latin American countries. In a Wall Street Journal oped
published just after the House vote, Empower America President
Vin Weber called on the President to immediately &quot;pursue
the next step in building a hemispheric free trade zone: negotiations
to incorporate Chile, Argentina and Venezuela into the NAFTA trading
bloc.&quot;
<P>
Whether Clinton heeds this advice and continues to support free
trade policies, or seeks to heal his Administrations wounds
with organized labor by moving left again, remains to be seen.
But one thing is certain: thanks to the support of Congressional
Republicans, Ronald Reagan's vision of a North American free
trade zone has finally become a reality. Empower America is proud
to have played a major role in this historic effort.

<H3>The Forced Collectivization of Medicine</H3>
<P>
By Jack Kemp
<P>
After a Clinton Administration official let slip that 40% of Americans
will pay more under its health care plan, the President's media
rapid response team went immediately into action...to change the
subject.
<P>
The diversion they chose was a frontal assault on insurance companies.
&quot;It is time,&quot; Hillary Clinton told an audience of doctors,
&quot;for...every American to stand up and say to the insurance
industry, 'Enough is enough. We want our health care system back.'...It
is time we stood up and said, 'We are tired of insurance companies
running our health care system.'&quot;
<P>
The First Lady's attack would have been more credible if not for
this ironic fact: The centerpiece of the Clinton health plan is
a dramatic increase in the power of insurance companies over the
health of Americans&#151;the power to ration medical care.
<P>
Remember, first, how the Clinton proposal is designed to cut health
costs. It would create regional &quot;Health Alliances&quot; that
would enforce a health care budget by placing legal limits on
what insurance companies could charge. Insurers could be fined
if their premiums don't meet these caps on health costs.
<P>
The result? Only those insurance companies that place the most
effective, restrictive controls on what they are charged by doctors
and hospitals will survive. By some estimates, only 5 or 6 insurers
will remain, and each of these companies will provide &quot;managed
care&quot;&#151; programs to cut costs and meet a budget set by
government.
<P>
How is that budget met? Insurance companies will dictate how doctors
and hospitals reduce expenses. Insurance reviewers, or &quot;gatekeepers,&quot;
will micromanage medical treatments to cut costs, secondguessing
doctors and nurses. These bureaucrats with little direct knowledge
of a patient, will effectively have the final say on what specialists
that patient can see, or what tests and technology they deserve.
<P>
This, in essence, is the Clinton plan: Big government would require
a few big insurance companies to meet smaller health budgets.
Those companies, to cut costs, would do the dirty work of rationing.
<P>
Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute recently described how this
rationing process works in other nations with nationalized health
care. In Canada, hundreds of medical procedures and drugs that
once were covered by national insurance have been declared too
expensive and are no longer paid for&#151;a process Canadians
call &quot;delisting.&quot;
<P>
In Germany, a 1989 reform reduced the range of medical services
covered by that nation's &quot;social insurance&quot; program.
The story is similar in Britain, Spain, Sweden&#151; and Oregon.
Yes, Oregon.
<P>
That state's Medicaid program lists 709 medical services in order
of urgency. The list is then matched against the amount of government
funding available in the health budget. Only 535 medical procedures
made the cut this year, while the remainder will not be paid.
So, for example, the treatment of swelling of the esophagus&#151;
numbered 538&#151;is covered. Disk surgery&#151;number 536 --is
not.
<P>
The Clinton plan's national budget for health care would make
this kind of rationing inevitable for every American.
<P>
&quot;When individuals pay for their own health care,&quot; Michael
Tanner concludes, &quot;they decide what services to buy. When
government pays for health care, it decides what services it will
pay for. The availability of health care services becomes subject
to the whims of majority rule.&quot;
<P>
Even Stanford University's Alain Enthoven, one of the original
designers of &quot;managed competition,&quot; has opposed the
Clinton plan because it uses health alliances to impose price
controls.
<P>
Nationalized health care always puts bureaucrats in the business
of choosing who deserves care, and who does not. In the Clinton
plan, those bureaucrats would work for insurance companies, enforcing
a health budget set by the government. In other countries, those
bureaucrats work for the government directly. The effect, in
either case, is precisely the same: a decline in the quality
and accessibility of medicine.
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine: The Clinton Health Care Plan</B>
<P>
Despite the hours of television time and millions of dollars spent
by the Clinton Administration to drum up support for its health
care reform plan, the public isn't being told much about the details.
A close look at these details reveals why:<B> </B>the President's
health care plan masks the largest power grab by the federal government
in recent history.
<P>
Here's what the Clinton administration won't tell you about their
health care plan:
<P>
I. <B>Government bureaucracies will be granted massive new powers
to ration care, set price controls, and eliminate competition.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Price Controls: Central to the President's plan is the
creation of a new bureaucracy, the National Health Board (NHB)
which would set &quot;global budgets,&quot; or limits on the total
amount of public and private spending on health care. It would
also set price controls on insurance premiums and prescription
drug prices.
<LI>Rationed Care: If total health care spending exceeds the
governmentset &quot;global budget,&quot; rationing must follow.
Managedcare &quot;gatekeepers&quot; will have systemic incentives
to ration care to comply with the spending caps imposed on them
by governmental health bureaucracies.
<LI>Tyrannical Enforcement: The National Health Board would
also have bigbrotherish enforcement powers. If a state fails to
fully comply with its edicts, the NHB can cut off all health care
funds to the state or direct the Secretary of the Treasury to
impose a payroll tax on every employer in the state.
<LI>Outlawing Traditional Medicine: Everyone will be required
to purchase insurance through governmental &quot;health alliances&quot;
in each region. Health alliances choose which insurance plans
consumers can choose among; they can shut out any plan whose premium
is 20% above the average,
thereby eliminating feeforservice (traditional) medicine and forcing
all residents of a particular region into HMOs. Clinton's plan
could take away citizens' ability to choose their doctor.
</UL>

<B>II. The President's plan cannot be
 paid for without drastic tax or deficit increases.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Underestimated Costs: Clinton originally estimated the
cost of his plan to be $30 billion; now, most economists place
that figure at least $120 billion higher. Harvard Economist Martin
Feldstein estimated that the plan would require an additional
$120 billion in taxes in the first year alone.
<LI>Unrealistic Expectasions: The President plans to expand
Medicare to include prescription drug and longterm care coverage
(price tag: $152 billion) while realizing a net savings of $124
billion:cutting &quot;waste and fraud.&quot; He relies on a steep new
cigarette tax to finance the bulk of government subsidies, even
though many studies have shown that his tax will bring in less
than half of the revenues he is counting on.
</UL>
<B>III. Economic downturn and job destruction will result.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Employer Mandates: Small companies will face a payroll
tax of 3.5%&#151;an estimated $29 billion in new costs to those
small companies which now account for around 80% of new job creation.
Larger companies would have to pay 7.9% of their payroll.
<LI>Job Loss: The Employment Policies Institute estimates that
Clinton's employer mandates will eliminate 3.1 million jobs.
<LI>Dislocation: The health care industry accounts for 14%
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 10 million people.
Huge changes in the structure and delivery of health care will
lead to significant dislocation and further job loss.
<LI>Stunted Innovations: Price controls on premium caps and
drug prices will stunt pharmaceutical and biomedical research
and development, which in turn, will postpone or eliminate the
opportunity to develop new drugs, prevention medicines, and disease
cures.
</UL>
<B>IV. Clinton's health plan strips individuals of choice,
autonomy, and privacy.</B>
<UL>
<LI>No Choice of Benefits: The Clinton Administration will
draw up a &quot;standardized benefits package;'9 that every American
is required to purchase. The content of this package will inevitably
be politicized.
<LI>Loss of Medical Privacy: Clinton would require every American
to carry with them at all times a &quot;National Health Care Card&quot;
which would contain one's entire medical history on a computerized strip. 
Anyone who can gain
electronic access (legally or illegally) to the computer system
could access an individual's medical records.
</UL>

<P>
President Clinton's health care plan begins with a wrong assumption
and ends with the wrong treatment. The President seeks to convince
us that our health care system&#151;which has consistently delivered
the best, most technologically advanced care in the world&#151;is
so broken that it must be replaced by bureaucracies and governmental
oversight. The flaws of our current health care system are real
and demand redress; changes in malpractice, tax, and insurance
laws are all necessary. But President Clinton's plan to disempower
Americans by placing the government in charge of health care will
ultimately result in higher prices, greater inefficiency, and
poorer health care.

<H3>EmpowerAmerica Launches 1994 Candidate Schools</H3>
<P>
Empower America is initiating a series of issues-oriented 1994
Candidate Schools to provide candidates at the local, state, and
national levels a coherent and comprehensive empowerment agenda.
These schools, to be held early next year in Washington, D.C.,
San Francisco, Denver, Detroit, Atlanta, and New York will focus
on economic competitiveness, growth, and entrepreneurship, free
trade, international leadership, health care, as well as education,
welfare, and crime.
<P>
Currently there are a number of political schools that address
the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns: fundraising, electoral strategies,
opposition research, and direct mail. What is missing, however,
are schools that present candidates with the <I>substantial </I>elements
of a political agenda and how best to campaign on such issues.
<P>
Candidates will be given a briefing book and a series of papers
authored by policy experts explaining the elements of the empowerment
agenda. Each candidate school will then be led by policy experts
who will explain the issues in detail, and political analysts
and pollsters who will instruct candidates on how to translate
the agenda into a winning campaign. Empower America's principals,
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber will
offer insights based on their political experience in governmental
leadership.

<H3>From the Grassroots....</H3>
<P>
Empower America held three successful grassroots events during the fall.
In Los Angeles, California, William Bennett, Vin Weber and Jack
Kemp greeted over 700 Empower America associates and supporters
at a highenergy reception honoring several of that city's noteworthy
citizen! who are devoted to the ideals of empowering individuals.
Also, it was our pleasure to be joined by Robert Woodson, Sr.
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, Orson Swindle
of Empower America, and Leon Watkins of the Family Help Line,
all of whom played essential roles in the evening's success.
<P>
In Dallas, Texas, our members gathered for a daylong conference
led by Jack Kemp and Vin Weber to address topics of vital interest
to southwest America. The eloquent conservative insight of former
Chief of Staff to Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and the hardhitting
pragmatism of Dallas' own, Mayor Steve Bartlett were major attractions.
We were also joined by local area experts for panel discussions
on the economy and NAFTA.
<P>
In New York City, Empower America held a dinner and panel discussion
with some notable conservative leaders. Joining Jack Kemp, Bill
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, was radio talk show
host Rush Limbaugh. Also in attendance was National Review founder
and Editor-at-Large William F. Buckley, Jr.
<P>
We are currently scheduling 1994 conferences for Miami, Houston,
San Francisco, and New York.

<H3>Empower America and GrassRoot state Initiatives</H3>
<P>
By William J. Bennett
<P>
On November 2,1993, citizens of the C November 2,1993, citizens
of state of Washington passed two important referenda that should
serve as models to other states, and will hopefully be a harbinger
of things to come. Their success reflects a growing (and healthy)
citizen conviction that government's primary duty is to protect
its people, rather than confiscate and redistribute their income.
<P>
Proposition 593, also known as &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out,&quot;
will place criminals convicted of their third violent felony in
prison for life, with no chance for parole, probation, or work
release. The simple logic of ensuring the incarceration of the
most dangerous and violent criminals made plenty of sense to the
citizens of Washington state; &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot;
garnered the support of 75% of the voters.
<P>
The reasons for Proposition 593's landslide victory are straightforward:
violent crime is destroying our social and civic order. And despite
evidence that the crime problem is largely caused by a small group
of hardcore criminals (studies indicate that two thirds of all violent
crimes are committed by less than 10 percent of criminals), government
has done little to protect law abiding citizens from these predators.
While the modern state has expanded its reach into virtually every
aspect of citizens' lives, it has increasingly abdicated its first
responsibility: to ensure public safety. Citizens are afraid and
they want to fight back; the passage of &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; is a very good start. It may well serve as a blueprint
for other states, and has already been passed as an amendment
to a comprehensive crime bill awaiting passage in the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Voters also registered their opposition to an ever expanding &quot;nanny
state&quot; that takes too much from us in order to do too much
for us.
<P>
Proposition 601 restrains future state spending growth and tax
increases by limiting the growth of the state budget to the population
and inflation growth rate and mandates that any new tax increase
must be approved by the voters. Proposition 601's success heralds
a rising tide of public support for job creation over social service
expansion, and economic opportunity over higher spending. Today
there is an enormous gap between what people believe government
can do and what it actually can do. The passage of Proposition
601 is a first step toward narrowing the gap and securing a progrowth,
fiscally responsible economic program.
<P>
Conservatives need to lead a national conversation that examines
anew the relationship between government and the governed. What
happened on the first Tuesday in November was a good place to
begin. And events in Washington state should remind people to
look less to the nation's capital and more to the states and localities,
those &quot;laboratories of democracy,&quot; where the most innovative
reforms are taking place.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>

This has been a very busy three months. We launched our grassroots
citizens' action campaign to defeat the Clinton tax increases.
The Clinton plan wilI~ raise taxes, destroy jobs and increase&#151;not
lower&#151;the federal budget deficit. We worked hard to defeat
it. Many of you received your Tax Action Packet, which explained
what you could do in your own state to help defeat the Clinton
plan. Jack Kemp, WilL; am Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and I gave
literally hundreds of radio and TV interviews, attacking the plan
and explaining why it will be so destructive to our economy. We
also launched an eightstate grassroots lobbying campaign to put
voter pressure on speciallytargeted, key &quot;swing vote&quot;
Senators. We appreciate the thousands of petition signatures that
you gathered and returned to us. And thanks to your generous support,
we were able to produce and place antitax radio ads on the Rush
Limbaugh show.
<P>
We're also working to promote positive change in America. We've
gotten behind the &quot;A Better Choice&quot; school choice ballot
initiative in California. It's the kind of innovative empowerment
idea America needs. It's a tough fight&#151;the antichoice forces
are spending millions of dollars to defeat us. But we're fightina
to win.
<P>
School choice will be one of the central themes at Empower America's
reception in Los Angeles September 23rd. The evening will feature
speeches by both William Bennett and Jack Kemp.
<P>
Our first conference in Milwaukee was a huge hit&#151;we sold
out all 700 spots. We'll also be holding regional conferences
this year in Dallas, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona. To get a copy
of our special video of the Milwaukee conference, send in the
form on the last page of this newsletter.
<P>
We look forward to seeing many of you in LA, and appreciate all
your hard work in the antitax effort. Together, we can make a
difference.
<P>
<B>Vin Weber, President</B>

<H3>Warning: Tax Hikes Ahead</H3>
<I>Clinton Budget is mined with more taxes, new spending</I>
<P>
<B>By Jack Kemp</B>
<P>
Three years ago, Americans were hit with the highest tax increase
in history because of the disastrous 1990 Budget Deal that was
sold on the promise to reduce the deficit by $500 billion. Sound
familiar? The result: the deficit exploded to over $300 billion,
taxes were raised on the &quot;rich,&quot; while revenues were
reduced and the economy suffered from anemic growth.
<P>
History demonstrates that economic growth and deficit reduction
cannot be achieved through higher taxes and promises of future
spending cuts. The parallels between the 1990 Budget Deal and
President Clinton's 1993 Budget Deal are remarkable. Both packages
rely heavily on &quot;soaktherich taxes,&quot; a regressive gas
tax, and the hope that a future Congress will cut spending. Specifically,
the 1990 Budget Deal raised taxes by $158 billion. Clinton's package
will nearly double that tax increase. Moreover, 80% of all spending
cuts in the 1993 Budget Deal are not scheduled to take effect
until after 1996.
<P>
One would think that somewhere along the way to constructing and
selling a budget package that is a mirror image of the deal struck
less than three years ago, someone would check whether the desired
results were achieved. Apparently, it is not in President Clinton's
nature to do so. Now that data from the 1990 Budget Deal is in,
we can compare the promises with the results. According to the
IRS, in 1991 the rich paid 6.1 % less in taxes even though their
tax rates were raised in 1990. Can Clinton blame this on the
slow economy? No, he cannot. The middle class paid more in
taxes (1% more)
even though their tax rates stayed the same. According to projections
of the 1990 Budget Deal, the deficit this year should be $142
billion. In fact, it is over $300 billion.
<P>
There is nothing new in the President's tax and spend asoroach;
it has been tried again and again, not once achiev
ing lower deficits and higher growth. The reason why people are
buying into the President's call for sacrifice (through higher
taxes on Americans as the only alternative to smaller deficits)
is that there has been no complete explanation of the ramifications
of the Clinton plan. However, the blame can be extended across
party lines. Unf ortunately, many Republicans, along with the
Democrats, have paid zero atten
tion to the real alternative - GROWTH.
<P>
Americans, after reading the fine print, will come to realize
what is in store for them. Will higher taxes, massive cuts in
defense spending and a growing dependency on government services
lead to longterm prosperity? Or will a broader tax base through
lower rates and the responsible scalingback of government free
up the resources that individuals and families can use to control
their own destinies? The real defining issue is whether we allow
our Tiation to cure its economic ills through growth or taxation.
I side with growth and the American people.

<H3>American Leadership or Disengagement?</H3>


<B>By Jeane Kirkpatrick</B>
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised a middle class
tax cut, while President Bill Clinton has increased the taxes
on the middle class.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised American armed
forces second to none, while President Bill Clinton has cut the
defense budget so deeply that the Secretary of Defense was forced
to change U.S. strategy and Clinton has also demoralized the armed
forces by imposing, without consultation, decisions that violate
basic American standards and values.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Clinton promised American air strikes,
if necessary, to save Bosnian civilians from Serbian aggression.
President Clinton has only followed the European lead in doing
nothing for too long.
<P>
Candidate Clinton promised to preserve U.S. leadership, but President
Clinton has retreated from a policy of leadership to a point of
acquiescent multilateralism. &quot;We have taken the lead,&quot;
said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, &quot;in passing to
multilateral bodies decisions and action on threats to peace.&quot;
They call it leadership. These policies variously called assertive
multilateralism, or cooperative security are, in fact, policies
of progressive AmeAcan disengagement and abdication.
<P>
The policy of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; is applied far
beyond the issue of gays in the military to other important questions
of preparedness, morale and AmeAcan power.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how robust or hollow our military forces
will be after the scheduled cuts have been carried out.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what President Clinton will do when it becomes
even clearer that Iraq and North Korea are developing nuclear
weapons in spite of promises to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what the Clinton Administration will do
when it is undeniably clear that China is selling missile technology
to Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran - in spite of promises
to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how the Clinton Administration proposes
to protect the continental United States from missiles launched
by the world's most violent dictators now that they have eliminated
funding for a strategic missile defense.
<P>
The President and Secretary of State have shown signs of improved
clarity and effectiveness in Lebanon and Bosnia, but not enough.
Further evidence of American disengagement can be perceived in
a variety of Clinton Administration decisions to date: the unconditional
extension of Most Favored Nation status to China, the unconditional
diplomatic recognition of the MPLA government of Angola, the uncon
ditional release of financial assistance to Nicaragua, the Administration's
continuing inaction on the North American Free Trade Agreement
and related hemispheric matters.
<P>
Some see in the U.S. insistence on multilateralism in economic
relations with Russia yet another example of a deliberate nonleadership
style in foreign policy.
<P>
Is the Clinton Administration renouncing the global leadership
the United States has excercised since World War II? Secretary
of State Warren ChAstopher has suggested that is the case, and
other State Department officials have recently emphasized the
Administration's determination to reduce U.S. commitments abroad.
<P>
One can only hope that our new president will heed the emerging
warning signs of the large price we, and the world, could pay
for abdication of U.S. leadership. The worldwide increase of terrorism
that has spread to the United States is a dramatic wakeup call.
A disengaged and unprepared America courts the very problems it
seeks to avoid.

<H3>The Politics of School Choice</H3>
<P>
<B>By William J. Bennett</B>
<P>
Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the
quality of public education. Today, low test scores, consistently
high dropout rates, drug use and increasing violence characterize
many of our public schools. Even as per student expenditures have
jumped (in constant 199192 dollars) from $2,035 in 1960 to $5,247
in 1990, student performance has continued to decline. Median
SAT scores have fallen almost 80 points over the last three decades,
and a recent international comparison of math and science skills
scored Americans at the bottom of the list of industrialized countries.
We need real reform, and we need it now.
<P>
The problem with our public schools is not a lack of money. Indeed,
both teacher salaries and overall educational expenditures have
increased dramaticallv. The failure of our schools is systemic:
despite the poor record of many schools,
unionization has strengthened the education establishment's power
over students and parents. Teachers' unions have made it virtually
impossible to fire even the most inept educator, and have freed
administrators from accountability. Parents, particularly lowerincome
parents, have few recourses, since they often lack the financial
means to send their child elsewhere.
<P>
The current system is a wreck; it hurts students, it undermines
parents and it perpetuates a social injustice. The American people
sense this: more than 70% of Americans support school voucher
systems, and as of 1992, 34 states were considering various school
choice initiatives. Increasingly, even teachers and education
bureaucrats lack faith in the system they defend&#151;22% send
their children to private schools, for example, and that number
is far higher in urban school districts. The widespread support
for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents - regardless of income
level - with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher
will simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents would
now have a choice - they could send their child elsewhere,
to another public school, or to a private or religious school.
This is the same concept we use in higher education; students
can use government grants and loans to attend the University of
Indiana, Notre Dame or Yeshiva University. Higher education performs
better because of the competition.
<P>
The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
It will increase competition, accountability and parental involvement.
It will save taxpayers money. Indeed, school choice is the most
important and farreaching education reform in America.
<P>
The only people to benefit from the public schools' lock on educational
resources are those who hold the key&#151;the teachers' unions
and the educational bureaucracy they represent. The National Education
Association (the nation's largest union with 2.1 million
members) has a
vested interest in ensuring public schools' monopoly over taxpayer
money, which is why they are raising teachers' dues for the express
purpose of funneling more than $15 million into a campaign to
defeat school choice in California. That is why we at Empower
America are taking a leading role in the fight for school choice
in California. As a recent <I>Forbes </I>article noted, &quot;The
public may be only dimly aware of it, but the union's growing
power has exactly coincided with the dismal spectacle of rising
spending on education producing deteriorating results.&quot; 
<P>
The timehonored task of education is to provide children with
sound intellectual and moral instruction. School choice empowers
parents to select schools that reflect the values and the academic
goals that they hold for their children.

<H3>Success in Milwaukee</H3>

<I>Standing Room Only at Conference</I>
<P>
&quot;...more than 700 regional political activists gathered
here. . .to celebrate. . .ideas. Conservative ideas such as public
school choice, welfare limits, free enterprise-style economic incentives
and things as basic as good oldfashioned tax cutting.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Wisconsin State Journal, </I>June 26, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton's economic, foreign and social policy
initiatives were found lacking by three prominent conservatives
who were in Milwaukee for the first meeting of a new national
organization called Ernpower America.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Milwaukee Sentinel, </I>June 25, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
Well over 700 enthusiastic supporters crowded into Milwaukee's
Italian Community Center on June 25th to hear Empower America's
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick as they launched
their series of regional conferences. With more than twenty events
scheduled over the next 18 months, these conferences are designed
to integrate national policies with state and local initiatives
and programs.
<P>
The Milwaukee event featured a morning session of comments by
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick, followed by
energetic question and answer sessions.
<P>
The lunch session featured two prominent conservative leaders.
Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a member of Empower America's
Gubernatorial Advisory Board, listed his state's numerous innovations
in the areas of education and welfare reform. Bob Woodson, president
of The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, focused on
reviving our nation's inner cities through economic growth and
policies which encourage home ownership and &quot;workfare&quot;,
not welfare.
<P>
The afternoon panels emphasized school choice and economic growth,
and provided an indepth look at efforts in these areas on the
local and state levels.

<H3>Battling for School Choice:EA Joins the
Grassroots Effort in Calif. </H3>

<P>
On November 2, the people of California will vote on Proposition
174, a revolutionary school choice initiative tesignet to empower
parents, reform education and save taxpayers money. The initiative
would give parents the opportunity to choose where their children
will be educated&#151;at a public, private or religious school.
If parents choose a public school, that school receives full funding,
about $5,200 per child. If parents choose a private or religious
school, they will receive a voucher worth half that amount, about
$2,600, to be used to pay the tuition (62 percent of California's
private schools cost $2,600 or less.)
<P>
Empower America is playing a leading role in the battle for school
choice in California. CoDirector William 1. Bennett signed the
ballot argument supporting Proposition 174 that will be sent to
all of the state's registered voters and he plans to participate
in numerous school choice events. CoDirector Jack Kemp has raised
$600,000 for the effort thus far. For a School Choice Action Packet,
please call 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>Free Trade and NAFTA</H3>

<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is scheduled to
be considered this fall by Congress. This agreement will make
history&#151;either as the missed opportunity that cost the U.S.
jobs, increased trade and a more competitive economy; or as the
creator of the world's largest free trade zone which expanded
exports to Canada and Mexico and created a growing supply of higher
paying jobs. Despite support by President Clinton, NAFTA might
not make it thtnilah Concrrecc Tf those onnosed to NAFTA would
only
look at the facts, they would find consensus among economists
who has seriously studied the documents and realize that it will
increase U.S. exports and create American jobs.
<P>
Before Mexico's 1986 decision to join the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT), tariffs on U.S. exports
were as high as lOOSo; Now they are down to an average of 10%.
The average tariff placed on Mexican products being sold in the
U.S. is 3%. The arithmetic is straightforward. The U.S. clearly
has more to gain by the elimination of tariffs. But let the facts
tell the story: since 1986 these declining tariffs produced a
windfall of export activity (see chart), shifting our trade status
with Mexico from a deficit of $4 billion to a surplus of $9 billion.
Mexico has become the fastest growing export market, purchasing
73% of its imports from the U.S. It has now established itself
as our second largest market; Canada being the first. Consequently,
as the Mexican economy grows, so do U.S. exports.
<P>
These increased exports have already created 300,000 new
jobs, doubling the number of jobs supported by exports to Mexico
(see chart). In fact, the Department of Commerce estimates that
each extra $1 billion in exports creates over 19,000 net new jobs.
The Institute for International Economics projects that by 1995,
over 1 million U.S. jobs will be supported by U.S. exports to
Mexico alone.
<P>
The answer to the question, &quot;what kind of American jobs will
be produced by the NAFTA agreement?&quot; is key. According to
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, exportrelated jobs
pay 17% more than the average U.S. wage. This applies to workers
in both the service and manufacturing industries.
<P>
Our borders and trading patterns have a finite capacity; but our
potential to expand trade and grow the economy, is infinite&#151;provided
we pursue free trade. The evidence is dear. If PresidentClinton
truly wants a stimulus package that creates longterm, private
sector jobs, he would seize the moment and urge passage of this
agreement now.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>
<P>
This is a critical time for our country as we are finally getting
a good look at President Clinton's economic plan. It's tax and
spend all over again.
<P>
The bottom line for individuals, families, and businesses: the
biggest tax increase in American history, $328 billion over five
years; an effective acrosstheboard tax increase on every taxpayer
of up to 20 percent; a tax on individuals earning as little as
$30,000; and more government spending. Whatever happened to President
Clinton's campaign promise to cut taxes for the middle class?
<P>
Every time you turn around, the Clinton team is talking about
another new tax on American families and workers. But they never
talk about cutting taxes.
<P>
Empower Arnerica thinks that's wrong and we've launched a campaign
to defeat the Clinton tax hikes. By energizing activists like
yourself, we're convinced <B>that the Clinton tax bill </B>can
be defeated. America needs economic policies that promote growth,
create jobs, and provide opportunity for entrepreneurs.
<P>
President Clinton says that his policies reflect the &quot;new&quot;
Democrat. Frankly, I can't tell the difference between his tax
hikes and tax hikes of the old Democrats. We need to get the economy
moving up the growth curve again. The Clinton tax increases will
only hurt our economy and increase the deficit.
<P>
Bill Clinton thinks you're not paying enough taxes. Empower America
thinks Americans are overtaxed, and we need your help in defeating
these tax increases and promoting an agenda for economic growth.
<P>
At a grassroots level, thousands of concerned citizens are helping
us to promote conservativeoriented empowerment strategies at all
levels of government. So, if you're concerned about Bill Clinton's
tax and spend policies, stay involved with Empower America. We
know there's a better way. 
<P>

<H3>Clinton's First 100 Days</H3>
Bill Clinton now concedes that his presidency is off to a rough
start. The problem, the White House would have us believe, has
to do with a lack of &quot;agenda discipline,&quot; trying to
do too much too soon. Mr. Clinton's problems, however, run much
deeper. <I>His Administration is not working because his liberal
philosophy is not taking.</I>
<P>
At an April 28th press conference, Empower America released its
analysis, &quot;The Credibility Gap: The First 100 Days of the
Clinton Administration.&quot; Among the key points:
<P>
  1. The idea heavily marketed during the campaign that Mr. Clinton
was a &quot;New Democrat&quot; has been disproved.The gap between
candidate Clinton and President Clinton is rapidly becoming a
gulf. He has reversed himself on middle class tax cuts, free trade,
Haitian refugees, home ownership for lowincome Americans, and
tax funding for abortions, among other issues. This is part of
the reason why his opinion ratings are the lowest in history of
any president at a comparable point.
<P>
 2. The presupposition that guides the Clinton Administration's
policies is, as the President told a joint session of Congress,
&quot;government must do more.&quot; In Bill Clinton's America,
the federal government will tax more, spend more, regulate more&#151;and
the American people will depend on government more. The public's
increasing frustration and alienation toward government does not
square with President Clinton's vision of an everexpanding government.
<P>
  3. During the campaign Bill Clinton invoked the word &quot;change&quot;
like an incantation. He made a compelling case for &quot;reinventing
government.&quot; But he seems far less interested in reinventing
government than in reinflating it. President Clinton's budget
will increase spending almost $300 billion over the next five
years.
<P>
4. Bill Clinton's political career has been characterized by an
easy abandonment of commitments. Rather than allaying these concerns,
President Clinton has confirmed them through a series of welldocumented
policy reversals. Bill Clinton is coming dangerously close to
forfeiting a president's most precious political asset -- his
credibility with the American electorate.
<P>
5. President Clinton has failed to create a government that can
govern. Many agencies still lack key appointments. Meanwhile,
President Clinton's policies and tactics have galvanized the Republican
party to a remarkable degree while key Democrats are backing away
from many of the President's proposals.
<P>
The Clinton presidency is way off stride and on the defensive.
His Administration appears overwhelmed. Public skepticism is rising.
It is in the nation's best interest for Bill Clinton to purposefully
steer his presidency to the responsible center --  which after
all is how he got elected.
<P>

<H3>The American Scene: Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
by William J. Bennett
<P>
The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, the most comprehensive
statistical portrait available of behavioral trends over the last
30 years, was released on March I 5th. The Index provides an empirical
analysis of the condition of modern American society.
<P>
The findings are troubling. Over the last three decades we have
experienced substantial social regression. Since 1960 there has
been a 560 percent increase in violent crime; more than a 400
percent increase in illegitimate births; a quadrupling in divorce
rates; a tripling of the percentage of children living in singleparent
homes; more than a 200 percent increase in the teenage suicide
rate; and a drop of almost 80 points in the average S.A.T. scores.

<P>
The Index does more than document cultural decline; it points
to some solutions. Cultural renewal depends above all on strengthening
and revitalizing our social and civic institutions -- families,
churches, schools, and neighborhoods. But government has a role to play. 
First, government should heed
the old injunction, &quot;Do no harm.&quot; The longterm impact
programs have on strengthening families, discouraging dependency
and criminal behavior, and encouraging educational achievement
should inform debate on social policy. Second, political leaders
should make use of their ability to shape attitudes through discourse
and legislation. Third, a legislative social agenda should emphasize
a tough and intelligent criminal justice system; radical education
reform (including school choice for public, private, and religious
schools); reversal of the destructive incentives of the welfare
system; removal of economic barriers to those living in poverty;
support of families by increasing the personal dependent exemption;
rescinding nofault divorce laws; removal of major obstacles to
adoption; improving child support collection; and encouraging
responsible fatherhood.
<P>
The Index struck a responsive chord with the public.  More than
70,000 people called to request copies of it. The Index also received
extensive media coverage, including 130 newspapers each with a
circulation over 100,000 and more than 500 newspapers overall;
and television, radio, and magazine coverage. It received favorable
coverage from the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, the <I>Wall
Street Journal's</I> Paul Gigot, and nationally syndicated columnists
Mona Charen, Cal Thomas, Georgie Anne Geyer, Morton Kondracke,
Ben Wattenberg, and Richard Grenier.
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging news is that there is a rough consensus
emerging about the nature of the cultural debate. Gerald Seib
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>that recent writings on
social issues, including the Index, are &quot;starting to cause
ripples inside Washington, and in time are likely to transform
the standard liberalconservative debate over social policy.&quot;

<H3>It's the Economy, Stupid Not A Stupid Economy</H3>
by Jack Kemp
<P>
Conservative activists now have an opportunity to defeat President
Clinton's tax increases and to go to the American people with
a superior agenda for real jobs, real economic growth and renewed
American leadership in the global economy.
<P>
First, we must debunk Clinton's notion that higher taxes will
lead to a more prosperous America. In reality, higher taxes will
weaken the economy, reduce revenues and increase the deficit.
Never in American history have tax increases created jobs or economic
growth. 
<P>
<B>A ProGrowth Agenda</B>
<P>
Empower America believes we can reduce the size of government
and lower the deficit without raising taxes. At the same time,
we support a progrowth agenda that really puts people first, not
government.
<P>
Here are some ideas for a growth agenda:
<P>
 <I>&#149; </I><B>Encourage en&#166;repreneurship, saving, investment</B>
<P>
The best way to rekindle the job creating power of America's entrepreneurs
is to expand the supply of risk capital available to finance creative
new ideas and develop new products. All provisions in the tax
code affecting saving and investing should be immediately indexed
to stop the corrosive effect of inflation. This includes indexing
capital gains taxes, depreciation allowances, corporate tax rates,
and retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401Ks.
<P>
Ultimately, we should phase out the capital gains tax altogether
on longterm investments and eliminate it for anyone who works,
saves, or invests in America's lowincome communities.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Tax relief for families and working Americans</B>
<P>
We should advocate a flat, fair, and simple tax system that rewards
success instead of punishing it.
<P>
To spur job creation, the payroll tax, currently the greatest
burden on middle class families and small businesses, should be
reduced. Since the mid1960s, the payroll tax has more than doubled
from 7.25 percent to 15.3 percent today. Middle income families
now face an effective marginal tax rate on all income of over
30 percent, compared with less than 20 percent 30 years ago. Reducing
this tax would expand employment by lowering the cost of hiring
additional workers and increasing the reward for working for unemployed
Americans.
<P>
 We must also champion tax reform, such as raising the dependent
exemption, that recognizes the family as America's paramount valueshaping
institution. The moral, spiritual, and cultural health of our
nation is inextricably linked with the strength of the Amencan
family. That strength is being undermined by government policies,
both economic and social, which are biased against marriage and
famiiies with children.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Spending restraint</B>
<P>
Spending restraint and regulatory relief is a key part of our
philosophy of limited government. Government spending absorbs
valuable resources, often for inefficient and wasteful purposes.
<P>
While cutting wasteful spending, there must also be strong budget
caps to restrain the growth of government spending. Capping the
rate of entitlement growth, except Social Security, at inflation
plus population growth,would save more than $250 billion over
five years.
<P>
However, real spending control requires institutional changes
to enforce accountability in the federal budget process, including
a lineitem veto to help balance the budget without raising taxes.
<P>
<B>* Free Trade</B>
<P>
Opentrading policies helped expand the global export market to
$3.1 trillion by 1989. Mr. Clinton is dangerously reversing course
by threatening trade wars with Europe and Japan.
<P>
The key to U.S. and global economic growth lies in opening new
markets to goods and services. Passing a clean, mutually beneficial
North American Free Trade Agreement and completing the floundering
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is
a top priority.
<P>
The next step is to negotiate marketopening trade agreements culminating
in a hemispheric freetrade zone. Our ultimate goal should be to
incorporate the Pacific Rim nations, Russia and other former communist
states into an open global trading system.
<P>
Clinton's farleft liberal policies must be stopped to prevent
them from hurting America.  Now is the time for us to once again
raise the banner of economic growth, low taxes, limited government,
strong families and equality of opportunity for all. Nothing could
produce a sharper contrast with the policies of the Clinton administration.
<P>

<H3>NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE '90s</H3>
By Jeane Kirkpatrick
<P>
There have been three great watersheds in the twentieth century&#151;moments
when the world came apart and recreated itself.
<P>
The first occured in the wake of World War I, and like today,
the optimistic trend in Europe was to a continent of democratic
governments. But in the decades that followed, Lenin in Russia,
Hitler in Germany, and Mussolini in Italy were able to seize power.
In each case, resurgent nationalism and a tradition of authoritarianism
played a role. In each case, the world stood by as democracy floundered.
And in each case, the cost of failed democracy proved incredibly
high. World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War were only
part of the price. The replacement of new democracies with Bolsheviks,
Fascists, and Nazis was wholly unexpected. It should prompt us
to ask ourselves now: what could happen that we do not expect?
<P>
The second watershed of the century occurred following World War
II. After Eastem Europe was conquered by the Soviets, the democracies
<I>did </I>act to prevent Westem Europe from the incorporation
into the Soviet bloc. U.S. resistance &#151; in the form of the
Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and NATO&#151;stopped the Soviet's
westward drive. NATO succeeded in providing a framework for democracy,
development, and stability because it was an organization of democracies
around the principle of collective security. Each time a former
dictatorship&#151;Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece&#151;was
incorporated into NATO after they established democratic institutions,
the belief that membership in NATO reinforced democracy was reiterated.
<P>
Now, in the wake of the collapse of Communism and the end of the
period of Soviet military threat, we have arrived at the third
great watershed. It is a moment of possibility when the world
is creating itself again. The transition of the former communist
states from totalitarianism to democracy, and from command to
market economies has already proved more complex and difficult
than was generally anticipated. The consequences of failure could
be catastrophic, yet no innovative Westem response comparable
to the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, or the Common
Market has been forthcoming. <I>It is critically important that
we make room for the new democracies in Western institutions.</I>
<P>
Now is the time to think about collective security. The U.S. and
the democracies helped create the context for the defeat of Communist
governments by providing an altemative model of more successful
societies and by maintaining military strength. But the peoples
of Central and Eastem Europe were not liberated by foreign armies,
but by their own efforts. They are already our allies in SpiIit.
We should make them allies and trading partners in fact.
<P>
After World War II, we believed that institutionalized association
with other democracies would reinforce habits of constitutional
rule and peaceful cooperation. We were right. It is time to apply
the lessons.
<P>

TAXING FAMILIES FIRST
<P>
<B>Bill Clinton wants the largest tax increase in American history.</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton plans to hike taxes $328 billion between 1994 and
1998.
<P>
This means Bill Clinton wants the American taxpayers to send an
extra $7,488,584 an hour to Washington,D.C. --  that's $124,809
a minute!
<P>
The average family of four will pay $904 more in taxes per year.
The average New Jersey family will pay $1,276 more. (source: The
Tax Foundation, February 24, 1993)
<P>
<B>Energy taxes will hit the middle class first.</B>
<P>
A typical middle income family will pay about $500 more a year
in energy taxes under the Clinton proposal.
<P>
Gasoline taxes will go up 8 to 12 cents a gallon.
<P>
The Clinton energy tax will cost $50 billion and 600,000 jobs.(source:
Institute for Research on the Economics of 
<P>
Taxation, March 19, 1993; the National Association of Manufactures,
New York Times, May 6, 1993) 
<P>
<B>Taxes on Social Security benefits for middle class retired
Americans will skyrocket 70%.</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton wants to raise the maximum taxabte amount of Social
Security benefits from 50% to 85% for those individuals making
over $25,000; and for couples making over $32,000.
<P>
For some retirees, this could amount to $2,700 a year&#151;or
$225 per month. (source: U.S. Sentate Republican Policy Committee,
March 17, 1993)
<P>
<B>Small businesses and farmers will be plowed under. </B>
<P>
Small business owners will be the victims of Bill Clinton's new
36% tax bracket, not the rich. 
<P>
Of all income tax returns reporting earninl s over $100,000, 52%
are smail businesses. 
<P>
American farmers will owe about $1 billion more a year in taxes.

<P>
Taxes on the typical mediumsized farm will increase by $1,600.(source:
&quot;A Vision for Stagnation&quot;, Joint EconomicCommittee,
April 1993)
<P>
<B>Jobs will be lost and gone.</B>
<P>
Over the next five years, 1.4 million fewer jobs will be created,
and total wages in the economy 
<P>
will be $483 billion lower.(source: National Center for policy
Analysis, March 11, 1993)
<P>
An estimated 1.1 million jobs will be lost by 1996.<B> </B>(source:DRI/McGraw-Hill,
New York Times, March 18, 1993)
<P>
<B>After all this, the nation will go deeper in debt.</B>

<HR SIZE=2>
<P>

<P>	Much has been made of the collapse of state socialism and the post-Cold War global march 
toward free markets. In reality, however, progress has been slow--and in some parts of the world 
nonexistent. Even today, as the authors show in the study that follows, only a relative handful of   countries--and we are blessed to be among them--have truly free economies. And some of them, our own 
included, are backsliding.
<P>	The recent shift in the congressional balance of power provides U.S. policymakers with one of 
those truly rare opportunities to rethink the way the United States government conducts its business. One 
area in which such a reexamination is long overdue is foreign aid.
<P>	As Admiral James W. Nance, senior Republican staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee told <I>The Washington Post</I> shortly after the 1994 congressional elections, the 
amount of money the United States has spent since 1947 on foreign aid equals more than one-third of the 
federal debt. Much of it has been wasted.
<P>	U.S. development aid should have one priority, and one priority only: promoting the kind of free 
market growth that will enable the recipient country to prosper <I>without</I> foreign aid. If U.S. aid 
does not promote free market capitalism and self-sufficiency, we need to ask the question: Why are we 
giving it?
<P>	The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> provides compeling evidence 
that economic prosperity and economic freedom go hand in hand. Lasting prosperity cannot exist in the 
absence of economic freedom; and a free economy inevitably results in economic growth and rising living 
standards.
<P>	If nothing else, the November 1994 elections reflected the U.S. public's dissatisfaction with 
business as usual. Well-intentioned programs that fail to accomplish their goals--and in some cases 
make matters worse--can no longer be tolerated. The U.S. foreign aid program is a classic example of 
this: good intentions gone awry.
<P>	While U.S. and global policymakers and opinion-leaders have rightly placed considerable 
emphasis over the years on political freedom, economic freedom has received scant attention. It's almost 
as if the policy community has determined that it doesn't matter. But it does matter. In fact, it is the key. 
If a country has a free economy, it can lift itself--and its people--out of poverty. We see this today in 
Asia, Latin America, and even in the early stages in parts of the former Soviet empire. We also see that 
economic freedom is a breeding ground for political freedom. South Korea, the Republic of China on 
Taiwan, Chile, and many other emerging markets provide vivid proof that economic prosperity depends on 
the opportunities created by a free economy, not on U.S. aid, the heavy hand of government planning, or 
even advanced infrastructure and abundant natural resources. Freedom is what counts most.
<P>	Former Treasury Secretary William Simon told me after reviewing a draft copy of <I>The Index 
of Economic Freedom</I> that it may well be the single most important publication ever published by 
The Heritage Foundation, surpassing even the best-selling <I>Mandate for Leadership</I> series which 
guided the Reagan Administration in the 1980s.

<TITLE>Preface</TITLE>
<H2> Preface</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P> Despite the near total collapse of socialism around the world, most countries still do not have free 
economies.  This is the main conclusion of the<I> Index of Economic Freedom,</I> a comparative study 
of economic freedom in the world.  The authors of the <I>Index</I>, Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, 
have discovered that most rich countries are also the most economically free.  Conversely, their research 
shows that most poor countries have economies that are unfree.  Thus, economic freedom is a critical 
factor in the relative wealth of nations.  The more government interferes in the market, the more it 
hampers economic growth and lowers the standard of living of its citizens.
<P>	These issues, though subject to academic study, have never been addressed in such a 
comprehensive manner. Thus, this report should lay to rest once and for all doubts about whether 
economic freedom is integral to economic development.  As the conclusions of this study show, there 
can be no doubt that the more free an economy is, the higher the likelihood of economic development.   
<P>	The idea of creating an index of economic freedom has been long in the making.  Milton 
Friedman and other economists for years have explored ways to measure the relative economic freedom 
of countries around the globe.  Groundbreaking work was done by the Fraser Institute and others to build 
the academic foundation upon which an index could be built.  However, in the mid-1980s analysts at The 
Heritage Foundation began thinking about ways to create an index that would be useful to policymakers, 
particularly with respect to allocating levels of foreign aid.  We were looking for a "user friendly" version 
of the index that could unambiguously show policymakers and investors the positive relationship between 
economic freedom and wealth.   
<P>	Thus was born The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I>, the first study of 
its kind.  It measures the economic freedom of over 100 countries according to the most important 
economic factors determining economic freedom, such as taxes, tariffs, and protection of private 
property.  Not all economic factors could or even should be examined.  Our task was to find accurate data 
for the most important factors, and then to provide the most comprehensive and accurate comparison 
possible. That is what the authors of the<I> Index</I> have done.  Avoiding paralyzing academic debates, 
the authors focus on what is known, and not on what can never be known.  The result is the most accurate 
snap-shot possible of how the countries of the world measure up to the standards of economic freedom.
<P>	There will be many uses for the <I>Index</I>.  Policymakers will find it helpful in determining 
whether Third World countries should be receiving foreign aid; that is, whether it will be squandered in 
economically unfree countries. They can discover that the main cause of poverty around the world is not 
the failure of rich countries to spread the wealth through foreign aid programs, but the misguided 
economic policies of developing countries themselves.  They also will find a paradox: The countries that 
appear to most need U.S. aid are the ones that least deserve it because their government-controlled 
economies will misuse the money.  By the same token, the countries that are least likely to squander U.S. 
aid because they have free economies are the countries that least need it.  Either way, there seems to be 
less of a need for so-called development aid.  The key to economic prosperity in the developing world is 
not foreign aid, but economic freedom.
<P>	Investors should find the<I> Index</I> to be useful as well.  While many countries are 
encouraging foreign investment through privatization and other means, and have more open economies 
than they did a few years ago, the report shows that the countries' economic "fundamentals" can be more 
important to investors than the strengths or weaknesses of particular companies or business sectors.  
These fundamentals include tax rates, the stability of the currency, trade policy, private property rights, 
and other factors considered by the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.
<P>	The<I> Index</I> should be a first stop for any investor who wishes to explore economic 
opportunities in a particular country or region. With the<I> Index</I>, economic trends can be discerned 
and regional comparisons can be made. While investment decisions always require in-depth and hands-on 
research by the companies themselves, the <I>Index</I> can be used as a starting point of research, 
particularly regarding investment decisions in developing countries.
<P>	Finally, the study should be an indispensable source of primary data and bibliographical 
references on the world's economies.  The authors use the most up-to-date information available.  They 
also have assembled an impressive bibliography that not only attests to the depth of their research, but can 
point other researchers in the right direction in their work.
<P>	Future editions of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> will enable readers to compare 
countries over time. Thus, trends in economic freedom will be established, which should be particularly 
useful to policymakers who are concerned with assessing the impact of foreign aid.
<P>	This report is a tremendously important undertaking of which I and the rest of the Heritage staff 
are justly proud.  It should show, once and for all, that economic freedom is no less important than 
political freedom.  As a human right which governments should be bound to protect, if for no other reason 
than concern for the general welfare of its citizens, economic freedom is a critically important key to the 
well-being of people.  It can be a measure not only of how free a person is, but of how rich or poor.  This 
is a powerful, even revolutionary idea.  If applied around the world, it could transform the world's 
economy.   It is in the hope that this report will contribute to that end that I present The Heritage 
Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.

<H2> Acknowledgments</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	We would like to express our appreciation to several individuals who helped to make the 
<I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> possible.  We thank Dr. Kim R. Holmes, Vice President and 
Director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, who edited the study, 
and Larry Di Rita, his Deputy, for providing invaluable assistance and support for the project.  
Richard Odermatt and Tom Timmons bore the brunt of the<I> Index's</I> considerable 
production work.  Their good cheer was most welcome.  Rob Chase of the Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies staff was extremely helpful with managing data.  Dr. Edward L. Hudgins, now of the 
Cato Institute, deserves credit for laying much of the foundation of the <I>Index</I> several years 
ago while serving as Director of the Center for International Economic Growth at The Heritage 
Foundation. 
<P>	Countless individuals serving with various accounting firms, businesses, research organizations, 
U.S. government agencies, embassies in Washington, and other organizations cooperated in providing us 
with data.  Their assistance, which so often went beyond our expectations, is much appreciated.  
<P>	The contribution of two individuals deserves special attention.  Christian Asis and Rebecca 
Schaefer, participants in The Heritage Foundation's summer internship program, were indispensable to the 
development of the <I>Index</I>.  It was Christian and Becky who did the legwork, tracking down data 
while exercising excellent judgment in the process.  Their unfailing good spirit and commitment were 
exceptional.
<P>	We would like to thank the Fraser Institute of Vancouver and the many scholars who have 
participated in its Rating Economic Freedom Project for doing groundbreaking work on measuring 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>  
<P>	Finally, we are grateful for the advice and criticism from the experts who reviewed this study. 
Richard V. Allen, Dr. James B. Burnham, Dr. Stuart M. Butler, Nicholas Eberstadt, Dr. Leonid Grigoryev, 
Dr. Henry R. Nau, Thomas L. Rhodes, Dr. Gerald W. Scully, and Hon. William E. Simon all helped to 
make this a better book.
<P>	Of course, we alone bear responsibility for the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Therefore, 
any shortcomings belong to us.

<TITLE> Executive Summary </TITLE> 
<H2> Executive Summary</H2> 
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	The idea of producing a "user-friendly" Index of Economic Freedom for policymakers was born at  The Heritage Foundation in 1989.  The purpose then, as it remains today, was to develop an index that 
measures the extent of economic freedom in countries around the world.  To this end a set of objective 
economic criteria has been established to grade over 100 countries. While there are many theories about the origins and causes of economic development, the findings of this study are conclusive: those countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic development than those with less economic freedom.
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom measures how well these countries score on a list of ten economic factors.  The higher the score, the more government interference in the economy (hence, the less economic freedom there is). The factors are: 
<UL><B>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation<BR>
10. Black Market<BR>
</UL></B>
<P>	The study demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest level of economic freedom (the lowest Index score) also have the highest living standards (see following chart).  Likewise, countries that have the least amount of economic freedom (the highest Index score) have the lowest living standards.
<P>	A comparison of the Index scores also demonstrates an interesting phenomenon: wealthy and 
economically free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic freedom (see chart). As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare and other social programs that were not affordable when they were poorer. Thus, after they have become economically "liberated," countries like Germany, Sweden, and even the United States tend to fall back down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore. These "Asian tigers" are still growing and developing and have not yet begun to restrict their economies with post-industrial welfare and environmental policies. This phenomenon, when displayed graphically, is called the Curve of Economic Freedom. It shows that economic freedom can rise and fall and that the seeds of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.
<P>	Another conclusion of this report concerns how fast developing countries with free economies grow. The data and scoring show that developing countries that pursued economic liberalization quickly became the richest in the world. Conversely, developing countries that did not pursue economic liberalization remained poor (see chart). Clearly, the path to prosperity is paved by economic liberalization and maximized economic freedom. This is a lesson which all developing countries should learn.
<P>	For example, Hong Kong and Singapore have the highest amount of economic freedom in the world.  In these countries consumers and businesses are free from most government intrusion.  Their economies are based on the mutual consent of individuals to buy, sell, and dispose of property as they see fit.  As a result, they have had extremely high levels of economic growth. Between 1980 and 1991, Hong Kong's gross national product grew at an average rate of 5.6 percent, while Singapore's economy grew at an average rate of 5.3 percent over the same period. While their economic wealth is less than that of some industrial democracies, Singapore's and Hong Kong's economies are catching up quickly with the Western world.  These countries someday may even surpass the U.S. and Germany in per capita GDP if current trends continue.
<P>	In contrast, countries like Angola, Bangladesh, and Haiti have the least amount of economic growth.  These countries have done little to unleash the entrepreneurial forces in their economies.  Instead, they have followed the self-destructive path of central government control and state intervention in the economy.  As a result, they are among the world's poorest nations. Other countries scored poorly as well, such as the newly formed independent republics of Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine.  Their problems stem from slow progress toward free market reforms.  Their economic problems are the worst in the former Soviet Union. 
<P>	Former Marxist countries which have made rapid progress toward maximizing economic freedom are doing relatively well: the Czech Republic and Estonia, for example, score well on the Index.  The Czech Republic has halted an economic decline. It probably will have a respectable growth rate of 3 percent in 1994.  The Bank of Estonia estimates the GDP growth will be in the 3 percent to 5 percent range in 1994.  These countries have managed to begin the process used by Hong Kong and Singapore to promote large economic growth rates by maximizing economic freedom.
<P>	Above all, these findings disprove the assertion that economic growth can be bought by huge transfers of wealth from the industrialized economies to the less developed world.  People in Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, and Ukraine are not poor because wealthy people in the West do not share their riches.  They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic policies that depress free enterprise.  Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free market will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise, but inhumane.

<H3>Why an Index of Economic Freedom?</H3>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) for years has been giving aid to 
developing countries whose economies are over-regulated, protected by trade barriers, and state-
controlled. Nevertheless, despite billions of dollars of U.S. development aid, most of these countries 
are still poor. The reason is simple: their governments have done little to promote economic 
freedom. Quite simply, the recipient countries are destroying their own economies.  Not only has 
U.S. development aid been wasted, it has actually retarded economic development in the countries 
that receive it. Not one country receiving foreign aid has succeeded in developing sustained 
economic growth.
<P>	It should be no surprise that U.S. aid has done so little to bring about global economic growth. 
The experience of the past three decades shows that economic policy, not aid, is the main factor in 
moving from the ranks of developing to middle and high income countries. For example, the economies 
of Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the "Asian Tigers," expanded their gross domestic product by a rate 
of 6 percent each year between 1960 and 1985.  During this period of rapid development, neither Hong 
Kong nor Singapore received significant amounts of development aid.
<P>	Indeed, these and other Asian countries would not have grown so much if the crutch of foreign 
aid had been available.  If Hong Kong had been flooded with aid, as was Tanzania, it probably would be 
closer to Tanzania's status as the world's second poorest country.  In reality, Hong Kong is one of the 
world's most dynamic economies, growing at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent from 1980 to 1991. 
<P>	The potentially perverse effect of development can be seen in the recent history of Chile. In 
1973, Chile was the world's second largest recipient of foreign aid.  It also had a stagnating economy. 
Under the leadership of Marxist President Salvador Allende, Chile's GDP shrank 5.6 percent in 1973.  As 
with many Latin American countries, the government controlled a large part of the Chilean economy, 
estimated to be around 75 percent of the GDP.
<P>	However, by 1990, Chile's economy changed dramatically.  General Augusto Pinochet launched 
a market reform program that drastically cut back on government intervention in the economy. The 
Chilean government controlled only 25 percent of the economy after Pinochet's privatization program 
was largely complete. As a result, Chile has developed one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  
A GDP growth rate averaging 7.3 percent per year since 1988 has dramatically improved the lives of the 
Chilean people. For example, the infant mortality rate has been reduced as life expectancy has gone up.
<P>	It was with this understanding of economic development in mind that the authors undertook to 
measure the relative economic freedom of most countries in the world. The <I>Index of Economic 
Freedom</I> represents an excellent tool for deciding how best to allocate development aid.  Using it 
would help to ensure that foreign aid is not sent to countries that repress economic freedom and have no 
chance of growing economically.  Countries scoring well or improving on the<I> Index</I> would be 
eligible for development aid if they were using the money in constructive ways--i.e., to help construct the 
building blocks of a free market economy. However, using aid to pay for building stock markets, a banking 
system, and other elements of a free market will always be dwarfed in importance when compared to the 
economic policy decisions of the host country. The greatest advantage of the Index is to ensure that U.S. 
development aid does no harm and is not wasted on countries that demonstrate no commitment to 
economic reform.
<P>	The<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> is not a tool for deciding whether or not to dispense 
humanitarian aid or to promise aid for reasons of national security. A foreign country's economic 
policies have always been and undoubtedly will continue to be irrelevant when deciding whether to offer 
relief to people suffering from hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Moreover, for reasons 
of national security, the U.S. should continue providing foreign aid when necessary to bolster allies 
abroad.
<P>	There is yet another use for the <I>Index</I>.  Investors around the world would benefit from 
knowing  how well countries score on the "fundamentals" of economic freedom.  Although the<I> 
Index</I> would be of  little use in judging the advisability of specific investments or in discerning the 
relative strength of specific business sectors, it could be useful in understanding the overall economic 
environment inside a country and whether the economic trends are favorable to future investments.  
Moreover, the <I>Index</I> would be more useful as a starting place in judging investment opportunities 
in underdeveloped countries than in the advanced democracies.  The relative economic performances of 
underdeveloped countries tend to be less known than those of Western nations.  And perhaps more 
important, an understanding of the economic "fundamentals" would be more important in assessing risk 
for the lesser developed nations.   The economies of poorer countries tend to be unpredictable and 
difficult for investors to understand.  The <I>Index</I> should help them to improve their understanding.

<P>	The U.S. will spend over $13 billion on foreign aid in 1994.  This brings total U.S. bilateral aid      
since 1946 to close to half a trillion dollars.  Of the $13 billion spent in 1994, AID will distribute $2.4      
billion in bilateral economic assistance directly to specific countries.  In addition, the U.S. will give almost a billion dollars in economic support to the former Soviet Union, $1.9 billion through international financial institutions including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and $2.4 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF), which are used to advance U.S. political and security interests.

<H3>Where We Are Going in Foreign Aid</H3>  
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	The Clinton Administration in 1994 made a bid to reform foreign aid. After countless   
commissions and blue ribbon panels over the years, President Clinton introduced the Peace,   
Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 (PPDA).  Many thought this would be the year in which   
the foreign aid program would finally be revamped.  
<P>	This, however, was not to be. The Clinton foreign aid reform plan ran out of steam, falling prey to   
politics and other priorities. The Senate Democratic leadership was unwilling to devote the floor time that   
the PPDA required. The reason: doing so would have given Clinton critics a stage for complaints against   
the President's foreign policy. Senate Democrats also were hesitant to direct congressional attention   
away from the health care debate.  Thus, the PPDA never made it to the floor for a vote.  
<P>	The PPDA was a weak attempt to reform foreign aid. It failed to address one of the fundamental   
problems of development aid: how best to use foreign aid to advance economic freedom and, as a result,   
spur economic development. <FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>   The central idea of the Clinton reform  
plan was something called   
"sustainable development." In this idea, the state manages the economy, trying to create "sustainable"   
economic growth without harming the environment or unleashing a "population explosion." But the results   
of this approach will be the exact opposite of the free market-driven growth the Administration claims to   
champion. By increasing government intervention in the economy--with intrusive environmental   
regulations and industrial policies--the Clinton plan will only strangle economic growth.  
<P>	The battle over reforming foreign aid is by no means over. AID Administrator J. Brian Atwood   
believes that the U.S. foreign aid program must be reformed or face budget cuts by skeptical legislators.   
But for foreign aid reform to succeed, more will have to be done than pouring old wine into new bottles,   
as the Clinton Administration has done. The greatest weakness of the Clinton approach is that it continues   
to give aid to countries that waste it.  Moreover, the programming emphasis of the Administration is   
wrong, focusing largely on population control and environmental protection efforts, not on economic   
growth.  Unless the purpose of U.S. development aid is to spur free market-reforms and economic   
growth, it will only prop up failing economies, doing more harm than good.  
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom is the ideal mechanism for judging which countries should   
receive foreign aid. This was the conclusion of George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the President's   
Commission on the Management of Aid Programs (1992), who urged AID to establish an Index of   
Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development aid among countries. Representative   
Robert Livingston, then ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Foreign Operations   
<P>Subcommittee, stated on the House floor last spring that the Republican Party should "expand on [the   
Index of Economic Freedom] and ultimately adopt it in our foreign aid program."<FONT SIZE="-2"> 
(2)</FONT>    
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom, rooted in the recognition that free markets are the only means   
toward development, should be the foundation of U.S. foreign aid reform legislation. By using the Index,   
policymakers can identify which countries are making progress toward free market reforms and which   
ones are not. Countries reforming their economies could use specially targeted aid to help build market   
institutions. Aid also could provide leverage in persuading developing countries to make market reforms.   
While it may be true that reforming countries over time will have less need for foreign aid, temporary   
assistance can help jump start the process of reform. The ultimate and ideal goal, however, should be to   
end dependence on aid altogether. It is with this goal in mind that the Index of Economic Freedom was   
developed.

<H3>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</H3>   
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	There are many factors that could be used to determine how much economic freedom    
exists in a country.  Economic relations between individuals are restricted to a varying degree by    
government intervention.  By looking at such economic factors as taxes, international trade, and    
banking, the extent to which economic freedom is encouraged or hindered can be discerned.    
</P>










<P><UL>
<B>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</B><BR>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
 6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation Policy<BR>
10. Black Market</UL>

<P><B>The Grading Scale.</B> Under each factor is a grading scale.  The scale runs from 1 to 5 with    
1 being the most free and 5 the least free. After each score is either a "-," "+," or "stable" mark.  These    
indicate whether a country is getting worse, better, or staying the same, respectively, in each category.   
<P>	Countries were ranked according to four categories of economic freedom.  Countries receiving    
an Index score of 1.99 or less are considered to have economies that are "free."  Countries scoring    
between 2.00 and 2.99 have economies that are "mostly free."  For scores of between 3.00 and 3.99,    
economies were ranked as "mostly not free."  And economies that obtained a score of 4.00 and above are    
"repressed."   
<P><B>The Sources.</B> In grading the countries, the most recent available information and statistical    
data were used. Where primary sources were not available, secondary sources were used. These cases are    
footnoted accordingly. In each section, a general list of sources is provided for each country. Unless    
otherwise footnoted, these are the main sources used to grade each of the countries.  A general    
bibliography appears at the end of the study.   
<P><B>	Choosing Which Countries to Score.</B> One of the prime motives for developing    
the Index of Economic Freedom is to provide policy makers with a guide for dispensing aid among    
countries. Thus, this edition of the Index rates most current or traditional recipients of significant ($5    
million annually) amounts of U.S. foreign aid.  Some countries, such as Rwanda, Somalia, and Zaire, were    
omitted mainly because reliable data to score their economies were not available. However, this poses no    
significant problem because U.S. aid to these countries is strictly humanitarian; by no measure is it    
contributing to sustained economic growth. Some major industrial and trading countries are included,    
largely for a point of comparison. As the results demonstrate, the respect these countries show for    
economic freedom generally stands in stark contrast to that of countries of the developing world.    
Additionally, a few countries of strategic importance to the U.S., including Mexico and China, were    
included. Future editions of <I>The Index of Economic Freedom</I> might consider even more than the    
current 101 countries.   
<H3>THE FACTORS<BR>   
Factor #1: Trade Policy.<FONT SIZE="-3">[1]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Trade policy is a key factor in measuring economic freedom. The degree to which a government    
hinders the free flow of foreign commerce has a direct bearing on economic growth. Trade policy, in fact,    
is a key factor in industrialization of developing economies. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>     
International trade enables a country's    
industries to maximize production by allowing them to import raw materials and foreign goods and    
services that are cheaper than those produced at home. It can also offer a country greater access to a large    
world market, which can be the source of much wealth.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average tariff rate is used to score a country's trade policy. A    
score of 1 through 5 is given based on a country's tariff rate--the higher the tariff rate, the worse the    
score. Sources to determine the average tariff rate were derived from reports issued by the General    
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  When the average    
tariff rate was not available in these sources, the authors determined the average rate by calculating the    
revenue raised from tariffs and duties as a percentage of total imports. Most of the average tariff rates are    
valid for 1992. In some cases, adequate average tariff rate figures do not exist.  In these cases, the authors    
used publications from the United States Trade Representative's office, the Commerce Department, and    
the State Department. These instances are footnoted. <FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  Such non-tariff   
barriers as trade quotas, overly    
strict licensing, or import inspections also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a    
country's score based solely on tariff rates was moved one point higher on the scale, representing    
decreased economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. has an average tariff rate of 3.6 percent.  Based on a scale    
measuring tariffs alone, it would be given a score of 1.  However, because the U.S. maintains non-tariff    
barriers, such as import quotas on textiles and sugar, it was given a total score of 2.

<H3>Factor #2: Taxation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[4]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Taxes are a key factor in measuring economic freedom. While every country taxes economic    
activity to pay for national defense, public health, and other vital government services, too much taxation    
stifles individual entrepreneurship. A tax is essentially a government-imposed disincentive to perform the    
activity being taxed. For this reason, exorbitant taxes slow economic growth. When analyzing this factor,    
taxes on corporate profits, income, and other significant activities are measured.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Two types of taxation are scored: income taxes and corporate    
taxes.  Each country was first scored based on these two major types of taxation, which many economists    
agree have the most negative economic impact on individuals.  These scores were then averaged to get a    
single taxation score.  Then, other taxes such as value-added taxes, sales taxes, and state and local taxes    
also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a country's taxation score was moved one-half    
point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.  This one-half point increase    
represents the relative impact of these other taxes on individual freedom.   
<H3>	1) Income taxes.</H3>    
<P>	Some countries have relatively high top income tax rates, but they apply to very few people. For    
example, Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent, but it is levied on such large amounts of income    
that very few people fall into this high tax bracket. The tax rate that applies to the average Japanese    
taxpayer is much lower.  Thus, to more accurately measure taxation policy, it is necessary to examine not    
only the top income tax rate, but the rate that applies to the average taxpayer.   
<P>	To discover the average income tax rate, a country's total gross domestic product was divided by    
total population. This per capita income figure was then used to determine which tax rate applies to the    
average income level. <FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>  Once this was done, each country was scored on   
1) the top tax rate and 2) the    
tax rate that applies to average income.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent.  But the 50 percent tax    
bracket applies to income levels that equal about $180,000, which is more than nine times the per capita    
GDP level, which is around $19,000.  The tax level that applies to that amount is 20 percent.  Thus, based    
on the tax scale, Japan would receive an income tax score of 4.   
<H3>	Income Tax Grading Scale  </H3>   
<P>This scale lists a score from 1 through 5. The higher the score, the higher the tax rate. The highest    
level for which a country qualifies is the score that the country receives.

</PRE>

<H3>	2) Corporate taxes. </H3>   
<P>	The second type of tax analyzed is the corporate tax. Each country is scored according to a    
sliding scale based on corporate tax rates.    
<P><B>	Example:</B> Japan has a top corporate tax rate of 37.5 percent. Thus, based on the    
corporate tax rate scale, Japan receives a score of 4.  Japan's overall tax score average is a 4.  But Japan    
maintains additional taxes in the form of a 37.5 capital gains tax, a 3 percent consumption tax, a 17.3    
percent to 20.7 percent local inhabitant tax, and a 14.6 percent social contributions tax.  Thus, Japan    
moves from a 4 to a 4.5.

<H3>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output. <FONT SIZE="-3">[6]</FONT>     
</H3>   
<P>	The greater the degree to which the government intrudes in the economy, the less individuals are    
free to engage in their own economic activities. By taking government consumption as a percentage of    
gross domestic product, the level of government consumption of economic output can be determined. The    
higher the rate of government consumption as a percentage of gross domestic product, the higher the    
Index score, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Measuring a country's government consumption as a percentage of    
GDP reveals only an approximation of the government's role in the economy. <FONT SIZE="-2">  
[7]</FONT>  In the U.S., for    
example, the federal budget is about 24 percent of GDP.  This figure includes servicing the federal budget    
deficit and transfer payments through entitlements like Medicaid. Other government consumption figures    
for most less developed countries do not include funds spent on servicing the budget deficit and some    
transfer payments. While using government consumption figures probably understates the total    
government intervention in the economy, it is a useful tool and starting point for gauging the degree of    
government intervention in the economy.   
<P>	The next step in scoring a country on government consumption is to determine the size of the    
state-owned sector of the economy. If  a large portion of a country's GDP is produced by the state-owned    
sector, it was moved one point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.    
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Russia has a government consumption as a percentage of GDP figure    
of about 22 percent.  This would give Russia a score of 2 because the government consumption figure is    
between 11 percent and 25 percent. However, state-owned enterprises account for a majority of industrial    
production.  Thus, Russia gets a final score of 3, one point higher.

</PRE>

<H3>Factor #4: Monetary Policy. <FONT SIZE="-3">[8]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The value of a country's currency is based largely on the government's monetary policy. If a    
government maintains a "tight" monetary policy, meaning the supply of currency does not exceed demand,    
individuals have the economic freedom to engage in productive and profitable economic activities.  If the    
government maintains a "loose" monetary policy, meaning it supplies more money than demand requires,    
money loses its value and individuals are less free to engage in productive and profitable economic    
activities.  The best way to measure monetary policy is to analyze a country's inflation rate over a period    
of time. The inflation rate is directly linked to the government's ability to manage the supply of money in    
the economy.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average inflation rate was the main criterion for this factor.    
The inflation rate is the best measure of how a country manages its money supply.  Countries with high    
inflation rates have a loose monetary policy and are graded higher because they have less economic    
freedom than countries with lower inflation rates. Countries with a low inflation rate have a tight    
monetary policy and are graded lower because they have more economic freedom.  Countries of the    
former Soviet Union pose a unique problem in determining average inflation rates.  Due to the fact that    
these countries had command economies, annual inflation rate averages from 1980 to 1991 are    
misleading.  Without a market-based system, prices can be held constant because they are controlled by    
the state.  Therefore, countries of the former Soviet Union are graded solely based on 1992 or 1993    
inflation figures.  While these figures are high, especially due to their transformation to a market-based    
system, they are more accurate reflections of the conditions of today than are figures from the Soviet era.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan keeps a tight control over its money supply, and low inflation    
rates are the result. Japan's government has done this by maintaining a supply of yen consistent with the    
domestic demand for the currency.  In addition, Japan has very high savings rates. This supplies the    
financial system with yen that banks and other institutions lend to borrowers. As a result of a tight    
monetary policy, Japan maintained a very low average annual inflation rate of 1.5 percent from 1980 to    
1991. Because of its low inflation rate, Japan receives the lowest score of 1.

<H3>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment Policy. <FONT SIZE="-2">[9]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	Foreign investment funds economic expansion. Investors from abroad supply capital to domestic    
investors who then start or expand their businesses. Restrictions on foreign investment hamper economic    
freedom and thus limit the inflow of foreign capital. By contrast, few or no restrictions on foreign    
investment maximize economic freedom and thus increase the flow of investments. For this category, the    
more restrictions a country imposes on foreign investment, the higher the score, and hence the lower the    
economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> A country's foreign investment policies were scrutinized in order    
to determine the overall investment climate. Among the specific questions asked: Are there foreign    
ownership limits placed on domestic industries? Is there an existing foreign investment code that defines    
the country's investment laws and procedures? Does the government encourage foreign investment by    
providing tax holidays or other incentives? Are foreign corporations treated under the law the same as    
domestic corporations? Are specific industries closed to foreign investment? These questions were    
answered to develop an overall description of the investment climate of the country being examined.     
Each country was graded based on its investment climate.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> Venezuela maintains restrictions on foreign investment.  Foreigners can    
own no more than 20 percent of a company engaged in one of the following industries: accounting,    
architecture, engineering, and insurance.  Foreign investment in oil, gas, coal, petroleum, automobiles,    
and iron ore is prohibited.  Finally, there are some employment restrictions.  On some investments, the    
workforce of a company with more than 10 employees must be 90 percent Venezuelan.  Thus, according    
to the criteria in the scale below, these restrictions are considered as moderately restrictive. Venezuela is    
given a score of 3 because there are restrictions on investment, but government policy at least conforms    
to established foreign investment codes.

<H3>Factor #6: Banking. <FONT SIZE="-3">[10]</FONT>   </H3>   
<P>	In most countries, banks provide the economy with the financial means to operate.  They lend    
money to start businesses, provide services such as real estate, insurance, and securities investments, and    
furnish a safe place for individuals to store their earnings.  The more government controls banks, the less    
they are free to engage in these activities. The consequence of heavy regulation of banks is restricted    
economic freedom. Therefore, the more a government restricts its banking sector, the higher the Index    
score it receives, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> This factor is measured by determining the openness of a country's    
banking system. Among the questions asked: Are foreign banks able to operate freely?  How difficult is it    
to open domestic banks?  How heavily regulated is the banking system?  Are banks free to provide    
customers with insurance, sell real estate, and invest in securities?  The answers to these questions were    
used to develop a description of the country's banking climate.  The Index represents a sliding scale that    
measures the relative openness of a country's banking system.   
<P>	Example: The U.S. banking system is minimally regulated.  However, it maintains federal    
deposit insurance and interstate banking regulations.  Based on the scale below, the U.S. receives a 2    
score, which means that restrictions on banks are considered to be low.

<H3>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls. <FONT SIZE="-3">[11]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	A free economy is one that allows individuals to set not only the prices on the goods and services    
they sell, but also the wages they pay to the workers they employ.  Some governments mandate wage and    
price controls. By doing so, they restrict economic activity, and thus curtail economic freedom.    
Therefore, the more a government intervenes and controls prices and wages, the higher the Index score    
and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  This factor is measured by how much a country lets the market or    
the government set wages and prices. Among specific questions asked: Are there any products whose    
prices are set by the government?  If so, which products?  Does the government affect prices by    
controlling such things as utilities?  Does the government have a minimum wage policy?  Are other wages    
set by the government? A sliding scale is developed to measure the relative degree of government control    
over wages and prices. A 1 or "very low" score represents wages and prices being set completely by the    
market, whereas at the other end of the scale, a "very high" score of 5 means that wages and prices are set    
completely by the government.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  In Hong Kong, all wages and prices are determined by the market. Thus,    
it receives a score of 1. By contrast, in Cuba, wages and prices are set by the government. Therefore, it    
receives a score of 5.

<H3>Factor #8: Property Rights. <FONT SIZE="-3">[12]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The accumulation of private property is the main motivating force in a market economy.  This    
factor examines the extent to which private property is protected by the government and how safe it is    
from expropriation.  The less protection private property receives, the higher the score, and hence the    
lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The degree to which private property is a guaranteed right is    
measured. So, too, is the extent to which the government protects and enforces laws to protect private    
property. The probability that the state will expropriate private property also is examined. The less legal    
protection of private property, the higher the score.  The higher the chance of government expropriation    
of private property, the higher the score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. economic system is based entirely on people's right to    
accumulate property. America's legal system is one of the best in the world. It allows people to use the    
court system for disputes over property and to enforce contracts. Thus, based on the scale below, the U.S.    
would receive a very low score of 1, meaning that the level of protection for private property is "very    
high."

<H3>Factor #9: Regulation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[13]</FONT>  </H3>     
<P>	In many less developed economies, obtaining a business license to sell a good or service is    
nearly impossible.  With so many hoops for the entrepreneur to jump through, it is very difficult to create    
new businesses. In some cases, government officials frown upon private sector initiative and it may even    
be illegal. While there are many regulations that hinder business, the most important ones are those    
associated with licensing new companies and businesses.  In some countries, like the U.S., obtaining a    
business license is as simple as mailing in a registration form with a minimal fee.  In others, especially in    
Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America, obtaining a business license requires endless trips to a    
government building and countless bribes, and may take up to a year.    
<P>	Once a business is open, that is not necessarily the end of government regulation.  In some cases,    
it is just the beginning.  Some countries apply their regulations haphazardly.  For example, an    
environmental regulation may be used to shut down one business while another is not penalized. Business    
owners become confused over which regulations must be obeyed. Moreover, the existence of many    
regulations can cause corruption as confused and harassed business owners try to work around the red    
tape.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  The purpose is to measure how easy or difficult it is to open a    
business.  The more regulations on business, the harder it is to open.  In addition, the degree of corruption    
was examined, as was whether the regulations are applied uniformly to all businesses. Another factor was    
whether the country has any state planning agencies that set production limits and quotas. The scale was    
established by listing a set of conditions for each of the five possible scores.  These conditions include    
such items as the extent of government corruption, the uniformity of the regulations' applications, and the    
extent to which the regulations pose a burden on business. At one end of the scale is the 1 score of very    
low levels of regulation, where corruption is nonexistent and regulations are minimal and uniformly    
applied. At the other end of the scale is the "very high" score of 5, where corruption is rampant,    
regulations are applied randomly, and the general level of regulation is very high. A country need only    
meet a majority of the conditions in each score for it to receive that score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Obtaining a business license in Hong Kong is very easy.  In some cases,    
one can even be obtained by mail. Hong Kong's regulation system is corruption-free, not a burden to    
business, and is applied uniformly throughout the country. Thus, Hong Kong receives a 1.

<H3>Factor #10: Black Market. </H3>   
<P>	Black markets are a direct result of government intervention in the market. In fact, a black market    
activity is one that the government has outlawed.  The larger the black market is in a country, the lower the    
economic freedom.  The smaller the black market, the higher the economic freedom.  This factor    
considers the size of a country's black market as a percentage of GDP.  The higher the percentage, the    
higher the score and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> Information available on the size of black markets in less    
developed countries is extremely scarce. Nevertheless, estimates can be made on the size of black market    
activities by answering several questions. For example, does the country have a large smuggling market?     
If so, this could be an indication that the government imposes too many restrictions on foreign imports.    
Do consumers need to turn to the black market to buy such items as televisions and video-cassette    
recorders?  If so, this could be an indication that these products cannot be bought in stores legally or that    
their prices are too high because of very high tariffs. Are there large numbers of workers who work    
illegally?  If so, this could be an indication that the economy is overly regulated and that labor must be    
supplied by the black market.   
<P>	The existence or absence of these and other activities was used to estimate the size of the black    
market as a percentage of gross domestic product.  In cases where black market information exists for    
specific countries, it is noted. At one end of the scale is the score of 1, where the black market    
constitutes less than 10 percent of GDP. At the other end is the score of 5, where the black market makes    
up 30 percent or more of GDP.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> In Peru, almost 30 percent of the GDP consists of such black market    
activities as labor and food. Other black market activities are outlawed in many cases. Peru receives the    
highest score of 5.

<H2>The Countries</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This section is a compilation of countries, each graded in all ten factors of the Index of 
Economic Freedom. Each country receives a 1 through 5 score for all ten factors. Those scores are then 
averaged to get a final Index of Economic Freedom score. Countries with a score between 1 and 2 have 
the freest economies. Countries with a score around 3 are less free. Countries with a score near 4 are 
over-regulated and need significant economic reforms to achieve even the most basic increases in 
economic growth. Countries with a 5 score are the most economically oppressive nations in the world.

<H2>Conclusion </H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This study demonstrates that the countries with free economic systems enjoy the highest 
degree of economic development.  Likewise, the countries with the least amount of economic 
freedom suffer from the lowest degree of economic development and are among the poorest 
countries on earth.  Throughout the world, free markets have driven development, while heavy 
government intervention has wrought nothing but economic disaster.
<P>	These conclusions are reflected in the scores of 101 countries examined in the <I>Index of 
Economic Freedom</I>. 7 countries were given  a "free" score, while 36 were found to be "mostly free." 
By contrast, 50 nations were "mostly not free," while 8 were deemed as "repressed." As these 
designations show, most of the countries in the world have economies that are not free. 
<P>	The <I>Index</I> demonstrates clearly the positive relationship between economic freedom and 
wealth. Five of the seven advanced industrial (G-7) democracies are among the ten countries whose Index 
score reflects the most economic freedom. By contrast, countries with unfree economies, such as Cuba, 
Mozambique, North Korea, and Vietnam, are among the world's poorest. Predictably Mozambique is 
indeed the world's poorest country.  While Mozambique's long running civil war, which ended in 1992, 
contributed to its poverty, there can be no doubt that Mozambique's long embrace of Marxism has been 
the major cause of its abysmal state of economic development.
<P>	<B>Asian Powerhouses. </B> Nor is it surprising that the Asian "Tigers"--Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan--are doing well economically. Two members of this enviable group, Hong 
Kong and Singapore, tie for the best score on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Each country 
scored a 1.25, receiving identical scores in all but two categories.  Hong Kong edged out Singapore by 
having lower tax rates while Singapore scored better than Hong Kong on monetary policy.  These two 
countries are paragons of economic freedom.
<P>	When compared with growth rates in many African countries, the "Asian Tiger" success is indeed 
impressive.  By 1965, the Asian Tigers and most Sub-Saharan African nations had achieved independence 
from colonial nation states.  In that year, Sub-Saharan African countries like Gabon had equal to higher 
levels of per capita wealth than Asian Tiger countries like the Republic of China on Taiwan.  For example, 
in 1965, Gabon had a per capita GDP figure of $1,286. By contrast, Taiwan had a per capita GDP of 
$1,133.<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   By 1991, Gabon's per capita wealth had risen to only $3,448. By contrast, Taiwan's per capita GDP had climbed to  $9,805. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
<P>	Since 1965 , Taiwan has received negligible amounts of development aid. Gabon has been flood-
ed with hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid--over $500 million in the past five years. The 
conclusion is inevitable: Taiwan flourished because it became economically free, while Gabon, awash in 
development aid, languished because it refused to steer a free market course.
<P>	Right behind Hong Kong and Singapore, finishing third overall in economic freedom, is Bahrain.  
This Middle Eastern country scored a 1.60. Despite Bahrain's state-owned oil industry it maintains one of 
the most open markets in the world with average tariff rates of around 3.3 percent.  It makes no use of 
non-tariff barriers such as trade quotas and voluntary export restraints.  It taxes neither income nor 
corporate profits. Because of tight monetary policies, Bahrain actually has achieved what economists call  
"negative inflation rates"--in other words, prices actually dropped in the 1980s.
<P>	Bahrain has few government-imposed prices or set wages, minimal restrictions on foreign 
investments, a limited bureaucracy that imposes scant regulations on businesses. Its black market is 
practically non-existent. In each of the categories where countries were ranked, Bahrain scored among the 
best.  Since Bahrain's independence in 1971, it has achieved a per capita GDP of $11,536,
<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  which makes it more wealthy than Ireland.
<P><B>	Nations Emerge from Communism. </B> The <I>Index </I>also sheds light on the 
different economic paths taken by former communist countries. Of the countries graded in this edition of 
the <I>Index, </I>the Czech Republic is ranked among the top 12 in the world with the highest levels of 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">[4]</FONT>  Thus, the Czech Republic has the freest economy of all the former East Bloc 
countries. Right behind the Czech Republic is Estonia. Both Estonia and the Czech Republic have adopted 
low rates of taxation, eliminated abusive government regulations, and minimized state constraints on 
individual economic activity. The results are that the economies of these two countries are performing 
better than any other former socialist state.
<P>	Some of the more developed countries have less economic freedom than less prosperous, 
developing countries.  Sweden, for example, scored a relatively weak 2.65.  This score can be attributed to 
Sweden's high level of taxation and the heavy role its government plays in the economy.  Neverthe-less, 
Sweden is wealthier than Malaysia, which scores a 2.15.  Sweden has a per capita GDP amount of 
$17,490, while Malaysia has a per capita GDP figure of $7,400.<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT> 
<P> 	This finding may seem, at first glance, to invalidate the claim that economic freedom is the most 
important factor in stimulating economic development. However, this would be a misreading of the 
evidence. The Index of Economic Freedom is but a snapshot in time.  It measures economic freedom 
today.  There is no accounting for the economic history of Sweden, nor is Malaysia's past captured in its 
Index score. Sweden is richer than Malaysia, even though it is less free, because Sweden began 
industrialization long before Malaysia. Thus, it has had longer to develop and accumulate wealth. 
However, at present growth rates, it may not be long before Malaysia catches up with Sweden. Malaysia's 
economic growth exceeds Sweden's today, and Malaysia had an average growth rate of 5.6 percent from 
1980 to 1991.  Sweden had an average rate of growth for the same time of 2 percent.
<P><B>	The Curve of Economic Freedom. </B> This comparison of Sweden and Malaysia 
points to an important phenomenon discovered in this study: Long periods of economic growth resulting 
from high levels of economic freedom seem to create states that reverse course and place limits on 
economic freedom.  This is the Curve of Economic Freedom.  As the curve demonstrates, most countries 
with limited levels of economic freedom are grouped together with corresponding low levels of per 
capita wealth.  As some countries begin to reform their economies by establishing market-based systems 
that promote economic growth, per capita wealth increases.  However, once these countries reach a 
certain level of economic prosperity, as in the G-7 countries, they are tempted to regulate their 
economies, raise taxes, and add welfare programs, which results in less economic freedom and slower 
rates of economic growth.
<P>	The Curve of Economic Freedom helps to explain why economic growth rates have lagged lowed 
in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1980s. Since that time, these countries has increased government 
spending, resulting in corresponding increases in taxation and regulation. If these trends continue, these 
countries will eventually suffer from dwindling economic growth and shrinking per capita wealth. 
<P><B>	Regions of Freedom. </B>North America, parts of Europe, and East Asia have the 
highest amounts of both economic freedom and per capita wealth.  Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, 
and some republics of the former-Soviet Union are among the least economically free and poorest 
countries in the world.  Yet, while many countries in the developed world have rather high levels of 
economic freedom, many have reimposed restrictions on that freedom while many less developed 
countries have removed impediments to freedom and are beginning to catch up with the advanced 
industrial countries.
<P>	For example, some nations in Europe, mainly Germany, France, Italy, and even the United 
Kingdom to a lesser extent, have economic recessions.  Much of this is a result of increased government 
spending and interference in the economy.  The European Union, for example, will spend about 22 percent 
of its combined GDP on social welfare programs.  This is up from around 16 percent in 1989.  In 
Germany, government spending on social security and welfare now accounts for 49 percent of total 
government expenditures.  In the U.K., social spending is about 33 percent.
<P>	To fund social programs, these countries have raised tax rates to very high levels. Germany, Italy, 
and Japan have top income tax rates over 50 percent.  Britain has a top rate of 40 percent, while that of  
the U.S. is 39.6 percent.  Hong Kong, however, taxes income at a top rate of around 15 percent.  Other 
developing countries, like Estonia, have adopted relatively low top tax rates of 26 percent.
<P><B>	Foreign Aid Failures. </B> The <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> scores 
represent a damning condemnation of the U.S. foreign aid program.  It is well known that many countries 
which have received the largest amount of economic assistance from the U.S., including India and 
Bangladesh, are also the world's poorest countries.  Sadly, many of these countries are only getting 
poorer, and most policy makers know that the U.S. foreign aid program is doing little or nothing to stop it. 
Indeed, this is why Brian Atwood, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, is 
scrambling to "reinvent" his beleaguered agency.
<P>	It is troubling to learn that the large recipients of U.S. aid are also the countries with the least 
amount of economic freedom.  India, for example, scored a 3.70 and Bangladesh scored even worse at 
3.90.  The dearth of economic freedom permitted in these countries has produced nothing but economic 
misery.  It is tragic that this disastrous course has been subsidized by U.S. foreign aid. 
<P>	The record is particularly damning in Africa. The west African country of Ghana scores a poor 
3.20. Nevertheless, Ghana is the "star" of the international donor community, receiving nearly $1 billion 
in development aid each year. The three Sub-Saharan countries, Swaziland, Uganda, and South Africa, have 
the greatest degree of economic freedom, scoring 2.90, 2.94, and 3.00, respectively. Though good by 
Africa standards, these are bad scores when compared to Western standards. Africa's interventionist 
economic policies have drained it of economic vitality. 
<P>	Israel scored a 3.10 and Egypt 3.50.  These two countries together receive the bulk of U.S. 
foreign aid.  They are scheduled to receive over $5 billion in 1995.  Although each country has spoken of 
economic liberalization, little progress has been made, particularly in Egypt, where a reform effort has 
run out of steam.  U.S. aid to these two countries may be justified in terms of U.S. national security.  The 
peaceful relationship between Israel and Egypt is viewed as the bulwark of Middle East stability.  
However, these considerations aside, there can be no doubt that U.S. aid is doing little to promote 
economic development in these countries. In fact, it may be retarding development by delaying economic 
reforms.
<P>	The U.S. has recently occupied Haiti to restore democracy to that poverty-stricken country.  
Haiti scores a 4.20 on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  This amounts to economic repression. 
The Haitian elite has repressed economic activity by every means, including the use of physical violence.  
Haiti's lack of economic freedom has made it the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  In short, 
Haiti's crisis is as much economic as political. Haiti's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> score 
suggests that foreign aid will do nothing to promote economic development unless the Haitian economy 
is dramatically liberalized.
<P>	Finally, nations still under the control of communist dictatorships like Cuba and North Korea, 
and to a lesser extent, Vietnam, collected at the bottom of the Index.  These countries are controlled by 
regimes that repress most forms of economic activity, saving most sources of wealth for corrupt 
government officials who use their control over the economy as the means to maintain power.
<P>	After all is said and done, the inescapable conclusion of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> 
is that the best way for a nation to grow economically is to tax less, lower trade barriers, better protect 
private property, allow foreign investment, and generally reduce the level of government interference in 
the economy. Whether they be G-7 countries or the Asian Tigers, countries that are the wealthiest and 
growing the fastest are the ones that are most economically free.  While many factors in addition to 
economic freedom account for the absolute wealth of nations--such as size, resources, the absence or 
presence of war, and even culture--no single factor is as important in determining economic development.  
The road to riches, it seems, indeed is paved with freedom.

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<p>
<h1><center>The Center for Political Renewal</center></h1>
<p>

The purpose of the Center for Political Renewal is to examine the revolutionary
changes now underway in American politics and develop the principles and the
agenda that will guide the next majority political coalition. Big Change may lead
to a revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

The work of the Center for Political Renewal consists of two related endeavors:
The work of Foundation distinguished Senior Fellow <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Weber">Vin Weber</a> on his book, The New
Majority; and the work of the Center itself in developing a set of principles and
an agenda to guide the next successful political coalition to produce a
(peaceful) revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

In The New Majority, Weber looks at the current political upheavals from a
historical perspective and outlines the principles of an emerging majority
coalition -- which may be a "new" Democratic party, a "new" Republican party or,
conceivably, a new party by a different name. <p>

Weber's work is reinforced by other Center activities. For example, in November
1994, the Center sponsored a major post-election poll whose stunning results were
reported in <a href="http://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Among its findings were that "a tidal wave
of voter discontent with government in general, and <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A> in particular, was
responsible for the loss of dozens of incumbent Democrats who failed to heed the
warning signs." The study found that by nearly 15 to 1, Americans believe the
Federal government is "much too big and has too much power."<p>

Unfortunately, the budget issue is beginning to lose the attention of the voters.  In the end, success at the polls will not be determined by the poignancy of the issues, but by the amount of interest the issue can muster among voters.  And so, light weight stupid issues like school prayer and smut on the internet become the cause d'jour while important matters like the solvency of our economy are neglected.<br><b>Mark, Staten Island, NY</b><P>

Just shut it down.<br>
It's time to call Clinton's and Paneta's bluff.
Keep up the talk of the "irresponsibility of leaving more debt to our children"on top of the $5 trillion already spent.
<br>Enough is enough!<br><b>Dean, Portland, OR</b><p>

Republicans should stand fast.  Don't get political
cold feet.  You don't need to compromise.
Compromising your principles means violating them!!
That's not what we sent you there to do.
<BR>
Unfortunately, old-bulls like Bob Dole seem to have a
"principle of the day" - whatever seems to be popular.
These are not principles, so we would have to call
wavering Republicans such as Bob Dole unprincipled.
<BR>
I speak for myself and hundreds of others who are tired
of seeing the old-timers run scared from the media, and
the freshman ignored by the Republican leadership.
<BR>
Get your act together guys, or we'll put you out to
pasture as soon as possible!!!
<br><b>Ron, St. Louis, MO</b>
<P>
The Democrats obviously have no desire to balance the budget. They are only playing along because they want to appear to be part of the process. If the Republicans had not gained a majority there would no talk of balanced budget, or welfare reform or Medicare reform from the Democrats. The Republicans should ignore the polls for the next year and keep pushing their budget reform. If the Republicans faulter at this there is a danger of the Democrats retaking the Congress.<br><b>Mark, Pasadena, CA</b><P>

Ronald Reagan once told his budget director, Jim Miller, "Jim, let's just shut it down, and see whether anyone notices!"<br><b>Terry, Toms River, NJ</b><P>

Please DO NOT raise the national DEBT ceiling 1 dollar on our children and grandchildren. I believe AS HAS ALREADY panned out in the media that the Republicians can make NO deals with either the Democrats or the President. Therefore I suggest a strong hand approach in dealing with him, DON'T BUDGE ONE INCH, give him the bills then adjurn congress and go home and let him squell. A week or two of no budget wont cause America to go under,and Him, Morris and his other handlers and so called experts can just scream. Get tuff with the media, show them that Clinton and Dems wont compromise, do your own media blitz. He has already stated he does not like this or that in the bills, face it at every turn he will make Congress look bad, SO PLAY HARDBALL with him. If he calls you back from adjournment TAKE YOUR TIME getting back, let Clinton be the GRINCH THAT STOLE CHRISTMAS. I have learned that NASTY people can only be delt with from a STRONG position and NEVER, NEVER compromise unless THEY are willing to also compromise.<br><b>William, Frederick, MD</b><P>

Quit the cutbacks and start cutting whole departments!
Any bureaucracy not eliminated while we have the chance
will just "grow" itself back within a decade or three.<br><b>Mike, Little Rock, AR</b><P>

 I'm very anxious about the 4.8 trillion dollar dept; particulary when I contemplate the future for my children. As a middle class income earner, I find the tax burden excessive, and quite frankly I'm getting physically and mentally tired. I want the federal government to be downsized, the states to be empowered, and my taxes restributed with more staying in my state.<br><b>Robert, Sierra Vista, AZ</b><P>

Republicans have lost some credibility with me by failing to address some of the more egregious examples of the so-called corporate welfare and special interest subsidies.  But the party has to remain firm in its convictions and continue to stress the benefits of the budget package without feeling that they must respond to the criticisms of the left.
<br>Stay the high ground.<br><b>James, Centerville, OH</b><p>

The Republicans in Congress must stand fast!  They must
withstand the barrage of the criticism of desperate
liberals.  Let Clinton save face by "negotiating" with him 
and making minor conciliations that he can then gloat
over.  As long as the result is a balanced budget, the
citizens of this country are the real winners.<br><b>Louise, Menlo Park, CA</b><P>

<title>A Message From Aspen -- 1/18/95 -- PFF</title>
</head>

<h2>Message from Aspen</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a></center>
<P>
Big Change is upon us.  In America, we have called this <I>revolution</I>.
 Today, it is also called <I>cyberspace</I>.
<P>
Two dozen doyens of big change and the new world met in Aspen
in August.  The theme on the table:  <I>Cyberspace and the American
Dream</I>.  Big Stuff:  an economic revolution, a transformation
of our way of life.  We asked them:  What does this mean for us,
the way we live together, do business, and govern?  Around the
table were some of the first surveyors of the digital landscape.
 It was familiar terrain for all;  so active talk we expected
&#150; and we wrangled and argued for two days about important
things, and about revolution. The last thing we expected to come
out of it all was a ringing, <I>solidarnosc</I> manifesto.
<P>
But something unexpected none the less remained.  A message runs
through the talk.  And it is a message, not for those in the know,
but for regular Americans, those to whom cyberspace is no more
than a breath of esoterica.  It is a message of needed fundamentals,
of things about big change that everyone should know.
<P>
We offer it in the form of the informal, of principles not for
incantation, but for reflection.  Words taken from the talk at
Aspen appear <I>&#147;like this.&#148;</I>
<P>
Here is our message.
<P>
<B><center>Cyberspace is not a medium, but a place.</B></center>
<P>
Before cyberspace, there was <I>the air waves</I>.  The old metaphor
was about how information traveled, how the ether took data packets
from one terminal to another.  And as a metaphor, the air waves
signaled a medium only, an agency that all wished to use;  a common,
and thus shared, instrumentality.
<P>
But cyberspace is a place.  We meet in the ether itself.  For
those who regularly play or do business there, it is even a temporary
habitation.  The new metaphor of a place becomes real;  even though
we are physically separate, our senses connect.  Information is
no longer data, but landscape.  At Aspen, when we reached for
words, they were concrete, world-words:  cyberspace as <I>&#147;ecosystem,&#148;
a new &#147;ecology,&#148;</I> <I>&#147;cyberspace is closer to
a datasphere or space of information.&#148;</I>  It has laid the
same claim on our imagination as a newly discovered country, a
frontier.  It is truly a new world.
<P>
We know it is a place because we think of it as a place.  We act
as though it is a place.  Groups of us meet there; we interact
there:  where <I>interact</I> is merely our new word for being
social.
<P>
Meaning we create human communities there.
<P>
Calling cyberspace a place is our fundamental first principle:
 first to change unstated habits of thought, and then the very
definitions of law.  It means that cyberspace is not a common
medium, a public good; which after the model of <I>the air waves</I>
needs government control and regulation if it is to be shared
as a commons.  Cyberspace is a realm, a sphere of permanent human
gathering and activity.  Primitive it is &#150; a digitally savage
place &#150; but it is, like the earliest American colonies, <B>in
the process of being settled</B>.  Since cyberspace is a created
place, our technology reach endows the possibility of its social
development, of its rise to civilization;  just as the evolution
of ships and the first computers &#150; sextant and astrolabe
&#150; made possible America itself.  So the first colonies in
cyberspace are like any other human experiments at living on a
distant shore.  They are experiments in society itself.
<P>
<B><center>The communities that grow there must be <br>private before they<I>
</I>are public.</B></center>
<P>
These experiments in cyberspace are pioneer communities, and they
may be the first stakeholders of a new society.  Not an alien
culture:  more like an extension of ourselves in a new, but very
different place.  And like any weak and distant settlement, the
new place seems oppressive in its harshness;  and from our far
away vantage &#150; like that of 17th century Londoners &#150;
it all seems primitive and strange.  And it is strange;  and the
unyielding strangeness of an alien world forces human social adaptation.
 People come to this new place with all the inherited social traditions
of late-industrial culture;  and it doesn&#146;t work that way
here.  Others have come in rebellion, or seeking sanctuary from
the tyranny of those traditions.  They want it all to be different.
<P>
What the cyber-colonists share is the desire to adapt, to be able
to be there, and stay there, and make it work.  That drives them;
 and that means, like so many fragile first settlements, that
they will find a way to make it work.  But that means finding
out above all what <I>does</I> work.
<P>
Culture is everywhere in us.  It teaches us how to arrange human
things, how to relate to one another.  And it urges us to make
rules that guide our thinking and our actions.  Law is only the
last form of human rule-making to appear.  Most societies rely
on custom and taboo; they save the law for community theater:
 a mix of teaching and collective observance.
<P>
Social rules &#150; custom and taboo as opposed to law &#150;
have become <I>private</I> in the modern sense:  that is, they
inhere to a community or group only, and are not officially owned
by the national society as a whole.  When social rules inhere
to the national society, they are no longer owned and exercised
by a community of <B>people</B>, but by the national <B>government</B>.
 This is the modern meaning of <I>public</I>.  Long ago, <I>public</I>
referred to the whole of a tribe, in a time when tribe and community
were the same word.  The industrial period separated public from
community.  The new nation state created a formal code of national
law that grew in to a superstructure of life:  it supplanted custom
and taboo for all groups, and replaced social rules with centralized
fiat.  Today, in everyday usage, public no longer means <I>of
the people</I>, it means that particular aspect of government
regulation of <I>everyone&#146;s</I> life.
<P>
Since cyberspace is still seen by America&#146;s centralized authority
as a public medium,  this authority seeks to regulate the new
ether as it did the air waves.  But suppose this authority affirmed
the new metaphor of cyberspace as a realm, colonized by pioneering
settlers?  Would the authority allow the new communities to create
their own rules?  Would it understand that old rules, hardened
into code and statute, might not fit the new place?<HR>

<P>
America&#146;s frontier communities grew up on their own.  The
British Crown did not interfere unduly in their <I>private</I>
life, even as this evolved into civic life, even to the level
of colonial assemblies.  And after we won our independence, young
America let communities continue to make their own rules.
<P>
<I>&#147;We are hearkening back to the old frontier.  At first
they spent an awful lot of time conquering the frontier and building
the frontier and making a society here where there was no one.
 And then they studied politics.&#148;</I>
<P>
Politics as governance should grow out of the traditions of community
rule.  But in industrial America rules have been codified on high,
and are imposed from above.  This reversal of original tradition
is suffered more or less passively by most citizens.  Those sodbusting
in cyberspace, however, are different.  They argue that regulation
for an industrial world will not work in the ether.  And they
are generally more &#145;ornery and defiant than most American
citizens.
<P>
Their message:  to colonize cyberspace,
<P>
<B><center>Custom must precede law.</center></B>
<P>
They want to build their own communities, not have them administered
by the state.  They insist that state-regulated human relations
in cyberspace will stunt, if not destroy, the growth of real society
there.
<P>
<I>&#147;This discussion is very evocative of communities in America
in the 18th century.  If you look at the communities that founded
America, many of them were fleeing a place of tyranny, and they
sought just to be unto themselves, and that was accepted originally
in America.  I think in some ways we have come full circle.&#148;</I>
<P>
Not just frontier spirit here, but a bit of <I>Allegheny Uprising</I>
too.  Cyberspace foments a rebellion against the Old Order.
<P>
<B><center>The new society is a successor society &#150; and so<br> a new
model.</B>
<P></center>
Why is this important?  This is surely the most marginal of frontier
societies.  Or is it?
<P>
What we call cyber-communities look more like encampments than
colonies.  But we tend to tie our image of community to the familial-neighborhood
icon only.  We forget that our economic intercourse is a highly
advanced network of business communities, marked by highly developed
sets of personal and group relationships.  In the US in fact,
a case can be made that the strongest personal ties that many
have are not family at all, but company and firm.  From core identity
to emotional investment, the communities of commerce define late
20th century America.
<P>
We call it The Marketplace.  And the new marketplace is moving
to the new place, cyberspace.  It is moving there because the
technologies of the ether <I>&#147;can make transaction costs
so small that we can eventually eliminate them.&#148;</I>  What
earthly market can say that?  And what market can ignore transaction
costs, when there is one that has none?
<P>
Like the ancient agora or bazaar, markets seek communities, and
communities cluster around the marketplace.  And as cyberspace
becomes a living social sphere, going to market there is not just
a response to zero transaction costs;  it is like going downtown
in the old city.  Communities actually, and increasingly, inhabit
the same space as the new marketplace.  Cyberspace begins to lose
its frontier edges, and edges into <I>Boom Town</I>.  More and
more people enter the ether and work there.  They don&#146;t just
get info dumps on their terminal;  the terminal becomes their
vehicle, their wheels into cyberspace.  So the new society gets
serious, and gets beyond the BBS, through the social network of
enterprise.
<P>
And because of business, the new society truly promises to succeed
the old.  It succeeds because it lets everything work faster,
better, and with higher confidence.  And it is open:  everything
is there to see.  Open markets have always worked on trust, and
each advance in transaction has been built on it.  Transparency
is its own enforcement.
<P>
Which means that the very nature of the cyberspace urges a ethos
of trust.  Transparency reaffirms the power of ostracism;  it
encourages virtue as no law of the land can.  What openness does
to business deadbeats, it does in a much larger sense for the
new society:  it renews the strength of custom over law, of group
rules self-defined over regulation by government authority.  And
it is fairer by far.  If <I>&#147;value is determined by the trust
that people have and can be engaged directly so as to define their
own currency even,&#148;</I> then each of us has the power to
shape our own value according to our actions.
<P>
So a new ethic in the marketplace at last comes home:  and the
far shores of a new world brings us back to the Atlantic shore
of our earliest ancestors;  back to that confidence in their values
and beliefs that is their charge to us.
<P>
<B><center>It threatens the old, and the old order seeks<br> to kill or stunt
it.</B></center>
<P>
But in this promise of progress is a problem.
<P>
<I>&#147;If markets are going to get immeasurably better, it should
be possible to return to the market many things that are handed
to government.&#148;</I>
<P>
Or, cyberspace as the main threat to the Old Order.
<P>
It took the American colonies almost two centuries to become a
threat to Britain&#146;s established order.  And it took long
war and a financial crisis to disrupt a century-long pattern of
British benign neglect of rule.
<P>
No such hope exists for cyberspace.  To the Old Order, the threat
of cyberspace is like the Industrial and the French revolutions
rolled into one.
<P>
<I>&#147;The fact that a system is chaotic and not capable of
control by old institutions, does not necessarily mean that it
is going to blow up like a bomb.&#148;</I>
<P>
Ah, but that is exactly how imperial Washington sees cyberspace.
 In its eyes it resembles a bomb in every respect:  it ticks like
a bomb, it is fused to blow in a finite period of time, and its
explosive power is enough to bring down the old house.
<P>
And the pioneers know it:
<P>
<I>&#147;When we start using phrases like </I>Government as the
Engine of Progress<I>, then we are deep into machine think and
machine language.&#148; ... &#147;The old machine model came out
with a perfect Hoover blueprint for everything.  Everything has
to be under control. Everything has to be in balance.  All the
pieces have to fit together.  But the machine can&#146;t evolve
or change.  And I think what we are engaged in now is the disassembly
of that super bureaucratic apparatus.&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;We should be examining very critically just which freedoms
really need government to be protected&#148; ... &#147;Before
we hand back to government or say to government, oh yes, you get
to protect all our freedoms, we should ask critically just which
ones we can protect for ourselves ...&#148;</I>
<P>
All we have to do is listen to our own words.
<P>
So &#147;telecom&#148; legislation brought forward by the <I>ancien
regime</I> is offered as public reform or public protection, but
it is intended to freeze evolution.  It would be like Charles
II forbidding all ship departures from Bristol to British North
America.  Of course, that would have been a form of royal self-mutilation.
 It was beyond the 17th century imagination.
<P>
But not beyond of the mind of the late 20th century imperial bureaucrat:
<P>
<I>&#147;We are in a world with ever-increasing regulatory tentacles
reaching throughout the system, and even now beginning to invade
the information economy itself and strangle it  ...&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;What we need is for telephone companies with their tremendous
fiber capacity to link to the broad band connections to homes
that cable companies now possess to create a broad band infrastructure
for the Internet.  But because regulators prohibit this natural
evolution ... capital is fleeing from the Internet ... to Hollywood.&#148;</I>
<P>
The irony is that forcing new world builders to compete over &#147;content&#148;
drives telecom back to the social universe of couch potato-TV;
 back to the stupefying, one-way feed box of industrial information
... back to the vision of George Orwell.
<P>
Back to the cultural compass of the 1950s?  Back to the future?
<P>
<B><center>We need to protect the new from the old, <br>while it is still
vulnerable.</center></B>
<P>
No regime has ever stopped relentless change.  Revolutions happen;
 the Soviet <I>nomenclatura</I> had not enough T-72s to stop theirs,
and our Imperial City has not enough Clipper Chips or Senators
Exxon to starve out the brash settlements on the Net.  But they
can slow it down, divert its course for awhile, give us all grief.
<P>
But what we have made in cyberspace is revolution&#146;s start.
 We don&#146;t have to worry about what it will do:  we know full
well what it will do.  What we must do is fight like hell to give
this juggernaut &#150; just like yesterday&#146;s locomotive of
progress &#150; its History-breaking head of steam.
<P>
<I>&#147;I am convinced that federal level government is an industrial
era artifact that arose to protect the interests of large industrial
institutions and will go away with them.&#148;</I>

 It's still trendy among liberals to link homelessness with supposed
government cuts in social services.  Nattering about Newt in the
mid-90s has replaced the roaring about Reaganism that characterized
the early-80s, but the message is the same:  Budget dips sink
ships.  The truth is different:  Many of the lives sinking in
recent years had holes cut into their hulls 25 years ago, during
liberalism's golden age.
<P>
 Take as a case study the story of Rudy Jones, 45.  He grew up
in a middle class household in the District and as a teenager
reacted, 60s-style, to school &quot;regimentation.&quot; He became
a voracious reader of political thrillers and worked for Hubert
Humphrey's campaign in 1968.  Then he went to college, where drugs
were more important than studies, and learned about LSD, speed
and surrealistic painting.
<P>
 After college Mr. Jones moved to Los Angeles and &quot;tried
to get into the film business.  That's where I really got into
some fast circles.  I was doing a lot of powdered cocaine out
there.&quot;  The infantilized gratification-seeking that characterized
late-sixties politics and culture stayed with him as he moved
back to Washington and worked at a television station as a production
technician and then as film and tape editor.  
<P>
 By 1984, Cal Ripken, Jr. thirty miles to the north had already
begun his streak of showing up for work day after day, but it
was hard for a child of the sixties to be an iron man.  A stripper
in a strip-tease joint in 1984 introduced Jones to crack cocaine,
which he had heard of before as a drug that led middle class people
to &quot;sell their houses and break up their lives.&quot;  He
had scoffed at such reports, but when he took his first hit &quot;the
bells were going off in the center of my brain.&quot;
<P>
 Jones had learned during the sixties to satisfy his impulses,
and he spent the mid-80s turning theory into practice.  More cocaine,
more disintegration in his life: &quot;It was like a slow motion
train wreck.  A big long pile up.&quot;  Unable to work consistently
because of his drug use, Jones left his job in 1988 and began
a series of freelance assignments that would give him the money
for crack without the obligation of regular labor.  
<P>
 The culmination came in September, 1994, when he received a check
for $1500 from a public television station: &quot;I just went
nuts. Didn't sleep or eat for four days in a row, doing crack
all the time.  That's when I realized I needed to do something
drastic.&quot;   Drastic for Jones was entering a live-in, anti-addiction
program at the Gospel Mission at 810 Fifth St., N.W.
<P>
   Ironically, it was sixties reasoning -- don't think about right
and wrong, just show me where I can get a buzz -- that led him
into a program built on right and wrong:  Jones based his decision
to enter the Gospel Mission not on faith in Christ, but on research
showing that religious anti-addiction programs are more successful
than others:  &quot;I wanted to get results, I didn't care how.&quot;
 
<P>
 Pragmatism changed to awe as Jones went through the Gospel Mission's
Bible studies and counseling programs, however. The transformation,
he says, began when he stopped thinking of God as &quot;a bunch
of physics laws&quot; and started to see Him as &quot;a personal
entity that man could relate to.&quot;  Suddenly he could pray,
for he knew that God was listening.  Suddenly there was purpose
that went outside self-pleasing, for God was watching.  Suddenly
there was power to change, because God was helping.
<P>
 After five months Jones felt &quot;completely changed.&quot;
 When I interviewed him in February, 1995, he spoke of no longer
living for each day's pleasures, as he had done since the 1960s,
but dying to self -- seeing God rather than man as the center
of things. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Complete changes sometimes short-circuit; time heals all wounds
and also tests all spiritual swoons.  I've checked on Rudy Jones:
 He has stayed clean this year and was judged ready to move out
of the Gospel Mission in order to live with and care for his mother,
who is now in her 80s and in need of help.  He's working in telecommunications
and volunteering twice a week to teach English and writing to
newcomers at the Mission.   Stuck in the sixties for three decades,
he has finally grown up.  And its time that the apologists for
infantilism did so also.

<title>Time to End Costly Direct Student Loans -- Heritage</title>

<H3><i>TIME TO END COSTLY DIRECT STUDENT LOANS</i></h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has portrayed its direct lending program for college students as essential to the educational future of young Americans. Nothing could be further from the truth. The direct government lending program is bad for taxpayers, bad for students, and bad for schools. Later this week, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee will consider the statutory changes necessary to achieve the spending targets for the 1996 federal education budget. They could expand, cap, or eliminate the Clinton direct lending program. The best choice for taxpayers, students, and schools would be to end it.
<p>

<b>STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The primary source of student financial aid in America is federally guaranteed student loans. Since it was created in 1965, this program, now known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL), has funded 74 million student loans worth over $180 billion.1  More than six million loans totaling nearly $22 billion were disbursed in FY 1994 alone.2  Private lenders provide the capital for the loans, and private and state guarantor agencies process them. The federal government subsidizes the interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases of default, and exercises regulatory authority over the program. This relationship, while by no means perfect, has worked relatively well in providing loans to millions of American college and university students.3<p>In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed replacing this program with direct lending by the federal government, extending a limited pilot program approved in the 1992 Higher Education Act. The Administration claimed this would be more efficient. While schools would administer the program, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loans and would service and collect the loans itself. This plan would radically change the federal government's three-decade involvement in college lending programs by effecting what Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) called "a total federal takeover of a successful public-private sector partnership."4<p>Congress initially rejected a full direct lending program, but approved a trial phase-in over at least five years:  5 percent of loan volume in 1994-1995, 40 percent in 1995-1996, 50 percent or more in 1996-1998, and 60 percent or more in 1998-1999. The U.S. Department of Education in July 1994 began making direct loans to 104 schools, representing 5 percent of the loan volume. In a sign that schools are hesitating to participate, the 1995-1996 loan volume will end up at around 28.7 percent -- far short of the 40 percent target.5  The Administration hopes to accelerate the program to reach 100 pe
rcent participation in 1997-1998, and is willing to require colleges and universities -- including those that object to the program -- to participate.6<p><b>BAD ECONOMICS</b><p>Much of the debate over direct loans turns on the question of cost:  Replacing guaranteed loans with direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. The FY 1996 Clinton budget claims $4.1 billion in savings over the 1996-2000 period if the direct loan program is fully implemented.7  Recent cost estimates tell a very different story.<p><b>Eliminating the direct loan program saves money.</b> Prior to 1990, the long-term financing and administrative costs of all student loans were ignored in budget scoring, and direct loan capital outlays were considered current year expenditures. This problem was corrected with the Credit Reform Act of 1990, which required calculation of these long-term costs for guaranteed loans but not for direct loans. When the direct loan program was enacted in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office initially estimated the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.8  This estimate ignored the long-term costs of direct loans in accordance with the Credit Reform Act. The 1996 Budget Resolution, however, amended the Credit Reform Act to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of the direct loan program. The revised report of the Congressional Budget Office, released in July and based on these changes in official budget scoring, projects that a fully implemented direct loan program would save just $115 million over the next seven years. Indeed, according to the CBO, eliminating the direct loan program and maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion in budget outlays over the next seven years.9<p><b>The direct loan program adds considerably to the national debt.</b> The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided by private sources. But under the Clinton plan, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loan
s. This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each year to provide enough capital for the program. According the Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK) in congressional testimony last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year 2014.10  Two independent analyses in 1993, conducted by leading accounting firms, argued that such amounts of government borrowing could increase interest rates on the public debt. One noted that this would "wipe out the saving claimed for direct lending" and warned lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" if they shifted to direct lending.11<p>Furthermore, the direct loan program is fiscally irresponsible. A key feature of the Clinton direct loan program is the "income contingent repayment plan" for students. The goal of this plan is to reduce the debt repayment burden on graduates struggling with repayment, thereby also reducing the rate of loan defaults. Instead of a regular monthly installment, repayment is contingent on future income. Students choosing this option, however, could well end up increasing their personal debt by stretching out their repayment period and actually increasing the principal on the loan. Nor will this help the default problem. According to the Congressional Research Service, "direct lending is largely irrelevant as a means of reducing [default] costs" and "may well increase default costs."12  If borrowers stretch out their repayments to 25 years, as encouraged by the income contingent repayment plan, the accumulated debt will simply be forgiven. Loan defaults would be permitted and assumed by the government.<p><b>BAD EDUCATION POLICY</b>
<p>
Direct lending centralizes control of student loans within the U.S. Department of Education. The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. The government already is funding this expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization. This not only builds a new government bureaucracy, but also creates the potential for vast inefficiencies and unconstrained program costs. 
<p>
The Department of Education is notoriously disorganized and mismanaged. It has proven that it cannot manage the existing student aid program,13 and already is having problems dealing with the current small-scale direct lending program. Among other things, students are experiencing delays and complicated paperwork.14  In 1994 the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct loans but was unable to account for some $100 million.15  The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, created by Congress as an independent advisory body on student aid, concludes in a recent study that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in general, cannot "ensure program integrity."16 <p>The Administration has proposed turning to another bureaucracy to solve the problem of loan collection:  the Internal Revenue Service. A joint study by the Education and Treasury Departments, however, concludes that "it is not feasible to expand the participation of the IRS in the collection of student loans."  IRS involvement in loan collection would "strain IRS resources, interfere with its primary mission, and decrease higher dollar tax collections, without improving student loan program administration or customer service."17  Without the IRS, however, the burden falls back on the Department of Education.<p>There are precedents for failure with direct loans. In the early 1970s, Congress experimented with direct loans through the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program. It was poorly managed, and because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates soared above previous levels. It was phased out in 1976. Largely because of this failure, there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors.
<p>
The direct loan program also is bad for academic freedom. Three quarters of all available college financial aid comes from the federal government.18  If the government takes over the loan program, colleges and universities will become dependent on a single lender to support their students. Its power to control loan revenue, together with its regulatory authority and enforcement power, will give the government vast influence over post-secondary education. The very possibility that the federal government might use this new authority to force curriculum changes or mandate racial preferences should breed caution. This is no farfetched theory; it is the very question settled in favor of the government in the 1984 Supreme Court case of <i>Grove City College v. Bell</i>.19  There currently are efforts to centralize further the college accreditation process (which allows a college's students to be eligible for financial aid in the first place) as a way of enforcing nationwide multicultural education standards.20  One can only imagine the temptations presented to some education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government control over student loan money. If recent history is any guide, further government intrusion can only harm college and university education.21 <p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>The existing guaranteed loan program is not perfect. Taxpayers bear all the risk, and schools, students, and lenders should bear greater responsibility. The system must be based on genuine risk sharing that minimizes government costs without destabilizing the current loan program. At the same time, recent improvements in the program should not be overlooked. The loan application process has become simpler in recent years, and the default rate has declined significantly. All of these improvements would be even greater if some of the streamlining ideas in the direct lending program were applied to the guaranteed loan program.
<p>
The solution is not to nationalize the multi-billion-dollar student loan program. That would mean new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans believe strongly that student loans should continue to be provided through private financial institutions, not the federal government.22 <p>Nor is the solution to maintain the program at some arbitrary level. This only postpones the final program decision, validates the creation of a new education bureaucracy, and delays the reforms needed to strengthen and improve funding prospects for America's educational future.23 <p>The only prudent and fiscally responsible answer is to eliminate the program.<p><b>Endnotes:</b><p><ol><li>For a review of the loan programs and ways to reform them, see Scott A.

<b>The American Conservative Union</b><br> 
<P>
Before the Subcommittee on
Commerce, Justice, and State<br>
The Judiciary, and related agencies of the Appropriations Committee<br>

<p>
<img alt="Picture of David Keene" src="keentest.gif"><br>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH"="30%"><P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.  Let me begin by thanking you for the opportunity to testify before you this morning.
<P>
My name is <A HREF="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a> and I am Chairman of the American Conservative Union.  The ACU has for more than 30 years served as the grass-roots lobby for the conservative movement.  Our nearly one million members have been interested in and involved in the debate over whether the Legal Service Corporation can be reformed or whether it should be eliminated as a delivery vehicle for legal services to disadvantaged Americans since the mid-seventies and feel very strongly that the entrenched interests in control of the corporation make it very unlikely that any meaningful reform is even possible.
<P>
Sometimes a program that has gone off the tracks becomes so entrenched and resistant to reform that it has to be eliminated.  The LSC is such a program.  It will do no good to cut off a few branches . . . you must go to the root problem, bite the bullet . . . and start over.
<P>
The Legal Services Corporation was, as you know, established in 1974 to take over the programs then housed within the Office of Legal Services in the Office of Economic Opportunity or OEO.
<P>
You will hear various versions of just why the LSC was established, but as you consider the question of extending its funding, I would urge you to consider that the Nixon Administration had been urged to establish such a quasi-governmental corporation by the Ash Commission in 1971 as "a first step toward reprivatization of what has traditionally been a function of the private sector."
<P>
The LSC has, in fact, developed into something quite different employing via grants and contract thousands of attorneys who have become dependent upon government largesse both for their income and as a means of allowing them the freedom to pursue an agenda that has very little to do with providing individual legal services to those who cannot otherwise afford to go to a lawyer.
<P>
It must be admitted that most of those who came to dominate the new corporation as well as a sizable number of those who fought first to establish it and later to defend it have no desire at all to "reprivatize" the provision of legal services within our society.  Rather, they sought a permanent home for their activities with a guaranteed source of funding free of even the minimal oversight they had faced at OEO.
<P>
And . . . as history has shown . . . the interests that quickly came to dominate the new corporation have a far, far different view of its role in our society than did most of those who voted to establish it.
<P>
Many in Congress who voted in 1974 to establish the LSC did so in the belief that through the corporation they would be giving individual Americans without the wherewithal to afford private lawyers access to the legal system that they might otherwise be denied.  They envisioned a small army of idealistic men and women utilizing LSC grants to help poor families fight unfair evictions or avoid consumer rip-offs.
<P>
Since 1974, however, the LSC has spent millions of dollars on quasi-legal political activity designed to "organize" and "empower" the poor as a group or class . . . money that might better have been used to serve individual clients.  The mission as those running
LSC has seen it is to transform American society by changing laws and governmental policies affecting what they tend to see as their constituencies.
<P>

Partisan and ideological disputes between Congress and the White House have allowed the LSC more than independence they made it unaccountable to anyone.  And this has allowed the interests that came to dominate it to take total and complete control . . . . A case in which the inhabitants were truly given control of the asylum.
<P>
There are no doubt good men and women working within the LSC framework who do see their mission as the members of Congress who voted to establish the program saw it.  I have no doubt that these men and women are out there serving the legitimate needs of individual clients.
<P>
We can applaud the work of these people while recognizing that the LSC has gone off the tracks in pursuing an additional mission that Congress has an obligation to halt.  The simple fact is that the LSC's major impact has not been in serving these clients, but in funding a network of activists dedicated not to helping clients function better within the framework of our society, but to changing that society.
<P>
The question is not whether the policy goals LSC grantees have sought are good or bad . . . or how much time they spend pursuing it, but whether Congress ought to be funding an effort to undermine the authority of the states and to influence public policy at all levels.
<P>
Private citizens have every right. . . indeed they may often have a moral obligation . . . to organize and work for policy changes that they hope will lead to the kind of society in which they want to live . . . and in which they want to raise their children and grandchildren.
<P>
But that is far, far different from saying that they have a right to tax money to finance such activities.
<P>
The funding of the LSC has amounted to little more that the channeling of tax money to men and women with an ideological, political agenda and allowed them to use that money to pursue that agenda.
<P>
Let's be clear.  Congress has no business funding such activities.
<P>
Senator Hollings said earlier this morning that the proper way to achieve such change is not through the course, but through the Congress . . . and he is dead right.
<P>
There is a legitimate question as to whether Congress should be funding even the provision of individual legal services . . . those services which the Ash Commission so correctly described as traditionally a function of the private sector.
<P>
The question of whether the private sector can accomplish this task will be debated in and out of Congress . . . and should be.
<P>
But that debate . . . however it is resolved . . . should not influence your vote on the continuation of the LSC.  As constituted with its network of grantees, contractors, alumni and friends the LSC cannot be reformed or limited to these arguably legitimate functions.
<P>
Instead, you must abolish it . . . reduce its funding to zero, send those who have perverted its original purpose and misused the tax money you have provided them packing . . . and start over.
<P>
If this Congress truly believes that tax monies should be used to provide legal assistance to those without  the funds needed to gain access to the civil justice system, you should design a system that will accomplish this goal, but don't think for a minute that the Legal Services Corporation can or will help you in the effort.
<P>
It's something you are going to have to do on your own.
<P>
Thank you.

<title>Affirmative Effort Op-Ed</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2>Affirmative Effort Op-Ed</h2>
<b>By Jack Kemp</b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>	
The scene is Washington D.C.:  a Republican President, new to the White House, defiantly throwing down the gauntlet to a Republican Congress, saying he will veto any bill that proposes to do more for "black Americans" than for "whites".
<p>
This is not some fast-forward vision of 1997, and the first days of a new Republican White House.  No, it's a flashback to 1866.  The agency to be vetoed was The Freedman's Bureau, established in President Lincoln's administration to "affirmatively" assist the recently emancipated African Americans.  The President -- Andrew Johnson, Mr. Lincoln's successor,  worried that any "affirmative action" would hurt the white population by specifically helping "negroes".
<p>
I offer this page out of history not to prove once again that, politically, there is not much new under the sun, but to illustrate that the issues of race and equality are woven into the very essence of our American experience.  While our present-day passions on the subject of affirmative action open old wounds -- they summon us to moral leadership of Lincolnesque proportions.
<p>
Thus far, the summons goes unanswered by both liberals and conservatives alike.  The unreconstructed liberal notion of endless racial reparations and race-based preferences is doubly guilty:  wrong in principle, and ruinous in practice.  President Clinton's much-vaunted affirmative action review produced more of a bumper sticker than a policy; Clinton's focus-group-fashioned "mend it, not end it" slogan makes a far better rhyme than reason.  The same, however, is true of the new affirmative action "abolitionists'" position which heralds equality but seldom addresses the way to truly give all people an equal footing.  Critics are right in asserting that "Affirmative Action" quotas have contributed to the poisoning of race relations in this country:  But critics must offer much more than just opposition and reproach.  We know what they are against, but what instead are they for?  
<p>
"A color-blind society," comes their response.  Of course, the goal of equal opportunity is paramount and a worthy destiny to seek -- but to say that we have arrived at that goal is simply not true.  My friends on the Right call for a color blind society and then quote Martin Luther King's inspirational "I have a dream" speech in which he imagined a nation in which every American would be judged not on the color of his or her skin, but on the "content of his character."  But all too often they totally neglect to quote the end of his speech when he describes the painful plight of minority America:  "The Negro," Dr. King said, "lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity."
<p>
Much has changed in the thirty years since King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  Minority enterprises have begun to gain a foothold, although there are far too few of them.  But can any one venture to the crumbling brick and mortar of Cabrini Green Public Housing, or the fear-ridden projects of Bed-Stuy or the streets lined with the unemployed in South Central L.A. or East St. Louis, and believe that what he sees there today would pass as progress since Dr. King's day?
<p>
This is not to negate the gains made by so many in the black and minority communities, but for large numbers the situation has not only not improved in thirty years, it has grown dramatically worse -- with a welfare system that entraps rather than empowers and punishes work and marriage and prevents access to capital, credit, and property.  Reality requires that we admit two things-- difficult admissions for both liberals and conservatives:  First, that a race conscious policy of quotas and rigid preferences has helped make matters worse.  But second, and more importantly, the Good Shepherd reminds all of us that our work is not done and as we think about moving into the twenty-first century, we must not leave anyone behind.
<p>
Sound policy begins with strong principles.  Affirmative action based on quotas is wrong  -- wrong because it is antithetical to the genius of the American idea:  individual liberty.  Counting by race in order to remedy past wrongs or rewarding special groups by taking from others perpetuates and even deepens the divisions between us, but race-based politics is even more wrong and must be repudiated by men and women of civility and compassion.  	
<p>
Instead, like the "radical Republicans" of Lincoln's day, who overrode President Johnson's veto on The Freedman's Bureau, we would honor the past by creating a future more in keeping with our revolutionary founding ideals of equality.  In this way, the eventual ending of affirmative action is only a beginning -- the political predicate of a new promise of outreach in the name of greater opportunity for access to capital, credit, prosperity, jobs, and educational choice for all.
<p>
The time has definitely come for a new approach, an "affirmative action" based not just on gender or race or ethnicity, but ultimately based on need.  "Affirmative", because government authority must be employed to remove the obstacles to upward mobility and human advancement.  "Action", because democratic societies must act positively and make real equality of opportunity -- without promising the equality of reward.
<p>
Affirming opportunity in America begins with education.  America's schools, particularly our urban public schools, are depriving minority and low-income children of the education that may be their passport out of poverty.  Even the poorest parent must have the option more affluent families enjoy:  the right to send their children to the school of their choice.  Affirmative effort means ending the educational monopoly that makes poor public school students into pawns of the educational bureaucracy.  And we should be paving the way to a voucher and magnet school system of public and private school choice.
<p>
Opportunity means an entryway into the job market.  That means removing barriers for job creation and entrepreneurship and expanding access to capital and credit.  According to the Wall Street Journal, from 1982 to 1987, the number of black owned firms increased by nearly 38%, about triple the overall business growth rate during that period.  Hispanic-owned businesses soared by 81%.  Women owned firms expanded by 57% and their sales nearly tripled.  Even so, of the 14 million small businesses in existence across the U.S. today, less than two percent are Black-owned.  And of 27 to 28 trillion dollars of capital in the U.S., less than one percent is in Black ownership.  Affirmative effort would take aim at expanding capital and credit as the life-blood of business formation and job creation -- including an aggressive effort to end the red-lining of our inner cities and a radical redesign of our tax code to remove barriers to broader ownership of capital, savings, and credit.
<p>
Opportunity means the ability to accumulate property.  Affirmative effort would mean an end to every federal program that penalizes the poor for  managing to save and accumulate their own assets.  An AFDC mother's thrift and foresight in putting money away for a child's future should not be penalized by the government welfare system as fraud -- as is currently the case.
<p>
Finally, real opportunity for racial and ethnic reconciliation requires an expanding economy -- one that invites the effort and enterprise of all Americans, including minorities and women.  A real pro-growth policy must include policies ranging from enterprise zones in our cities to a commitment to lowering barriers to global trade.  It should also offer relief from red tape, regulation and freedom from punitive tax policies.  Each is part of an affirmative action that can "move America forward without leaving anyone behind."
<p>
Now that we have opened a somewhat hysterical dialogue on affirmative action, we can never go back --  we can only go forward.  Our challenge is to put aside the past -- abandon the endless round of recrimination and a politics that feeds on division, exclusion, anger and envy -- and reaffirm, like Lincoln at his moment of maximum crisis, a vision of the "better angels of our nature", a big-hearted view of the nation we were always meant to become and must be if we are to enter the 21st century as the model of liberal democracy and market-oriented capitalism the world needs to see.

<h2>REFORMING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN EMPLOYMENT: <br>
HOW TO RESTORE THE LAW OF EQUAL TREATMENT</h2>
<h3>By Nelson Lund</h3><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief No. 17<br>
August 2, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center>
<P>
Nelson Lund is Associate Professor of Law at the George Mason
University School of Law. From 1989 to 1992, Professor Lund served
as Associate Counsel to President George Bush. Before that, he
served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
and Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department
of Justice.
<P>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<P>
 In his recent speech on affirmative action programs, President
Clinton strongly reaffirmed the federal government's long-standing,
and thoroughly discredited, approach to this subject. That approach
is easy to sum up: Proclaim a fervid opposition to discrimination,
but practice a policy of discriminatory preferences and favoritism
for selected groups. The euphemisms and Orwellian doublespeak
by now are quite familiar:
<P>
President Clinton's embrace of the discriminatory status quo puts
the burden on Congress to initiate meaningful reform. Such reform
must address three principal areas in which the federal government
practices or fosters discriminatory preferences: contract set-asides,
education, and employment. Congress in all likelihood will consider
the following three options.
<P>
<B>OPTION 1: Put the federal government's own house in order.</B>
This approach, which has been embraced by Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole (R-KS) and Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), would
dismantle the notorious system of minority and sex-based quotas
for federal contracts and forbid the federal government from discriminating
in hiring and promotions. Federal contract set-asides increase
the cost of government procurement by preventing agencies from
accepting the low bids on many contracts, and they discriminate
against low-bidding firms that are owned by people of the wrong
color or sex. Abolishing this practice would be a significant
step in the right direction by establishing a level playing field
for the more than $161 billion in federal contracts awarded annually. (1) 
Abolishing discriminatory practices in federal hiring and promotions,
moreover, would substitute individual merit for group status and
give equal legal rights to more than 2.8 million federal employees.

<P>
  The limits of this approach, however, are evident from Chart
1, which shows that the federal government employs only 3.1 percent
of the workers now protected by the principal anti-discrimination
statute. Federal contractors, moreover, would still be allowed
to use discriminatory preferences, and Labor Department bureaucrats
could still bring pressure for "better numbers," so
long as they avoided the imposition of formal goals and timetables.
And discriminatory preferences in college admissions would be
virtually untouched. 
<P>
<B> OPTION 2: Outlaw discriminatory preferences imposed not only
by the federal government, but also by federal contractors and
subcontractors, and by state and local level governments and other
recipients of federal grants.</B> Although this is not a complete
solution, it would extend the principle of equal treatment to
an additional 26.5 million employees of firms that do business
with the federal government and the approximately 16 million Americans
who work for state and local governments. (2) And it would cover practically
all colleges and universities. This approach adopts the well-accepted
principle that the federal government should neither engage in
discrimination nor finance discriminatory conduct by others. That
principle has been applied for many years to protect women and
certain minorities from discrimination by those who do business
with the federal government or who accept federal financial assistance.
<P>
 But, again, this approach leaves something to be desired. Under
this approach, it would still be legal to discriminate against
half of those Americans currently covered by the federal civil
rights law.
<P>
<B> OPTION 3: Require equal treatment for 100 percent of the population
that is now covered by federal civil rights law.</B> The most
complete solution is also the simplest. The Civil Rights Act of
1964 clearly forbade employment discrimination against either
sex and against any racial or ethnic group. Although federal agencies
and the courts have refused to implement Congress's straightforward
mandate, the Congress can now insist that its original intent
be honored. This would extend the principle of equal treatment
to the more than 94 million American employees now covered by
the 1964 Act. Similarly, racial discrimination by federal grantees
 -- which includes almost all colleges and universities  --  has
been formally forbidden for thirty years. Congress need only insist
that this law be enforced as written.
<P>
 This study explains in some detail why Congress should opt for
a comprehensive approach to the problem of discriminatory preferences
in employment. After exploring the illegitimate origins of the
current system, it discusses the nature of the current problem
and explains why partial solutions are unsatisfactory. It also
unmasks the myths behind "voluntary" affirmative action
and the "disparate impact" theory of discrimination.
Finally, it offers an outline of the legislation Congress ought
to consider if it wants to restore the ideal of equal treatment
under the law. 
<P>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<P>
 The Congress of the United States has never sanctioned the discriminatory
conduct that now occurs routinely in the American workplace under
the rubric of "affirmative action." To the contrary,
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination
in employment against any individual "because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Senator
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-MN), who was the Democratic floor manager
for the 1964 Act, assured the Senate that "nothing in the
bill would permit any official or court to require any employer
or labor union to give preferential treatment to any minority
group." (3) Even more dramatically, Humphrey challenged one skeptical
colleague by saying:
<P>
<blockquote> If the Senator can find in title VII... any language which provides
that an employer will have to hire on the basis of percentage
or quota related to color... I will start eating the pages one
after another, because it is not in there. (4)</blockquote>
<P>
 Technically, Senator Humphrey was right. But federal judges and
bureaucrats soon proved him wrong by using Title VII to create
the elaborate system of quotas and preferences that we see all
around us today. This transformation was accomplished through
a series of Orwellian distortions of the law, none of which has
ever been ratified by Congress.
<P>
 Congress can solve all the important problems arising from affirmative
action in the workplace by emphatically reaffirming the law it
enacted in 1964. This would have the effect of repealing the complicated
system of racial and sex-based preferences that have proliferated
thanks to rogue judges and regulators. Congress must understand
that these problems cannot be solved simply by getting the federal
government itself out of the business of discrimination. The most
serious effects of the federal government's twisted interpretation
of Title VII are occurring in the private sector and in state
and local government. Unless Congress addresses those effects,
any claim of leadership will ring hollow indeed.
<P>
<h4>UNDERSTANDING AFFIRMATIVE DISCRIMINATION</h4>
<P>
 Group-based employment preferences are incompatible with the
ideal of equal opportunity that every federal employment statute
has claimed to advance. They are also incompatible with the views
of the overwhelming majority of Americans. (5) For the same reasons
that Congress has quietly accepted the insidious spread of such
preferences, however, it will be reluctant to abolish them. Powerful
special interests, ranging from civil rights lobbyists and labor
unions to significant elements of the business world, will ferociously
defend the discriminatory status quo. Legislators who make their
stand on the principles articulated by Hubert Humphrey and Martin
Luther King, Jr., will be accused of racism, insensitivity, and
political expediency. As a consequence, true expediency may tempt
them to soften the rougher edges in the current system through
cosmetic reforms and empty symbolism, leaving the underlying problem
unresolved.
<P>
 One common perception about affirmative action is that it began
as a benign effort to combat discrimination and has evolved gradually
into the current system of quotas and preferences. Affirmative
action, according to this view, simply requires employers to "cast
a wider net" so that members of historically neglected groups
can enjoy the opportunity to compete on an equal footing for jobs
and promotions. While there is some truth in this view, there
also are indications that it was no accident that "affirmative
action" became a device for smuggling legalized preferences
into the fabric of American life.
<P>
 In September 1965, for example, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued
an executive order requiring federal contractors to agree that
they would take "affirmative action to ensure that applicants
are employed, and that employees are treated during employment,
without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin." (6) 
This sounds perfectly innocuous. Only a few months earlier, however,
Johnson had said that "equality of opportunity is essential,
but not enough." What was really required, according to Johnson,
was a transition to "the next and the more profound stage
of the battle for civil rights.... We seek not just legal equity
but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but
equality as a fact <I>and equality as a result.</I>" (7) 
<P>
 Whatever the original vision of affirmative action may have been,
it soon became a tool for imposing equality of results rather
than equality of opportunity. While federal law on its face forbids
discrimination against members of any racial group or either sex,
this apparently simple principle has been obscured and twisted
by a complex web of lies, censorship, doublespeak, and code words.
Those whom the law now disfavors can be denied a job or promotion
because of their skin color or their sex without being victims
of "discrimination" in its new legal meaning. This miracle
is accomplished by calling the denial either (a) affirmative action
taken to <I>prevent</I> discrimination; (b) an unfortunate side
effect of an attempt to cure "historic injustices";
(c) a prerequisite to achieving "diversity in the workplace";
or (d) the result of a presumption of "social disadvantage"
for everyone in the preferred racial group. 
<P>
  The dizzying and ever-changing array of intellectual rationales
for discrimination has been accompanied by an elaborate code of
misleading language. Quotas become "measurable goals and
specific timetables." When a job applicant is rejected because
of race, it was not really because of his race: it was just that
the favored person had <I>his</I> race counted as a "plus
factor." Or discrimination isn't really bad unless it is
also "stigmatizing" (an effect that apparently can be
experienced only by certain legally favored groups). All of this
evasive rhetoric has arisen because the underlying practices are
so difficult to defend. And because of that difficulty, they are
rarely defended. Instead, they often are just carried out covertly.
But the discriminatory nature of affirmative action cannot be
concealed entirely. 
<P>
 Example: A 1989 poll of <I>Fortune</I> 500 executives indicated
that only 14 percent of these firms even claimed to eschew discriminatory
preferences in favor of merit-based hiring decisions. A majority
of the firms claimed to employ "affirmative action goals,"
and a full 18 percent acknowledged that they have adopted specific
quotas. (8)
<P>
Example: In 1990, Max Frankel, who was then executive editor of
<I>The New York Times</I>, acknowledged that the standard of excellence
that his organization applied to employees depended upon the individual's
skin color:
<P>
 <blockquote>We've reached a critical mass with women. I know that when a
woman screws up it is not a political act for me to go fire them.
I cannot (easily) say that with some of our blacks. They're still
precious, they're still hothouse in management, and if they are
less than good, I would probably stay my hand at removing them
too quickly. It's still a political act and it would hurt the
organization in a larger sense, so you tolerate a little more
in the short term. (9)</blockquote>
<P>
 
<P>
Example: The state of California enacted a law setting a goal
that "by fiscal year 1992-93, 30 percent of all new hires
in the California Community Colleges as a system will be ethnic
minorities." (10)
<P>
Example: After the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer </I>was criticized
for an editorial advocating that poor black women be encouraged
to use the contraceptive Norplant, the paper's editor announced
a quota of 50 percent minorities and 50 percent women for all
newsroom hires during the succeeding five years. (11)
<P>
Example: The Xerox Corporation has adopted a kind of "hidden
hand" alternative to quotas: Annual bonuses are based in
part on a manager's success in promoting blacks and women. (12)
<P>
Example: The Washington Bureau chief of the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>
has announced that no white males will be hired "until we
[do] more for minorities and women." (13)
<P>
Example: Apparently seeking to increase the "diversity"
of its workforce by hiring more women, the U.S. Forest Service's
Pacific Southwest Region created "upward mobility positions"
limited to "applicants who do not meet the [Office of Personnel
Management] qualifications requirements." A Forest Service
spokesman defended its amazing search for <I>unqualified</I> workers
with the following revealing comment: "On its face, this
seems bizarre. However, the intent  if not the choice of language
 was appropriate to the circumstances.... " (14)
<P>
Example: On January 20, 1995, Oklahoma City decided to withdraw
from the U.S. Department of Justice's Police Hiring Supplement
Grant program, under which it had been authorized to hire 25 officers.
Police Chief Sam Gonzales objected to a Justice Department letter
that demanded an "underutilization analysis" for women
and minorities and an affirmative action plan including specific
steps to achieve "goals" for correcting the underutilization
that the Justice Department <I>assumed must exist</I>. Justice
Department officials also demanded that the city develop a specific
plan for the "equal employment of women and minorities within
the Police Department's sworn personnel." Chief Gonzales
commented: "I believe this particular language to be very
significant in that it states `equal employment' of women and
minorities rather than `equal employment opportunity.'" (15)
<P>
<h4>B>THE ILLEGITIMATE SOURCES OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
 The main goal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to dismantle
the Jim Crow system, under which black Americans were pervasively,
overtly, and legally discriminated against in substantial portions
of the nation. The prohibition against employment discrimination
in Title VII of that statute was meant to enhance the economic
well-being of this oppressed minority by requiring employers to
give blacks the same opportunities available to whites. That goal
was achieved: Jim Crow was destroyed, and economic progress among
southern blacks increased dramatically during the decade following
the enactment of Title VII. (16)
<P>
 Although the motivating force for the Civil Rights Act was opposition
to the legalized oppression of Jim Crow, Congress did not stop
there. Following a long American tradition, exemplified by the
Fourteenth Amendment itself, the legislature established universal
legal rights that apply everywhere in the country. Significantly,
Title VII contains no special provisions for blacks, and no special
provisions for the South. The concept of "protected groups"
is alien to the fundamental principles of Title VII, which establishes
individual rights belonging to every employee and applicant for
employment. (17)
<P>
 Although it rested on universal principles, Title VII originally
included exemptions for certain entities, most notably small employers
and government agencies. The original statute also provided exceptions
for certain kinds of traditional practices, such as treating men
and women differently where sex is a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation"
of a business. (18) Subsequent acts of Congress expanded the reach
of the statute to cover state and federal agencies (19), as well as
some small employers exempted in the original Act and certain
forms of unintentional discrimination. The law has also been amended
to increase the powers of the principal enforcement agency (the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) and to enlarge the monetary
relief that victims can recover from defendants.
<P>
 Not once, however, has Congress created any "affirmative
action" exception to Title VII's prohibition against discrimination. (20)
The exceptions that have arisen are entirely the product of executive
and judicial action.
<P>
<h4>QUOTAS BY EXECUTIVE ORDER</h4>
<P>
Pursuant to executive orders issued by Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, the Department of Labor undertook the most important
early initiatives promoting illegitimate forms of affirmative
action. These initiatives were not dictated by the executive orders
themselves, which required only that federal contractors "take
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and
that employees are treated during employment, without regard to
their race, creed, color, or national origin." (21) In light of
the long-standing patterns of racial discrimination that existed
at the time, especially in the South and in certain unionized
industries, this language implied no more than that firms wishing
to do business with the federal government should resist the strong
inertial forces supporting those odious practices. But this unexceptionable
goal was soon left behind.
<P>
 Early in the Nixon Administration, the Labor Department quietly
promulgated an order requiring that "the rate of minority
applicants recruited should approximate or equal the ratio of
minorities to the applicant population in each location." (22) 
After an outcry against this proportional representation scheme,
the order was replaced with a more subtly worded set of rules
that nonetheless had the effect of requiring racial quotas and
preferences. Under the current version of these rules, federal
contractors must establish numerical "goals and timetables"
(one of many popular euphemisms for quotas) whenever minorities
are "underutilized" according to arbitrary standards
that do not measure actual discrimination. (23) Enforced by the Office
of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the Labor Department,
these rules give OFCCP the power to issue debarment orders forbidding
federal agencies from doing business with firms that show insufficient
zeal in meeting their quotas. Needless to say, the threat of debarment
has powerful <I>in terrorem</I> effects.
<P>
<h4>JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION OF QUOTAS</h4>
<P>
Had the federal courts enforced the plain meaning and intent of
Title VII, the arbitrary quota policies promoted by the Nixon
Administration and its successors might have withered on the vine.
In <I>United Steelworkers v. Weber</I> (24), however, the Supreme Court
held that racial quotas are permissible under Title VII. The case
arose when Kaiser Aluminum and the United Steelworkers adopted
a collective bargaining agreement establishing a training program
that would qualify unskilled Kaiser workers for jobs in various
skilled trades. Eligibility for the program was determined by
seniority, but Kaiser succumbed to pressure from the Labor Department
and imposed a 50 percent quota for black applicants. (25) While acknowledging
in his majority opinion that the language of Title VII's prohibition
against discrimination "because of race" plainly forbade
this affirmative action program, Justice Brennan nevertheless
pretended that Congress intended something other than what the
statute says. He was unable, however, to find a single shred of
evidence to support this position. Justice Rehnquist's dissenting
opinion, by way of contrast, assembled a massive array of evidence
conclusively refuting Brennan's audacious misinterpretation.
<P>
 In <I>Johnson v. Transportation Agency</I> (26), the Supreme Court
affirmed and expanded the affirmative action exception to Title
VII. Employers in both the public and the private sectors now
face pressure to grant discriminatory preferences when there is
a "manifest imbalance" of minorities or women in "traditionally
segregated job categories." Despite what one might think
from reading this language, however, affirmative action is not
limited to rectifying segregationist practices by discriminatory
employers. Rather, discrimination is legitimized whenever women
or minorities are "underrepresented" in some job. The
standards for determining "underrepresentation" are
extremely loose, and have been met even when it has been caused
by some vague and unspecified form of "societal discrimination." (27)
<P>
 With perfect circular reasoning, "discrimination" is
presumed to exist when "underrepresentation" in particular
jobs is found.
<P>
<h4>INNOCENT VICTIMS OF QUOTA POLICIES</h4>
<P>
The Supreme Court has also stated that legitimate affirmative
action plans must not "unnecessarily trammel the interests
of the [disfavored] employees." (28) Here again, however, the
Court permits employers to impose explicit racial quotas even
when those quotas offer no relief to victims of proven discrimination. (29)
<P>
 Quotas and preferences, moreover, are legal even when they deny
employment opportunities to individuals who have never benefited
from an employer's prior discrimination.
<P>
 The <I>Weber</I> decision is once again illustrative. The white
plaintiff in that case, an unskilled laborer, had never belonged
to one of the unions whose racist policies had presumably excluded
blacks from the skilled trades. Yet the Court upheld a discriminatory
quota that deprived this plaintiff of an opportunity that would
have been open to him but for the color of his skin. While in
theory there are limits to how far employers can go in trammeling
the interests of people in disfavored groups, (30) in practice, the
Supreme Court has never held that an affirmative action plan violates
Title VII. In fact, the Court has created a legal rule that presumes
the validity of discriminatory affirmative action plans, thus
requiring victims to assume the heavy burden of <I>disproving</I>
the validity of such plans. (31)
<P>
 With the law stacked so heavily against them, victims of affirmative
action policies seldom seek legal redress. The reported decisions
therefore do not present anything like a true picture of the underlying
problem. It is completely absurd to argue, as one Clinton Administration
consultant has contended, that the paucity of reported judicial
decisions means that "the problem of 'reverse discrimination'
is not widespread; and that where it exists, the courts have given
relief." (32) One might as well argue that the paucity of litigation
about employment discrimination in the 1950s meant that discrimination
against blacks was a rarity. (33)
<P>
 Although reported cases are not especially numerous, a few examples
offer some insight into the sort of policies that courts find
acceptable.
<P>
Example: A county agency, which had never discriminated against
women, adopted an affirmative action plan with a "goal"
of 36.4 percent women (corresponding to the proportion of women
in the county's workforce) on highway maintenance crews. Despite
the utterly obvious fact that women are less likely than men to
seek jobs involving heavy physical labor, the Supreme Court labeled
this a "traditionally segregated job category." The
Court approved the county's decision to deny a promotion to a
male applicant in favor of a less qualified woman. (34)
<P>
Example: After receiving the highest score on a competitive examination,
a white firefighter was denied a promotion to engineer in favor
of a black firefighter with a lower score. Without discussing
the percentage of blacks in the fire department or in the engineer
position, and without making any comparisons with the available
labor force, the federal courts discovered a "manifest imbalance"
in a traditionally segregated job category. In upholding the fire
department's racial discrimination, the appellate court commented,
in words that could have been applied as easily to Jim Crow itself,
that the affirmative action plan "minimizes the disruption
of employees' expectations by providing clear guidelines for when
race may be taken into account." (35)
<P>
Example: In approving a plan to increase the number of women in
a university sociology department by discriminating against male
applicants, a federal court held, apparently with a straight face,
that "[w]hen approximately fifty percent of the nation's
population is women and only thirty-four percent of the recipients
of Ph.D.'s in sociology are women, sociology must be considered
to be a traditionally segregated field." (36)
<P>
Example: A county school board approved a policy involving race-based
involuntary transfers of teachers among schools. The courts acknowledged
that the challenged policy "does classify and burden individual
teachers on the basis of race." Although the policy had been
adopted in connection with a desegregation case, there were no
vestiges of discrimination in faculty assignments. The courts
nonetheless upheld the discriminatory policy "because the
goal of providing to schoolchildren a racially diverse learning
environment is clearly a legitimate one under Title VII." (37)
<P>
Example: A court approved a university's decision to raise the
salaries of women faculty members by amounts ranging from 1 percent
to 40 percent. The school's decision was based on a statistical
study showing that women were paid less than "comparable"
men. The comparability study, however, took no account of variables
such as "research productivity and quality, teaching quality
and load, publication quantity and community service" because
such variables generally "are not available and/or not suitable
for statistical analysis compared to the relatively straightforward
coding of other factors such as rank or tenure status." Thus,
nondiscriminatory factors that could obviously create salary disparities
were ignored because the court did not have any numbers handy
with which to measure them. (38)
<P>
<h4>THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION</h4></B>
<P>
 Any honest discussion about the prevalence of employment discrimination
must begin with two propositions. First, no one knows or can know
how much discrimination against any group actually occurs. Second,
no law can eliminate such discrimination completely.
<P>
 There simply have been no reliable studies measuring either how
much discrimination American employers actually engage in or against
whom they discriminate the most. We can be sure of one thing,
however: discrimination against virtually all groups does occur,
and will continue to occur. If the laws against murder, a crime
that is easily detected and severely punished, have never come
close to eliminating it, (39) our anti-discrimination laws will not
eliminate discrimination. Thus, the claim that discriminatory
affirmative action policies must be maintained until we achieve
a "color-blind" society is simply a ruse that will guarantee
eternal life to those policies.
<P>
 Although anti-discrimination laws will never produce a color-blind
society, policymakers can certainly craft a color-blind law. That
is exactly what Congress set out to do when it passed the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and the legislature was perfectly correct
in expecting that law to reduce the incidence of discrimination.
To the extent that Title VII raises the cost of discriminating
against those protected by the statute, it is simply inevitable
that less discrimination will occur. (40 It emphatically does not
follow, however, that the goal of reducing discrimination against
groups that have historically been the victims of prejudice requires
the use of preferences in their favor.
<P>
 The upside-down notion of using discrimination against some groups
to combat discrimination against other groups begins with the
false premise that any statistical "imbalance" in the
workforce must be the result of discrimination against the underrepresented
group. This premise is not only false; it is preposterous. (41) No
society has ever existed in which human beings sort themselves
into jobs and occupations according to the mathematical laws of
chance:
<P>
<blockquote> The even distribution or proportional representation of groups
in occupations or institutions remains an intellectual construct
defied by reality in society after society. Nor can all this be
attributed to exclusions or discrimination, for often some powerless
or persecuted minorities predominate in prosperous occupations. (42)</blockquote>
<P>
 Attributing every "imbalance" to employer discrimination
assumes away the manifest effects of differences in educational
achievement, family upbringing and cultural traditions, marital
patterns, and even the physical differences between the sexes.
When one begins indulging assumptions like that, one has left
reason behind and entered the realm of mysticism.
<P>
 What discriminatory affirmative action policies certainly can
do is increase the number of minorities and women holding desirable
jobs. That is the basis of their political appeal, just as the
artificial allocation of desirable jobs to whites was a critical
contributor to the political durability of the Jim Crow system.
Reserving certain jobs for certain groups, or giving preferences
to members of those groups, obviously serves the narrow self-interest
of those who enjoy the preferences. These beneficiaries inevitably,
and ironically, are drawn from the most elite and <I>least</I>
disadvantaged segments of the preferred groups. As one shrewd
observer has pointed out, "race-based set-asides have amounted
to no more than a cruel bait-and-switch game in which conditions
of poor Blacks were used to garner preferences that ultimately
benefited upper-income Blacks and White corporations." (43) In
effect, the current preference system creates a labor cartel,
allowing the legally privileged groups to command above-market
wages or (what amounts to the same thing economically) to depress
the demand for their competitors' services. This is wonderful
for the cartel's members, but everyone else pays the price.
<P>
 Apart from the economic inefficiencies imposed on society in
general, the costs of affirmative action are borne largely by
two groups:
<P>
<B> Whites, Men, and Other Unfashionable Groups.</B> The most
obvious victims of legalized discrimination are those individuals,
"predominantly unknown, unaffluent, unorganized," (44) who
are excluded by preferential policies from positions they otherwise
would have obtained. These victims of affirmative action are neither
the CEOs of major corporations nor their highly paid Washington
lobbyists. Nor are they neurotics who deserve to be subjected
to President Clinton's condescending pop psychology. (45) On the contrary,
they are mainly ordinary working people who suffer the same losses
experienced by other victims of discrimination. They are easy
to ignore or make fun of inside the Beltway, but that says more
about the climate in Washington than it does about those who must
live with the decisions that are made there.
<P>
<B> Minority Victims.</B> A less obvious group of victims comprises
those minority individuals and women who would have succeeded
without preferential policies, but whose achievements become clouded
by the suspicion and resentment of others. The fact that resentment
against these individuals is actually unjustified will not prevent
it from occurring. (46)
<P>
<h4>THE OPPOSITION TO REFORM</h4>
<P>
 Perhaps the best evidence that discriminatory preferences are
a serious and widespread phenomenon is the ferocity of the opposition
to abolishing them. (47) For every beneficiary, there is a corresponding
victim. Thus, if the beneficiaries of this discrimination believe
they stand to lose a great deal if it ends, that suggests that
reform of the status quo is an urgent matter. (48) Accordingly, it
is imperative that Congress enact the simple reforms that are
needed to remove the stamp of legal approval from the discrimination
that the law now promotes. But that will not be easy. Besides
the direct beneficiaries of quotas and preferences (including
those who are paid to administer or advocate preferential policies),
politically significant business interests have incentives to
preserve the current legal regime.
<P>
 First, inefficient quota requirements -- whether imposed directly
or indirectly 
<P>
 -- confer advantages on large, established business enterprises
vis-&agrave;-vis their smaller competitors. This effect, which
is a matter of simple economics, is especially powerful when the
regulatory regime involves massive paperwork and reporting requirements
like those imposed by the EEOC and OFCCP.
<P>
 Second, after decades of government pressure to get their numbers
right, a great many large companies have institutionalized affirmative
action as a significant element in their corporate cultures. These
firms thus have large and powerful <I>internal</I> constituencies
for such programs. Those internal constituencies will fight to
protect their interests and will help shape the public posture
of the firm on issues that affect those interests.
<P>
 The incentives that exist for business interests to support the
status quo will not necessarily produce aggressive <I>public</I>
support for policies that favor discrimination. Indeed, business
leaders often adopt an anti-regulatory rhetorical posture even
when they are actively seeking anti-competitive government regulations.
With affirmative action, there are especially strong reasons to
avoid getting caught up directly in the public controversy: For
most big firms, almost any position they adopt on the public policy
question is bound to offend a significant portion of their employees
and customers. (49) But these considerations need not prevent business
interests from taking quiet and indirect steps to protect their
interests. The dubious arguments that support those interests
therefore need to be confronted.
<P>
<h4>THE MYTH OF "VOLUNTARY" AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
One of the most enduring myths about affirmative action is that
it reflects voluntary efforts by American employers to comply
with Title VII's spirit of equal opportunity. An especially dangerous
corollary of this myth is that Congress should merely forbid the
federal government from engaging directly in discrimination, leaving
the private sector to continue behaving as it has in the past.
In order to appreciate why both the myth and the corollary are
fallacious, a very rudimentary introduction to the economics of
discrimination will be helpful.
<P>
 There is a respectable, though hardly unimpeachable, economic
argument for repealing the legal constraints on discrimination
by private employers. (50) According to this argument, ordinary market
forces will minimize employer discrimination that is based on
such arbitrary factors as a personal distaste for members of certain
groups. The market, however, would still reward economically efficient
forms of discrimination. This can occur when race or sex is correlated
with desirable characteristics that are costly to identify directly.
Thus, for example, if very few women possess the physical strength
to perform a certain job, it may be cheaper for an employer to
exclude women from consideration than to administer strength tests
to all applicants. Such discrimination, according to the economic
argument, should be tolerated because the efficiencies it creates
benefit <I>all</I> groups over the long run, even if some individuals
are denied jobs for which they are the best qualified. (51)
<P>
 Business interests sometimes use variations on this economic
argument to defend discriminatory affirmative action programs.
They argue, for example, that a diverse workforce is an essential
business imperative because firms need to respond to a racially
and ethnically diverse consumer population. (52) When used to defend
discriminatory policies, these arguments rest on the assumption
that members of certain racial groups are more likely to understand
what consumers in their own group will find appealing, or on the
assumption that customers are more likely to patronize firms that
give a prominent role to employees of their own race. For example:
<P>
<blockquote> Given the national demography and the fact that much of our domestic
business is with city and state governments, walking in with an
all-white male team is a tie-breaker negative, said one chief
executive who was quoted anonymously in the [Glass Ceiling] report.
"If I go to Washington, I need black representatives to interact
with the people who can give me contracts." (53)</blockquote>
<P>
 Assuming that such assumptions are correct, they do not answer
the moral and political question: Should private firms be allowed
to enhance their efficiency by engaging in racial discrimination
or pandering to the racial preferences of their customers? And
even if one believes that private firms should be allowed to do
this for the sake of efficiency, the economic argument cannot
justify forbidding firms to discriminate against some groups but
not others. Efficiency is efficiency, whether it leads firms to
appeal to the preferences of black consumers or white consumers.
Thus, if the economic argument justifies allowing firms to engage
in discriminatory affirmative action, it must also justify allowing
firms to resume old-fashioned patterns of discrimination <I>against</I>
women and minorities.
<P>
 For moral and political reasons, Congress is not likely to give
serious consideration to "deregulating" the market by
repealing Title VII. Some in Congress, however, may be tempted
to believe that leaving private-sector affirmative action programs
alone is an economically benign form of "partial deregulation."
This temptation must be resisted, for the theory on which it rests
is entirely false.
<P>
<h4>INADEQUACY OF LIMITING REFORM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</B>
</h4>
Some opponents of racial preferences support a legislative strategy
that focuses primarily on the most notorious forms of direct discrimination
by the federal government, such as contract set-asides. There
certainly are plenty of deserving candidates for extinction among
these programs. Most of them, however, should be doomed in any
event by the Supreme Court's recent decision in <I>Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pe&ntilde;a</I> (54), which held that racial classifications
by the federal government are unconstitutional unless they are
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. Congress
can and should prevent the Clinton Administration from wasting
society's resources by engaging in protracted litigation in defense
of programs that are legally dubious and morally wrong. But genuine
leadership requires more than staying half a step ahead of the
courts. In any case, this alone would barely touch the most significant
problems that federal law has created. To suppose that the federal
government can get its own house in order merely by ceasing to
practice direct discrimination ignores the pervasive effects that
its laws have on the rest of society.
<P>
 First, even from a strictly economic or libertarian perspective,
reforms that are limited to the federal government would be grossly
inadequate. Such reforms would allow discrimination to continue
in important economic sectors that are not subject to the full
discipline of market forces. This includes state and local governments,
as well as firms that are otherwise insulated from competitive
forces, such as those in the nonprofit sector and in some heavily
regulated industries. No "reform" that leaves these
institutions free to discriminate can be defended on the basis
of free-market principles.
<P>
 Second, the federal government does not merely permit private
firms to engage in discriminatory affirmative action. On the contrary,
it actively <I>pressures</I> them to discriminate through compliance
reviews of federal contractors by the Labor Department and through
the litigation policies of the EEOC. Just as the supposedly "voluntary"
racial quotas at issue in <I>Weber</I> actually were adopted in
the face of Labor Department pressure, much of the current culture
of affirmative action has developed in an effort to satisfy the
demand of federal bureaucrats for the "right numbers."
<P>
 Third, and perhaps most important, the current legal doctrines
on affirmative action <I>inherently</I> promote discrimination
by private firms because of the asymmetrical treatment of different
groups. Even if federal agencies were to get completely out of
the business of promoting discrimination, the law itself would
continue to promote discrimination through the incentives it creates
for private employers. Consider the choice confronting an employer
who has two candidates, one minority and one white, for a promotion
to a managerial position. If both candidates possess the minimal
qualifications for the position, the employer faces a substantial
risk of litigation if the white is promoted, even if the white
candidate has better qualifications. If the employer denies the
promotion to the better-qualified white candidate under an affirmative
action plan, however, the risk of liability is near zero. Faced
with these asymmetrical incentives, rational employers inevitably
and systematically will discriminate against legally disfavored
groups, especially whites and men. Allowing this to continue is
not a benign form of "partial deregulation," but a powerful
engine of government-sponsored favoritism. Until these incentives
are removed, market forces will continue to <I>foster</I> discrimination
rather than discourage it.
<P>
<h4>THE EXAGGERATED THREAT OF DISPARATE IMPACT LITIGATION</h4>
<P>
Because the economic, or "free market," rationale for
allowing minority preferences is untenable, business lobbyists
may claim that they must engage in this form of discrimination
in order to protect themselves from litigation based on statistical
underrepresentation. This argument has some merit in theory, but
its practical significance can easily be overstated. To the extent
that the argument is valid, moreover, it suggests the need for
reform of the rules governing statistics-based litigation, <I>not</I>
for the preservation of rules permitting employers to engage in
discriminatory affirmative action. To understand why the threat
of litigation over "bad numbers" is less than pressing,
though still worth solving, a brief discussion of the law's evolution
is required.
<P>
 In a 1971 decision, <I>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</I> (55), the Supreme
Court accepted the Nixon Administration's contention that employment
criteria that lead to "underrepresentation" of minorities
in a company's workforce can be unlawful even if the employer
has not intentionally discriminated against anyone. This theory,
which goes by the name of "disparate impact analysis,"
had no basis in the law and in fact was incompatible with the
statute. Chief Justice Burger's opinion flouted the text of Title
VII, distorted and misrepresented the legislative history, and
even went so far as to misstate the factual findings of the district
court in the <I>Griggs</I> case itself. (56) Apart from being a legislative
rather than a judicial exercise, the legislative draftsmanship
in the <I>Griggs</I> opinion was utterly incompetent. Burger declared
that statistical disparities could lead to liability, but he offered
no intelligible test either for deciding what statistical comparisons
should be used or for deciding how large the disparities must
be.
<P>
 Burger's opinion also created a legal defense that employers
could use to justify disparities that otherwise would produce
liability, but he offered no fewer than eight different and conflicting
formulations of the standard that such employment criteria must
meet. The hopeless ambiguities and vagueness of <I>Griggs</I>,
and the impossibility of seeking guidance from the statute that
<I>Griggs</I> had recklessly amended, set the Court on a long
and difficult search for a manageable set of legal standards.
During the early years of this process, many lower courts made
it relatively easy for plaintiffs to establish a statistical case
against an employer, and employers often were held to absurdly
high standards of "business necessity" in defending
employment criteria that failed to generate "enough"
minorities and women in certain jobs.
<P>
 Employers that used race-neutral hiring criteria (as Kaiser Aluminum
had been doing before the Labor Department pressured it to adopt
the racial quota that was challenged in <I>Weber</I>) thereby
exposed themselves to liability if such criteria had a disparate
impact on minorities. Unless employers were allowed to get their
numbers "right" by discriminating against whites, they
would be placed in a Catch-22: vulnerable to Labor Department
sanctions and/or lawsuits by minorities if race-neutral criteria
led to disparate effects and liable to whites if they sought to
avoid such suits by instituting preferential policies. By permitting
employers to engage in preferential treatment of minorities, the
Court offered them a comparatively cheap way of escaping this
Catch-22.
<P>
 Employers will oppose any legal regime that forces them to make
decisions that expose them to liability no matter what they do.
They can hardly be blamed for this, and the law certainly should
not create Catch-22s for anyone. In 1989,however, the Supreme
Court articulated standards of proof for disparate impact cases
that were much more favorable to employers than the rules that
had taken root in the lower courts. (57) Under these standards, plaintiffs
were required to show that the employer's conduct actually caused
substantial underrepresentation. The Court also concluded that
defendants could escape liability simply by producing evidence
that their employment criteria were based on legitimate business
reasons. This ruling greatly reduced the threat of disparate impact
liability for all but the most inexplicably arbitrary employment
practices, and thus greatly reduced the pressure on employers
to adopt preferential policies designed to produce statistically
balanced workforces.
<P>
 In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress codified the theory
of disparate impact, thus ratifying a previously illegitimate
doctrine. In doing so, however, the legislation preserved almost
all of the safeguards for employers that the Supreme Court had
established in its 1989 decision. More important, perhaps, the
1991 statute created a new remedial scheme authorizing compensatory
and punitive damages in cases involving intentional discrimination,
but <I>not</I> in cases arising under the disparate impact theory. (58) 
This new rule creates tremendously powerful incentives for plaintiffs
and their attorneys to forego disparate impact litigation in favor
of claims based on the standard theory of intentional discrimination. (59)
<P>
 These incentives, together with the relatively circumscribed
disparate impact standards codified in the 1991 statute, have
caused the virtual disappearance of serious disparate impact litigation. (60) 
For that reason, business interests no longer can legitimately
maintain that the restoration of a color-blind legal rule will
create the Catch-22 described above.
<P>
 Business lobbyists nonetheless might argue that courts and enforcement
agencies may revive disparate impact litigation at some future
time. This possibility cannot be ruled out completely. The most
likely way for this to happen would involve an aggressive disparate
impact campaign by the EEOC and the Justice Department, combined
with judicial misinterpretation of ambiguous language in the 1991
statute. Because EEOC and Justice are public agencies, they are
less subject than the private plaintiffs' bar to the financial
disincentives that the 1991 Act created for disparate impact litigation.
And the courts, as we have seen so often in the past, are perfectly
capable of seizing on any real or imagined ambiguity in the civil
rights statutes when they want to expand the reach of those statutes
beyond what Congress has authorized.
<P>
 This possibility -- that federal agencies and the courts again
will cause disparate impact litigation to become a serious problem
-- does not seem likely to materialize in the foreseeable future.
The EEOC's workload has gone up dramatically in recent years,
largely because of an increase in intentional discrimination claims
under Title VII (especially claims involving sexual harassment)
and under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The agency's
budget, however, has not seen commensurate increases, and the
agency would therefore have difficulty in diverting significant
resources to disparate impact litigation. Similarly, while the
courts certainly have the power to interpret the 1991 statute
in a way that would greatly facilitate abuses of the disparate
impact theory, recent judicial trends do not suggest that this
is likely to happen.
<P>
<h4>RESTORE THE COLOR-BLIND LAW THAT CONGRESS ENACTED</B>
</h4>
Congress is not to blame for the misinterpretations to which Title
VII has been subjected. Writing in 1979, then-Justice Rehnquist
noted: 
<P>
 <blockquote>Were Congress to act today specifically to prohibit the type
of racial discrimination suffered by [the plaintiff in <I>Weber</I>],
it would be hard pressed to draft language better tailored to
the task than that found in [sections 703(a) and (d)] of Title VII.  (61)</blockquote>

<P>
 Rehnquist's comment remains equally valid today, and there is
little reason to tamper with the operative language of the statute.
Rather, what is needed is an amendment requiring the courts and
executive agencies to begin obeying the law that Congress framed
three decades ago.
<P>
 In fact, Congress foresaw in 1964 that its clear language might
be misconstrued and included in the statute a provision specifically
foreclosing any interpretation requiring the correction of statistical
imbalances in an employer's workforce. (62) Had the <I>Weber</I> majority
not been driven by an Orwellian contempt for the meaning of words, (63) 
this precautionary provision would have accomplished its purpose. (64)

<P>
 A more comprehensive and carefully drafted statement of congressional
insistence that Title VII means what it says, however, can now
accomplish what Congress sought to achieve in 1964. While there
can be no absolute assurance against the flouting of legislative
commands, the courts have become less reckless in recent years.
They are unlikely to defy Congress on this issue, and enactment
of legislation embodying the principles summarized below should
assure that the principle of equal opportunity finally is accepted
into the law.
<P>
<B>Legislative Solutions</B>
<P>
 The key provisions of such a legislative approach are as follows:
<P>
Ban quotas and preferences. Congress should forbid courts and
enforcement agencies from interpreting Title VII to authorize,
permit, or encourage the use of quotas or preferences relating
to race or sex. 
<P>
<B>Permit legitimate affirmative action.</B> Congress should state
that employers may adopt <I>legitimate</I> affirmative action
policies that promote equal opportunity without using or encouraging
the use of quotas or preferences. This proviso would allow employers
to ensure that minorities and women are not excluded from employment
opportunities by managers' prejudices, stereotypes, or inappropriate
recruiting habits. (65)
<P>
<B>End backdoor quotas.</B> Employers should be prohibited from
engaging in indirect forms of discrimination through euphemisms
like "diversity," "inclusiveness," or developing
a "multicultural workforce." The existing cast of bureaucrats
and corporate affirmative action officers also should be forbidden
from repackaging the same old surreptitious racial quotas under
some new rubric like "socially disadvantaged background." (66)
<P>
 The promoters of preferences repeatedly have shifted their language
and invented new excuses for continuing the discriminatory policies
of the past. In order to deprive them of the legalistic arguments
at which they have proven so adept, any legislation adopted by
Congress must contain airtight legislative language that closes
the door to the use of new euphemisms and new rationales for discrimination.

<P>
 This, in brief, is the appropriate way to restore the ideal of
equal treatment under the law to which Title VII originally was
dedicated. There is neither any need nor any justification for
compromises, incremental changes, or further temporizing.<p>

<li>703(e), 42 U.S.C.  2000e2(e).  This exception from the basic
prohibition against discrimination applies with respect to religion

concern with racial discrimination, the statute makes no provision
for treating race or color as a bona fide occupational qualification.

<li>Section 107(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 added a provision
to Title VII that, by its terms, would seem specifically to prohibit
typical forms of discriminatory affirmative action:  "Except
as otherwise provided in this title, an unlawful employment practice
is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor
for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated
the practice."  Civil Rights Act of 1991,  107(a), 42 U.S.C.
 2000e2(m).  Section 116 of the 1991 statute, however, also provided
that "[n]othing in the amendments made by this title shall
be construed to affect courtordered remedies, affirmative action,
or conciliation agreements, that are in accordance with the law."
 Civil Rights Act of 1991, 116, 42 U.S.C.  1981 note.  If affirmative
action policies that were permitted under pre1991 judicial precedents
are assumed to be "in accordance with the law" within
the meaning of Section 116, then Section 107(a) can be interpreted
to allow their continuation.  Because the legislative history
of the 1991 Act does not evince an intent to overrule those judicial
precedents, the Supreme Court is unlikely to hold that Section
107(a) outlawed previously permissible affirmative action policies.

the 1991 statute does not manifest congressional intent to codify
the judicial decisions that permit discriminatory affirmative
action.  For further detail, see Nelson Lund, "Lawyers and

<li>Federal regulations, for example, require that every "utilization
analysis" consider the minority population of the surrounding
labor area, the size of the minority unemployment force, and the
percentage of the minority workforce compared with the total workforce.
 In addition to such factors, which ignore qualifications entirely,
the regulations also require the consideration of factors that
do not take account of the relative qualifications among individuals,
such as the availability of "promotable and transferable
minorities" within the contractor's organization.  See 41
C.F.R.  602.11(b)(1).  Contractors must take "special corrective
action" when there is an "underutilization" of
minorities, or when other phenomena occur, as when a lower percentage
of minority than nonminority applicants meets the firm's employment
criteria, or minorities meet the firm's promotion criteria at
a lower rate than nonminorities.  <I>Id.</I>  602.23.  These phenomena,
obviously, are not necessarily caused by discrimination, and "special
corrective action" often will entail discrimination against

is magnified when pressure is exerted on larger firms to discriminate
in favor of minorities and women.  There is some empirical evidence
suggesting that exactly this has occurred.  See, <I>e.g.</I>,
Ferrell Bloch, "Affirmative Action Hasn't Helped Blacks,"
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, March 1, 1995, p.  A14:  "While
black unemployment rates have remained twice those of whites,
the proportion of blacks working for firms with 100 or more employees
(who must file annual EEO1 reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission), federal contractors (who are subject to Labor Department
affirmative action requirements), and local, state and federal
government has grown dramatically.  For example, in 1966, black
female managers were 40% less likely than white male managers
to work in firms with 100 or more employees.  But by 1980, black
female managers were 50% more likely than their white male counterparts
to work in these larger companies."

<li>See Thomas Sowell, <I>Civil Rights:  Rhetoric or Reality</I> (New
York:  William Morrow, 1984), p.  116:  "There is neither
evidence nor even the pretense of evidence for the proposition
that all groups are prepared to make the same sacrifices to achieve
the same ends, quite aside from any question of equal capability,
natural or acquired.  Yet without that assumption, there is no
reason to expect the even representation which is used as a norm
to measure discrimination."

<li>Robert L.  Woodson, Sr., "Affirmative Action Has Accomplished
Little for Most Blacks," <I>The Ethnic Newswatch</I>, May
31, 1995, p.  42.  Woodson also has pointed to statistics showing
that "the income gap between different tiers of black income
groups has been steadily growing since the enactment of the first
civil rights legislation.  Between 1970 and 1986, the percentage
of black families with incomes over $50,000 nearly doubled, while
the percentage of black families with incomes under $10,000 rose
from 26.8 to 30.2 of the population."  Robert L.  Woodson,

<li>See John F.  Harris, "Clinton Asks Support for Policy Review:
 Party Must Back Study Of Preferences, He Says," <I>The Washington
Post</I>, April 9, 1995, p.  A11:  "[Clinton] said affirmative
action supporters must understand that this is 'psychologically,
a difficult time for a lot of white males  the socalled angry
white male.'"

<li>A recent <I>USA Today</I>/CNN/Gallup Poll found that 19 percent
of black women and 28 percent of black men believe that their
colleagues "privately questioned your abilities or qualifications
because of affirmative action."  The same survey found that
32 percent of whites thought that "a racial minority where
you worked got an undeserved job or promotion as a result of affirmative
action programs."  "Affirmative Action:  The Public
Reaction," <I>USA Today</I>, March 24, 1995, p.  3A.

<li>The mere possibility of a voter initiative to curtail affirmative
action in California has generated threats of an economic boycott
against that state.  And those threats apparently are meant to
have a wider effect:  "This [boycott threat] is also directed
at two Washington players:  Congress and the White House,"
said one civil rights leader, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
 "Both have to be reminded that there is going to be a major
effort to bring political costs into this debate and balance the
scales of consideration.  Right now the debate is tilted in favor
of accommodating the political views of white males."  Steven
A.  Holmes, "Government Acts to Set its Policy on Race Programs,"
<I>The New York Times</I>, June 24, 1995, p.  1.  The Clinton
Administration obviously will not challenge the civil rights establishment.
 Unfortunately, the urge to temporize in the face of intimidating
tactics undoubtedly remains strong even among conservatives. 
One prominent Republican, for example, recently made the amazing
pronouncement that "we as a party need to work hard to earn
the right to deal with this issue and to deal with it in a sensitive
way."  See Nancy E.  Roman, "GOP Panel To Go Slow on
Affirmative Action:  Leaders Don't Want to Alienate Blacks,"
<I>The Washington Times</I>, June 7, 1995, p.  A12.  Because it
is obvious that no one has to "earn" the right to do
the right thing, statements like this inevitably give off an aroma
of cynical political calculation.

<li>On the other hand, if the beneficiaries (and thus the victims)
of preferential policies are actually the rare exception in the
American workplace, what harm could there be in restoring the
law of equal treatment?

<li><I>Cf., e.g.</I>, Judith H.  Dobrzynski, "Some Action, Little
Talk," <I>The New York Times</I>, April 20, 1995, p.  D1:
 "[W]hile many of the more than two dozen company and industry
association executives contacted spoke privately about affirmative
action, almost none would comment for the record."

<li>This argument is developed at length in Richard A.  Epstein, <I>Forbidden
Grounds:  The Case Against Employment Discrimination Laws</I>
(Cambridge, Mass.:  Harvard University Press, 1992).

<li>In addition, there are substantial costs involved in administering
and enforcing the antidiscrimination laws.  If those costs were
eliminated, some of the savings would be used to increase wages
and/or create more jobs.

<li>See, <I>e.g.</I>, Jonathan Kaufman, "Management:  How Workplaces
May Look Without Affirmative Action," <I>The Wall Street
Journal</I>, March 20, 1995, p.  B1:  "Eastman Kodak Co.
 maintains it is committed to diversity because the composition
of the American work force is changing and so is its customer
base. ' If affirmative action wasn't legislated, we'd still continue
with our goal of building a diverse work force,' says Patricia
Fleming, Kodak's director of affirmative action.  Kodak won't
specify how many women or blacks it has in top positions, but
it recently tied a portion of management compensation to recruitment
and promotion of minorities and women."

<li>Peter T.  Kilborn, "White Males and Management," <I>The
New York Times</I>, March 17, 1995, p.  A14.

Review</I> (forthcoming).

<li><I>Wards Cove Packing Co.  v.  Atonio</I>, 490 U.S.  642 (1989).

<li>In a disparate impact case, remedies are confined largely to injunctive
relief, limited back pay, and attorney's fees.  These limitations
applied to all Title VII cases prior to 1991.  The new statute
caps compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination
at different levels according to the size of the defendant.  For
the large firms that offer the most attractive targets for disparate
impact and class action lawsuits, the cap is set at $300,000 per
claim.

<li>For further detail, see Glen D.  Nager and Julia M.  Broas, "Enforcement
Issues:  A Practical Overview," <I>Louisiana Law Review</I>,
Vol.  54 (1994), pp.  1473, 14821483.

<li>I have been able to find only one reported case in which a private
firm was held liable under the disparate impact provisions of
the 1991 Act.  In <I>Bradley v.  Pizzaco of Nebraska, Inc.</I>,
7 F.3d 795 (8th Cir.  1993), the court forbade a pizza chain's
relatively trivial practice of requiring employees to be cleanshaven.
 This case almost certainly will not become an important precedent,
for the court's reasoning was extremely poor.  The Eight Circuit's
opinion, for example, did not even discuss the operative provision
of the statute, and it actually misquoted the provision on which
it purported to rely.  In <I>EEOC v.  Joint Apprenticeship Committee</I>,
828 F.  Supp.  264 (S.D.  N.Y.  1993), the court used a disparate
impact theory to invalidate a high school education  requirement
for admission into an apprenticeship program.  This case was tried
well before the 1991 Act came into effect, and its significance
is reduced by the fact that the defendant chose for tactical reasons
at trial only to challenge the government's <I>prima facie</I>
case without offering a "business justification" defense.

<I>Johnson</I>, 480 U.S.  at 657 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

<li>Section 703(j) provides:  "Nothing contained in [Title
VII] shall be interpreted to require any employer...  subject
to this [title] to grant preferential treatment to any individual
or to any group because of the race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance
which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage
of persons of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin
employed by any employer...  in comparison with the total number
or percentage of persons of such race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin in any community, State, section, or other area,
or in the available work force in any community, State, section,
or other area."  42 U.S.C.  2000e2(j).

<li>For a discussion comparing the <I>Weber</I> majority's behavior
to that of the nightmare government in Orwell's <I>1984</I>, see
Justice Rehnquist's <I>Weber</I> dissent.  443 U.S.  at 219221.

<li>The <I>Weber</I> majority inferred from 703(j)'s ban on interpretations
<I>requiring</I> employers to grant preferential treatment that
Congress meant to allow interpretations <I>permitting</I> employers
to grant preferential treatment.  This negative inference is absurd.
 There are an infinite number of possible misinterpretations of
any statutory language, and 703(j) could not possibly list them
all.  The fact that it rules out one misinterpretation, therefore,
does not imply that it means to allow any others.  By contrast,
a valid negative inference can arise when a statute creates express
exceptions to an otherwise general rule.  Absent contrary evidence,
the creation of such express exceptions implies that similar exceptions
are not intended because it shows that the legislature considered
and rejected the need for exceptions other than the ones it expressly
included.  Title VII includes an express exception for preferential
policies, which is carefully limited to certain circumstances
involving Indians living on or near reservations.  See 703(i),
42 U.S.C.  2000e2(i).  This exception clearly implies that other
forms of preferential affirmative action are forbidden.

<li>The legislation should leave untouched the existing law regarding
employers' use of classifications based on sex, religion, or national
origin where such characteristics are a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of
that particular business or enterprise."  703(e), 42 U.S.C.
 2000e2(e).  This exception to Title VII's prohibition against
discrimination has been construed more narrowly than Congress
had reason to anticipate in 1964, but the issues raised by these
narrowing constructions are separate from the issues raised by
affirmative action.

<li>For concise critiques (from different points on the political
spectrum) of the notion of giving preferences to the "socially
disadvantaged," see James P.  Scanlan, "No Substitute
for The Real Thing," <I>Legal Times</I>, May 1, 1995, p.

Action for the Needy Won't Work," <I>The Washington Post</I>,

<h2>Lamar Alexander: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Lamar Alexander has been Governor, University President and U.S. Education
Secretary.<p>
In 1978 he literally walked 1,000 miles across Tennessee to become its
Governor.  At the request of the U.S. Attorney, he was sworn into office three
days early to prevent the incumbent Governor from granting clemency to prisoners
the FBI believed had paid cash for their release.<p>
During his two terms as Governor, Tennessee grew jobs at twice the national
average, went from last to third in the production of new automobiles, from 48th
to 36th in average family incomes, and enacted the nation's only state program to
pay teachers more for teaching well.  When he left office, the state had fewer
government employees, a smaller debt, and the nation's fifth lowest tax rate.<p>
He and his family then moved to Australia to live for a while and he wrote
his third book, Six Months Off, about that experience.  In 1987 he and his wife,
Honey, helped found a company, Corporate Child Care Services, that today has
1,200 employees.  In 1988 he became President of the University of Tennessee. 
And in 1991 the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him as President Bush's
Education Secretary.  During the summer of 1994, Alexander drove 8,800 miles
across the United States, staying with families in 38 states.  The book about
that drive, We Know What To Do, will be published this Fall.<p>
He is a country and classical pianist who has played on the Grand Ole Opry
and the Billy Graham Crusade.  He chaired the nation's governors, served as
co-director of Empower America, and founded the Republican Neighborhood Meeting. 
The Education Commission of the States and the National Collegiate Athletic
Association have given him their highest awards.  He lives in Nashville.  Lamar
and Honey have four children: Andrew, 25; Leslee, 22; Kathryn, 20; and William,
16.<p>

<TITLE>Albania</TITLE>
<H2>ALBANIA</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Located in southeastern Europe, the Balkan country of Albania gained its independence 
from the Ottoman Empire in 1912. Its struggle for independence, however, resulted in the  loss of 
about half its territory and 40 percent of its citizenry to neighboring Greece and Yugoslavia. During 
World War I, Albania became a battlefield in which much of the country was destroyed. Following 
the war, Albania was an independent state ruled by a monarchy. Although King Zog sought 
economic self-sufficiency, Albania became increasingly dependent on Italy. In 1939, Benito 
Mussolini occupied parts of Albania. The Albanian Communist Party was formed in 1941, and after 
World War II Albania became one of the world's most oppressive communist states. The 
communist regime was deposed in 1991, and current President Sali Berisha was elected in 1992.  
President Berisha is trying to implement an ambitious program of free market reforms. He has, 
however, encountered some political opposition, losing in November 1994 a referendum on his 
proposed constitution.
<P> <IMG SRC="alb.gif">
<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of protectionism)</I> <BR>
Most of Albania's tariffs range from 5 percent to 30 percent. Tariffs range from zero 
percent on heavy machinery used in agriculture, to 5 percent on mineral fuels, to 30 
percent on electronic equipment, to 20 percent on precision equipment, like oscilloscopes. 
Thus,  Albania's average tariff rate is probably between 15 percent and 20 percent. There 
are no import licenses required.
<P><B> Factor #2: Taxation</B><BR>
<I>Score - Income taxation:  2-Stable (Low tax rates) <BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 3-Stable (Moderate tax rates)<BR> 
Final Taxation Score: 3.5-Stable (Moderate tax rates)</I> <BR></B>
Albania has a top income tax rate of 24 percent. <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT> Albania's top corporate tax rate is 30 percent. It also has a small business tax, a social contributions tax, and a turnover tax.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of government consumption)</I><BR>
The public sector generates about 66 percent of the GDP. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>   
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high levels of inflation) </I><BR>
Inflation in Albania has been very high. The annual inflation rate was between 200 percent 
and 300 percent in 1992 and 1993. The government is currently implementing a tight 
monetary policy to curb high inflation rates.
<P><B>Factor #5:  Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Albania has quickly moved to open its borders to desperately needed foreign capital. It has 
passed laws forbidding state expropriation of foreign property. Foreign firms and domestic 
firms are treated equally under Albanian law. There are no sectors closed to foreign 
investment.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
While Albania has made significant strides in replacing the communist central bank and 
providing the avenues for a competitive market-driven system, Albania's financial system is 
still not fully private. Albania's financial system consists of seven major banks. Of these, 
four are state-owned, two are joint ventures between state-owned banks and private banks, 
and only one is fully private. There are few governmental restrictions on foreign banks.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Albania has a minimum wage. Most prices are controlled by the huge, state-owned sector 
of the economy which still receives government subsidies. These enterprises are often able 
to control prices because they can undercut prices determined by the market.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
While the government has made great strides in privatization, the private sector is still small 
when compared to the size of public holdings. In addition, Albania's court system is still too 
immature to handle a growing case load of property disputes. Thus, the biggest threat to 
private property remains that large state-owned sector and an inadequate legal system.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of regulation) </I><BR>
Albania has made some progress in streamlining its bureaucracy. Nevertheless,  the 
bureaucracy has been unable to adapt to the emerging private sector. It is still too large and 
inefficient.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of black market activity) </I><BR>
While Albania's legal market may be growing, many consumers and entrepreneurs still find 
it easier and more profitable to deal in the black market. Taxi and bus transportation still is 
provided by black marketeers. Smugglers find that the scarcities caused by high tariffs on 
auto parts provide them with ample opportunities for profit on the black market.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>   	The North African country of Algeria has had a state-controlled socialist economy since 
independence from France in 1962. Years of government mismanagement and low oil prices in the 
mid-1980s led to anti-government riots in 1988. In 1989, Algeria adopted a new constitution that 
ended one-party rule and called for multi-party elections. But the elections were canceled in January 
1992 after the results of the first round of voting made it clear that the radical Islamic Salvation 
Front would have taken power. This precipitated a rebellion by Islamic radicals against the military-
backed government. Since 1992, more than 10,000 Algerians have been killed in a brutal civil war. 
Islamic terrorists have targeted foreigners to cut Algeria's economic links to the outside world and to 
fuel discontent. In this uncertain climate, real economic growth has averaged barely 2 percent per 
year over the last several years. Under pressure from the international financial community, Algeria 
has committed to economic liberalization. The pursuit of economic reform, however, has been 
erratic.

Algeria has been liberalizing its trade policy. Substantial barriers to free trade nonetheless 
remain. Lately the government has shown some signs of backtracking, tightening import 
controls, for example. Nevertheless, the government monopoly on trade has been 
abolished. The government reformed the tariff schedule in 1992, cutting the top tariff rate 
from 120 percent to 60 percent as well as reducing the number of tariff categories. In 
addition to tariffs, importers must pay two other taxes, adding a combined 17 percent to 90 
percent to the cost of imports. <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>    Some goods require import licenses.

Final Taxation Score: 3.5- Stable (High tax rates)</I>
The top income tax rate in Algeria is 50 percent. There is no tax on average income. Income 
earned by foreigners is taxed at a flat 20 percent. It had been as high as 70 percent. The 
corporate tax rate is 50 percent for business profits and 20 percent for earnings that are 
reinvested. Tax breaks are available for companies locating in poorer areas. Algeria also 
maintains a value-added tax of 21 percent. 
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of government consumption) </I><BR>
State-controlled enterprises dominate most commerce and industry. Private sector involvement 
is slowly increasing. The government consumes 16.9 percent of Algeria's GDP. Algeria's 
state sector is massive, accounting for some 65 percent of national production. 
Unfortunately, massive corruption and mismanagement permeate the government. An 
announced privatization effort has not progressed.

<I>Score: 2- (Low inflation rate) </I><BR>
Algeria's average annual rate of inflation between 1980 and 1991 was 10.1 percent. Inflation 
was estimated at 24 percent for 1993. 
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>  
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Algeria has recently improved its foreign investment environment. A 1993 investment code 
includes incentives for foreign investors, though the wording is vague. Laws governing 
hydrocarbons and natural gas exploration have been liberalized and free trade zones have 
been established. Nevertheless, several sectors remain off limits to foreigners. Coupled with 
the large role of state enterprises, foreign investment opportunities remain limited. 
Moreover, it is not uncommon for foreign investors to spend two years negotiating with 
government officials who oversee investments. Finally, radical Islamic groups are 
threatening the stability of the government. 
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Algeria's heavily state-controlled banking sector has been liberalized. Foreign banks may 
establish operations in Algeria. They must maintain the same level of capital as Algerian 
banks. Two private Algerian banks are in the process of being formed. The state-owned 
central bank assumes non-performing commercial bank loans, many of which are carried 
by state-controlled enterprises.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The Algerian government controls the profit margins and the sales of  medicine, school 
supplies, tobacco, sugar, coffee, and vegetable oil. Subsidies on food items exist, and the 
government's widespread participation in the economy limits pricing competition. However, 
some prices have been decontrolled over the last few years.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-  (Moderate level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Government expropriation is unlikely. Algerian law prohibits expropriation based upon future 
legislation. Expropriations based upon existing law require fair compensation in foreign 
currency. Of late, collective farms have been parceled into lease properties. This is a 
modest advance for property rights. Overall, private property is reasonably well protected 
in Algeria. This would change drastically if the Islamic fundamentalists were to come to 
power. 
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 3-  (Moderate level of regulation) </I><BR>
Algerian private sector enterprises, of which there are relatively few, must contend with 
burdensome regulations. Algerian workers cannot be easily dismissed. The norm is 
employment for life. This represents a considerable burden to foreign companies and the 
private sector. In addition, it is difficult for foreign companies to hire people from their 
home country. Paying taxes is cumbersome, partly because of the inefficient and corrupt 
bureaucracy.

<P>	The southern African country of Angola began a war of independence from Portugal in 
1961 and won its independence in 1975. After that, Angola became embroiled in a civil war. The 
government adopted a socialist economic system and had close ties with Cuba and the Soviet 
Union. Years of civil war between the government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement, which 
controls large areas of the country, have left Angola economically devastated.

Angola is virtually a closed market. While figures on Angola's tariff rates are virtually non-

<H2>ARGENTINA</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	By the 1930s, Argentina had achieved the status of fourth richest country in the world. Just before World War II, Argentina had a living standard equal to that of the U.S. and Europe. But following the war, it introduced a host of social and economic policies that sent the economy into a spiraling decline. Under the leadership of President Carlos Menem, Argentina in 1989 began a free market revival that has increased economic freedom. As a result, inflation has stabilized and the economy is growing. While corruption is still rampant, Argentina is now the richest country in South America.
<P><IMG SRC="arg.gif">
<P><B>Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of protectionism)</I><BR>
Argentina began to liberalize its trade policy in the mid-1970s. That policy continues today. Along with 
Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, Argentina is a member of the Southern Cone Common Market 
(Mercosur) free trade zone. Argentina has a three-tier tariff system: 20 percent for finished products 
destined for consumption, 15 percent for intermediate goods, and 5 percent for raw materials. Its 
average tariff rate is 10.8 percent. Since October 1992, Argentina has imposed a 10 percent 
surcharge on all imports except capital goods, and it maintains a "trigger price mechanism" that 
automatically applies anti-dumping or compensatory levies whenever the price of an import falls 
below a certain amount. Argentina limits the import of automobiles through a quota system.

corporate tax rate of 30 percent. Argentina maintains a 30 percent capital gains tax and a 27 percent 
value-added tax.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
As Argentina becomes more industrialized, it is limiting government intervention in the economy. It is

<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high levels of inflation)</I><BR>
Argentina has tried to control its high inflation rate. The average annual rate of inflation from 1980 to 
1991 was 416 percent. For 1992, the rate dropped to 16 percent. For 1993, the rate dropped to 10 
percent. It is expected to be below 5 percent for 1994.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
There are few investment barriers in Argentina. Firms do not need to gain permission from the 
government to invest in Argentina. Foreign investors may wholly own most local companies and no 
permission is needed to own investment shares in the local stock exchange. However, foreign 
investment is prohibited in the following industries: fishing, nuclear power generation, uranium 
mining, ship building, and some businesses along the borders. In addition, many foreign investors 
complain about bureaucrats seeking bribes.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Argentina's banking system is becoming more competitive as the result of privatization. As banks have 
become profit-driven, they have streamlined and modernized business practices. However, there are 
restrictions on foreign banks. In fact, foreign banks may not open branches in Argentina. Moreover, 
the government has stopped granting licenses to foreign banks that permit them to acquire local 
banks. Thus, foreign banks are scarce in Argentina. As for domestic banks, government bodies and 
state agencies must conduct their business with state-owned banks. About 15 percent of the banks 
are state-owned. While domestic banks cannot freely invest in real estate and industrial firms, they 
can freely sell securities and insurance.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Wages and prices are more freely set today than in the last four decades. From 1930 to the late 1980s, 
price controls were the rule in Argentina. Under the leadership of President Menem, the 
government has liberalized prices. Today, there are no major items that have price controls. Most 
wages are determined by the market. However, the government fixes wages for public sector 
employees, and there is a minimum wage.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property)</I></BR>
Private property is secure in Argentina. While the likelihood of property expropriation is low, court 
protection for private property sometimes can be weak.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
Argentina was once one of the most regulated economies in the Western Hemisphere. Now it has 
reduced cumbersome registration requirements. Thus, opening a business in Argentina is generally 
easy. Existing regulations are relatively straightforward and applied uniformly most times.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of black market activity)</I><BR>
In the past, most of Argentina's GDP was produced in the black market. However, as Argentina's 
market becomes more integrated into the world economy, the black market is shrinking. Still, as 
much as 38 percent of the labor in the city of Cordoba is provided by the black market. Moreover, 
because the economy has yet to become fully deregulated, other activities like transportation and 
construction still exist in the black market.

<P>	An archipelago some 50 miles east of Florida, the Bahamas consists of some 700 islands, 
only 30 of which are inhabited. The Bahamas is a parliamentary democracy and a member of the 
British Commonwealth. Its biggest industry is tourism and, with a few notable exceptions, the 
economy is essentially free from government controls.

<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of protectionism)</I><BR>
A main source of revenue for the Bahamian government is import duties. Its tariff rates are 
very high. The general rate of duty charges on imports is 33 percent. The Bahamas 
maintains no other significant barriers. <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>

<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
The Bahamian government plays a limited role in the economy. Government consumption as a

<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of inflation)</I><BR>
The Bahamas historically has had low levels of inflation. From 1980 to 1991, its average annual 
inflation rate was 5.9 percent. Today it is about 3.3 percent.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
There remain significant barriers to foreign investment in the Bahamas. For example, the 
government restricts foreign investment in areas that directly compete with Bahamian-
owned businesses, such as construction. It does this by preventing foreign companies from 
obtaining business licenses and by imposing other requirements in areas where Bahamian 
businesses already exist. Further, there is no foreign investment code in the Bahamas.

<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
The Bahamas is one of the financial centers of the Caribbean. Its financial sector is extremely 
open to foreigners. The Bahamas seeks to attract foreign banks.  
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2- (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The Bahamas maintains some price controls on such items as automobiles, auto parts, flour, 
gasoline, public transportation, and utilities, but its wages are mainly determined by the 
market. There is now no minimum wage, although it will be introduced soon by the 
government.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high level of protection of private property) </I><BR>

system based on English common law adequately protects private property.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low levels of government regulation) </I><BR>
Regulation is virtually non-existent in the Bahamas. The government follows a hands-off 
approach to business. Opening a business in the Bahamas is simple. There are no specific 
requirements for establishing a business and English common law is used to enforce 
contracts. Profits are not taxed and businesses are free from burdensome regulations.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of black market activity) </I><BR>
The black market in the Bahamas is like those in most developed countries: restricted to guns 
and drugs. Gambling is legalized in the Bahamas. Since the government outlaws few things 
and businesses are free to operate as they see fit, the black market is very small. Still, high 
trade barriers result in some smuggling in such items as auto parts and electronics.

<P>[1 ] It is impossible to generate an average tariff rate for the Bahamas because information on tax 
revenues generated from imports is not available. However, the Bahamas' general tariff rate of 33 percent, 
which applies to most imports, was used. Other tariff rates range from zero percent on foodstuffs to 47 
percent on luxury items to a top rate of 200 percent. Still, since most imports fall into the general 
category, the 33 percent figure most closely represents the Bahamas' average tariff rate. For more 
information, see The Bahamas, International Tax and Business Guide, 1994 edition, Deloitte Touche 
Tohmatsu International, New York, New York, 1994.<BR>

This figure is for 1987, the most recent year available, and was generated from statistics found in World

Since independence, Bangladesh has received massive infusions of foreign aid. Rather than being

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Bolivia is a landlocked country in central South America. It is a constitutional democracy. 
While much of Latin America is moving toward liberalized economies and free trade, the 
government still maintains a strong hold on the economy. While the government has controlled 
inflation and the economy has grown somewhat, Bolivia is behind its neighbors in economic growth 
and freedom. In fact, Bolivia is the poorest country in South America.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif">
<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of protectionism)</I><BR>
In 1990, the government reduced the average tariff rate from 16 percent to 10 percent on all 
but capital goods, whose rate is 5 percent. Thus, Bolivia's average tariff rate is between 5 
percent and 9 percent.
<P><B> Factor #2: Taxation</B><BR>
<I>Score - Income taxation: 2+ (Low tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 3-Stable (Moderate tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 3-Stable (Moderate tax rates)</I><BR>
Bolivia has a flat income tax rate of 13 percent. It does not tax corporate income. Instead, it 
taxes corporations based on their net worth, at a rate of 3 percent. Bolivia also has a 13 
percent value-added tax and a variety of other transaction and property taxes.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Bolivia's government consumes more of its economy than does any other state in South 
America. State-owned industries account for over 70 percent of GDP. Government 
consumption as a percentage of GDP is 16 percent.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of inflation)</I><BR>
Bolivia has had chronically high inflation rates, though considerable progress has been made 
recently. Its average inflation rate was 264 percent from 1980 to 1991. In 1992 and 1993, 
the inflation rate fell to about 10 percent.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Foreign investment is encouraged in Bolivia. Few restrictions remain on foreign investment. 
While some restrictions remain on the petroleum and mining industries, they are minimal.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Bolivia's banking system is backward and corrupt. Most banks in Bolivia are state-controlled 
and lending is aimed at the state sector. There are only five foreign banks in Bolivia. Both 
private and foreign banks are restricted by the government.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
There are few price controls in Bolivia, although the government maintains the right to impose 
limits on the prices of foodstuffs. Wages and prices are becoming more free as more state-
owned companies have been privatized. There are no minimum wage laws in Bolivia.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Legal protection of private property is lax. Large property owners are particularly vulnerable to 
official corruption as property can be seized without just compensation and "taxed" by 
corrupt government officials. Although the government has begun an ambitious 
privatization program, expropriation of private property is still possible.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of government regulation)</I><BR>
Bolivia's economy is heavily regulated through haphazardly applied government requirements 
on business. There are many complaints of corruption. While the government maintains no 
occupational or environmental regulations, corruption poses a significant burden on 
business.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of black market activity)</I><BR>
Bolivia has one of the largest black markets in the Western Hemisphere. The black market is 
about equal to the official economy of Bolivia. Much of this black market is in the drug 
trade. Still, Bolivia's regulations push many "legal" professions into the black market, such 
as construction, transportation, and others.

Botswana is sparsely populated. Wealth is very sharply divided between rich and poor. Botswana is 
highly dependent on bordering South Africa, which supplies about 85 percent of its imports and 
even administers the country's customs procedures.

There are many sectors of the economy that are closed to foreign investment. These are:

domestic businesses. There are some tax holidays for specific investments.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Botswana has a competitive and advanced banking system compared to most African nations. 
However, the state plays a heavy role in the banking system by controlling most banks 
through the state-owned and -operated central banking system. Foreign banks are not 
permitted to operate in Botswana. The government owns and manages several major 
commercial banks.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Most wages and prices are determined by the market. Botswana has a minimum wage. Few 
prices are set by the government. However, agriculture prices are established by negotiated 
agreements with the government. Moreover, since a large portion of the economy is owned 
by the government, both prices and wages are affected by government-determined wage 
and price policies.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Property is relatively safe in Botswana. There is little history of property expropriation in 
Botswana. However, because of poor economic conditions, the court system lacks the 
money to operate the courts efficiently.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of regulation)</I><BR>
Despite Botswana's free market orientation, government bureaucracy often poses a burden on 
businesses. A business license is relatively easy to obtain. However, the bureaucracy plays 
a significant role in running the economy. For example, the government regulates the length

<P>	Brazil is the largest country in South America. It was once a colony of Portugal. Under 
President Fernando Collor, who was impeached in 1992, Brazil reduced trade barriers, privatized 
state-owned enterprises, controlled inflation, and maintained a tight monetary policy. When the new 
president, Itamar Franco, assumed office, he stated that Collor's policies would be continued. 
However, this did not happen. Under Franco, Collor's reforms lost their momentum. While he 
continued privatization and reduced government spending, he also raised taxes and increased 
government control over credit. Brazil's new President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, promises to 
reduce taxes and tariff rates, as well as privatize many state-owned businesses.

<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of protectionism)</I><BR>
Brazil maintains an average tariff rate of 14.3 percent. It has other barriers to trade as well, 
such as import licenses and other duties. For example, imported personal computers are 
subject to a 35 percent duty, a 10 percent freight insurance charge, a 15 percent value-
added tax, and a 17 percent sales tax. These duties increase the price of imported 
computers by over 100 percent.

<I>Score - Income taxation: 2+ (Low tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 3+ (Moderate tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 3+ (Moderate tax rates)</I><BR>
Brazil has a top income tax rate of 35 percent. The Brazilian government determines tax 
brackets based on what it calls a "fiscal unit of reference."  This is a method to determine 
an individual's annual income amount after a year's worth of inflation, which is very high 
in Brazil. With this method, the government gets the maximum amount of revenue from 
income that is continuously inflating. However, the average Brazilian does not pay taxes. 
Using the per capita GDP of $2,800 expressed in U.S. dollars, the average Brazilian 
taxpayer falls into the lowest tax bracket in which no taxes are owed. Brazil has a maximum 
corporate tax rate of 25 percent and a state corporate tax of 5 percent for a total top rate of 
30 percent. In addition, Brazil has a 25 percent capital gains tax, a top federal value-added 
tax of 365 percent, a 7 percent to 25 percent state value-added tax, a 10 percent social 
contributions tax, and a maximum municipal service tax of 10 percent.

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Brazil still maintains barriers to foreign investment. Restrictions on investments in the service 
industries can be high. For example, foreign capital investments in petroleum, banking, 
insurance, telecommunications, and mining are limited. Other investments, such as in 
transportation, utilities, media, real estate, and shipping, are prohibited. Brazil also imposes 
local content requirements on foreign equity participation.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Of the few foreign banks that exist in Brazil, all are restricted from expanding branches or doing 
business with state-owned companies. Brazilian law prohibits new foreign participants in 
the capital stock of national trading banks as well as any increase in equity participation in 
Brazilian banks. Moreover, Brazil has not permitted the entrance of any new banks. 
Indications are that this policy will continue. Domestic banks are allowed to engage in 
securities exchanges and insurance services, but they are prevented from engaging in real 
estate ventures and most equity investments.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Brazil has had a long history of wage and price controls. Brazil last froze prices in 1990, but 
controls have been gradually eased since that time. Nevertheless, Brazil still maintains price 
controls on a variety of goods and services such as some foodstuffs. Businesses may be 
required to ask permission from the government to increase prices, even if production costs 
rise. Many companies are not free to set their own prices. Brazil maintains a minimum 
wage. 
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
There is little chance that the private property of foreign investors will be expropriated in Brazil. 
Because there are a number of major multinational corporations in the country and the 
government is trying to attract foreign investment, the protection of foreign-owned property 
is adequate. However, domestically owned property is at risk. 
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
Government regulation is rampant in Brazil. Its economy is heavily regulated. Environmental, 
health, consumer, labor, financial, and a host of other regulations greatly restrain business 
activities.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of black market activity)</I><BR>
Brazil has a moderate level of black market activity. Brazil's black market has shrunk, 
however, in recent years as Brazil has reduced trade barriers on previously protected 
goods, reducing the ability of smugglers to make a profit on highly taxed products.

Canada is a supporter of free trade policies. Its average tariff rate is 4.9 percent. Canada is part 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Mexico. While 
largely a free trader, Canada nonetheless maintains trade barriers against dairy products, 
liquor, poultry, and wheat. According to the United States Trade Representative's office, 
Canada's Special Import Measures Act has been used to reduce imports. Since the early 
1980s, the country also has increased its use of antidumping laws, further restricting 
imports.

Canada has a progressive tax structure with a top marginal rate of 29 percent. Its tax rate on the 
average income level  is 17 percent. Canada has a massive national debt that amounts to 60 
percent of GDP. This is increasing pressures to raise taxes. Canada has a top marginal 
corporate tax rate of 38 percent. Canada also has provincial taxes ranging from 6 percent to 
10 percent, a 21.63 capital gains tax, and a 7 percent value-added tax called a Goods and 
Services Tax.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Canada has been much more willing to intervene in its economy than has the United States. 
The government consumes 21 percent of the GDP. The Canadian government owns and 
runs the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian National Railway, and the 
Canadian Wheat Board. Nevertheless, since 1984, the Canadian government has 
undertaken a substantial privatization program, which has now stalled.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of inflation)</I><BR>
Monetary policy is set by the Canadian Central Bank. The average annual inflation rate from

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Canada maintains several restrictions on investment. The Investment Canada Act, for example, 
requires the government to review each foreign investment to determine whether there is a 
"net benefit to Canada."  While most foreign investments ultimately benefit the recipient 
country, Canada's regulations discourage potential investors. The Investment Canada Act 
often is used to restrict foreign investment in the following industries: energy, publishing, 
telecommunications, broadcasting, and cable television.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Canada has a private financial system with some restrictions. The Canadian banking system 
prohibits entry of foreign-owned branches. In mid-1992, Canada implemented a financial 
sector reform package that increased competition among banks, trust companies, and 
insurance companies.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low levels of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Most prices are set by the market without government involvement. Some notable exceptions

as eggs, poultry, and dairy products.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1- (Very high level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Private property is a fundamental principle of the Canadian economy. Canada's legal and 
judicial system afford adequate protection of private property. However, the Canadian 
government's flirtation with socialist economic policies may lead to renewed calls for the 
nationalization of some businesses.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2- (Low levels of regulation)</I><BR>
It is relatively easy to establish a business in Canada. Every business must be registered in its 
province, except in New Brunswick, which does not require any kind of registration. Fees 
range from nominal to nonexistent. Registration is virtually automatic for most types of 
businesses. Regulations are applied evenly and consistently. Some regulations like 
consumer safety and environmental laws, plus occupational and health standards, pose a 
burden to business. Nevertheless, by global standards, Canada's level of regulation is low.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	While most of the economic success stories since 1960 come from Asia, Chile is one 
shining example of a Western Hemispheric country enjoying great economic success. Chile 
underwent a massive economic transformation in the 1970s that has made it the envy of Latin 
America. This economic transformation continues and has resulted in some of the fastest economic 
growth rates in the Western Hemisphere. <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   Following this 
steadfast economic transformation, Chile underwent a series of political reforms that culminated in 
democratic elections in 1989. The Chilean Constitution has well defined and protected individual 
liberties. Chile's new president, Eduardo Frei, is continuing the country's free market course.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif">
<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of protectionism)</I><BR>
International trade is the cornerstone of the Chilean economy. Chile has a flat tariff rate for 
most products of 11 percent. However, other tariffs raise the average tariff rate to 12.37 
percent. Chile maintains an import license requirement, but only about 5 percent of the 
applications are rejected each year. Chile has substantial non-tariff barriers.

The top income tax rate is 20 percent. The average taxpayer is in the 7 percent bracket. Chile's 
rates are among the lowest in Latin America. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>  Chile 
taxes its citizens under a complex method of increasing tax rates based on what the 
government calls the "value" of earnings. These values are determined by periodic 
calculations to limit the effects of inflation. Chile has an effective top corporate income tax 
rate of 35 percent. Chile also maintains a 15 percent capital gains tax and an 18 percent 
value-added tax.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low government consumption)</I><BR>
Chile is an example of how reduced government consumption produces solid rates of economic  
growth. Chile's government consumption as a percentage of GDP is 8.6 percent. Chile has 
achieved this low rate by permitting private enterprises to  supply such "public" services as 
education, pension funds, social security, and some utilities. <FONT SIZE="-

operated.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate inflation rate)  </I><BR>
Chile's average annual rate of inflation from 1980 to 1991 was 20 percent. Chile's central bank 
pegs the peso to a basket of currencies based on the U.S. dollar.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Chile aims to attract foreign investors by granting them quick government approval in some 
industries. Nevertheless, while Chile has reformed its foreign investment code to attract 
investment, significant barriers still exist. For example, all foreign investors must gain 
permission from the government's Foreign Investment Committee. Moreover, the 
government maintains restrictions on investment in the fishing, maritime transport, and oil 
and gas industries. 
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
While Chile's banking system is relatively free from government corruption, it is not a totally 
competitive, market-oriented industry. Chile requires a license for foreign banks. All 
licenses have been frozen. Thus, no new foreign banks now are allowed in Chile. Only 20 
foreign banks operate in Chile. Domestic banks, especially those in the lending business, 
often find themselves in competition with the government-owned banks, thus distorting 
market operations. Chile has a state-operated agency that provides subsidized loans to the 
public and private sectors. Its 40 percent default rate has swallowed up lending capital and 
skewed the banking system with bad loans. Banks are not permitted to engage in insurance, 
real estate, or investment services.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Chile's price policy is determined mainly by the market. Some exceptions are prices for urban 
and public transport and some utilities. Minimum wages, hours worked, and safety 
regulations are all controlled by the government. Chile also maintains a "family subsidy" for 
poor workers, which guarantees a minimum wage for specified workers.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Private property is gaining increased protection from the Chilean government through greater 
efficiency in the court system and legal institutions. Chile has had since the early 1980s a 
comprehensive program of privatization, and it continues today. The likelihood of private 
property expropriation is very low.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
Government regulation in Chile runs from nonexistent in some areas to overbearing in others. 
Opening a business in Chile is far easier than in many Latin American countries. 
Regulations are moderate, but some can pose a burden on private businesses. The Public 
Health Ministry, for example, regulates all food and drug products. The Ministry directly 
regulates the production, storage, distribution, sale, and import of all food and drug items.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate black market activity)</I><BR>
Like most Latin American countries, Chile has a black market. Some estimates suggest that as 
much as 35 percent of the labor in Chile, especially in the bigger cities, is supplied by the 
black market. Nevertheless, as the country becomes more industrialized, the black market 
activities will shrink.

<P>	While China is often criticized for its human rights abuses and its communist political

the economic reforms of the 1980s were undone following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 
1989. However, since that time, China once again has pursued economic liberalization. These 
reforms have paid off as economic growth reached 12 percent in 1993. While China's economy is

As a communist system, most property is owned by the state. The World Bank reports that 
China's government consumes only 9.8 percent of the GDP, which is up from 8.3 percent 
in 1980. Still, China's state-owned sector contributes almost all GDP. By definition, 
therefore, China's government consumption is very high due to the fact that the state owns 
most of the economy.

<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of inflation)</I><BR>
Being a command economy, China had an average annual rate of inflation of only 5.8 percent 
from 1980 to 1991. Inflation was 8.1 percent in 1992. However, this underestimates the 
real rate of inflation because the communist government controls prices.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
China's government has always maintained barriers against foreign investment. China suffers 
from a lack of foreign investment codes. Moreover, the Chinese use their foreign 
investment policy to prevent foreign investments in industries owned by the government. 
However, China's special foreign investment zones in the south give it a somewhat better 
score.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>

<I>Score: 4-Stable (Low level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
China is a communist system in which most of the property remains in government hands. 
However,  China is currently privatizing some major industries, thus moving state-owned

<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
In an attempt to boost the private sector, the Chinese bureaucracy sometimes does not enforce 
cumbersome regulations. China still has a state planning agency that makes significant

tax rate of 30 percent, plus a 25 percent tax penalty for making over a specific income. However, the 25

<P>	The central African county of Congo became a French colony in 1910. It became 
independent in 1960. Congo's history has been marked by one-party rule, political repression, 
economic stagnation, and frequent military coups. In 1992, multi-party elections were held. These 
elections spawned riots and civil unrest. Little progress toward democratic or market reforms has 
been made since.

Congo's average tariff rate is unknown. The biggest barrier to trade remains red tape, rampant

<P>	The Central American country of Costa Rica declared its independence from Spain in 
1821. The U.S. remains Costa Rica's largest trading partner. Foreign aid has drastically decreased 
since the end of the Cold War and trade between the U.S. and Costa Rica is growing. Costa Rica's 
economic growth is mainly the result of increased trade and economic reforms.

Although Costa Rica has been moving to open its borders, it still remains a rather difficult 
market to penetrate. Costa Rica has an average tariff rate of 12.7 percent. Costa Rica's 
customs procedures are cumbersome and plagued with inefficiencies. Many importers are 
forced to hire a customs specialist just to get their products across the borders. Costa Rica 
maintains significant non-tariff barriers. For example, import permits are required for dairy 
products, pork, poultry, meat, rice, beans, potatoes, onions, and wheat.

<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Costa Rica offers one of the best investment climates in Central America. Costa Rica has no 
repatriation requirements, allowing foreigners to take out all of their profits, and a widening 
group of foreign investment incentives. Some tax holidays are offered for specific 
investments. Costa Rica does not discriminate against foreign investors, treating them no 
differently than local investors. Some restrictions remain on utilities and services, where 
investments are barred.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Foreigners are prevented from engaging in some banking services like checking and savings. 
However, banking competition is generally free and open in Costa Rica. Banks are not

environmental impact studies. Moreover, the government requires private companies to 
grant vacations, holidays, overtime, and social insurance.

<H2>CUBA</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Cuba is one of the most repressed economies in the world. After Fidel Castro seized power 
in 1959, he systematically imposed government control and ownership of every economic activity 
and outlawed private property and individual economic freedom. Cuba's economy remained afloat 
through decades of hefty subsidies from the Soviet Union, which used the island as a base to 
threaten U.S. national security. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Cuba lost its subsidies, forcing it 
to compete internationally on its own merits. Understandably, the Cuban economy collapsed. 
Although Castro has made some reforms to attract foreign investors, Cuba's economy is still 
communist.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif">

<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of protectionism) </I><BR>
Castro maintains some of the highest levels of protectionism in the world. All imports into Cuba 
must be inspected and approved by Castro's government. In many cases, customs officials 
confiscate imports for their own personal use, especially if they are scarce goods like 
electronics. Official corruption is sanctioned and supported by Castro's customs officials. 
As a result, Cuba has trade barriers that effectively bar most imports.
<P><B> Factor #2: Taxation</B><BR>
<I>Score - Income taxation: 5-Stable (Very high tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 5-Stable (Very high tax rates) <BR>
Final Taxation Score: 5-Stable (Very high tax rates) </I><BR>
Because the Cuban government controls the entire economy, it essentially confiscates the 
proceeds of all economic activity.  Since the fruits of all economic activity are owned by 
the government, the resulting rate of taxation approaches 100 percent.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of government consumption ) </I><BR>
Although Castro permits some private economic activity in a restricted way, the means of 
production and the profits gained from them are still entirely in the hands of the state. The 
Cuban government directly owns and runs most of the Cuban economy.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high levels of inflation) </I><BR>
The Castro government claims that inflation does not exist in Cuba.  But this is a fiction. If 
price controls were lifted and the true value of the currency were measured, inflation would 
be extremely high. The official prices of goods may be low because they are controlled and 
subsidized by the state, but the tremendous scarcity of goods and services attests to their 
real value. In short, Cuba's currency is worth little, and it is not convertible on the 
international market. Moreover, because money is printed rampantly to cover the costs of 
debts, the peso is greatly inflated. The Cuban government freely admits that 11.5 billion 
pesos are circulating in excess of demand. 
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Foreign investment is effectively barred in Cuba. Castro will permit some foreign investments, 
in tourism for example, but  the Cuban government outlaws full foreign ownership. 
Moreover, the Cuban foreign investment code is unreliable.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Banks in Cuba are owned and operated by the government and are heavily influenced by the 
state-owned central bank. There is no competition in this industry.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Virtually all wages and prices are set by the Cuban government.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very low level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Private property is outlawed in Cuba, and the government can confiscate property with 
impunity.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of regulation) </I><BR>
The Cuban government regulates the entire economy by owning and operating the means of 
production.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5- (Very high level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Cuba's black market activity is greater than that of the official or legal economy. As might be 
expected in a command economy, even basic economic activities are performed in the 
black market. Thus, Cuba's black market involves the sale of basic foodstuffs like milk and 
bread, transportation services, and housing.

percent; in some cases that tax raises prices so high that some products become 
unaffordable and therefore are effectively barred from the country. For example, a 
consumption tax is added to automobiles based on their engine size. As a result, imported 
cars are far out of reach of the average citizen. Import licenses exist for most products.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Ecuador became independent from Spain in 1822. For the next century, the country was 
plagued by much instability and many dictatorships. Today, Ecuador's economy is based mainly on 
oil. During the oil boom of the 1970s, the government of Ecuador used its increased wealth to 
subsidize businesses and generally to raise the level of government consumption in the economy. 
However, as oil prices plummeted later in the decade and into the 1980s,  Ecuador's oil-based 
economy began to decline. Trying to recover, Ecuador has been making economic reforms that 
reduce the level of state intervention in the economy.

<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Ecuador's government consumes only 8.7 percent of its GDP. This may seem very low

state-owned sector contributes less than 8 percent of GDP.

<I>Score: 5- (Very high level of inflation)</I><BR>
Ecuador's main monetary goal has been to stabilize inflation by controlling the supply of

<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
There are 32 private banks in Ecuador, which is a considerable number when compared to

<P>	Egypt gained its independence from Britain in 1922. Today, Egypt is a social democracy 
ruled by President Hosni Mubarak. The government launched a desperately needed market 
liberalization program in 1991. It has attempted to remove the state from the market. However, 
very little progress has been made in privatizing Egypt's massive and inefficient public sector. Nor 
has much been done to reform and reduce the size of the bureaucracy. In the past two years 
Egypt's tourist industry has suffered a billion-dollar-a-year loss because of radical Islamic terrorist 
attacks on foreign tourists and government officials. Egypt is the second-largest annual recipient of 
U.S. foreign aid.

Egypt has made modest progress over the past several years in liberalizing its trade policy.  
Nevertheless, Egypt remains one of the most heavily protected markets in the world. 
Egypt's average tariff rate of around 30 percent is exceptionally high.  Such non-tariff 
import barriers as import bans also protect domestic industries. Some  trade reforms have 
been undertaken, including the 1993 reduction of the maximum tariff rate on most items 
from 100 percent to 80 percent and the elimination of import bans on most commodities. 
Nevertheless, 159 previously banned items have been placed on a "quality control" list.

Egypt's banking industry is dominated by the public sector. The state-owned and central bank 
exercises considerable control over private banks. Egyptian banks have formed joint 
ventures with such companies as Barclays' and Bank of America. However, the 
government will not permit the establishment of new joint venture banks or branches. Joint 
venture banks are subject to strict control by the central bank, which determines the fees 
and commissions they can charge. The central bank also exercises control over the 
appointment of directors of joint venture banks and determines their interest rates for loans 
in the economy. The central bank also requires joint venture banks to deposit with it an

Price controls have been removed on most products. Remaining price controls should be 
removed within the next year, except on pharmaceutical products. However, gasoline, 
flour, and sugar remain subsidized. The existence of a massive public sector limits the 
private sector's ability to set wages and prices. The government limits the amount of profit 
earned on some imported goods. There is a minimum wage. 
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>

<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of black market activity)</I><BR>
With its long commitment to a command economy and the slowness of its economic reforms,

percent in GDP in 1990, 3.5 percent in 1991, 4.8 percent in 1992, and 5 percent in 1993. Under 
President Alfredo Cristiani, the government relinquished control of prices, slashed import tariffs, 
privatized most of the financial system, and followed a relatively tight monetary policy. While some 
problems remain, El Salvador's economy is growing and showing signs of increasing prosperity.

As a member of the Central American Common Market, a group of nations committed to 
lowering trade barriers, El Salvador has agreed to reduce its tariffs. Tariffs generally range

percent tax on imports, and some individual states may impose special tariffs for up to 30 
days. <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   This brings El Salvador's average tariff rate to 
above 10 percent. Another burden for importers is a government requirement for a health 
certificate for imported poultry. Since this certificate is nearly impossible to get from the 
government, poultry imports are effectively banned. El Salvador also maintains tariffs on 
corn, rice, and sorghum and soybean meal. When the price for these imported products 
falls below a certain level, a 20 percent tariff is added.

government requires 11 days of paid vacation a year, an annual 30 percent bonus after only

<P>	A small island nation in the South Pacific Ocean, Fiji gained its independence from the 
United Kingdom in 1970. It developed a democratic constitution shortly thereafter. However, 
during the 1980s several military coups occurred. Because of political instability, Fiji has been 
unable to adopt significant, long-lasting economic reform. As a result, sustainable economic growth 
has been unattainable.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	France is the fourth-largest industrialized economy in the world. Like much of  Europe, 
France's economy has been in a recession for the past several years. While essentially a free

<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of protectionism)</I><BR>
As part of the European Union, France's trade policy is the same as other EU members. 
Imports are subject to the common EU external tariff of 3.6 percent. While economic 
integration has reduced some trade barriers, it has raised others. Particular industries 
affected by raised barriers are electronics, telecommunications equipment, medical and 
veterinary equipment, and agricultural products.
<P><B>Factor #2: Taxation</B><BR>
<I>Score - Income taxation: 3-Stable (Moderate tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 4-Stable  (High tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 4-Stable (High tax rates)</I><BR>
France has a top income tax rate of 30.5 percent. The tax rate on the average income is 15 
percent. France's complicated tax structure puts the total corporate tax paid over 35 
percent. In addition, France maintains an 18 percent to 33 percent capital gains tax, an 18.6 
percent value-added tax, a business activity tax of up to 20 percent, and a social 
contributions tax of 16 percent to 45 percent.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Total government consumption as a percentage of GDP is 18.6 percent.  The French 
government has monopoly control over several parts of the economy, such as energy 
generation and supply, rail transportation, postal services, telecommunications, and tobacco 
production and distribution. Moreover, many state-owned companies dominate various 
industrial sectors, skewing pricing and adding inefficiency to the entire French economy. 
Some of these companies are in such industries as iron and steel, aluminum, coal mining, 
aerospace, nuclear energy, and many forms of transportation except trucking. France is 
undergoing a limited privatization program and for this reason receives an improving score. 
Despite some of its problems, the level of government intervention in the economy is low 
by global standards. 
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of inflation)</I><BR>
France had an annual inflation rate of 5.7 percent from 1980 to 1991. Today, it remains around

<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Non-French investors must receive approval from the Ministry of Economics before buying a 
French business. The Ministry of Economics can block any investment if it deems the sale 
as violating the "national interest."
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
The French government controls two of France's largest banks, Banque Nationale de Paris and 
Credit Lyonnais. This control severely reduces the availability of credit.  Nevertheless, 
foreign investors are finding it easier to invest in French financial services and to open 
banks.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
France has a long history of legalized monopolies in such areas of the economy as 
telecommunications, public infrastructure, electricity, and rail transportation. In 1987, 
however, the French government removed price controls, and most prices are now set by 
the market. Products still under price controls are pharmaceuticals, books, tobacco, 
agricultural products, coal, and steel. France maintains a minimum wage, and some wages 
are controlled by the government.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Property rights are uniform throughout France. Enforcement is adequate. However, there are 
some impediments to acquiring property. The French Constitution, for example, states that 
any company defined as a national public service or as a natural monopoly must pass into 
state ownership. The Constitution allows the state to nationalize companies that fall into this 
category. However, in practice and by global standards, protection is high.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
The reforms established by the EU have made opening a business in France easier. Obtaining a 
business license is relatively easy, but some hurdles still must be overcome. For example, a 
company must obtain a registration number from the district commercial court. To do so, a 
copy of the business's lease, plus other documentation, must accompany the application. 
However, France has made some progress in streamlining this cumbersome registration 
process by incorporating all the registration requirements into one office.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low black market activity)</I><BR>
The French black market is conducted mainly in gambling and in the buying and selling of 
illegal weapons, drugs, and stolen merchandise.

stability unusual in Africa. In 1990 French troops stationed in Gabon quelled riots against the regime 
of President Omar Bongo, who has been slowly making political and economic reforms. However, 
Bongo retains tight control over political activity. The Gabonese economy has been partially

Foreign property is unlikely to be expropriated. However, there have been charges that

 While the bureaucracy is generally effective, lengthy delays in the processing of some business 
investments and expansions are common. Regulations have increasingly complicated the 
business environment. Moreover, the success of Gabonese enterprises depends largely 
upon their political connections. A 1992 "Gabonization" program forces employers to 
decrease the number of foreigners in their work force. The President has called upon 
foreign-owned businesses to hire more Gabonese workers.

Germany's taxes remain among the highest in the industrialized world and the European Union. 
Germany's top income tax bracket is 53 percent. The tax on the average income level 
varies between 20 percent and 35 percent. In 1994, however, the top income tax rate will 
fall to 47 percent. But the rate applied to the average income will change little. Corporate 
profits are taxed twice. The top rate is 50 percent and is called a "corporation tax."  Those 
same profits are taxed additionally at rates that range from 12 percent to 20 percent, 
depending on the locality of the business. This is called a "locality tax." Thus, in 1992 a 
company's profits could have been taxed as high as 70 percent. The 50 percent top rate will 
fall to 45 percent in 1994. In addition, there are a 7.5 percent tax called a "solidarity 
supplementary surcharge," a 45 percent capital gains tax, a 15 percent valued-added tax, 
and land, property, and real estate taxes.

Germany's total public consumption as a percentage of GDP was 17.9 percent in 1992, and 
that probably rose in 1993. After reunification, the German government extended its 
generous social welfare system to the former East Germany. Moreover, the German 
government expanded subsidies for private investment. These hefty expenditures have 
increased the role of the German government in the economy. Nevertheless, there seems to 
be a recognition that this social spending has gone too far. Germany's social security and 
welfare spending now amounts to about 48 percent of total government expenditures, 
compared to only 28 percent in the U.S. Nevertheless, by global standards, the level of 
government consumption of economic output is low.
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>

Germany's inflation rate has been among the lowest in the world. Germany had an average

Germany is a world financial center and banking powerhouse. Some 60 foreign banks from 21 
countries had established German branches and subsidiaries in 1990. In addition, 193 
foreign banks from 39 countries have representative offices in Germany. The State 
Department reports that Germany's banking system is becoming more open to foreigners. 
Nevertheless, Germany still maintains some restrictions on foreign banks. All foreign banks 
must obtain a license to do business in Germany. This process can take up to four months, 
and in some cases the German bureaucracy can be cumbersome, acting as a barrier to 
banks that want to quickly establish themselves in Germany.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Germany's free enterprise system is based on market-set prices and wages. Minimum wages 
are not fixed by law, but are the result of collective bargaining, which has brought average 
wage increases of between 3 percent and 4 percent annually since the 1980s. While wages 
are predominately set by the market, Germany still maintains a Federal Cartel Office (FCO) 
which monitors prices on specific goods and services. If prices rise quickly, the FCO 
initiates an investigation to discover whether the increase is a result of cartels or 
monopolies. If it is, fines are imposed and prices are reduced. In addition, Germany 
controls the price of rent and agricultural products. 
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high level of protection of private property )</I><BR>
Germany's economy is based on the private ownership of property. It is undergoing extensive 
privatization, especially in the former East Germany. Germany is pursuing privatization of 
state-owned property, and the chances of expropriation are virtually nonexistent. 
Germany's court system provides a very high level of property protection, as it is efficient 
and available for all types of dispute resolution.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
Establishing a business in Germany is relatively easy, with little or no barriers to new business 
creation. All that is required is for a new business to notify the local economic supervisory 
office, which supplies a certificate. Corruption is absent, and regulations are applied evenly 
and consistently. However, Germany's employment, product safety, and environmental 
laws pose some burdens on business. Nevertheless, by global standards, Germany has a 
low level of regulation.

Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah quickly transformed Ghana into a one-party socialist state. This 
lasted until 1992 when Flight Lt. J.J. Rawlings legalized political parties. Rawlings won Ghana's 
1992 presidential elections, though their fairness has been questioned. An economic liberalization 
program begun by Rawlings in 1983 has improved what was a collapsing socialist economy. Annual 
growth has averaged 4.5 percent since then, giving Ghana one of Africa's best-performing 
economies. Ghana benefits from a relatively well-developed infrastructure and rich raw materials.

liberalizing measures, restrictions on foreign investment remain in several sectors. An 
inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy stipulates the nature of investments, including the 
amount and source of capital, the nationality and number of shareholders, and training 
requirements for Ghanaian labor. Moreover, prospective investors are screened on a case-

Soviet Union attempted to take over Greece in 1946. This led to a civil war in which many lives 
were lost. Greece emerged from the civil war as a Western democracy and joined the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952. It has been involved in a bitter stand-off with Turkey over the 
island of Cyprus, which both countries claim as their own. Since joining the European Community 
in 1981, Greece has worked to bring its economy in line with the other democracies of Europe. 
Four years of free market economic reforms undertaken by the conservative government of Prime 
Minister Constantine Mitsotakis came to an end in October 1993 when Mitsotakis lost his reelection

<P>	The Caribbean nation of Haiti has little economic freedom. Although turning toward 
democracy in February 1991, freely elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not an advocate of 
free markets. Following his ouster by military coup in September 1991, the country was isolated 
economically and remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Given Aristide's anti-market 
past, the newly returned president is unlikely to launch major economic reforms.

Final Taxation Score: 3-Stable (High tax rates)</I><BR>
Haiti has a top income tax rate of 30 percent. Haiti's tax collection system is so poor that it is 
impossible to determine which rate applies to the average income. Tax evasion is massive. 
Direct taxes paid represent only 15 percent of total receipts. <FONT SIZE="-

<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>

The most recent reliable figures for Haiti's government consumption are for 1987. In that year, according 
to the World Bank, central government expenditure as a percentage of gross national product was 18.7 
percent. However, this figure probably seriously understates the government's true consumption of GNP. 
<FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
  Gross domestic product, for example, has shrunk every year since 1991. If estimated 
government expenditures remain relatively constant, Haiti's government consumption is 
estimated to be more than 25 percent of GDP.

Haiti's average annual inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 was 7.1 percent. However, in 1992 and

closer to 35 percent.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Sanctions prevented most, if not all, foreign investment in Haiti. But even under Aristide, 
foreign investment was not welcome. Haiti's hostility to foreign investment is likely to

<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Although there are some foreign banks operating in Haiti, the system is collapsing under

<I>Score: 4- (High level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Haiti has controlled prices on many items, including cement and gasoline. With most of its

Private property has little or no protection in Haiti.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of regulation)</I><BR>
Corruption is rampant. It was virtually impossible to open a business legally under the military 
regime. Members of the military used regulations as a way to extort goods and services 
from businesses. They would, for example, use force to confiscate products directly from 
vendors. With Aristide, these practices are likely to end. However, Haiti's bureaucracy still 
will be corrupt and will continue to pose a burden on business.

Today, mining, manufacturing, construction, and public utilities account for about 37 percent of 
gross domestic product. Agriculture accounts for only 12 percent of GDP. In the late 1980s and 
early 1990s, Ireland became a base for production of advanced consumer electronics products.

<P>	The Caribbean island nation of Jamaica has seldom adopted a free market approach to 
economic policy. During the 1970s and part of the 1980s, the government was the primary player in 
the economy. Entrepreneurship was not encouraged, and Jamaica was on its way to developing a 
socialist economy. Until recently, Jamaica's economy was mostly not free. It was characterized by 
a high level of protectionism and government intervention in the economy. However, the 
government recently has opened up the economy to foreign investments and has reduced taxes. 
While Jamaica's economy has grown slowly in the past, the prospects for future economic growth 
look good.

<H2>JAPAN</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>


<P>	Japan has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the post-World War II era. 
With a democracy firmly in place by 1946 and an economy in ruins, Japan eliminated most 
elements of socialism and adopted the basics of a free market system which helped propel it to the 
economic status it now enjoys.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif"> 

<P><B>Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of protectionism)</I><BR>
Many economists argue that Japan is very protectionist. Yet Japan's average tariff rate is 
among the lowest in the world, around 1.5 percent--less even than the U.S. Japan also has 
eliminated quotas in rice, something not even considered just a year ago, and has begun to 
open up its market. While tariffs have never really been the problem in Japan, like the U.S. 
and the European Union it remains plagued with non-tariff barriers. These include 
government red tape, government toleration of business collusion, exclusionary private 
business practices, a fragmented distribution system, and a relatively unapproachable 
government bureaucracy. While these often prove to be impediments to imports, Japan's 
market is more accessible than those of most countries in the world.
 <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>  Therefore, by global standards, especially when compared to countries 
like Bangladesh, India, and Yemen, Japan's trade barriers are relatively low.
<P><B>Factor #2: Taxation</B><BR>
<I>Score - Income taxation: 4+ (High tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 4-Stable (High tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 4.5 (Very high tax rates)</I><BR>
Japan's top income tax rate is 50 percent. The tax rate that applies to the average income level 
is 20 percent. Japan is now considering an income tax reduction. Japan has a top marginal 
corporate tax rate of 37.5 percent. In addition, Japan has an inhabitant's tax that is paid to 
the prefecture or municipality in which the company is located, a capital gains tax of 37.5 
percent, and an enterprise tax of 6 percent to 12.84 percent.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low government consumption)</I><BR>
Government consumption as a percentage of GDP is 9.4 percent.  The Japanese government 
has gone from periods of extensive subsidies to opening up its market for some products, 
such as rice. Moreover, Japanese government expenditures have been kept lower than 
those of other countries because the United States has provided for Japan's defense.
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of inflation)</I><BR>
Japan's annual inflation rate averaged only 1.5 percent from 1980 to 1991. Inflation was 1.8 
percent in 1992. In 1993, Japan actually had a negative inflation rate of about 2 percent. So 
far in 1994, prices are still shrinking.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Japan's foreign investment procedures were overhauled in the early 1990s. However, Japan 
continues to maintain investment restrictions on agriculture, aircraft, atomic energy, 
fisheries, forestry, leather goods, oil and gas production, and space development. 
Moreover, Japan's close government relationship with private businesses often proves to be 
a barrier to foreign investment because some businesses and government agencies collude 
to make foreign investments too costly.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
The banking industry is very competitive in Japan. The government places few restrictions on 
Japanese banks and their ability to engage in a variety of services. For example, banks are 
allowed to underwrite, deal, and broker all kinds of securities through subsidiaries. This 
allows banks to be more competitive. Japan remains the world's largest net creditor. Some 
minor restrictions exist on foreign banks.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
There are no price controls in Japan except on rice. Wages are mainly set by the market. Japan 
has a minimum wage.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high protection of private property)</I><BR>
Japan has an efficient legal and court system capable of protecting property rights. Government 
expropriation of property is unlikely.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
While Japan's economy often is characterized as heavily regulated, most businesses enjoy a 
large amount of economic freedom. The process for opening a business in Japan has been 
made easier in the last several years. Moreover, while some regulations may pose burdens 
directly on individuals, Japan's regulations on businesses are aimed at allowing them 
enough room to maximize profits. Therefore, many regulations on businesses either are not 
enforced or are not a significant burden on business. For example, Japan rarely enforces its 
anti-trust laws, allowing businesses to join forces without the threat of anti-monopoly 
litigation from competitors. Therefore, by global standards, Japan's level of regulation is 
low.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of black market activity)</I><BR>
The Japanese government has undertaken an immense crackdown on such illegal activities as 
the buying and selling of guns and narcotics.

The government of South Korea has relied on foreign investment to build its export economy.  Foreign

Obtaining a business license in South Korea is a simple process. All businesses must be registered, but 
Korea's efficient process is not a major burden. However, in some cases, the government fails to 
publish all of its regulations and enforcement of some regulations remains haphazard.  Sometimes 
businesses find themselves in violation of regulations that they do not know exist. In addition, Korea 
enforces most labor standards only on domestic firms, leaving foreign firms vulnerable to radical 
labor activities like arbitrary strikes. In some cases, these activities have forced the bankruptcy of 
foreign firms, which flee the country without paying their employees. As a result, Korea mandates 
that foreign firms deposit three months worth of wages in a special account.

a largely agrarian economy with rice as its largest crop. Much of its agricultural industry is state-

1960, Madagascar had little economic growth in the 1960s. In 1970 its economy took a massive 
turn for the worse because the government moved from a market-based economy to a command 
economy.  However, beginning in 1988, the government began to institute some limited economic 
reforms that have produced modest rates of economic growth. In 1991, calls for political reforms 
sidetracked economic reforms. Today, Madagascar's economy is in shambles as economic reforms 
have stalled.

<P>	Malawi is located in central Africa. It gained independence from Britain in 1964. 
Throughout the rest of the 1960s and into the 1970s, Malawi used increased agricultural production 
as an engine for economic growth. During that period, Malawi's GDP more than doubled with 3 
percent annual growth rates.  However, this changed in the 1980s. As drought brought on an 
agricultural depression, and as refugees from the nearby Mozambique civil war flowed into the 
country, Malawi's economy sank into a deep recession.  The government responded by restricting 
imports and raising government spending on social programs. This caused the budget deficit to 
balloon and pushed the country further into a depression.  As a result, Malawi's economy shrank 
nearly 8 percent and real per capita GDP dropped by 11 percent in 1992. The government has yet 
to recover from the depression.

Britain in 1964. During the 1970s, Malta's socialist experiments left many businesses bankrupt. 
Instead of letting the businesses fail, the government nationalized them. This caused the budget to 
become bloated. Today, Malta has made progress toward free market reform. It has reduced some 
taxes, maintained a tight money supply, and welcomed most foreign investment.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	After years of suffering from socialist economic policies and limited economic freedom, 
Mexico is well underway in liberalizing its market. As with many countries reforming their 
economies, many of the benefits of the free market are just beginning to take effect in Mexico. 
Moreover, Mexico's efforts to integrate its economy with that of the U.S. and Canada with the 
passage of the North American Free Trade Area agreement will liberalize the Mexican economy 
even more. However, despite the NAFTA, Mexico still imposes limits on economic freedom, 
especially in respect to non-NAFTA members. In addition, Mexico's political system has not been 
reformed as rapidly as its economy, although some progress has been made.  Government 
corruption continues, particularly in the form of bribes and kick-backs for government projects, and 
there is a large black market.  Nevertheless, the overall prognosis for Mexico is good.  The reforms 
are taking root and the political system, despite some recent assassinations of major political figures, 
is holding firm.

<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of protectionism) </I><BR>
Mexico's average tariff rate is about 9.4 percent. Moreover, Mexico maintains import licenses 
for 198 different products, including beans, cars and trucks, corn, dairy products, firearms, 
and poultry. As a result of the NAFTA, Mexico's tariffs on U.S. goods will drop to 
insignificant levels, although barriers will remain for non-NAFTA members.

Mexico's top marginal tax rate is 35 percent. The tax that applies to the average income level is 
17 percent. Mexico has a top corporate tax rate of 35 percent. Corporate capital gains are 
also taxed at the corporate rate. Mexico has a value-added tax of 10 percent, a 34 percent 
capital gains tax, a state tax on salaries, and a resident tax. 
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic 
Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of government consumption) </I><BR>
Mexico's government consumption as a percentage of GDP figure is 9 percent. 
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of inflation) </I><BR>
While Mexico has made great strides in containing inflation, it has had a poor history of doing 
so. Mexico's average inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 was 66.5 percent. However, as a 
result of imposing a tighter monetary policy, the inflation rate was running at below 10 
percent in 1994.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Mexico has reformed its foreign investment code to attract more investors, allowing for more 
equal treatment for foreign and domestic firms. Moreover, the NAFTA will further open 
Mexico to foreign investors from the U.S. and Canada as it becomes an attractive place to 
establish businesses.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Mexico heavily restricts foreign participation in its banking industry. Foreigners are permitted to 
own only a minority number of shares in Mexico's financial services industry. Areas in 
which foreign participation is strictly regulated include banks, brokerages, and insurance 
companies. Foreigners are prohibited from engaging in foreign exchange and credit unions. 
Moreover, domestic banks are prohibited from investing in real estate and industrial firms. 
There is some corruption involved in the dispensing of loans to state-owned companies.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Mexico maintains a minimum wage with incremental cost of living increases. Prices are set by 
both the market and the government. Some goods affected by price controls are black and 
white television sets, beer, bleach, blenders, cigarettes, electric batteries, electric irons, gas 
stoves, light bulbs, note books, pencils, pens, razors, refrigerators, and toothpaste. 
However, the government plans to eliminate these and other price controls over time. 
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Private property is guaranteed by the Mexican constitution. As more state-owned property is 
privatized, private property will be increasingly protected by law. There is now little fear of 
expropriation under the current political system.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of regulation) </I><BR>
Opening a business remains a complicated task. Each business must obtain a license or some 
other form of certification from numerous government agencies, including the Public 
Registry of Commerce, the Bureau of Statistics, federal and local tax authorities, the 
Mexican Social Security Institute, and the National Housing Fund. In addition, some 
localities require each business to belong to a local chamber of commerce and trade 
association. Moreover, additional licenses may be required from the Ministry of Health and 
other agencies. Although Mexico is making attempts to end corruption, its current 
regulatory environment remains an obstacle to business creation.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Mexico has a thriving black market that extends beyond drugs, prostitution, and guns. In many 
Mexican cities, a black market in transportation services such as taxis and busing is 
rampant. Black market labor is often available to businesses wanting to skirt minimum 
wages laws. Some estimates peg black market labor in Mexico City at over 40 percent.

<P>	Located in Southern Africa, Mozambique is the poorest country in the world. Portuguese 
control led to the start of a conflict for independence in 1964. By 1974, Portugal was fighting 
independence movements in Angola and Guinea Bissau as well as Mozambique. In that year, 
Mozambique was granted independence. Two years later, Mozambique entered a bloody civil war 
that only recently was concluded. Having held multi-party elections, Mozambique is now attempting 
to build a democratic government. With such a history of bloodshed and civil unrest, there has been 
little opportunity to develop a free market. Mozambique remains one of the most economically 
repressive countries in the world.

the victor, Violeta Chamorro, promised economic reform. But little progress has been made. The 
Sandinistas, who hold key government posts in the military and police, have blocked reforms, 
especially the privatization of state-owned enterprises and other nationalized sectors of the 
economy.

<P>	The South Asian country of Pakistan gained independence following the partition of the 
Indian subcontinent and the end of British rule in 1947. Since then the country has remained poor 
and a huge recipient of foreign aid. Much of this aid has been squandered in economically useless 
projects, and Pakistan has been unwilling to adopt significant economic reforms. However, in 1994 
the government began to show signs of interest in free market reforms. For example, privatization 
of state-owned businesses is a new priority.

Peru has an extremely low government consumption level. This, however, is more the result of 
inefficient government information than of low levels of government spending. According 
to the World Bank, the government of Peru consumes only 5.1 percent of GDP. This 
figure severely understates government consumption in Peru. It is probably the result of 
poor record keeping. More informal estimates place Peru's government consumption at

the Philippines. The U.S. played a major role in the reconstruction of the Philippines after the end 
of World War II. However, between 1945 and 1953, the government's socialist economic policies 
prevented the country from establishing a free market economy. Successive administrations were

<P>	Once a communist member of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, Poland has made 
economic progress since the fall of the Iron Curtain. Poland's six-party coalition, led by Prime 
Minister Hanna Suchocka, collapsed in September 1993. It was replaced in 1994 by a two-party 
alliance of the former Communist Party and the Agrarian Party. While the new government says 
that it wants to continue economic reform, it faces increasing populist pressures from disillusioned

<P>	Although the Portuguese economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.3 percent from 1965 
to 1980, it collapsed in the 1980s because of socialist economic policies. The revised Portuguese 
Constitution of 1982 called for the public ownership of land, natural resources, and the principal 
means of production. Today, Portugal still is burdened by a cumbersome bureaucracy.

<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of protectionism) </I><BR>
As part of the European Union, Portugal has a average tariff rate of 3.6 percent. However, it 
maintains non-tariff barriers by using quantitative import restrictions on foreign 
automobiles, fabrics, fuses, parts of footwear, iron and steel tubes and pipes, and weaving 
machines.

Portugal has a top income tax rate of 40 percent. The rate that applies to the average income

has a 36 percent capital gains tax, a value-added tax ranging from 4 percent to 30 percent, a 
20 percent real estate tax, and a 50 percent inheritance tax.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic

<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of government consumption)</I><BR>
The Portuguese government consumes 21 percent of GDP. Although the government has

banking industry, but in the production of alcohol, cement, chemicals, food, glass, and 
electricity.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate levels of inflation) </I><BR>
Portugal had an average annual inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 of 17.4 percent. In 1992,

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Portugal has opened most of its industries to foreign investment. As a member of the European 
Union, Portugal treats all foreign companies equally with domestic companies. However, 
foreign investments are not permitted in postal carriers or in such public utilities as sewage 
treatment, transportation, and water services. While the European Union has reformed 
investment procedures, individual countries may have higher barriers to non-members. 
Such a case exists in Portugal with regard to local content requirements. 
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
The government is 100 percent owner of some of Portugal's large banks, including the Caixa 
Geral de Deposito, and the Banco Fomento Exterior SA. This allows the government to 
play a large role in controlling the lending practices of private banks. Since the government 
subsidizes the state-owned banks, they get an unfair competitive advantage against private 
banks.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The government eliminated almost all price controls in 1993. However, price controls remain 
on electricity, water, and pharmaceutical products. Portugal has a minimum wage. 
 <P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Portugal is privatizing much of its bloated state-owned sector. Citizens are increasing their 
purchases of shares in state-owned companies. This is providing an expanding base of 
private property.  Portugal has a relatively efficient legal system that adequately protects 
property in most cases. Expropriation is unlikely.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of regulation)</I><BR>
Despite some liberalization, Portugal still maintains some significant regulations. One specific 
example is the 1987 environmental protection law that is the most stringent in the European 
Union. As a result of this law, new businesses and proposed business expansion projects 
must undergo very cumbersome environmental impact reviews by various government 
bureaucracies. This law often proves to be too high a hurdle for some businesses to jump. 
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of black market activity)</I><BR>
Portugal's black market consists of selling such scarce goods as auto parts and pharmaceutical 
products. These scarcities are created by government-imposed price controls and trade 
quotas.

<P>	Romania's transition to democracy and free markets has been troubled and at times even 
violent. After the killing of former communist strongman Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, Romania was 
ruled by former communists who were only lukewarm about democracy and free markets.  
However, the current government of Ion Iliescu has established an economic reform plan that, if 
implemented, could bring significant economic growth. Chief among these reforms, tax reductions 
and mass privatization are aimed at increasing economic output. However, political events may 
jeopardize economic reform.

spending continues to outpace economic growth.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of inflation) </I><BR>
Communist control of the economy kept the official inflation rate artificially below what it 
should have been. Romania had an official average annual rate of inflation from 1980 to

period. Today, it is around 210.3 percent per year.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Romania maintains a fairly free market in foreign investment. Most barriers to foreign

<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Romania's banking environment has yet to mature. Banks are under strict control of the

inside Romania. 
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>

<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (Low level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Romania has yet to establish a system of property protection. The legal system remains unable 
to arbitrate property rights disputes. Chances of expropriation, however, remain unlikely 
due to the government's massive privatization plans and growing free enterprise. For 
example, since 1990, the government has registered over 24,849 commercial companies 
that have foreign participation. This indicates that the private sector is growing.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of regulation) </I><BR>
Regulations in Romania remain subject to haphazard application. This proves to be a significant

<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Most of Romania's economic activity is still performed in the black market. This is because a 
lagging economy has yet to provide many of the basic needs of consumers. Many food 
items, for example, can still be bought on the black market but are scarce at stores.

<P>	The largest of the former Soviet republics, Russia has struggled for several years to introduce 
democratic political institutions and a free market economy. Progress has been slow. The government has

Russia's tariff ranges from 5 percent to 30 percent. Tariffs on luxury items can be significantly higher: 
as much as 150 percent. Russia's average tariff rate is about 14 percent. However, duty rates 
change rapidly and arbitrarily. Moreover, Russia maintains many trade restrictions left over from 
the Soviet regime. For example, safety standards, licensing and testing, and other requirements pose 
a significant non-tariff barrier. Corruption is present in the customs services, and bribes are 
sometimes necessary to bring goods into the country.

Russia has a top income tax rate of 30 percent. The tax rate that applies to the average income level is 
12 percent. Russia has a top corporate income tax rate of 38 percent. This amount includes federal 
and regional taxes. Moreover, Russia has a 35 percent capital gains tax, a 20 percent value-added 
tax, a tax ranging from 85 percent to 100 percent on foreign profits, and a social payments tax. 
Because taxes are so high and arbitrary, tax evasion is widespread.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of government consumption) </I><BR>
Russia's government officially consumes 22.7 percent of GDP. However, state-owned enterprises still

misleading. Russia's government probably consumes 26 percent to 35 percent of GDP.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of inflation) </I><BR>
Russia had an annual inflation rate of over 1,300 percent in 1992. It was 800 percent in 1993. Inflation

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
A 1991 Russian law permits foreigners to acquire newly privatized firms in Russia. Few legal restrictions

However, the biggest barriers to foreign investment are the uncertainty of laws, crime, and political 
instability.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Many state-owned banks have been privatized. There is fierce competition in the commercial banking 
market. Foreign banks are now operating in Russia. However, Russia has yet to create a stable 
banking environment. A November 1993 presidential decree froze registered foreign bank activity 
and bars new foreign banks from entering Russia with less than 30 percent Russian ownership. This 
conflicts with a September 1993 decree sheltering foreign investors from adverse changes for three 
years. The entire banking system remains tightly controlled by the central bank. Moreover, most 
banks in Russia offer only a few services and are not as competitive as banks in the West. 
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Some 90 percent of all prices are set by free enterprise, while 5 percent are fixed by the state and 
another 5 percent are subject to government limits on the amount of profitability. However, because 
the government controls much of the economy through ownership of the public sector, it maintains 
a high level of indirect control over wages and prices. Russia maintains a minimum wage.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
While private property is guaranteed in Russia, protection remains significantly lacking. The Russian 
court system works poorly; no clear and concise method of settling disputes of property has been 
developed. Moreover, protection of private property receives varying levels of police attention in 
different localities. Finally, corruption and organized crime remain a significant threat to private 
property. Expropriation remains possible due to unstable economic and political conditions.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation) </I><BR>
Russia is experiencing a wave of dynamic entrepreneurial spirit. Many small businesses are growing 
around the larger cities. Small businesses are sprouting up by the hundreds in cities like Moscow. 
These businesses are easy to establish, and little regulation is imposed on them. However, the 
Russian government has yet to extend this "hands off" attitude to larger enterprises. Some 
regulations are arbitrary and unevenly enforced, posing a burden to business.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Russia's black market is massive. Despite recent moves to establish a free market, there are many black

<P>	Singapore won its independence from Malaysia on August 9, 1965. Since then, the country 
has undergone economic liberalization, eventually moving the country into the industrialized world.  
Singapore had average annual growth rates of about 6.5 percent from 1965 to 1990. Today, 
Singapore is one of the richest countries in Asia.  It has made remarkable progress by maintaining 
an open trade and investment environment; a corruption-free, pro-business regulatory system; 
political stability; an efficient, strike-free labor force; and tax incentives for foreign investors.

Singapore's average tariff rate is nearly nonexistent, from 0.3 to 0.5 percent. It maintains 
straightforward labeling requirements, no import quotas, and no non-tariff barriers to 
foreign trade. Import licenses are not required, and customs procedures are minimal. The 
code regulating product standards is not an impediment to trade.

Singapore's top rate is 30 percent. However, average income is not taxed. In fact, one needs to 
make twice the average income before the lowest taxable bracket, 21 percent, applies. 
There are no taxes on capital gains. Singapore has a flat corporate tax rate of 27 percent. It

<P>	South Africa's transition from apartheid to a non-racial democracy has gone well. A key to 
the country's future stability will be the revival of a long-depressed economy. South Africa enjoys 
many economic benefits, including a modern industrial sector, a well-developed infrastructure, and 
abundant natural resources. The government over the years has maintained a great deal of control 
over the economy, and this policy is continued by the new government. However, some badly 
needed economic liberalization has begun, including the privatization of some state assets, the 
state's withdrawal from the distribution of agricultural goods, and the trimming of public sector 
personnel.  This course of liberalization is nonetheless uncertain. The new government will be 
tempted to spend more on social programs to improve quickly the lives of previously 
disenfranchised black South Africans.

For many years South Africa has maintained high tariffs and other import restrictions. As a

clothing is 100 percent.  The tariff on motor vehicles is 115 percent. The agricultural sector

<I>Score: 2- (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
There is no government approval required for foreign investment. Foreign investors are subject 
to the same laws as domestic investors. There are no requirements for South African 
participation in management. However, the new government led by the African National 
Congress may not maintain a hospitable investment climate. Its egalitarianism could lead to 
increased economic control by the government, which would deter investors. 
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Quantitative and administrative controls over deposit and lending rates have largely disappeared. 
The banking and insurance industries nevertheless are strictly controlled. Legal restrictions 
which discriminate against foreign-owned financial institutions have been eliminated.  
However, the new government may pressure the banks into making politically motivated 
loans.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The government has abolished price controls on all but a few politically sensitive items, such as 
the supply of gas, coal, and electricity. It has also deregulated the agricultural sector. Only a 
few years ago, as many as 22 now-abolished marketing boards fixed prices for agricultural 
products. Moreover, to lower prices, the government has abolished import restrictions on 
fertilizer, farming equipment, and cement. No national minimum wage exists.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
No private-sector company, whether South African or foreign-controlled, has ever been 
nationalized. However, there is a danger that the redistributionist policies of the ANC 
government, including its land reform program, may weaken private property rights.     
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation) </I><BR>
Regulation of economic activity is minimal in South Africa. It takes only takes 4 to 10 days to 
incorporate a business, and most businesses can be started with a minimum of formalities. 
While licenses are required for certain activities, they can be obtained with relative ease. 
However, there will be increasing political pressure to practice more affirmative action in 
the hiring and firing of personnel.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>  
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Legal restrictions which prevented black South Africans from owning businesses, obtaining 
skilled jobs, or living in major urban centers were lifted in 1991. This will reduce black 
market activity. Nevertheless, South Africa's continued high level of trade restrictions 
encourages smuggling.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Sweden's economy has changed dramatically over the last several years. Once considered a 
workable socialist economy, Sweden experienced a severe economic recession in the 1980s that 
exploded the myth that a cradle-to-grave welfare state could be maintained without destroying the 
economy. By the end of the 1980s, it became increasingly clear that Sweden's economic policies, 
which included tax rates as high as 98 percent, were leading the country down the road to economic 
ruin. Because of  Sweden's generous social welfare spending, worker retraining programs, high 
unemployment compensation, and high tax rates, Sweden's GDP shrank by 6 percent from 1991 to 
1993 and unemployment rose to around 10 percent. In the end, Sweden was forced to abandon 
most of its socialist policies and follow a more market-oriented economy. Proving to be far from a 
"worker's paradise," Sweden now stands as a shining example of how socialism, no matter how 
watered down, does not work and how real economic reform produces sustainable economic 
growth.
<P><IMG SRC="xxx.gif">

<P><B>Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of protectionism) </I><BR>
Sweden's average tariff rate is about 3 percent on manufactured goods and 5 percent on 
finished goods. Thus, the average rate is around 4 percent.
<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>  However, Sweden maintains significant import licensing 
procedures for such items as agricultural goods, ferroalloys, fiberboard, and semi-finished 
iron and steel.

Final Taxation Score: 4.5-Stable (High tax rates) </I><BR>
The Swedish tax burden is one of the heaviest in Europe.<FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>   
The tax burden consumes about 50 percent of GDP. Sweden has a top income tax rate of 
50 percent.<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>   The tax rate that applies to the average 
income level is 30 percent. Sweden's top corporate tax rate is 28 percent. It also has a 21 
percent to 25 percent value-added tax.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of government consumption) </I><BR>
Sweden's government expenditures account for around 75 percent of GDP.
<FONT SIZE="-2">[4]</FONT>  Sweden, understanding its economic malaise, is attempting 
to reduce government spending. 
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of inflation) </I><BR>
Sweden's average inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 was 7.4 percent. This rate is dropping 
because Sweden has pegged its currency to the European currency unit (ECU) and has 
followed a tighter monetary policy. Inflation rates since 1991 have averaged around 3 
percent to 4 percent per year.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Sweden has few barriers to foreign investment. However, some restrictions continue on foreign 
ownership of air transportation companies, the maritime industry, and items considered 
necessary during time of war, such as arms manufacturing.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
All commercial banks in Sweden but one are domestically owned and operated.  Two more are 
directly owned by the government. While foreign banks have been permitted to establish 
subsidiaries and branches in Sweden since 1980, the application process still remains a 
barrier for most foreign bankers. However, the government is trying to liberalize the 
banking system, making it easier to open new banks.<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>  
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Most wages and prices are set by the market. There is no national minimum wage law. 
However, the government influences wage rates by establishing a minimum wage for 
employees of state-owned industries. Prices are also affected by government-owned 
businesses, which are subsidized.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
While Sweden has a rather extensive history of nationalization and expropriation of private 
property, it has recently undertaken a massive privatization program that is returning private 
property to the private sector. However, private property still receives less protection in 
Sweden than it does in other parts of Western Europe or in North America.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of regulation) </I><BR>
Obtaining a business license in Sweden is relatively easy.  Businesses must register with the 
Patent and Registration Office and the appropriate tax offices. Moreover, Sweden 
maintains a comprehensive safety, environmental and consumer regulatory structure that 
poses a burden to businesses.  For example, the Environmental Protection Act of 1969 
requires all businesses to obtain permission from the government before they release any 
pollutants into the environment. In cases where the expansion of a business may result in 
more pollution, a company must undergo a lengthy and sometimes extremely burdensome 
investigation.  There are many other regulations on businesses, such as a government-
imposed five-week vacation.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Low level of black market activity) </I><BR>
While Sweden once had a rather large black market in the construction industry, economic 
reforms are making it easier for most goods and services to be exchanged legally.

Taiwan places limits on foreign participation in the banking industry. Moreover, the

<P>	Thailand could be the next Asian tiger. From 1987 to 1991 its gross domestic product grew 
at around 10 percent annually. The current government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai is 
committed to continued economic liberalization. Political opponents of the regime are trying to limit 
the expansion of increased foreign investment and may ultimately endanger continued economic 
reforms. Thailand's rapid growth has not been without difficulty. For example, Thailand's roads, 
bridges, and rail systems, have failed to keep up with industrial expansion. And, economic 
expansion has not reached everyone. Most cities have pockets of poverty.

artificially high rates. The tariff on an imported product is assessed not according to its 
current price, but according to the price the last time the product entered the country. If the 
invoice price is lower, the Thai government can impose a tariff rate assessed at the previous 
higher price.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Turkey became an independent state in 1923 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. 
After decades of one-party rule, a multi-party system was adopted in 1950.  After a military coup in 
1960, the army drafted a new constitution in 1961, starting a trend of continued rule by a series of 
ever-weaker governments. As a result, a growing radical socialist and labor movement emerged. 
Beginning in the 1970s, Turkey became a recipient of large amounts of U.S. foreign aid. This aid 
did little to promote economic growth. In fact, it was often used to postpone badly needed 
economic reforms. Recently, however, Turkey has begun to make reforms. It has lowered taxes, 
increased opportunities for foreign investment, and increased its reliance on market forces.  Despite 
such progress, the nation is still plagued by skyrocketing inflation and huge unemployment rates.

extensive market liberalization policy that has made Britain one of the strongest economies in the 
European Union. Thatcher's reforms provide an example not only of how increased economic 
freedom produces sustained economic growth, but of how a country that was once sliding back

has one of the freest economies in the world, but not the most free. Recently, the U.S. has 
increased government regulations, taxes, and government spending. As a trend, the U.S. has been 
reducing the levels of economic freedom since the 1940s. As a result, economic growth and living 
standards have leveled off as some economic activity is being hindered by increased government 
intrusion. Still, America's vast resources and high levels of accumulated wealth have kept it from 
sliding more into economic stagnation.

steel, sugar, textiles, and other items.<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   Moreover, the 
U.S. is an aggressive user of unilateral trade retaliation. For example, it uses antidumping 
laws, which allow the U.S. to impose tariffs and duties on products imported at too low a 
price. It also relies on countervailing duties, which allow the government  to impose duties 
on imports that are subsidized in their home markets. However, the U.S. has successfully 
negotiated passage of the North American Free Trade Area, which reduces trade barriers 
among Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and has completed a global free trade pact 
called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Thus, U.S. trade policy is really 
heading in two different directions at the same time. Given the propensity of the Clinton 
Administration to threaten U.S. trading partners with trade retaliation, it remains a

Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 with Executive Order 11615, 
which placed a 90-day freeze on all prices, rents, wages, and salaries. The U.S. 
government continues to set prices on some goods and services, such as agricultural goods,

Moreover, the U.S. has many, albeit well intentioned, onerous regulations like the

defeat of South Vietnam in the Vietnam War in 1975, the communists, who now controlled the 
entire country, established a communist system for the entire country. While the government is 
liberalizing its economy in some areas, the economy remains generally repressed.

<P>	Yemen is one of the oldest regions of human habitation. After centuries of domination by 
various empires, including the Romans and the Ottomans, the southern part of Yemen became a 
protectorate of the British in 1839. Turkey controlled the northern part of Yemen. Turkey lost 
control of northern Yemen after World War I, and in 1934 it became independent. A civil war 
erupted in northern Yemen in 1962. Civil unrest spilled over into southern Yemen, forcing the 
British to withdraw in 1967. A Marxist government took over southern Yemen soon after, sending 
the economy into a nose dive. After two decades of political and civil chaos, North and South 
Yemen united into a single country in 1990.  Some progress toward economic liberalization had 
begun, but it was cut short by the outbreak of a civil war in 1994.

are assessed a 67 percent duty. Customs duties for tobacco imports are assessed at a rate 
of 145 percent. In addition, Yemen has non-tariff barriers in several areas. For example,

<P>	Zambia gained its independence from Britain in 1964. It remained a one-party socialist state 
until 1989, when political party opposition was legalized. In 1991 Frederick Chiluba won an 
overwhelming election victory over long-time President Kenneth Kaunda. Chiluba ran on a platform 
of democracy and free enterprise. After years of disastrous economic policies, President Chiluba is 
trying to lead Zambia to economic recovery. He has liberalized the economy, pruned the civil 
service, and privatized a few state enterprises. However, he still has a long way to go.

President Chiluba has reduced tariffs. By African standards, Zambia's average tariff rate is 
relatively low: 11.9 percent. Import restrictions have been eased. However, resentment

Moreover, corruption in the Customs Bureau is on the rise.

Kaunda's socialist regime left a legacy of nationalized property. Businesses were expropriated 
as recently as 1989. However, legislation enacted in 1993 provides for full compensation 
for newly nationalized property in convertible currency. While the government has sold 
some state enterprises, privatization is proceeding slowly. Though the courts in Zambia are 
reasonably independent, property rights protection remains weak.

<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Zambia's history of price controls and inefficient government monopolies has bred a huge black

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Here's a chilling phrase.  &quot;Lives unworthy of being lived&quot;
-- that's the translation of a German phrase that goes all the
way back to 1920.  That's when influential German doctors advocated
a euthanasia program.  The mentally retarded, people who were
insane, and terribly wounded World War I veterans were the first
victims.  Later this same philosophy was used by Adolph Hitler
and served as the philosophical foundation for the Holocaust.

<p>

Today, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in two
euthanasia cases. It is just weeks before we observe the twenty-fourth
anniversary of the Court's infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision.
That unjust decision gave us partial-birth abortions and the
death of 30 million unborn children.  And it has seriously undermined
the respect that we should give to the courts.

<p>

America is not Germany.  But we must take care not to remove
those safeguards that have historically protected vulnerable lives.
Remember, the oldest rule in medicine: &quot;Do no harm.&quot;
If we forget it, the so-called right to die will become a right
to be killed.

<p>

For Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with today's
Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.

<center><h2>RIGHT TO KILL NOT OBVIOUS IN CONSTITUTION,</h2>
<h4>CLEAVER NOTES HIGH COURT CONCERNED WITH WHO DECIDES<br>
WHO DIES -- AND WHY</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In today's euthanasia case before the
U.S. Supreme Court, the justices made the most pro-states' rights
arguments heard in years, noted Family Research Council Director
of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver on Wednesday. Cleaver attended
the arguments as attorney of record for FRC which filed a brief
in the case.

<p>

&quot;The justices seemed reluctant to seize the power of life
and death. The nature of the justices' questions seemed to indicate
that they were concerned about imposing a blanket ruling on the
complex issue of arming physicians with a right to kill,&quot;
Cleaver said. &quot;The court also relied heavily on the centuries-old
tradition that doctors should be healers and not killers. We agree.&quot;

<p>

For example: Justice David Souter asked the attorney general from
Washington state about how the court could weigh the risks of
empowering physicians with a right to kill and how it could be
controlled. The attorney general replied that we can look at the
Netherlands and Germany and see that death could not be contained
... it's been &quot;tried and failed.&quot;

<p>

(Editor's note: Family Research Council's amicus brief dealt with
the historical record of the culture of euthanasia -- so called
&quot;good death&quot; -- in Germany which was expanded from the
killing of the handicapped, elderly and mentally ill to the killing
of others deemed undesirable.)

<p>

Justice Souter commented that the court might want to wait until
it could understand the ramifications of such a decision. Justice
Stephen Breyer, talking about what he learned in the many amicus
briefs, noted that good pain control was available and that almost
all of the 25 percent of people who die in pain, do so needlessly.
The justice asked whether it was right to assume that if we create
a right to assisted suicide, will that not be a disincentive to
improve pain care? Justice Breyer got into the cost of medical
care, mentioning that it would certainly be cheaper to give a
lethal dose than to give aggressive treatment.

<p>

Cleaver noted, &quot;The justices as a whole were very concerned
about whether giving physicians the power to kill was something
for the courts to decide at all or something for states to decide
democratically after discussion and study.&quot;

<p>

Along those lines, Justice Antonin Scalia noted that those favoring
physician-assisted death claim that it would be confined to the
terminally ill, in insufferable pain, who competently request
death. He asked, if you want to legalize a physician's ability
to kill, why would the U.S. Constitution narrowly define those
with a right to die? He asked, if pain gives a person the right
to die, why should the line be drawn with the terminally ill?
Why should those who will be in pain for a 10-year illness be
denied? By what reasoning do you prevent the death right from
expanding?

<p>

&quot;The High Court is clearly weighing the tough questions surrounding
granting physicians the power to kill. There is no greater issue
facing a people than who has the power to take life. It is of
paramount importance that all Americans can trust that the medical
profession is devoted to saving life -- not destroying it,&quot;
Cleaver said.

	"We must, however, continue to express our concerns about mandated Medicaid expansions. States do not have the luxury of operating a budget deficit. Every mandated dollar that we spend is a real dollar that has to be taken from another program."  Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, June 7, 1990

While attention recently has focused on the problems of the Medicare system, Congress shortly will try to tackle another health care financial time bomb in the form of Medicaid, the health care program serving the nation's poor. If significant reforms are not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to Medicaid. And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the rate for total state spending, states will be forced either to increase taxes or to divert money from other programs.
<p>
Medicaid is a state-administered program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
	The cost of Medicaid to the federal government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid costs will almost double by 2002.
<p>
	Although the financial impact on the federal government under current law is alarming, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid. States can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal rules requiring that certain levels of coverage be provided to certain populations.
<p>
	To examine the probable future budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend using certain assumptions to forecast the state share of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002. First, the Heritage analysis assumes no change in the current Medicaid program. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level Medicaid burden if Congress does nothing to reform this program. Second, where possible, a state's Medicaid spending trend is adjusted by expected changes in state economic activity, by forecasted changes in the eligible population, and by the trend in federal Medicaid transfers to the state.
<p>
	The forecasts for future state Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between historical Medicaid spending changes and fluctuations in the state's economic activity and Medicaid-eligible population. In four cases, however, the relationship was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in spending; these are identified with an asterisk on <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Table 1</a>. This table shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the states are to meet their projected Medicaid expeditures.
<P>

Highlights
<p>
	Between 1995 and 2002, if no reforms are enacted, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money on Medicaid. Total state Medicaid spending over this period is projected to be $1,730 billion, of which $1,042 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 19 percent of its revenues to the health care program.
<p>
	As <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the twelve-year period between 1990 and 2002.
<p>
	Some individual states will be particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $21.5 billion in new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $20 billion; Florida, $15.2 billion; Pennsylvania, $13.7 billion; and Texas $8.6 billion. If these states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $294 per year; New York, by $427; Florida, by $441; Pennsylvania, by $427; and Texas by $211.
<p>
	This rapid growth in the state's Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation infrastructure (see <a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state Medicaid spending that is growing at a rate of 11 percent, while total state spending should grow at an 8 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8 percent rate.
<P>
	Again, some states will be hit particularly hard. <a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a> shows those states that are forecasted to have increases in Medicaid spending from their own revenues that are greater than 50 percent.
<p>

Technical Assumptions
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the additional funds states would need to raise to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<P>
	We assumed no change in the current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. We used this as the basic structure of future Medicaid spending.
<P>
	These baseline forecasts of state Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher federal Medicaid program spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $98 billion over the period 1996 to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.
